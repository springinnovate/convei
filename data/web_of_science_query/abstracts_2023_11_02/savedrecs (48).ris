TI  - Insights of remote sensing data to surmount rainfall/runoff data limitations of the downstream catchment of Pineios River, Greece
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Efficient rainfall/runoff data modeling necessitates field data availability. Remote and rough terrain areas restrict data collection that leads to less reliable simulated models. Consequently, complete geographic databases are the quest to conduct over the catchment under investigation. The hydrologic model developed for this research based on different return periods (2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, and 200 years) gave significant discharge outputs. It was found that a basin average precipitation having a return period of 5 years yields a peak discharge of 1032.7 m(3)/s with the time of peak occurring 23.25 h after the event has started. It results in a volume of 79.9x10(6) m(3). A storm event having a return period of 200 years, with basin average rainfall approximately two times more intense than the above yields an enormous discharge of 2191.1 m(3)/s and an accumulative volume of water of 158.8x10(6) m(3). Accordingly, the catchment cannot accommodate such significant volumes of water and flooding becomes unavoidable. Therefore, hydrological, and hydraulic models can support decision-makers in correspondence to the catchment management problems for the sustainable and economic development of the wider area, by providing systematic and consistent information.

TI  - A High Spatial Resolution Satellite Remote Sensing Time Series Analysis of Cape Bounty, Melville Island, Nunavut (2004-2018)
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in vegetation have been observed in areas of the Arctic due to changing climate. This study examines a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series (2004-2018) of high spatial resolution satellite data (i.e., IKONOS, WorldView-2, WorldView-3) to determine if vegetation abundance has changed over the Cape Bounty Arctic Watershed Observatory, Melville Island, Nunavut. Image data were corrected to top-of-atmosphere reflectance and normalized for time series analysis using the pseudo-invariant feature (PIF) method. Percent vegetation cover measurements and indices derived from local climate data (growing degree days base 5 degrees C; GDD(5)) were used to contextualize NDVI trends in different vegetation types and within active layer detachments (ALDs). NDVI showed similar patterns within the different vegetation types and across the ALDs. There was no significant change in NDVI nor in GDD(5) over time. However, there were statistically significant (p < 0.05) relationships between the GDD(5) and NDVI for all vegetation types. Using field measurements with high spatial resolution remote sensing data helps link changes in NDVI with changes to vegetation and earth surface processes. The challenges of integrating high spatial resolution satellite data from different sensors in a time series analysis are also discussed.

TI  - Regional estimation of garlic yield using crop, satellite and climate data in Mexico
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Garlic (Allivium sativum L.) has been consumed by humans since the beginning of recorded history. Despite its culinary and economical importance, little efforts are reported in the literature to forecast garlic yield. In this study, we developed the first attempt to predict garlic yield at large scale using crop, satellite (TERRA-MODIS) and climate data (ERA-5). The study area was located in Mexico (2004 - 2018). We compared the predictive capacity of three Machine Learning (ML) methods: generelised linear model (glm), support vector machine radial (svmR) and random forest (rf); as well as different combinations of predictors. The best performance was obtained by the svmR model (R-2 = 0.68 and %RMSE = 20.08%) which combined YieldBaseLine, NDVI and climate data under Feature Selection scenario (FS) = 0.90. The rf method performed similarly well (R-2 = 0.66), while glm achieved lower performance (R-2 = 0.61). To test the predictive capacity of the models in practice, we additionally used a leave-one-year-out method in a time-wise manner. Models gradually improved over the years as more data was incorporated for training. The svmR and rf methods presented an overall performance of R-2 similar to 0.60 (%RMSE similar to 20.5%), reaching the highest accuracy (R-2 = 0.78, %RMSE similar to 16.6%) in 2014. Both approaches reveal the potentiality of the proposed models to account for the inter-annual and spatial garlic yield variability in Mexico. This procedure can be adjusted and used for other crop types or locations.

TI  - The New Zealand government's response to the Wai 262 report: the first ten years
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Wai 262 claim, six Maori claimant groups sought the Waitangi Tribunal's findings that the Crown had breached its Treaty of Waitangi guarantee to allow Maori to exercise tino rangatiratanga (the unqualified exercise of our chieftainship) over our matauranga Maori (the body of knowledge originating from Maori ancestors, including the Maori worldview and cultural practices) and taonga (tangible and intangible treasures). The Tribunal publicly released its full report on the claim in 2011. Whilst the National Government (2008-2017) engaged internally with the report, it did not respond publicly. It is only since the Labour-led Government (2017-2020) came into power and proposed Te Pae Tawhiti, a work programme to address the Crown's breaches, that the government has engaged with the report publicly. In this article, I argue that, whilst Maori should engage in Te Pae Tawhiti, we must do so cautiously and with a full appreciation of the government's policies on these issues over the past decade. The article provides unprecedented insights into the government's response to the Wai 262 report. The insights will be important in helping Maori and others to hold the government accountable as the Treaty partners work together to address these issues in the Te Pae Tawhiti era.

TI  - Design for now, but with the future in mind: a "cognitive flexibility theory" perspective on online learning through the lens of MOOCs
T2  - ETR&D-EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper is in response to the manuscript entitled "MOOCocracy: the learning culture of massive open online courses" (Loizzo and Ertmer in Educ Tech Res Dev 64:1013-1032, 2016, ) from the perspectives of cognitive flexibility theory (CFT), in the context of pandemic-induced emergency remote teaching. Our response focuses on one of the questions raised in the call for this special issue on the latter topic: what are the implications of current, urgent work being done in digital learning for the future of online learning? We argue that much of what is important for a better future of online learning can also be done well now. However, building now with the future in mind involves a fundamental reorientation of the epistemic standpoint of online learning. The need for such a reframing is a tenet of CFT. Therefore, we use CFT as a lens to reflect on the proposal by Loizzo and Ertmer (Educ Tech Res Dev 64:1013-1032, 2016, ) to combine c-MOOC and xMOOC designs to "foster a flexible, learner-centered culture" (p. 1027). Acknowledging the value of diverse perspectives afforded by the MOOCocracy culture, we also discuss how a CFT-based epistemic stance may further inform the future design and practice of MOOCs and, in a similar manner, online learning in general. We present some examples of ways application of learning and instruction principles of CFT can benefit online learning for the development of adaptive worldviews and the resultant development of adaptive skill that is becoming increasingly essential for life and work. Having this framework in mind as a principled overlay while urgently preparing for current schooling can help us build better, for now, and even more so for the needs that will remain in the longer term as education increasingly incorporates "twenty-first century skills."

TI  - Remote sensing approach to simulate the land use/land cover and seasonal land surface temperature change using machine learning algorithms in a fastest-growing megacity of Bangladesh
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization across many regions in the world is altering the existing land use/land cover (LULC), which is significantly raising the land surface temperature (LST). The present study aims to estimate future LULC and seasonal (summer and winter) LST scenarios in one of the fastest-growing megacities and the business capital of Bangladesh, named as Chattogram. Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm and Landsat thermal bands were used to retrieve LULC and LST changing patterns for 1999, 2009 and 2019, respectively. The Cellular Automata (CA) and the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) machine learning algorithms were applied to simulate the LULC and seasonal LST scenarios for 2029 and 2039. The CA and ANN model were validated using simulated and estimated LULC and LST data for 2019. The CA model demonstrated an excellent accuracy with an overall kappa value of 0.82. Mean Square Error (MSE) and Correlation coefficient (R) values were used for ANN model validation, which also produced excellent results with 0.523 and 0.796 in summer and 0.6023 and 0.831 in winter season, respectively. Simulated LULC revealed a substantial increase in the urban built-up areas by 9.23% (2029) and 13.59% (2039), compared with the year 2019. Simulated summer LST demonstrates that 31.30% and 35.02% area will likely to face surface temperature more than 36 degrees C, followed by 1.28% and 29.53% area in winter season for year 2029 and 2039, respectively. The seasonal LST scenarios in different LULC demonstrated comparatively higher temperatures in built-up areas. Based on the results, a strong correlation was found between the changes in urban areas and raising LST by representing major encounters for environmental engineers and urban planners to mitigate the consequences of the surface urban heat island (SUHI) phenomenon. For ensuring sustainable urban growth and minimizing the SUHI effect in this fastest-growing megacity, future city master plan must focus on the importance of urban plantation and conservation of natural resources.

T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, digital elevation models (DEMs) derived from AlosPalsar data (Japanese Space Agency-JAXA), Sentinel-1A data, and Envisat ASAR data (European Space Agency-ESA) were compared by using a global navigation satellite system (GNSS). In addition, AW3D30, SRTM, and ASTER GDEM (open-access DEMs) data were also included in the accuracy evaluation. The DEM accuracies were investigated in three different terrain types, namely a plain area, mountainous area and agricultural area, and compared at elevation values on a pixel-based. The accuracy obtained from the ALOS PALSAR satellite data was found to be more reliable for all three terrain types. The standard deviation and root mean square values were calculated and compared to each other. The results of the accuracy assessments showed that the best result for the plain area was obtained with the Sentinel-1A and SRTM data, for the mountainous area was obtained with the SRTM data and for agricultural area was obtained with the ALOS PALSAR and SRTM data.

T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To combat desertification, an understanding of its current development is necessary, including that of causative factors associated with climate change and increasing human activity. Whereas, there is an ongoing debate surrounding impact factors for change in vegetation and desertification in arid regions. The present study assesses the spatiotemporal characteristics of vegetation change in the Ulan Buh Desert, northwest China. Driving factors for desertification were discussed using the Global Inventory Monitoring and Modeling System Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GIMMS NDVI) and SPOT Vegetation NDVI datasets, high-resolution satellite images, and meteorological and socioeconomic data in the period 1982-2018. The results show a trend of overall greening, with increasing trends at rates between 0.0008/year and 0.0013/year indicated by the two NDVI datasets and with a corresponding reduction in dune activity. The spatial variations of two NDVI datasets verified the significantly greening trend in the northern and southern areas of the desert. Human activity was observed to have impacted vegetation dynamics. It is predicted that the implementation of ecological projects will contribute to the restoration of vegetation during a warmer, wetter climate trend. However, the reduction of wind strength played a dominant role in vegetation greenness and dune stability in the Ulan Buh Desert. The present study revealed the spatiotemporal characteristics of vegetation variations and the driving factors for desertification in arid regions.

TI  - Groundwater erosion of coastal gullies along the Canterbury coast (New Zealand): a rapid and episodic process controlled by rainfall intensity and substrate variability
T2  - EARTH SURFACE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Gully formation has been associated to groundwater seepage in unconsolidated sand- to gravel-sized sediments. Our understanding of gully evolution by groundwater seepage mostly relies on experiments and numerical simulations, and these rarely take into consideration contrasts in lithology and permeability. In addition, process-based observations and detailed instrumental analyses are rare. As a result, we have a poor understanding of the temporal scale of gully formation by groundwater seepage and the influence of geological heterogeneity on their formation. This is particularly the case for coastal gullies, where the role of groundwater in their formation and evolution has rarely been assessed. We address these knowledge gaps along the Canterbury coast of the South Island (New Zealand) by integrating field observations, luminescence dating, multi-temporal unoccupied aerial vehicle and satellite data, time domain electromagnetic data and slope stability modelling. We show that gully formation is a key process shaping the sandy gravel cliffs of the Canterbury coastline. It is an episodic process associated to groundwater flow that occurs once every 227 d on average, when rainfall intensities exceed 40 mm d(-1). The majority of the gullies in a study area southeast (SE) of Ashburton have undergone erosion, predominantly by elongation, during the last 11 years, with the most recent episode occurring 3 years ago. Gullies longer than 200m are relict features formed by higher groundwater flow and surface erosion > 2 ka ago. Gullies can form at rates of up to 30 m d(-1) via two processes, namely the formation of alcoves and tunnels by groundwater seepage, followed by retrogressive slope failure due to undermining and a decrease in shear strength driven by excess pore pressure development. The location of gullies is determined by the occurrence of hydraulically conductive zones, such as relict braided river channels and possibly tunnels, and of sand lenses exposed across sandy gravel cliffs. We also show that the gully planform shape is generally geometrically similar at consecutive stages of evolution. These outcomes will facilitate the reconstruction and prediction of a prevalent erosive process and overlooked geohazard along the Canterbury coastline.

TI  - Introducing an intelligent algorithm for extraction of sand dunes from Landsat satellite imagery in terrestrial and coastal environments
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, an intelligent algorithm for the extraction of sand dune maps from Landsat satellite images in terrestrial and coastal environments was presented by a case study of the sand dunes in northeastern Iran and one example on the coast of the Oman Sea in southeastern Iran. First, to find the best sand dune detection algorithm, the land cover map is created by aerial photography and field observation in ILWIS software. Next, a binary image is created in which the sand dunes are considered as white pixels and other parts as black pixels. In the next step, the pixels of each land cover map class are divided into 50 equal parts, one part of them is used to train different smart grids and the rest of them are used for evaluation. Then the classification is done using all 50 parts in turn, and the Correct Classification Rate (CCR) index is calculated. This action is performed for the K-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, AdaBoost, RUSBoost, and SVM algorithms. Furthermore, to see the effect of the PCA and LDA statistical methods, the classifier algorithms are implemented by applying these techniques. Finally, the proposed method was tested in a coastal area as an example. The findings show that the CCR of the proposed method is around 84% using 2% of the ground truth of the area for training and the other 98% of them for testing. In the case study, the detection results show that around 9.98% of the area is covered by sand dunes. To have a practical detection of the sand dunes area, the proposed machine learning method is applied to some experimentally verified points. Based on the results, ensemble classification methods, especially RUSBoost, have the best detection accuracy. Also, the result of its test on the coastal sand dunes showed its ability to identify, map, and monitor the sand dunes in coastal areas.

TI  - Northern preference for terrestrial electromagnetic energy input from space weather
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrestrial space weather involves the transfer of energy and momentum from the solar wind into geospace. Despite recently discovered seasonal asymmetries between auroral forms and the intensity of emissions between northern and southern hemispheres, seasonally averaged energy input into the ionosphere is still generally considered to be symmetric. Here we show, using Swarm satellite data, a preference for electromagnetic energy input at 450km altitude into the northern hemisphere, on both the dayside and the nightside, when averaged over season. We propose that this is explained by the offset of the magnetic dipole away from Earth's center. This introduces a larger separation between the magnetic pole and rotation axis in the south, creating different relative solar illumination of northern and southern auroral zones, resulting in changes to the strength of reflection of incident Alfven waves from the ionosphere. Our study reveals an important asymmetry in seasonally averaged electromagnetic energy input to the atmosphere. Based on observed lower Poynting flux on the nightside this asymmetry may also exist for auroral emissions. Similar offsets may drive asymmetric energy input, and potentially aurora, on other planets. Seasonally averaged energy input into the ionosphere from geospace is generally considered to be symmetric. Here, the authors show preference for electromagnetic energy input at 450km altitude into the northern hemisphere, on both the dayside and the nightside, when averaged over season.

TI  - Is the retropharyngeal lymph node the first echelon node for carcinoma tonsil? Prospective evaluation and literature review
T2  - EUROPEAN ARCHIVES OF OTO-RHINO-LARYNGOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose Tonsil cancer being predominantly treated by non-surgical means, there is a paucity of data on lymph nodal drainage pathways and histo-pathologically confirmed metastatic rates. This study assesses the retropharyngeal lymph node (RPLN) in N0 squamous cell carcinoma tonsil as a possible first echelon node and a site for occult metastasis. Methods Prospective study involving treatment naive N0 carcinoma tonsil treated by primary surgery and adjuvant treatment from June 2017 to March 2019. In-vivo lymph nodal drainage patterns were assessed by sentinel node mapping by preoperative SPECT-CT and intra-operative hand-held Gamma probe. All patients had a subsequent Level I-III/IV sampling neck dissection supplemented with RPLN dissection. Histological evaluation of sentinel nodes and RPLN involved step-serial sectioning and pan-cytokeratin immunohistochemistry. A comprehensive literature review was performed with keywords "retropharyngeal lymph node", "oropharynx", "tonsil", "squamous cell carcinoma" to determine the incidence of RPLN positivity in previously published series. Results Sentinel node was successfully identified by SPECT-CT in all 17 patients (ipsilateral level 2a-13/17, 2b-1/17, 3-1/17; bilateral 2a-1/17; isolated contralateral retropharyngeal node-1/17). 8/17 had occult neck metastasis. In no patient was an ipsilateral RPLN identified as the sentinel node. Histological sampling did not indicate metastatic tumor in the RPLN in any patient (0/17). A systematic literature review further confirmed that RPLN metastasis in oropharyngeal cancer is noted only in the presence of pN + disease at other neck levels, and isolated RPLN metastasis is extremely rare (1.2%). Conclusion The ipsilateral RPLN is not identified either as the first echelon node or as a site of occult metastatic disease in N0 tonsil cancer. CTRI registration CTRI/2019/06/019551.

TI  - Step-by-step surgical procedures for a correct identification of the sentinel lymph node in endometrial cancer.
T2  - Facts, views & vision in ObGyn
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: In patients with endometrial cancer, the common method for assessing the status of lymph nodes (LN) is lymphadenectomy. The sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is a revolutionary concept and it will play an increasingly important role in surgical practice. The surgical technique of the sentinel lymph node is less destructive than lymphadenectomy, and it requires less anatomical knowledge.METHODS: Step by step technique of cervical injection, the preparation of the anatomical spaces and the identification of the main structures to detect and remove the SLN safely in patients affected by endometrial cancer stage IA.RESULTS: We identify the three different lymphatic pathways drainage from the uterine cervix and show how anatomical retroperitoneal knowledge is essential for the safe dissection of anatomical spaces. In literature it is reported that in about 9% of cases the SLN is located at the lumbo-aortic level, so it is clear how important it is to know the anatomy to follow the highlighted lymph pathway to identify first lymph node absorber of the drainage.CONCLUSION: Anatomical knowledge and the correct preparation of the anatomical spaces make the identification of the sentinel lymph node safe and feasible.

TI  - Landsat time series reveal simultaneous expansion and intensification of irrigated dry season cropping in Southeastern Turkey
T2  - JOURNAL OF LAND USE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term monitoring of the extent and intensity of irrigation systems is needed to track crop water consumption and to adapt land use to a changing climate. We mapped the expansion and changes in the intensity of irrigated dry season cropping in Turkey ' s Southeastern Anatolia Project annually from 1990 to 2018 using Landsat time series. Irrigated dry season cropping covered 5,779 km(2) (+/- 479 km(2)) in 2018, which represents an increase of 617% over the study period. Dry season cropping was practiced on average every second year, but spatial variability was pronounced. Increases in dry season cropping frequency were observed on 40% of the studied croplands. The presented maps enable the identification of land use intensity hotspots at 30 m spatial resolution, and can thus aid in assessments of water consumption and environmental degradation. All maps are openly available for further use at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4287661.

TI  - Prospective Registry Trial Assessing the Use of Magnetic Seeds to Locate Clipped Nodes After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for Breast Cancer Patients
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Targeted axillary dissection (TAD) involves locating and removing both clipped nodes and sentinel nodes for assessment of the axillary response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) by clinically node-positive breast cancer patients. Initial reports described radioactive seeds used for localization, which makes the technique difficult to implement in some settings. This trial was performed to determine whether magnetic seeds can be used to locate clipped axillary lymph nodes for removal. Methods This prospective registry trial enrolled patients who had biopsy-proven node-positive disease with a clip placed in the node and treatment with NAC. A magnetic seed was placed under ultrasound guidance in the clipped node after NAC. All the patients underwent TAD. Results Magnetic seeds were placed in 50 patients by 17 breast radiologists. All the patients had successful seed placement at the first attempt (mean time for localization was 6.1 min; range 1-30 min). The final position of the magnetic seed was within the node (n = 44, 88%), in the cortex (n = 3, 6%), less than 3 mm from the node (n = 2, 4%), or by the clip when the node could not be adequately visualized (n = 1, 2%). The magnetic seed was retrieved at surgery from all the patients. In 49 (98%) of the 50 cases, the clip and magnetic seed were retrieved from the same node. Surgeons rated the transcutaneous and intraoperative localization as easy for 43 (86%) of the 50 cases. No device-related adverse events occurred. Conclusions Localization and selective removal of clipped nodes can be accomplished safely and effectively using magnetic seeds.

TI  - Mapping cotton cultivated area combining remote sensing with a fused representation-based classification algorithm
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Cotton is one of the major cash crops in the world, which is the main fiber crop that delivers fibers to textile industries across the globe. The efficient and timely information of the cotton distribution is essential for cotton production, agricultural management, as well as the sustainability of agricultural systems. However, there still keep challenges in accurately extracting cotton cultivated area over large areas. To address this issue, we explored the feasibility of combining time series enhanced vegetation index (EVI) calculated from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data with the fused representation-based classification (FRC) algorithm to identify the cotton pixels and map cotton cultivated area in the major cotton production regions of China. The Fourier transform was used to obtain the harmonic features of the annual time series EVI at a pixel scale over the study area. Then the FRC algorithm was applied for the identification of cotton cultivated area with harmonic features as input. By calculating the fused residual for each pixel, and setting the threshold value for each province based on the statistical data, the cotton cultivated area was extracted in the study area during 2015-2017. Finally, the performance of the FRC algorithm for cotton mapping was evaluated and compared with those of the collaborative representation-based classification (CRC) and sparse representation-based classification (SRC) algorithms. The results showed that there was a good correlation between the MODIS-derived cotton cultivated area and statistical data at the municipal level, with the coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.83 for 3 years. The mapping results of the cotton cultivated area derived by the FRC algorithm had a higher precision compared with those derived by the CRC and SRC algorithms. It demonstrated that the combination of time series MODIS EVI data, statistical data and the FRC algorithm is effective in identifying the cotton cultivated area. Furthermore, the applicability of this approach to other crop mapping and higher spatial resolution images is worth investigating.

TI  - The hsp40 Gene Family in Japanese Flounder: Identification, Phylogenetic Relationships, Molecular Evolution Analysis, and Expression Patterns.
T2  - Frontiers in Marine Science
M3  - Article
AB  - Heat shock proteins (hsps) are cellular chaperones that are involved in developmental stages and stress responses. Hsp40 is the major subfamily of hsps, but has not been fully characterized in Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus), especially their roles in immune response. In this study, a comprehensive identification and analysis of hsp40 in flounder is presented, including gene structures, evolutionary relationships, conserved domains, molecular evolution analysis, and expression patterns. Sequence features and phylogenetic analysis revealed that hsp40 genes could be grouped into 40 distinct subfamilies and most of them (96%) in Japanese flounder possessed no less than two introns. Molecular evolution analysis indicated that the hsp40 genes were conservative during evolution and were functional-constrained. Meanwhile, hsp40 genes were found to express in different embryonic and larval stages and might play the role of sentinel in healthy organisms. Furthermore, hsp40 genes' expression profiles after Edwardsiella tarda injection were determined in Japanese flounder without precedent, and 88% (44/50) of hsp40 genes showed differential expression patterns after bacterial challenge. Our findings provide basic and useful resources for understanding the immune responsibilities of hsp40 genes in flatfish.

TI  - Integrating crop growth models with remote sensing for predicting biomass yield of sorghum
T2  - IN SILICO PLANTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant phenotypes are often descriptive, rather than predictive of crop performance. As a result, extensive testing is required in plant breeding programmes to develop varieties aimed at performance in the target environments. Crop models can improve this testing regime by providing a predictive framework to (i) augment field phenotyping data and derive hard-to-measure phenotypes and (ii) estimate performance across geographical regions using historical weather data. The goal of this study was to parameterize the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) crop growth models with remote-sensing and ground-reference data to predict variation in phenology and yield-related traits in 18 commercial grain and biomass sorghum hybrids. Genotype parameters for each hybrid were estimated using remote-sensing measurements combined with manual phenotyping in West Lafayette, IN, in 2018. The models were validated in hybrid performance trials in two additional seasons at that site and against yield trials conducted in Bushland, TX, between 2001 and 2018. These trials demonstrated that (i) maximum plant height, final dry biomass and radiation use efficiency (RUE) of photoperiod-sensitive and -insensitive forage sorghum hybrids tended to be higher than observed in grain sorghum, (ii) photoperiod-sensitive sorghum hybrids exhibited greater biomass production in longer growing environments and (iii) the parameterized and validated models perform well in above-ground biomass simulations across years and locations. Crop growth models that integrate remote-sensing data offer an efficient approach to parameterize larger plant breeding populations.

TI  - Preoperative ultrasound-based radiomics score can improve the accuracy of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center nomogram for predicting sentinel lymph node metastasis in breast cancer
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: To develop a combined nomogram by incorporating the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) nomogram and ultrasound (US)-based radiomics score (Radscore) for predicting sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis in invasive breast cancer.Materials and Methods: This retrospective study was approved by the ethics committee of our institution, and written informed consent was waived. A total of 452 patients with invasive breast cancer who received SLN Biopsy in a single center were included between January 2016 and December 2019. The patients were divided into a training set (n = 318) and a validation set (n = 134). A total of 1216 features were extracted from the regions of interest (ROIs) of the tumors on conventional ultrasound. The maximum relevance minimum redundancy (mRMR) and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm were used to build the Radscore. Afterward, the diagnostic performance was assessed and validated. Comparison of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and decision curve analysis (DCA) were performed to evaluate the incremental value of the combined model.Results: Obtained from 18 features, the Radscore indicated a favorable discriminatory capability in the training set with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.834, whereas a value of 0.770 was observed in the validation set. The AUC of the combined model was 0.901 (95 % confidence interval (95 % CI): 0.865 0.938) in the training set and 0.833 (95 % CI: 0.788-0.878) in the validation set. Both of them were superior to MSKCC or imaging Radscore alone (P < 0.05). DCA demonstrated that the combined model was superior to the others in terms of clinical practicability.Conclusion: Preoperative US-based Radscore can improve the accuracy of clinical MSKCC nomogram for SLN metastasis prediction in breast cancer.

TI  - Monitoring drought events and vegetation dynamics in relation to climate change over mainland China from 1983 to 2016
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the present drought events and dynamics of vegetation, the circumstances in mainland China could become even more serious. Therefore, we study the impact of drought on vegetation trends in mainland China, with the aim of discovering the temporal and spatial differences in vegetation dynamics caused by seasonal drought. Our method is based on the use of data from the AVHRR Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from 1983 to 2016 and temperature and precipitation data from Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (NASA's MERRA). Due to the sparse vegetation and low drought, NDVI is the most useful for describing drought conditions in mainland China. The NDVI, TCI, VHI, NVSWI, VCI, TVDI, and NAP from April to October increased rapidly, while the NDVI, TCI, VHI, NVSWI, NAP, TVDI, and VCI are stable every month in September, improve again in October, and then show in December a downward trend. The NDVI, TCI, VHI, NVSWI, NAP, TVDI, and VCI monthly values indicate that mainland China suffered from severe drought in 1984 and 1993, which lasted until 2007, which were the most drought years. For monitoring drought in mainland China, the NDVI, TVDI, NAP, VCI, and NVSWI values were selected as a tool for reporting drought events during different growing seasons. The seasonal values of TVDI, NDVI, NAP, NVSWI, and VCI confirmed that mainland China suffered from severe drought in 1984, 1993, and 2007 and led the durations of severe drought. Spatial correlation is generated between NDVI, TCI, VHI, NVSWI, NAP, TVDI, and VCI. The correlation between NDVI, TCI, VHI, NAP, and VCI showed a significantly positive correlation while significantly negative correlation between NVSWI and TVDI, TVDI and VHI, which showed a good indication for the assessment of drought, especially for the agricultural regions of mainland China. This shows that the positive sign to support NAP, NVSWI, and TVDI is a good monitoring of the drought indices. During the summer, it appears that compared to the southeastern part of mainland China, drought is more likely to occur in the northwestern areas. There is no doubt that these drought indices are comprehensive indicators of monitoring drought events in mainland China.

TI  - Performance of case definitions and clinical predictors for influenza surveillance among patients followed in a rural cohort in Senegal
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundInfluenza is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Africa. However, a lack of epidemiological data remains for this pathology, and the performances of the influenza-like illness (ILI) case definitions used for sentinel surveillance have never been evaluated in Senegal. This study aimed to i) assess the performance of three different ILI case definitions, adopted by the WHO, USA-CDC (CDC) and European-CDC (ECDC) and ii) identify clinical factors associated with a positive diagnosis for Influenza in order to develop an algorithm fitted for the Senegalese context.MethodsAll 657 patients with a febrile pathological episode (FPE) between January 2013 and December 2016 were followed in a cohort study in two rural villages in Senegal, accounting for 1653 FPE observations with nasopharyngeal sampling and influenza virus screening by rRT-PCR. For each FPE, general characteristics and clinical signs presented by patients were collected. Sensitivity, Specificity, Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and Negative Predictive Value (NPV) for the three ILI case definitions were assessed using PCR result as the reference test. Associations between clinical signs and influenza infection were analyzed using logistic regression with generalized estimating equations. Sore throat, arthralgia or myalgia were missing for children under 5years.ResultsWHO, CDC and ECDC case definitions had similar sensitivity (81.0%; 95%CI: 77.0-85.0) and NPV (91.0%; 95%CI: 89.0-93.1) while the WHO and CDC ILI case definitions had the highest specificity (52.0%; 95%CI: 49.1-54.5) and PPV (32.0%; 95%CI: 30.0-35.0). These performances varied by age groups. In children <5years, the significant predictors of influenza virus infection were cough and nasal discharge. In patients from 5years, cough, nasal discharge, sore throat and asthenia grade 3 best predicted influenza infection. The addition of "nasal discharge" as a symptom to the WHO case definition decreased sensitivity but increased specificity, particularly in the pediatric population.ConclusionIn summary, all three definitions studies (WHO, ECDC & CDC) have similar performance, even by age group. The revised WHO ILI definition could be chosen for surveillance purposes for its simplicity. Symptomatic predictors of influenza virus infection vary according the age group.

TI  - Diagnostic accuracy of postmortem computed tomography for bleeding source determination in cases with hemoperitoneum
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LEGAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the accuracy of postmortem computed tomography and different radiological signs for the determination of the bleeding source in cases with hemoperitoneum confirmed at autopsy.Methods Postmortem computed tomography data of consecutive cases with hemoperitoneum confirmed at autopsy were reviewed by two raters, blinded to the autopsy findings. The determination of possible bleeding sources was based on the presence of the sentinel clot sign, blood or sedimented blood surrounding an organ, intraparenchymal abnormal gas distribution, and parenchymal disruption. The bleeding source and the cause of hemoperitoneum (traumatic, surgical, natural, or resuscitation) as reported in the autopsy report were noted. The survival intervals of the deceased were calculated when information about the time of an incident related to death was available in the autopsy reports.Results Eighty-five cases were included in the study. Postmortem computed tomography showed 79% sensitivity and 92.1% specificity for the detection of the bleeding source. The sentinel clot sign was associated with surgical or natural causes of hemoperitoneum and longer survival intervals. Sedimented blood around the bleeding source was associated with resuscitation. Abnormal gas distribution within organs and combination of multiple radiological signs provided higher sensitivity.Conclusion Postmortem computed tomography provides moderate sensitivity and high specificity for determining the bleeding source in cases with hemoperitoneum. Different PMCT signs are associated with different causes of hemoperitoneum and survival intervals.

TI  - Three-dimensional deformation monitoring and simulations for the preventive conservation of architectural heritage: a case study of the Angkor Wat Temple, Cambodia
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Architectural heritage has important historical, artistic, and technological value. However, these sites are subject to long-term degradation and are sensitive to disturbances from the surrounding landscape, resulting in the potential deterioration of the architecture. Deformation is a quantitative indicator of the vulnerability of architectural heritage. The extraction of three-dimensional (3D) deformation via existing geodetic approaches, such as global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) and interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), proves to be a challenging task. In this study, we proposed an adaptable methodology for the preventive monitoring of architectural heritage by integrating differential SAR tomography (D-TomoSAR) and a finite element method (FEM) to overcome the limitations of current geodetic approaches in cultural applications (i.e., sparse measurements in space; time- and labor-intensive). The Angkor Wat Temple, a well-known monument at the Angkor World Heritage site, Cambodia, was selected as the investigation target. We used D-TomoSAR to calculate the deformation, height, and thermal dilation of the structure using 46 TerraSAR-X images acquired during 2011-2013. InSAR deformation measurements were used as the constraint for the 3D deformation simulation and structural monitoring using an integrated approach to diagnose the soundness of the architectural structure. The experimental results demonstrate the following: 1) the integration of InSAR measurements prevented the underestimation of structural instabilities and linked the simplified physical model and mechanical parameters to the FEM simulation. 2) The Angkor Wat Temple appeared stable; however, structural instabilities were detected with an absolute deformation rate of up to 3 mm/yr. 3) Daily changes in thermal-related deformations caused by incoming frontal and posterior solar radiation-induced the bending of the architecture and the risk of structural defects. Our study reveals the defect mechanism of the Angkor Wat Temple and demonstrates the potential of the proposed method for the health diagnosis and preventive safeguarding of architectural heritages across the globe.

Through the analysis of the temperature of the canopy, it is possible to infer about the physiological aspects of the plants, helping to understand the behavior of the vegetation and, consequently, in the environmental monitoring and management of green areas. This study aims to validate the MOD11A2 V006 product from canopy surface temperature data obtained by an infrared radiation sensor. For the validation of the MOD11A2 product, a comparative analysis was performed between the land surface temperature (LST) data, obtained by the MODIS sensor, and the canopy temperature data, obtained by the SI-111 infrared radiation sensor coupled to the Itatiaia National Park (PNI) micrometeorological tower. Meteorological variables and land surface temperature collected from January to December 2018 in the PNI were also analyzed. The results reveal that the MOD11A2 product overestimates the canopy temperature in the daytime (MB ranging from 1.56 to 3.57 degrees C) and underestimates in the night time (MB ranging from - 0.18 to - 4.22 degrees C). During daytime, the months corresponding to the dry season presented a very high correlation (r = 0.74 and 0.86) and the highest values for the Willmott index (d = 0.70 and 0.64). At nighttime, the MOD11A2 product did not present a good performance for the LST estimation, especially in the rainy season. Therefore, we observed that the MOD11A2 product has limitations to estimate the land surface temperature and that possible changes in the algorithm of this product can be performed for high atmospheric humidity conditions.

TI  - Enhanced system for maternal mortality surveillance in France, context and Methods
T2  - GYNECOLOGIE OBSTETRIQUE FERTILITE & SENOLOGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - Maternal mortality, despite its rarity in rich countries, remains a fundamental indicator of maternal health. It is considered as a "sentinel event", consequence of dysfunctions of the health care system, often cumulative. In addition to the classical epidemiological surveillance outcomes-number of deaths, maternal mortality ratio and identification of the subgroups of women at higher risk-its study allows an accurate analysis of each deceased woman's trajectory to identify opportunities for improvements in the content or organization of care; the correction of which will make it possible to prevent deaths but also upstream morbid events affected by the same dysfunctions. To achieve this dual epidemiological and clinical audit objective, an ad hoc enhanced system is needed. France has had such a system since 1996, the National Confidential enquiry into maternal deaths (ENCMM), coordinated by the Inserm Epope team. The methodology has been adapted over time to improve completeness and better document cases. The first step is the multi-source identification (direct declaration, death certificate, birth certificates, hospital discharge data) of women who died during pregnancy or within one year of its end, in metropolitan France and overseas departments. The second step is the collection of detailed information for each death by a pair of clinical assessors. Recent evolutions aim to better document the social context of women as well as the background of women who have died of suicide. Psychiatrists have been included among the assessors. The third stage is the review of these anonymized documents by the National Committee of Experts on Maternal Mortality, which judges whether the death is maternal (causal link) and makes a judgment on the adequacy of care and avoidability of death. A psychiatrist is now associated to the CNEMM for the assessment of maternal suicides. The synthesis of the information thus collected for maternal deaths in the period 20132015 is presented in these articles of this special issue. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

TI  - Practice Patterns Among Penile Cancer Surgeons Performing Dynamic Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy and Radical Inguinal Lymph Node Dissection in Men with Penile Cancer: A eUROGEN Survey
T2  - EUROPEAN UROLOGY OPEN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Dynamic sentinel lymph node biopsy (DSNB) and radical inguinal lymph node dissection (ILND) are important in the management of penile cancer patients, but high-level evidence for preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative management remains scarce. According to an online survey of 35 surgeons from ten European countries, 57% perform >10 ILND procedures per year and 86% offer DSNB. Furthermore, management differs substantially for dye injection site, use of lymphoscintigraphy, preferred incision sites, techniques for lymphatic control, duration of empiric antibiotic therapy, perioperative thromboprophylaxis, time points for drain removal, and definition of the ILND dissection floor. Consensus was observed for the use of perioperative antibiotics (although not duration and type) and the borders for ILND template definitions. We conclude that there is significant variation in patient management among eUROGEN penile cancer surgeons. This heterogeneity may confound multicentre studies; therefore, a consensus to standardise inguinal node management in penile cancer across European penile cancer centres is warranted.Patient summary: Our survey reveals that preferences and surgical techniques for inguinal lymph node sampling and removal varies significantly between European penile cancer surgeons. Consensus is needed to standardise the management approach for penile cancer. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of European Association of Urology.

TI  - Intercomparison of freshwater fluxes over ocean and investigations into water budget closure
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of algorithms for the retrieval of water cycle components from satellite data - such as total column water vapor content (TCWV), precipitation (P), latent heat flux, and evaporation (E) - has seen much progress in the past 3 decades. In the present study, we compare six recent satellite-based retrieval algorithms and ERA5 (the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts' fifth re-analysis) freshwater flux (E - P) data regarding global and regional, seasonal and interannual variation to assess the degree of correspondence among them. The compared data sets are recent, freely available, and documented climate data records (CDRs), developed with a focus on stability and homogeneity of the time series, as opposed to instantaneous accuracy.One main finding of our study is the agreement of global ocean means of all E - P data sets within the uncertainty ranges of satellite-based data. Regionally, however, significant differences are found among the satellite data and with ERA5. Regression analyses of regional monthly means of E, P, and E - P against the statistical median of the satellite data ensemble (SEM) show that, despite substantial differences in global E patterns, deviations among E - P data are dominated by differences in P throughout the globe. E - P differences among data sets are spatially inhomogeneous.We observe that for ERA5 long-term global E - P is very close to 0mm d(-1) and that there is good agreement between land and ocean mean E - P, vertically integrated moisture flux divergence (VIMD), and global TCWV tendency. The fact that E and P are balanced globally provides an opportunity to investigate the consistency between E and P data sets. Over ocean, P (nearly) balances with E if the net transport of water vapor from ocean to land (approximated by overocean VIMD, i.e., del . (vq)(ocean)) is taken into account. On a monthly timescale, linear regression of E-ocean - del. (vq)(ocean) with P-ocean yields R-2 = 0.86 for ERA5, but smaller R-2 values are found for satellite data sets.Global yearly climatological totals of water cycle components (E, P, E - P, and net transport from ocean to land and vice versa) calculated from the data sets used in this study are in agreement with previous studies, with ERA5 E and P occupying the upper part of the range. Over ocean, both the spread among satellite-based E and the difference between two satellite-based P data sets are greater than E - P, and these remain the largest sources of uncertainty within the observed global water budget.We conclude that, for a better understanding of the global water budget, the quality of E and P data sets needs to be improved, and the uncertainties more rigorously quantified.

TI  - Persistent pollutants exceed toxic thresholds in a freshwater top predator decades after legislative control
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Declining emissions of persistent organic pollutants (POPs), subject to international control under the Stockholm convention, are not consistently reflected in biotic samples. To assess spatial and temporal variation in organochlorine pesticides and PCBs in UK freshwaters, we analysed tissues of a sentinel predator, the Eurasian otter, Lutra lutra between 1992 and 2009. Past declines in otter populations have been linked to POPs and it is unclear whether otter recovery is hampered in any areas by their persistence. PCBs, DDT (and derivatives), dieldrin and HCB were detected in over 80% of 755 otter livers sampled. Concentrations of Sigma PCB, Sigma DDT and dieldrin in otter livers declined across the UK, but there was no significant time trend for Sigma PCB-TEQ (WHO toxic equivalency, Van den Berg et al., 2006) or HCB. In general, higher concentrations were found in the midlands and eastern regions, and lowest concentrations in western regions. Concentrations of PCBs and HCB in otters increased near the coast, potentially reflecting higher pollutant levels in estuarine systems. Decades after legislative controls, concentrations of these legacy pollutants still pose a risk to otters and other freshwater predators, with spatially widespread exceedance of thresholds above which reproduction or survival has been reduced in related species.

TI  - Strengthening effect of super typhoon Rammasun (2014) on upwelling and cold eddies in the South China Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEANOLOGY AND LIMNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Typhoon is one of the frequent natural disasters in coastal regions of China. As shown in many studies, the impact of typhoons on the South China Sea (SCS) should not be overlooked. Super typhoon Rammasun (2014) was studied that formed in the northwestern Pacific, passed through the SCS, then landed in the Leizhou Peninsula. Remote sensing data and model products were used to analyze the spatiotemporal variations of the cold eddies, upwelling, sea surface temperature, mixed layer depth, rainfall, sea surface salinity, suspended sediment concentration, and surface-level anomaly. Results confirm the constant presence of upwelling and cold eddies in the southeast of Hainan (north of the Zhongsha Islands) and the southeast of Vietnam in July. In addition, we found the strengthening effect of super typhoon Rammasun on the upwelling and cold eddies in the SCS. The major reasons for the continuous decrease in sea surface temperature and the slow regaining of seawater temperature were the enhanced upwelling and vertical mixing caused by the typhoon. The increasing of the surface runoff in the Indochina Peninsula was mainly affected by the typhoon, with some contribution for the southeast of Vietnam's cold eddy and upwelling.

TI  - Three decadal morphodynamic evolution of a large channel bar in the middle Yangtze River: Influence of natural and anthropogenic interferences
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - The study focused on the question of how the natural and human forcing has affected the morphodynamic evolution of bars in the middle Yangtze River. A large channel bar was investigated using satellite remote sensing data during 1986-2017. A novel algorithm was proposed to select images acquired at the similar river stage. The bar was delineated from selected images and surface area, volume and centmid were quantified to examine bar morphodynamics. The results indicated a four-stage evolution process, including a steady extension (1986-1998), a quick shrinkage (1998-2002), a fluctuated shrinkage (2002-2012), and a fluctuated extension (2012-2017). The first stage was characterized by the steady growth at a rate of 0.087 km(2)/a, and a centroid translation towards the inner bend by 400 m. The second stage was the most dynamic episode, with the bar degradation at a rate of 0.71 km(2)/a, and a downstream migration by 850 m. In the third stage, the bar was eroded at a rate of 0.05 km(2)/a, and migrated towards the inner bend by about 80 m. In the fourth stage, the bar was deposited at a rate of 0.12 km(2)/a, and traveled upstream by around 400 m. The bar volume exhibited the similar trend. The analysis showed that the four stages were separated by the consecutive floods, the closure of Three Gorges Dam and the installation of two river engineering works. The results suggested that the bar evolved much more dynamic under the natural flow (1985-2003) than that of the regulated (2003-2012). The findings revealed that the evolution was largely governed by the flow and sediment supply while the human forcing can affect the process by altering these regimes. This study also demonstrated the great usefulness of combining multi-temporal imagery and river stage records in the assessment of bar morphodynamics.

TI  - <i>He awa whiria</i>-A "Braided River": An Indigenous Maori Approach to Mixed Methods Research
T2  - JOURNAL OF MIXED METHODS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - While literature on mixed methodology predominantly focuses on North American and European philosophical stances, non-Eurocentric worldviews and indigenous philosophies are also relevant to mixed methods research. This article aims to present the indigenous Maori worldview (te ao Maori) and how this lends itself to mixed methods research, in a New Zealand European and Maori partnership, to conduct bicultural research. The authors use the Maori metaphor He awa whiria (braided river) to describe combining the strengths of two distinct worldviews into a "workable whole." A framework brings together these two different paradigms as equals, incorporating both numerical and opinion-driven results. The authors illustrate this with a research example of creating a bicultural research framework, underpinned by mixed methods research philosophy.

TI  - Small Cetacean in a Human High-Use Area: Trends in Harbor Porpoise Abundance in the North Sea Over Two Decades
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The North Sea is one of the most heavily used shelf regions worldwide with a diversity of human impacts, including shipping, pollution, fisheries, and offshore constructions. These stressors on the environment can have consequences for marine organisms, such as our study species, the harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), which is regarded as a sentinel species and hence has a high conservation priority in the European Union (EU). As EU member states are obliged to monitor the population status, the present study aims to estimate trends in absolute harbor porpoise abundance in the German North Sea based on almost two decades of aerial surveys (2002-2019) using line-transect methodology. Furthermore, we were interested in trends in three Natura2000 Special Areas of Conservation (SACs), which include the harbor porpoise as designated feature. Trends were estimated for each SAC and two seasons (spring and summer) as well as the complete area of the German North Sea. For the trend analysis we applied a Bayesian framework to a series of replicated visual surveys, allowing to propagate the error structure of the original abundance estimates to the final trend estimate and designed to deal with spatio-temporal heterogeneity and other sources of uncertainty. In general, harbor porpoise abundance decreased in northern areas and increased in the south, such as in the SAC Borkum Reef Ground. A particularly strong decline with a high probability (94.9%) was detected in the core area and main reproduction site in summer, the SAC Sylt Outer Reef (-3.79% per year). The overall trend for the German North Sea revealed a decrease in harbor porpoise abundance over the whole study period (-1.79% per year) with high probability (95.1%). The assessment of these trends in abundance based on systematic monitoring should now form the basis for adaptive management, especially in the SAC Sylt Outer Reef, where the underlying causes and drivers for the large decline remain unknown and deserve further investigation, also in a regional North Sea wide context.

TI  - My cup of tea: Behaviour change intervention to promote use of reusable hot drink cups
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally approximately 16 billion paper coffee cups are being thrown away every year. One solution to this problem is using a reusable hot drink cup. We developed a behaviour change intervention to increase the use of reusable hot drink cups on an Australian University campus and evaluated its effectiveness; we also investigated the psychological mechanisms through which change happens; moreover, we extended the investigation on the previously established relationship between habit strength and intolerance of uncertainty. Participants (N = 156) from a large Australian University were randomly assigned to one of four intervention conditions: 1) an intervention aimed at evoking environmental values, 2) an intention-based intervention, 3) a habit-based intervention, and 4) a control group with no direct intervention to increase use of reusable cups. At baseline, participants in the three intervention groups received a new reusable hot drink cup, and completed a pre- and six-week post-intervention questionnaire assessing habit strength, intention to use a reusable cup, biospheric values, personal involvement and personal norms towards the environment, ecological worldview, and intolerance of uncertainty. The behaviour of using a reusable cup was recorded by participants using a phone app immediately after delivery of the intervention and at six-week follow-up. There was a significant increase in the use of reusable cups in all intervention conditions immediately after the intervention and after the six-week follow-up, compared to the control condition. The key mechanisms for behaviour change were similar between the intervention conditions, with groups increasing habit strength, especially if they had difficulty tolerating uncertainty. These findings offer suggestions for establishing habits in pro-environmental behaviour change interventions, as well as for tailoring habit-based interventions for those who are intolerant of uncertainty.

TI  - Assessment of surface energy balance algorithm for land and operational simplified surface energy balance algorithm over freshwater and saline water bodies in Urmia Lake Basin
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To manage inland water resources, surveying the performance of remote sensing models for estimating the actual evaporation in arid regions is so important. Hence, this study aimed to assess the performance of two energy balance algorithms including surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL) and operational simplified surface energy balance (SSEBop) in freshwater and saline water bodies. Another purpose of the present study was efficiency improvement in hypersaline lakes. In this regard, a practical salinity correction coefficient was used to overcome shortcomings of the selected models over saline Lake. The analysis of yearly lake water budget was used to assess the selected energy balance algorithms' performance with a novel approach. These algorithms were investigated at Shahid Kazemi Dam Reservoir (as a freshwater body) and Urmia Lake (as a hypersaline water body) in Iran. The results showed that two selected algorithms estimated the evaporation rate at the selected freshwater body with a proper accuracy. The results showed the root mean square error for SEBAL result (RMSESEBAL) as 2.0 mm/day, correlation coefficient for SEBAL result (R-SEBAL) as 0.80 mm/day, and RMSESSEBop and R-SSEBop as 1.7 and 0.80 mm/day, respectively. However, these models overestimated evaporation over the hypersaline water body (RMSESEBAL = 88.4 mm/month, R-SEBAL = 0.90 and RMSESSEBop = 39.9 mm/month, R-SSEBop = 0.94). Salinity correction coefficient improved the results as RMSESEBAL = 19.8 mm/month, R-SEBAL = 0.90 and RMSESSEBop = 13.4 mm/month, and R-SSEBop = 0.94. In general, the algorithm performance was improved using the salinity correction coefficient in the chosen hypersaline water body.

TI  - Next-generation tools to control biting midge populations and reduce pathogen transmission
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Review
AB  - Biting midges of the genus Culicoides transmit disease-causing agents resulting in a significant economic impact on livestock industries in many parts of the world. Localized control efforts, such as removal of larval habitat or pesticide application, can be logistically difficult, expensive and ineffective if not instituted and maintained properly. With these limitations, a population-level approach to the management of Culicoides midges should be investigated as a means to replace or supplement existing control strategies. Next-generation control methods such as Wolbachia- and genetic-based population suppression and replacement are being investigated in several vector species. Here we assess the feasibility and applicability of these approaches for use against biting midges. We also discuss the technical and logistical hurdles needing to be addressed for each method to be successful, as well as emphasize the importance of addressing community engagement and involving stakeholders in the investigation and development of these approaches.

TI  - Shoreline changes and its impact on the mangrove ecosystems of some islands of Indian Sundarbans, North-East coast of India
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to analyse the shoreline oscillations of three estuarine Islands in Sundarban delta and its impact on mangrove forests around the Islands. Six multi-temporal Landsat images spanning 42 years (1975-2017) have been used in the study. Band ratio was computed to discriminate the water line from the land, which was later digitized. Digital shoreline analysis system (DSAS) was employed for estimation and analysis of the shorelines changes by End point rate (EPR) model and Linear regression rate (LRR) model after laying transects offshore of the baseline. Sea level and topography of the islands have also been analyzed. To assess the mangrove health, time series Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI) analysis has been performed using the Mann Kendall Tau statistics and Sen's slope. Mangrove degradation maps were produced from the data and combined with evidences collected from field works. The results point to a very dynamic shoreline ensuing in erosion of mangrove forests while some areas do show encouraging trends due to sustained accretion especially in the southern and eastern parts. Overall erosion is higher than accretion in the Islands. Results show that NDVI has been decreasing along patches that are near to erosion hotspots irrespective of climatic trends. Thus it can be concluded that mangrove forests are under severe stress due to shoreline ingression and sea level rise and not climatic alterations. Going forward this work could provide significant information on the nature of shoreline changes and could assist in sustainable development for Sundarban biodiversity niche management.

TI  - Epidemiology and challenges of dengue surveillance in the WHO South-East Asia Region
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
M3  - Review
AB  - Dengue poses a significant health and economic burden in the WHO South-East Asia Region. Approaches for control need to be aligned with current knowledge on the epidemiology of dengue in the region. Such knowledge will ensure improved targeting of interventions to reduce dengue incidence and its socioeconomic impact. This review was undertaken to describe the contemporary epidemiology of dengue and critically analyse the existing surveillance strategies in the region. Over recent decades, dengue incidence has continued to increase with geographical expansion. The region has now become hyper-endemic for multiple dengue virus serotypes/genotypes. Every epidemic cycle was associated with a change of predominant serotype/genotype and this was often associated with severe disease with intense transmission. Classical larval indices are widely used in vector surveillance and adult mosquito samplings are not implemented as a part of routine surveillance. Further, there is a lack of integration of entomological and disease surveillance systems, often leading to inaction or delays in dengue prevention and control. Disease surveillance does not capture all cases, resulting in under-reporting, and has thus failed to adequately represent the true burden of disease in the region. Possible solutions include incorporating adult mosquito sampling into routine vector surveillance, the establishment of laboratory-based sentinel surveillance, integrated vector and dengue disease surveillance and climate-based early warning systems using available technologies like mobile apps.

TI  - Ornamental houseplants as potential biosamplers for indoor pollution of organophosphorus flame retardants
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated the occurrence, compositions, and partitioning behaviors of organophosphorus flame retardants (OPFRs) in indoor dust, air, and ornamental plants in Dalian, China, to evaluate the possibility of using houseplants as indoor biosamplers of OPFRs. The mean concentrations of OPFRs in the indoor air, dust, and plant samples were 14.9 ng/m(3), 18,000 ng/g, and 345 ng/g, respectively. Tris(2-chloroisopropyl) phosphate (TCIPP) was the dominant congener in all kinds of samples. Significant correlation was found between the concentrations of tris(1.3-dichloroisopropyl) phosphate (TDCIPP) in indoor air and plants, suggesting that ornamental plant can be used as a sentinel for certain OPFRs in the indoor air. We developed a predictive model to assess the partitioning coefficients of OPFRs between indoor air and plant. The lipid content in leaf cuticle instead of leaf organic matter was used to improve the accuracy and reliability of this assessment. Using this model, we can estimate the OPFR concentrations in the indoor air based on their concentrations measured in the corresponding indoor plant. The estimated air concentrations were generally comparable with the measured concentrations, especially for those with octanol-air partition coefficient log K-oa <11.6. Indoor plants can also provide a more holistic understanding of OPFR occurrence within a home due to the relatively long-term air-foliage partitioning. The results suggest that under certain conditions indoor ornamental plants have the potential to be used as the biosamplers of OPFRs in the indoor environment clue to their convenience and low-cost.

TI  - Mapping rice area and yield in northeastern asia by incorporating a crop model with dense vegetation index profiles from a geostationary satellite
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Acquiring accurate and timely information on the spatial distribution of paddy rice fields and the corresponding yield is an important first step in meeting the regional and global food security needs. In this study, using dense vegetation index profiles and meteorological parameters from the Communication, Ocean, and Meteorological Satellite (COMS) geostationary satellite, we estimated paddy areas and applied a novel approach based on a remote sensing-integrated crop model (RSCM) to simulate spatiotemporal variations in rice yield in Northeastern Asia. Estimated seasonal vegetation profiles of plant canopy from the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) were constructed to classify paddy fields as well as their productivity based on a bidirectional reflectance distribution function model (BRDF) and adjusted normalized difference vegetation indices (VIs). In the case of classification, the overall accuracy for detected paddy fields was 78.8% and the spatial distribution of the paddy area was well represented for each selected county based on synthetic applications of dense-time GOCI vegetation index and MODIS water index. For most of the Northeast Asian administrative districts investigated between 2011 and 2017, simulated rice mean yields for each study site agreed with the measured rice yields, with a root-mean-square error of 0.674 t ha(-1), a coefficient of determination of 0.823, a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.524, and without significant differences (p-value = 0.235) according to a sample t-test (alpha = 0.05) for the entire study period. A well-calibrated RSCM, driven by GOCI images, can facilitate the development of novel approaches for the monitoring and management of crop productivity over classified paddy areas, thereby enhancing agricultural decision support systems.

TI  - Socio-environmental land cover time-series analysis of mining landscapes using Google Earth Engine and web-based mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mining contributes to land cover changes, directly and indirectly affecting the natural landscape and local communities. The need for robust analyses of social and environmental data at the mine site and mine region scale is essential for regulators and mining companies to effectively identify, monitor, sustainably mitigate and manage mining impacts. This study characterized and evaluated land cover changes and their concurrent impacts on socio-environmental land uses in a Philippines mining landscape. Using composites of multispectral Landsat images, vegetation indices and a Digital Elevation Model (DEM), classified land use and land cover time-series maps were created. High-level land covers with a coarse thematic resolution that could be successfully characterized using Landsat historical imagery were first mapped using supervised Random Forest classification in Google Earth Engine (GEE). Subsequently, web-based mapping by local experts was used to characterise key fine thematic resolution land use categories within selected zones of importance which were not possible to characterise using Landsat alone. The time-series provided an accurate estimate of change, and revealed significant temporal trends at the regional scale between 1994 and 2018. Trends included a significant decrease in primary vegetation and an increase in built-up areas, mining and irrigated agriculture. Some notable fine-scale land use changes revealed by the analysis were the increase in social development projects post 2005 and conversions between citrus and paddy agriculture; these were initially balanced but leaned prominently towards paddy cultivation post 2010. An assessment of land use and land cover transitions provided key insights to several socioenvironmental indicators, including environmental quality, habitat loss, population distribution and livelihood, essential to characterise and support the management of the mine's socio-ecological system. The paper concludes by reflecting on the methods developed, evaluating their limitations and presenting potential ways to improve the workflow to better support social change assessments.

TI  - 20 years of landscape dynamics within the world's largest multinational network of protected areas
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The world's largest network of protected areas (PAs), Natura 2000, is facing different types of disturbances and pressures, however, it still remains unclear the impact they have on the conservation status of sites. Remote sensing big data analysis and satellite data were used to quantify dynamics of the dominant land cover category, landscape structure, and vegetation greenness, as indicators of conservation status, as well as drivers of change, between 2000 and 2018, within each Natura 2000 protected area, across the entire European Union. Our results show that the majority of sites are 'favourable' on natural land cover range and areas, but heading to 'unfavourable' status regarding the landscape structure, while an alarmingly high number of sites experience both net loss of the dominant land cover type and degradation of landscape structure, labeled consequently as having an 'unfavourable' conservation status. The results also showed high differences between biogeographic regions and countries, with an extremely low number of sites suffering dramatic changes to other dominant land cover types, mainly among grasslands. Mediterranean region showed a high net forest increase (mainly extension of existing forests) as well as insignificant changes of landscape fragmentation and diversity (predominantly in Greece, Spain and, Italy), related to the intensification of forest planting, and to a high loss of grassland area and cropland (land abandonment). High net forest gain, but increasing landscape fragmentation, was observed in the Continental region (mainly in Bulgaria, Poland, Germany and, Italy), suggesting that forest developed in numerous new smaller patches, due to the development of invasive species through natural processes (agricultural land abandonment) and natural system modifications. The Alpine region also showed a low positive net forest change, but with significant dynamics of gains due to reducing of agricultural activities and human disturbances, and losses due to natural catastrophes such as natural fires, storms, avalanches or landslides. Contrarily, the Boreal and Atlantic regions recorded considerable net forest loss during the analyzed period, caused mainly by the occurrence of natural catastrophes, natural biotic and abiotic processes (erosion, parasitism, diseases), and the increase of forestry clearance. These results show the high potential of moderate resolution remote sensing big data in assessing PAs, even more as higher spatial and temporal resolution satellite data are continuously emerging.

TI  - Climate change versus land-use change-What affects the ecosystem services more in the forest-steppe ecotone?
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ecosystem services (ESs), which play an important role in the balance of the natural ecosystem and social-economic development, are suffering from degradation caused by human activities and climate change. However, themanner inwhich the ESs respond to the land use/cover changes (LUCCs) and the climatic factors respectively remain elusive, especially in the forest-steppe ecotone, which is highly sensitive to climate change and anthroponotic activities. Based on the remote sensing data and in situ meteorological data, we comprehensively modeled and compared 4 key ESs changes caused by 3 LUCC types, land-use change fraction, and climate changes through two simple comparative experiments. Our results showed that: theGrain for theGreen Project improved the mean soil conservation, carbon sequestration, and water yield but reduced the sand fixation. The cropland expansion had a positive influence on the water yield and sand fixation, but it induced a decline in soil conservation and carbon sequestration. The urbanization very likely increased the water yield and decreased soil conservation, carbon sequestration, and sand fixation. The unequal change fractions of the same land-use conversion may affect the ESs differently. The ESs changes have different responses to climate change in different landscapes due to the ecological process. The water yield could be well explained by the temperature, precipitation, radiation, and wind speed. Climate change had a stronger effect on the water yield and carbon sequestration than the land use/cover changes but sand fixation and soil conservation were more likely to be affected by LUCCs. The impact of three types of land-use changes and climate change on the ecosystem services should be considered when formulating land-use policies. This paper might aid the decision-makers in achieving ESs sustainable management and develop land-use strategies in the forest-steppe ecotone. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Observations of anticyclonic eddies in the western subarctic North Pacific
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - We conducted a ship observation of two anticyclonic mesoscale eddies (Eddies A and B) between June and July 2016 in the offshore region of the western subarctic North Pacific to clarify the impact of anticyclonic eddies on biological production. Analysis of satellite data reveals that Eddy A formed south of the Alaskan Peninsula on May 2011 while Eddy B formed in the observation area on November 2015. Iron concentration was low both inside and outside Eddies A and B, and there were no large differences between chlorophyll a (chl-a) concentration inside and outside eddies. Satellite-derived chl-a concentration inside Eddy A had been high compared with that in the surrounding area when the eddy was located along the Aleutian Islands and just after it detached from the islands, suggesting that iron originating from the coastal region was consumed during the two-year journey from the coastal region to the observation area. Field measurements also reveal that vertical diffusivity was low both inside and outside Eddies A and B, which could be another factor underlying low iron both inside and outside Eddies A and B and small differences between chl-a concentration inside and outside the eddies.

TI  - Redistributing resilience? Deliberate transformation and political capabilities in post-Haiyan Tacloban
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - There are increasing calls for transformation to be considered as a means to address the effects of social, cultural and political conditions on vulnerability when resilience is applied in practice. Yet transformation does not necessarily lead to more equitable social conditions. Here, we draw on the analytical framework of political capabilities to reveal aspects of the underlying politics of transformation. Our focus is on the relocation of communities in Tacloban, Philippines following Typhoon Haiyan, as an example of a deliberate transformation enacted as part of an integrated development and disaster risk reduction plan. A household survey, focus group discussions and individual interviews are applied to rank households in terms of their perception of household resilience four years after the disaster. Analysis of the drivers and consequences of differentiation reveals an uneven distribution of resilience among residents, with many facing difficulties despite a focus on livelihoods embedded in the relocation plan. While some were able to leverage pre-existing human and social capital, others found that the shift from coastal livelihoods left them struggling to find a valued role. Relocation reinforced underlying subjectivities with new layers of meaning, reflecting experiences of success and failure in adjusting to a more commercial culture and cash economy. The plan sought improvement through commercial opportunities, reflecting the authority and worldview of dominant city and international stakeholders. While the deliberate transformation that followed sought to be just in the distribution of risk and opportunity, poorer residents lacked the political capability to influence the relocation narrative, which in turn overlooked histories of marginalization and the lived experience of the poor. The case highlights the significance of engaging political capabilities if transformations are to support those in vulnerable communities to make valued life choices. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - An assessment of temporal, spatial and taxonomic trends in harmful algal toxin exposure in stranded marine mammals from the US New England coast.
T2  - PLoS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite a long-documented history of severe harmful algal blooms (HABs) in New England coastal waters, corresponding HAB-associated marine mammal mortality events in this region are far less frequent or severe relative to other regions where HABs are common. This long-term survey of the HAB toxins saxitoxin (STX) and domoic acid (DA) demonstrates significant and widespread exposure of these toxins in New England marine mammals, across multiple geographic, temporal and taxonomic groups. Overall, 19% of the 458 animals tested positive for one or more toxins, with 15% and 7% testing positive for STX and DA, respectively. 74% of the 23 different species analyzed demonstrated evidence of toxin exposure. STX was most prevalent in Maine coastal waters, most frequently detected in common dolphins (Delphinus delphis), and most often detected during July and October. DA was most prevalent in animals sampled in offshore locations and in bycaught animals, and most frequently detected in mysticetes, with humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) testing positive at the highest rates. Feces and urine appeared to be the sample matrices most useful for determining the presence of toxins in an exposed animal, with feces samples having the highest concentrations of STX or DA. No relationship was found between the bloom season of toxin-producing phytoplankton and toxin detection rates, however STX was more likely to be present in July and October. No relationship between marine mammal dietary preference and frequency of toxin detection was observed. These findings are an important part of a framework for assessing future marine mammal morbidity and mortality events, as well as monitoring ecosystem health using marine mammals as sentinel organisms for predicting coastal ocean changes.

TI  - Object-Based Wetland Classification Using Multi-Feature Combination of Ultra-High Spatial Resolution Multispectral Images
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and Google Earth (GE) RGB images have ultra-high spatial resolution. But it is difficult to get a high classification accuracy due to the poor spectral resolution. In this article, the object-based wetland classification is investigated using multi-feature combination of ultra-high spatial resolution multispectral images (MSI). A Gram-Schmidt (GS) transformation is used to fuze Sentinel-2A data with UAV and GE RGB images, respectively, in order to obtain the ultra-high spatial resolution MSI as data sources. Three different feature combination classification scenarios are constructed for fusion GE and UAV MSI, respectively, based on selected features. The object-based random forest (RF) algorithms with parameters (mtry and ntree) optimization are used to carry out finer wetland classification. Results show that the fusion GE and UAV MSI have good applicability in the finer wetland classification, especially the fusion UAV images, and integrating multi-source features could improve classification accuracy. Both data sources reach the highest accuracy in scenario3. The overall accuracy of fusion UAV image scenario3 is 94.31% (Kappa = 0.9353), and that of fusion GE image scenario3 is 87.37% (Kappa = 0.8528). The contribution of different features to wetland classification is obtained with spectral and vegetation indexes, texture, geometric and contextual features.

TI  - AeroCom phase III multi-model evaluation of the aerosol life cycle and optical properties using ground- and space-based remote sensing as well as surface in situ observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Within the framework of the AeroCom (Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models) initiative, the state-of-the-art modelling of aerosol optical properties is assessed from 14 global models participating in the phase III control experiment (AP3). The models are similar to CMIP6/AerChemMIP Earth System Models (ESMs) and provide a robust multi-model ensemble. Inter-model spread of aerosol species lifetimes and emissions appears to be similar to that of mass extinction coefficients (MECs), suggesting that aerosol optical depth (AOD) uncertainties are associated with a broad spectrum of parameterised aerosol processes.Total AOD is approximately the same as in AeroCom phase I (AP1) simulations. However, we find a 50% decrease in the optical depth (OD) of black carbon (BC), attributable to a combination of decreased emissions and lifetimes. Relative contributions from sea salt (SS) and dust (DU) have shifted from being approximately equal in AP1 to SS contributing about 2/3 of the natural AOD in AP3. This shift is linked with a decrease in DU mass burden, a lower DU MEC, and a slight decrease in DU lifetime, suggesting coarser DU particle sizes in AP3 compared to AP1.Relative to observations, the AP3 ensemble median and most of the participating models underestimate all aerosol optical properties investigated, that is, total AOD as well as fine and coarse AOD (AOD(f), AOD(c)), Angstrom exponent (AE), dry surface scattering (SCdry), and absorption (AC(dry)) coefficients. Compared to AERONET, the models underestimate total AOD by ca. 21% +/- 20% (as inferred from the ensemble median and interquartile range). Against satellite data, the ensemble AOD biases range from -37% (MODIS-Terra) to -16% (MERGED-FMI, a multi-satellite AOD product), which we explain by differences between individual satellites and AERONET measurements themselves. Correlation coefficients (R) between model and observation AOD records are generally high (R > 0.75), suggesting that the models are capable of capturing spatiotemporal variations in AOD. We find a much larger underestimate in coarse AOD(c) (similar to-45% +/- 25 %) than in fine AOD(f) (similar to-15% +/- 25 %) with slightly increased inter-model spread compared to total AOD. These results indicate problems in the modelling of DU and SS. The AOD(c) bias is likely due to missing DU over continental land masses (particularly over the United States, SE Asia, and S. America), while marine AERONET sites and the AATSR SU satellite data suggest more moderate oceanic biases in AOD(c).Column AEs are underestimated by about 10% +/- 16 %. For situations in which measurements show AE > 2, models underestimate AERONET AE by ca. 35 %. In contrast, all models (but one) exhibit large overestimates in AE when coarse aerosol dominates (bias ca. +140% if observed AE < 0.5). Simulated AE does not span the observed AE variability. These results indicate that models overestimate particle size (or underestimate the fine-mode fraction) for fine-dominated aerosol and underestimate size (or overestimate the fine-mode fraction) for coarse-dominated aerosol. This must have implications for lifetime, water uptake, scattering enhancement, and the aerosol radiative effect, which we can not quantify at this moment.Comparison against Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) in situ data results in mean bias and inter-model variations of -35% +/- 25% and -20% +/- 18% for SCdry and AC(dry), respectively. The larger underestimate of SCdry than AC(dry) suggests the models will simulate an aerosol single scattering albedo that is too low. The larger underestimate of SCdry than ambient air AOD is consistent with recent findings that models overestimate scattering enhancement due to hygroscopic growth. The broadly consistent negative bias in AOD and surface scattering suggests an underestimate of aerosol radiative effects in current global aerosol models.Considerable inter-model diversity in the simulated optical properties is often found in regions that are, unfortunately, not or only sparsely covered by ground-based observations. This includes, for instance, the Sahara, Amazonia, central Australia, and the South Pacific. This highlights the need for a better site coverage in the observations, which would enable us to better assess the models, but also the performance of satellite products in these regions.Using fine-mode AOD as a proxy for present-day aerosol forcing estimates, our results suggest that models underestimate aerosol forcing by ca. -15 %, however, with a considerably large interquartile range, suggesting a spread between -35% and +10 %.

TI  - Development of Sentinel LN Imaging with a Combination of HAase Based on a Comprehensive Analysis of the Intra-lymphatic Kinetics of LPs
T2  - MOLECULAR THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - The sentinel lymph node (LN) is the first LN to which lymph fluid flows from tumor tissue. We identified the key parameters of liposomes (LPs) that affect their accumulation in regional (primary) LNs with minimum leakage to its connecting (secondary) LNs by a comprehensive analysis of the LN-to-LN trafficking of LPs with various surface charges and various sizes. We used a lymphatic flow-modified (LFM) mouse that allows for the chronological analysis of inguinal (primary) LN-to-axillary (secondary) LN at the body surface. As a result, the anionic medium-sized LPs (130 nm on average) exhibited the highest accumulation in the primary LNs. A mechanism-based analysis revealed that CD169-positive macrophages in LNs were the dominant cell population that captures anionic LPs. Sentinel LN imaging was also performed by the intratumoral injection of fluorescent medium-sized anionic LPs using a breast cancer orthotopic model. In comparison with the typically used contrast agent indocyanine green, the anionic LPs were detected in sentinel LNs with a high sensitivity. Additionally, the co-injection of hyaluronidase significantly improved the sensitivity of detection of the fluorescent LPs in sentinel LNs. In conclusion, medium-sized anionic LPs combined with hyaluronidase represents a potent strategy for investigating sentinel LNs.

TI  - A Hospital-Based Multi-Centric Study to Determine the Clinico-Epidemiological Profile of Intussusception in Children < 2 Years in Rajasthan, India
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To determine the clinical and epidemiological profile of Intussusception in children aged Method This was a hospital-based multi-centric surveillance study conducted at three tertiary care sentinel sites in Rajasthan over a period of 2 y. Children <2 y of age admitted with intussusception as per Brighton's criteria 1 were enrolled. Demographic details including age, sex, clinical presentation, diagnostic methods, duration of symptoms, mode of treatment, and complications were recorded and analyzed. Results During the study period of 2 y, the authors identified 164 cases of intussusception based on level-1 Brighton's criteria. Median age at presentation was 7 mo [Interquartile range (IQR) 5-10 mo] with a male to female ratio of 2:1. Pain abdomen and blood stained stool were the commonest presenting complaints (88.4% and 81.7%, respectively). Commonest site of intussusception was Ileocolic (82.32%). Pathological lead point was identified in 18.9% cases. Distinct seasonality was observed as maximum cases of intussusception were detected in the months of Jan-March (34.1%). Surgical intervention was required in the 89.63% cases. The median time duration between onset of symptoms and admission at sentinel site was 2 d (IQR 1-3 d). Proportion of cases that required surgery increased as the time interval between onset of symptoms and admission increases. Conclusion Intussusception is a common surgical condition among children under-two years of age with majority of cases occurring during infancy. Case management is dependent primarily on time duration elapsed between symptoms onset and admission to tertiary care centre. Early case detection and timely referral may provide an opportunity to avoid surgical interventions.

TI  - Determining the source of dust storms with use of coupling WRF and HYSPLIT models: A case study of Yazd province in central desert of Iran
T2  - DYNAMICS OF ATMOSPHERES AND OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Dust storm, which has a significant impact on regional air quality, is one of the most hazardous meteorological phenomena in the arid areas. Yazd province is one of the arid areas in Iran that is exposed to dust storms. In this study, two cases of dust storms of Yazd province are studied with the use of coupling numerical models and aerosol optical depth (AOD) from MODIS data. We investigated synoptic condition of such dust storms that were formed downstream of upper level through in the area by focusing on two storms, on May 24 and 25, 2014. For this purpose, a dynamic coupling of this case is done using WRF output the HYSPLIT model. This model was implemented to investigate the sources of the dust storms by calculating the back trajectories from the receptor sites. The trajectories indicated that the first and the second case storms occurred in the northeast and the south of Yazd respectively. These results also showed a good agreement with MODIS aerosol optical depth data and HYSPLIT back trajectories paths.

TI  - Performance and relationship of four different agricultural drought indices for drought monitoring in China's mainland using remote sensing data
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing frequency and intensity of extremedrought events have harmed the environment, ecosystem, and agricultural productivity. However, the characteristics of agricultural drought in China have not been well understood. The remote sensing (RS) based gridded monthly precipitation, soil moisture, land surface temperature (LST), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) datasets over 1982-2018 were utilized to derive standardized precipitation index (SPI), standardized soil moisture index (SSI), multivariate standardized drought index (MSDI), and vegetation health index (VHI). The variation patterns and trends of SPI, SSI, and MSDI at the 1-, 3-, and 6-month timescales against monthly VHI anomaly were compared to identify the best agricultural drought index in China. The drought variations in the four sub-regions (northwest, north, Qinghai-Tibet area, and south area) were also investigated. The results showed that: (1) Temporal patterns of VHI anomaly were similar to relative soil moisture and slightly different from precipitation. The spatial patterns of MSDI matched with VHI the best than SPI and SSI. (2) All three indices showed positive correlations with VHI at the three timescales. The highest correlation coefficients (r) between MSDI and VHI ranged from 0.25 to 0.67, 0.22 to 0.78, 0.23 to 0.69, and 0.19 to 0.74 in northwest China, north China, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and south China, respectively. (3) The connections between monthly VHI and the three drought indices were weaker at the 1-month timescale (0.16 < r < 0.25) than the 3-month (0.39 < r < 0.78) and 6-month (0.26 < r < 0.68) timescales. (4) The VHI significantly increased inmost of China except north China. Overall, MSDI showed better performance formonitoring agricultural drought in China's mainland. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Expansion of Shishper Glacier lake and recent glacier lake outburst flood (GLOF), Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Shishper lake is an ice-dammed lake in northern Pakistan that has drained twice within one (1) year. The parameters evaluated in this paper are the lake's area, volume, peak discharge, and its outburst events using various satellite images from November 2018 to June 2020. Based on satellite imagery and empirical approaches, the lake formed in November 2018 and reached a maximum of 0.34 km(2) till its first breach that occurred on 22 June 2019. Since June 2019, the lake drained till September 2019. After that, the flow was blocked again, and the lake expanded to an area of 0.27 km(2) till its second outburst event that happened on May 29, 2020. Eight cross-sectional profiles of Hassanabad ravine are generated based on peak discharge in the lake's rapid outburst. The results indicate that, the peak discharge for both 2019 and 2020 was more than 4500 m(3) s(-1). Delineation of downstream Hassanabad ravine shows that more than 1000 buildings and 2000+ population is prone to flood. However, the lake drain twice steadily, but it has a high potential to cause severe damages if it bursts abruptly.

TI  - Evaluation of the environmental impacts of urbanization from the viewpoint of increased skin temperatures: a case study from Istanbul, Turkey
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization is an inevitable process all around the world especially in developing countries like Turkey. Istanbul has been experiencing rapid urban expansion for the past 60 years. This urban expansion is leading to the replacement of forests by various artificial surfaces. This situation has a critical impact on the natural surfaces due to the alteration of heat energy balance. In this study, the authors tried to investigate the extent of urbanization of Istanbul within the past decades to unearth its impacts on the urban heat island (UHI) severity and the level of its ecological consequences in terms of decreased thermal comfort. To this end, land use/cover (LULC) and land surface temperature (LST) maps were generated using Landsat imageries based on random forest (RF) classifier (as a machine learning tool) and radiometric image processing algorithms, respectively, for four different dates from 1989 to 2019. The statistical and spectral indicators were calculated for the study area to evaluate the association between urban development and UHI. Results indicate that Istanbul has suffered a continuous land transformation from forest to urban and croplands so that the area of forest has diminished by 373.3 km(2), and the artificial surfaces have increased by 260 km(2). Skin temperatures over all the LULC classes show an increase during the study period with the highest values estimated over artificial surfaces. The statistical analysis of urbanization indicators (ULI, PD, UGSI, NDVI, and NDBI) and UHI indicator (UTFVI) resulted in good correlation coefficients with the best agreement found between NDBI and UTFVI which stresses the strong link between the expansion of built-up areas as a result of urbanization and the severity of UHI and its ecological impacts in Istanbul. Thus, it is a must for policy-makers and officials of the city to take accurate measures regarding the urban planning to mitigate the harsh environmental impacts of growing urbanization of Istanbul in upcoming years.

TI  - Associations between surrounding residential greenness and intelligence quotient in 6-year-old children
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Residential greenness has been reported to be positively associated with health benefits for children, including improved cognitive function. We investigated the association between the intelligence quotient (IQ) of 6-year-old children in Seoul, South Korea and surrounding greenness currently and during the mothers' pregnancy. We also analyzed whether these effects differed by the type of greenness, such as natural or built greenness.Methods: This study considered 189 mother-child dyads fromthe Environment and Development of Children Cohort study, who lived in Seoul during the prenatal period and when the child was 6 years old. We defined surrounding greenness using Landsat image data from Korean Arirang satellite images with buffers within 100 m - 2000 m of the radius of each participant's residential address. We separately analyzed two types of greenness, namely natural and built greenness. The children's IQ (total, verbal, and performance IQ) wasmeasured using the Korean Educational Developmental Institute'sWechsler Intelligence Scale for Children.Results: Prenatal exposure to built greenness in 500mand 1000mbufferswas associatedwith children's total IQ in a fullmodel [difference in IQ (95% CI): 3.46(0.68, 6.24) and 3.42 (0.53, 6.31) per interquartile increase in proportion of greenness]. However, postnatal exposure to built greenness in all buffers was associated in children's total IQ. We found a stronger association between children's total IQ and built greenness rather than natural greenness.Conclusions: We found that 6-year-old children tended to score higher on total IQ if they lived in greener neighborhoods. The results provide further evidence of the health benefits of greenness and provide support for urban planning and public health to build healthy urban cities for children and pregnant women.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon fiber-reinforced silicon carbide matrix (C/SiC) composites are typical difficult-to-cut materials due to high hardness and brittleness. Aiming at the problem of the serious high cutting force and poor surface quality in conventional milling (CM) C/SiC composite process, ultrasonic vibration-assisted milling (UVAM) and conventional milling tests with a diamond-coated milling cutter were conducted. The results showed that reducing the feed per tooth, cutting depth, or increasing the cutting speed can reduce the average cutting force, and increasing the ultrasonic amplitude, the average cutting force decreases first and then increases. With the assistance of ultrasonic vibration, the maximum reduction rates of average cutting forces Fx, Fy, and Fz were 43.7%, 29.16%, and 68.09%.The ultrasonic vibration assisting effect does not significantly improve the damage of materials such as fiber breakage during processing. The ultrasonic vibration assisting effect improves the quality of processing edges. It is found that reducing feed per tooth, cutting depth, or increasing cutting speed can reduce surface roughness and increasing the ultrasonic amplitude reduces the surface roughness first and then increases. On the whole, the surface roughness of C/SiC ultrasonic vibration milling is slightly smaller than that of conventional machining.

TI  - Characteristics of mesoscale convective systems during the warm season over the Tibetan Plateau based on FY-2 satellite data sets
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) often cause heavy precipitation events during the warm season over the Tibetan Plateau (TP). By using the 1-hr gridded data sets with the resolution of 0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees from the geostationary satellites of Fengyun-2 series (FY-2C/2E), the characteristics of MCSs over the TP during the warm season (May-August) from 2005 to 2012 are analysed. Based on objective criteria, MCSs over the TP can be divided into six categories, namely mesoscale convection complexes (MCCs), persistent elongated convection systems (PECSs), meso-beta circular convection systems (M(beta)CCSs), meso-beta elongated convection systems (M(beta)ECSs), smaller meso-beta circular convection systems (SM(beta)CCSs), as well as smaller meso-beta elongated convection systems (SM(beta)ECSs). The results show that there are 1,465 MCSs occurring over the TP during the warm seasons of 2005-2012, and most MCSs occur in a banded area around 30 degrees N with two high-frequency centres. The frequency of MCSs reaches a maximum in July, followed by August and June, while the lowest frequency occurs in May. The high-frequency centre is located in the northern part of the TP in May, and moves southward to the central and southern part of the TP from June to August. 82.3% of the MCSs over the TP belong to the elongated categories, out of which M(beta)ECSs account for the most. MCSs over the TP have significant diurnal variations, which usually initiate at around 1700 LST (LST, LST = UTC + 8 hr), then develop and reach maturity at 2000 LST, then weaken and dissipate at 2200 LST. The life cycles of MCSs are characterized by slow growth and rapid weakening. The larger the scale of MCSs over the TP is, the longer the duration will be.

TI  - Smart solutions for smart cities: Urban wetland mapping using very-high resolution satellite imagery and airborne LiDAR data in the City of St. John's, NL, Canada
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Thanks to increasing urban development, it has become important for municipalities to understand how ecological processes function. In particular, urban wetlands are vital habitats for the people and the animals living amongst them. This is because wetlands provide great services, including water filtration, flood and drought mitigation, and recreational spaces. As such, several recent urban development plans are currently needed to monitor these invaluable ecosystems using timeand cost-efficient approaches. Accordingly, this study is designed to provide an initial response to the need of wetland mapping in the City of St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador (NL), Canada. Specifically, we produce the first high-resolution wetland map of the City of St. John's using advanced machine learning algorithms, very high-resolution satellite imagery, and airborne LiDAR. An object-based random forest algorithm is applied to features extracted from WorldView-4, GeoEye-1, and LiDAR data to characterize five wetland classes, namely bog, fen, marsh, swamp, and open water, within an urban area. An overall accuracy of 91.12% is obtained for discriminating different wetland types and wetland surface water flow connectivity is also produced using LiDAR data. The resulting wetland classification map and the water surface flow map can help elucidate a greater understanding of the way in which wetlands are connected to the city's landscape and ultimately aid to improve wetland-related conservation and management decisions within the City of St. John's.

TI  - Wetland changes in the Amur River Basin: Differing trends and proximate causes on the Chinese and Russian sides
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - According to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), understanding the extent of wetlands, their change trends and the proximate causes is important for the conservation of wetlands and endangered waterfowls. Here we studied the world's ninth largest river basin, the Amur River Basin (ARB), with a land area of 2.08 million km(2). Our objectives were to address the information deficiencies of spatially explicit wetland distributions and their changes and to quantify the proximate causes of these changes in various periods in the ARB. A hybrid approach combining object-based and hierarchical decision-trees classification (HOHC) was applied to Landsat series images to obtain multitemporal land cover datasets from 1980 to 2016. Further quantitative analysis revealed that the ARB held 184,561 km(2) of wetlands in 2016, accounting for 9% of the whole basin area. Among these, 59% of the wetlands were identified on the Russian side, while 40% were on the Chinese side, and 1% were on the Mongolian side. The ARB lost 22% of its wetland (52,246 km2) from 1980 to 2016, with a consistent net loss from 1980 to 2010 but an area gain from 2010 to 2016. Human activities dominated the consistent wetland losses on the Chinese side of the ARB, of which cropland expansion was the primary proximate cause of wetland loss (69%). Conversely, the wetlands on the Russian side had consistent losses from 1980 to 2010 followed by a gain from 2010 to 2016, which could be attributed to climate change. These quantified data will inform decision-making on wetland conservation and benefit scientific studies depending on spatially explicit wetland information.

TI  - Temporal record and spatial distribution of fire foci in State of Minas Gerais, Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The objectives of this study are: (i) to evaluate the space-temporal variability of fire foci by environmental satellites, CHIRPS and remote sensing products based on applied statistics, and (ii) to identify the relational pattern between the distribution of fire foci and the environmental, meteorological, and socioeconomic variables in the mesoregions of Minas Gerais (MG) - Brazil. This study used a time series of fire foci from 1998 to 2015 via BDQueimadas. The temporal record of fire foci was evaluated by Mann-Kendall (MK), Pettitt (P), Shapiro-Wilk (SW), and Bartlett (B) tests. The spatial distribution by burned area (MCD64A1-MODIS) and the Kernel density - (radius 20 km) were estimated. The environmental variables analyzed were: rainfall (mm) and maximum temperature (degrees C), besides proxies to vegetation canopy: NDVI, SAVI, and EVI. PCA was applied to explain the interaction between fire foci and demographic, environmental, and geographical variables for MG. The MK test indicated a significant increasing trend in fire foci in MG. The SW and B tests were significant for non-normality and homogeneity of data. The P test pointed to abrupt changes in the 2001 and 2002 cycles (El Nino and La Nina moderated), which contributes to the annual increase and in winter and spring, which is identified by the Kernel density maps. Burned areas highlighted the northern and northwestern regions of MG, Triangulo Mineiro, Jequitinhonha, and South/Southwest MG, in the 3rd quarter (increased 17%) and the 4th quarter (increased 88%). The PCA resulted in three PCs that explained 71.49% of the total variation. The SAVI was the variable that stood out, with 11.12% of the total variation, followed by Belo Horizonte, the most representative in MG. We emphasize that the applied conceptual theoretical model defined here can act in the environmental management of fire risk. However, public policies should follow the technical-scientific guidelines in the mitigation of the resulting socioeconomic - environmental damages.

TI  - Reliability of visual detections of cirrus over Poland
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth is a cloudy planet-at every moment, 62-72% of the planet is covered by cloud. Its presence and properties affect the flow of energy between the sun, Earth and the atmosphere. More comprehensive information about cloudiness is important to improve our understanding of the impact of cloud on Earth's radiation budget. The aim of our work is to assess the accuracy of ground-based high-level cloud detections over Poland compared with satellite data. This project is the very first evaluation of error in visual high-cloud observation. Specifically, we answer a fundamental question: how effective are ground-based observers in detecting high-level cloud? Our unprecedented analysis is based on two datasets: traditional, visual observations from 43 selected synoptic stations and satellite (lidar) data, for the years 2006-2017. Ground-based observations were obtained from the archives of the Polish National Weather Service (IMWM-NRI), while satellite data came from the CALIPSO mission. Our final dataset comprised 7548 ground-based and satellite observations. Accuracy was assessed using the following indicators: probability of detection (Pd), probability of false alarm (Pfa), and overall accuracy (ACC). Overall (day and night observations), in the absence of lower-level cloud, observers correctly detected 80% of high-level cloud. However, when lower-level cloud was present, observers could not detect around 70% of high-level cloud. In sum, ground-based, high-level cloud detection is a function of the presence of lower-level cloud, the time of day, and the size of the area over which cirrus are observed/detected.

TI  - Integrating machine learning with Markov chain and cellular automata models for modelling urban land use change
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Modelling urban land use change is of profound concern to environmental scientists who have found cellular automata models very attractive for simulating urban dynamics. The quest for suitable predictive models to improve realistic simulation of urban land use change has resulted in the use of several notable cellular automata calibrations. Cellular automata model has become very attractive and one of the strongest models for urban growth simulation due to its simplicity and possibility of evolution. However, the inability of cellular automata to include driving forces of urban growth in the simulation process has warranted further cellular automata calibrations to minimize this weakness. To address this problem, and contrary to previous cellular automata calibrations, this research presents a novel integration of support vector machine, Markov chain and cellular automata for urban change modelling. Support vector machine is introduced as a machine learning technique to mine the impact of the explanatory variables that drive urban change. Markov chain is employed to mine the urban transition probabilities between the various urban epochs while cellular automata are used to implement the incremental discrete time steps based on neighbourhood interaction from an initial time to a future time. This modelling is implemented using Landsat data acquired in 1984, 2000 and 2015 over Lagos in Nigeria, Africa's most populous city. Urban transitions (1984-2000 and 2000-2015) are used to simulate future urban state in 2030 and validation metrics include McNemar's test. The introduction of stochasticity into the model helps create the typical randomness inherent in the real world for deriving future urban forms through discrete cellular automata iterations. The high accuracy obtained in this experiment implies a substantial fit between the predicted and reference data. This outcome proves the robustness of this method for modelling urban change.

M3  - Article
AB  - Using integrated Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) datasets (Envisat: 2003-2009; Sentinel-1: 2014-2018), local gravity surveys, and passive seismic data, we investigated the environmental hazards associated with the rise of the Miocene Jazan salt diapir (JZD; ~ 2 km(2)) within Jazan city, Saudi Arabia, and identified areas at risk in its immediate surroundings. Our findings include (1) the JZD outcrop and its northern, southern and western bordering areas have been undergoing substantial uplift (up to 4.7 mm/yr), whereas the sabkhas to the east are witnessing subsidence (up to - 7.5 mm/yr); (2) a low Bouguer anomaly (7.5 mGal) was observed over the JZD relative to its surroundings (8.5-12 mGal) with the steepest gradient along its eastern side; (3) strong and clear horizontal/vertical (H/V) spectral ratio peak and high frequency (5-10 Hz) over the JZD outcrop and areas proximal to its western margin, but areas to the east have a weak H/V peak and low frequency (1.5-3 Hz); (4) drilling confirmed presence of a shallow (4 m) salt bedrock layer west of the JZD and the absence of this layer to its east (up to depths of 60 m); (5) uplift patterns along the diapir margins are indicative of near-vertical contact along the JZD eastern margin and less steep contacts along the remaining margins; and (6) additional near-surface diapirs could potentially be identified in the vicinity of the JZD using our integrated approach.

TI  - Socio-economic and environmental impacts of COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan-an integrated analysis
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has affected about 210 countries with more than 67 million confirmed cases and over 1.5 million deaths across the globe including Pakistan. Considering the population density, health care capacity, existing poverty and environmental factors with more than 420,000 infected people and about 8300 plus mortalities, community transmission of the coronavirus happened rapidly in Pakistan. This paper analyses the short- and long-term effects of COVID-19 peak on the socio-economic and environmental aspects of Pakistan. According to the estimates, an economic loss of about 10%, i.e. 1.1 trillion PKR, will be observed in the FY 2021. Certain pandemic impediment measures like lockdowns, social distancing and travel restrictions taken by the Government have been thoroughly analysed to determine how they impacted the livelihoods of nearly 7.15 million workers. Consequently, a rise of 33.7% of poverty level is projected. While many negative impacts on primary, secondary and tertiary sectors of the economy such as agriculture, education and health care are observed, a drastic improvement in air quality index of urban centres of the country has been recorded amid lockdowns. With current economic crisis, fragile health care system and critical health literacy, a well-managed and coordinated action plan is required from all segments of the society led by the public authorities. Thorough assessment of COVID-19 scenario, management and control measures presented in this study can be assistive for the provision of policy guidelines to governments and think tanks of countries with similar socio-economic and cultural structure.

TI  - "Assessing the key drivers of stream network configuration dynamics for tectonically active drainage basins using multitemporal satellite imagery and statistical analyses"
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - A comprehensive integrated framework was designed to categorize individual streams and watersheds based on their temporal variation, and to determine the key drivers controlling watershed hydrology in the Qorveh-Dehgolan Basin. Four stream networks were extracted from multi-temporal Pan-Sharpened Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 imageries. Nineteen geomorphometric indices are measured and classified into the linear aspect, aerial aspect, and relief aspect. The results revealed a significant decline in stream networks from 2000 to 2017, reducing basin order. The factor analysis identified three principal factors including 'factor of basin magnitude' (affecting low-altitude watersheds), 'factor of steepness' (influencing high-altitude watersheds), and 'factor of texture'. The focal mechanism highlighted the complex fault mechanisms in the study area. Finally, RadViz clustering showed that for the lower order streams in the high-altitudes watersheds, stream width showed higher temporal variability in comparison to other parameters. In contrast, flow accumulation showed high variance in higher-order streams.

TI  - Risk of Psychiatric Adverse Events Among Montelukast Users
T2  - JOURNAL OF ALLERGY AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY-IN PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: There have been conflicting results from observational studies regarding the risk of psychiatric adverse events (PAEs) with montelukast use.OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there are associations of depressive disorders, self-harm, and suicide with use of montelukast compared with inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) use.METHODS: Using data from the Sentinel Distributed Database from January 1, 2000, to September 30, 2015, patients (n = 457,377) exposed to montelukast or ICS, aged 6 years and older with a diagnosis of asthma, were matched 1:1 on propensity scores. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were estimated for each study outcome overall and by age, sex, psychiatric history, and pre-/post-2008 labeling updates using Cox proportional hazards regression models.RESULTS: Exposure to montelukast was associated with a lower risk of treated outpatient depressive disorder (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.89-0.93). No increased risks of inpatient depressive disorder (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.90-1.24), self-harm (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.69-1.21), or self-harm using a modified algorithm (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.63-1.05) were observed with montelukast use compared with ICS use. Most PAEs occurred in the roughly one-third of patients having a past psychiatric history.CONCLUSIONS: When compared with use of ICS, we did not find associations between montelukast use and hospitalizations for depression or self-harm events. Our findings should be interpreted considering the study's limitations. Psychiatric comorbidity was common, and most PAEs occurred in patients with a past psychiatric history.

TI  - Early warning of infectious disease outbreaks on cattle-transport networks
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Surveillance of infectious diseases in livestock is traditionally carried out at the farms, which are the typical units of epidemiological investigations and interventions. In Central and Western Europe, high-quality, long-term time series of animal transports have become available and this opens the possibility to new approaches like sentinel surveillance. By comparing a sentinel surveillance scheme based on markets to one based on farms, the primary aim of this paper is to identify the smallest set of sentinel holdings that would reliably and timely detect emergent disease outbreaks in Swiss cattle. Using a data-driven approach, we simulate the spread of infectious diseases according to the reported or available daily cattle transport data in Switzerland over a four year period. Investigating the efficiency of surveillance at either market or farm level, we find that the most efficient early warning surveillance system [the smallest set of sentinels that timely and reliably detect outbreaks (small outbreaks at detection, short detection delays)] would be based on the former, rather than the latter. We show that a detection probability of 86% can be achieved by monitoring all 137 markets in the network. Additional 250 farm sentinels-selected according to their risk-need to be placed under surveillance so that the probability of first hitting one of these farm sentinels is at least as high as the probability of first hitting a market. Combining all markets and 1000 farms with highest risk of infection, these two levels together will lead to a detection probability of 99%. We conclude that the design of animal surveillance systems greatly benefits from the use of the existing abundant and detailed animal transport data especially in the case of highly dynamic cattle transport networks. Sentinel surveillance approaches can be tailored to complement existing farm risk-based and syndromic surveillance approaches.

TI  - Prevalence of Physician-Reported Food Allergy in Canadian Children
T2  - JOURNAL OF ALLERGY AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY-IN PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Food allergy prevalence data have largely been derived from self-report, and estimates vary.OBJECTIVE: Determine the prevalence of physician-reported food allergy in children using electronic medical record data from the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPSSN).METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study using the CPCSSN repository, Canada's only primary care practice -based surveillance system. Machine learning algorithms were applied to assess for food allergy documentation. Demographic information, chronic diseases of interest, prescribed medications, and health behaviors from the CPCSSN repository were identified.RESULTS: The prevalence of physician-reported food allergy in Canadian children was 2.53% (95% CI, 2.48%-2.59%). The most common food allergies documented were peanut (0.8% of children), tree nut (0.6%), cow's milk (0.4%), egg (0.3%), fruit (0.2%), finned fish (0.2%), and shellfish (0.2%). Among children with food allergy, only 33.7% had an epinephrine autoinjector prescription. In logistic regression analysis, children with food allergy were more likely to have an atopic comorbidity (odds ratio [OR], 2.20; 95% CI, 2.06-2.35) and less likely to be obese than children without food allergies (OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.780.90). In the ageand sex-adjusted models, patients with food allergy were significantly more likely to have a psychiatric morbidity, specifically: attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (OR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.66-1.96), autism (OR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.632.19), and depression (OR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.02-1.35).CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first to estimate national physician-reported prevalence of food allergy, and demonstrates a lower rate than that based on self-report. Further studies into the association of food allergy and psychiatric comorbidities (attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism, depression) and the association of food allergy and obesity are needed.

T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and has resulted in an ongoing pandemic. As of 5 July 2020, more than 11.1 million cases have been reported across 188 countries and territories, resulting in more than 528,000 deaths. More than 6.03 million people have recovered. The entire world population currently faces enormous challenges (i.e., social, environmental, health, and economic) due to the impact of COVID-19. In this regard, the affected countries are now trying to slow down the virus's transmission through social-distancing, lockdowns, increasing the number of tests and treatment facilities. There have been four lockdowns (25 March 2020-31 May 2020), and two unlock periods (1 June-31 July 2020) in India. Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) has been analyzed using MODIS satellite data during various phases of lockdowns over India. With the implementation of lockdown steps, AOD values dropped significantly over various regions. A significant reduction in AOD over the North-Central regions (up to -50%) compared to the regions in the South or Northeast India. The AOD over these regions was significantly affected by the lock/unlock phases. It was also observed that there was a considerable buildup of AOD during the pre-lockdown period in the year 2020 as compared to the past two years.

TI  - Simulating the Expansion of Built-Up Areas using the Models of Logistic Regression, Artificial Neural Network, and Geo-Mod in Marivan City, Iran
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding and modeling land use and land cover changes are critically important subjects for the purposes of environmental management, planning, and civil engineering. Models are considered as good approaches for having better estimation or understanding of the phenomenon of land use, land cover changes, thoughtful planning, and alteration in better management of cities and villages. Therefore, this study was conducted to analyze and compare the three models of logistic regression, ANNs, and Geo-Mod in predicting the expansion of built-up areas in a 10-year period in Marivan city, Iran. For this purpose, land cover maps at different times were prepared using Landsat data, including the images of the TM sensor of Landsat 5 in 1989, the ETM+ sensor of Landsat 7 in 2000, and the TM sensor of Landsat 5 in 2011. According to the results, during the period from 1989 to 2011, the built-up area of land cover has been multiplied by 2.74 (73.63 ha/year), which is equal to 1296 ha in 2011 compared to 459 ha in 1989. According to the results, logistic regression has been the preferred method in modeling changes to built-up areas among the presented methods. In addition, one of the advantages of logistic regression is to determine the relationship between variables and changes to the built-up areas. Although Geo-Mod yielded poorer results than the other two methods, its advantages of the neighborhood rule and the maximum use of available data should not be disregarded.

TI  - Extrapolating canopy phenology information using Sentinel-2 data and the Google Earth Engine platform to identify the optimal dates for remotely sensed image acquisition of semiarid mangroves
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuum monitoring of mangrove ecosystems is required to maintain and improve upon national mangrove conservation strategies. In particular, mangrove canopy assessments using remote sensing methods can be undertaken rapidly and, if freely available, optimize costs. Although such spaceborne data have been used for such purposes, their application to map mangroves at the species level has been limited by the capacity to provide continuous data. The objective of this study was to assess mangrove seasonal patterns using seven multispectral vegetation indices based on a Sentinel-2 (S2) time series (July 2018 to October 2019) to assess phenological trajectories of various semiarid mangrove classes in the Google Earth Engine platform using Fourier analysis for an area located in Western Mexico. The results indicate that the months from November through December and from May through July were critical in mangrove species discrimination using the EVI2, NDVI, and VARI series. The Random Forest classification accuracy for the S2 image was calculated at 79% during the optimal acquisition period (June 25, 2019), whereas only 55% accuracy was calculated for the non-optimal image acquired date (March 2, 2019). Although mangroves are considered evergreen forests, the phenological pattern of various mangrove canopies, based on these indices, were shown to be very similar to the surrounding land-based semiarid deciduous forest. Consequently, it is believed that the rainfall pattern is likely to be the key environmental factor driving mangrove phenology in this semiarid coastal system and thus the degree of success in mangrove remote sensing classification endeavors. Identifying the optimal dates when canopy spectral conditions are ideal in achieving mangrove species discrimination could be of utmost importance when purchasing more expensive very-high spatial resolution satellite images or collecting spatial data from UAVs.

TI  - RADARSAT-2 Derived Glacier Velocities and Dynamic Discharge Estimates for the Canadian High Arctic: 2015-2020
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - RADARSAT-2 imagery collected each winter from 2015/2016 to 2019/2020 is used to quantify and characterize the variability in the motion of, and the discharge from, the major marine-terminating ice masses of the Queen Elizabeth Islands (QEI: Devon, Ellesmere and Axel Heiberg Islands) in the Canadian High Arctic. The majority of the glaciers did not experience significant variations in flow speeds over the observation period, and for most that did the variations are attributed to pulse and surge processes. However, there are exceptions where the velocity record indicates continued acceleration of the glaciers by processes that appear distinct from surging or pulsing, such as dynamic thinning. These include Trinity and Wykeham glaciers (Prince of Wales Icefield) and Belcher Glacier (Devon Ice Cap). The combination of surface velocities with ice thicknesses indicates that average ice discharge to the ocean for the QEI over the observation period was 2.78 +/- 0.52 Gt a(-1) (ranging between similar to 2.37 +/- 0.48 Gt a(-1) and similar to 3.20 +/- 0.55 Gt a(-1)), similar to 50% of which was channeled through the Trinity-Wykeham glacier basin alone. The results presented here, combined with those of previous studies, provide a comprehensive record of ice motion and discharge from the QEI between 2008 and 2020.

TI  - Landscape service flow dynamics in the metropolitan area of Cordoba (Argentina)
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Human decisions, policies, and management strategies play an important role in structuring landscape patterns in a metropolitan area. Land-use/land-cover (LULC) changes can be considered probably the most important factor affecting the environment and the maintenance of landscape service flow. In particular, processes such as agricultural intensification, deforestation, urbanization and industrialization affect landscape heterogeneity in terms of composition and configuration. However, the multifunctional aspect of LULC as well as traditional agricultural practices can contribute to the maintenance of landscape service flow. This research aims to analyze and assess: (1) LULC dynamics and change from 1988 to 2019 within the metropolitan area of Cordoba (Argentina); (2) the effect of this change on landscape composition and configuration; (3) the flow of landscape services from 1988 to 2019, with the identification of hot-spots of landscape service provision. To analyze LULC dynamics and change within the study area, three Landsat images were utilized, while change detection analysis has been performed to identify the areas most affected by changes, the spatial distribution of change and the change trajectories of LULC classes in terms of landscape composition and configuration. Finally, the valuation of landscape service flow has been carried out by placing an economic value on the LULC classes, through the use of proxies. LULC pattern change has resulted in the expansion of extensive agriculture. The total variation from 1988 to 2019 has highlighted a significant reduction of Horticulture, Forests, and Grasslands, which have been converted into other classes (Urban and Extensive Agriculture). This conversion of LULC classes has had profound effects on landscape service flow, which guarantees the well-being of local communities. This research has contributed to the knowledge of where the hot-spots of landscape service' provision are located by helping landscape managers to identify suitable local policies able to preserve them, thus avoiding their loss, and enhancing landscape integrity, functionality, and resilience.

TI  - Aerosol Optical Properties Measured Using a PAX in Central Asia from 2016 to 2019 and the Climatic and Environmental Outlooks
T2  - ACS EARTH AND SPACE CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol optical properties, including absorption and scattering coefficients (B-abs, and B-scat), extinction coefficient (B-ext), single scattering albedo (SSA), and so forth, are critical metrics to estimate the radiative balance of the atmosphere. However, their ground measurements are sparsely distributed in the world, where Central Asia is void in these measurements. We had been performing the measurements of AOPs and BC with a photoacoustic extinctiometer (PAX) in Jimunai, a border town of China neighboring Kazakhstan, Central Asia, from Aug 2016 to Apr 2019. This three-year study first reported statistically significant trends of B-abs, B-scat, B-ext, SSA, and derived concentrations of BC (Mann-Kendall trend test, p-value 0.05) in the Central-Asian area. B-abs and B-scat show increasing trends and SSA was decreasing determined by the greater increasing pace of B-abs than B-scat. Seasonal and diurnal variations of the AOPs were associated with climate shift and residents' commute activity, respectively. The difference in the magnitudes and trends of AOPs between the measurements and satellites' observations advise that more care should be invested when choosing remote-sensing data to represent the AOPs at a specific site. The increasing trend of derived BC concentrations is reflected in the deposition record of BC in a snowpit of the nearby Muz Taw glacier. We suppose that the dramatically increasing BC particles emitted from Jimunai are significant factors triggering the melting of the adjacent mountain glaciers. The outflow of dust from the neighboring Gurbantiinggiit Desert could occasionally invade into Jimunai and deteriorate the local air quality, as evidenced by a probable dust event captured by the PAX on Feb 15, 2018. Finally, we outlook the future perspectives of measurements in Jimunai as a long-standing station.

TI  - The comparison of the wisdom view in Chinese and Western cultures
T2  - CURRENT PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Wisdom views in different cultural contexts are closely connected with the corresponding culture's worldview. Some results are found by comparing the wisdom concepts in Chinese and Western cultures: Firstly, the early wisdom concepts, both in China and the West, contain the elements of intelligence and virtue. Whereas, from the Enlightenment to the Piagetian school, the western concept of wisdom has then shifted to the role of cognition and knowledge; By contrast, the traditional Chinese wisdom concept has been treating wisdom as a virtue. Modern Chinese and western wisdom psychologists are inclined to accept the wisdom meta-theory of "integration of intelligence and virtue". Secondly, both Chinese and the Western philosophy advocate using wisdom to solve real-life problems. Western thinkers focus on practical problems in the material world, i.e. reconciling conflicts between people and the world through understanding and changing the environment. However, Chinese philosophers focus on internal spiritual problems, i.e. improving the individual realm to solve the contradictions inside oneself. Thirdly, both China and the West highlight the comprehensive application of multiple thinking modes. While comparing with the west, which is excelled in using logical and analytical thinking modes and utilizing rational cognition, China is far better at using dialectical and holistic thinking modes and applying intuitive comprehension.

TI  - Comparative evaluation of drought indices for monitoring drought based on remote sensing data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Many indices are used to monitor drought events. However, different indices have different data requirements and applications. Hence, evaluating their applicability will help to characterize drought events and refine the development of effective drought indices. We constructed different drought indices based on multisource remote sensing data and comprehensively evaluated and compared their applicability for drought monitoring throughout China. The characteristics of drought events in 2009 and 2011 were compared using various drought indices. The different time scales of the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) were used to evaluate remote sensing drought indices in different regions. Single drought indices, including the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), the Temperature Condition Index (TCI) derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, the Precipitation Condition Index (PCI) derived from Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) data, and the TCI and Soil Moisture Condition Index (SMCI) derived from Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) data, as well as combined drought indices, including the Microwave Integrated Drought Index (MIDI), Optimized Vegetation Drought Index (OVDI), Optimized Meteorological Drought Index (OMDI), Scale Drought Conditions Index (SDCI), and Synthesized Drought Index (SDI), were analyzed and compared to evaluate their applicability. The results showed that different drought indices have specific characteristics under different land use types in China. The VCI and TCI can better monitor long-term drought conditions, but they have a weak correlation with the in situ drought index in forestland and grassland areas. The correlation of SPI-1 with the PCI is higher than that with other single indices, which indicates that the PCI is a good short-term drought index. The SMCI has a better correlation with the short-term in situ drought index, but it is not conducive to drought monitoring in areas such as densely forested land and grassland. The correlations of the in situ drought index with the combined drought indices (the MIDI, OVDI, OMDI, SDCI, and SDI) are better than those with the single drought indices.

TI  - Metaplastic carcinoma of the breast and <i>BRCA1</i> germline mutation: a case report and review
T2  - HEREDITARY CANCER IN CLINICAL PRACTICE
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Metaplastic carcinoma of the breast consists of both invasive ductal carcinoma and metaplastic carcinoma. This rare subtype of cancer has a poor prognosis. The development of metaplastic breast cancer and relationship with BRCA1 are not well known. Here, we report a rare case of germline BRCA1 mutation-positive breast cancer with chondroid metaplasia.Case presentation: A 39-year-old Japanese woman with a family history of breast cancer in her mother and ovarian cancer in her maternal grandmother consulted at our hospital with a left breast mass. Needle biopsy for the mass was performed, leading to a diagnosis of invasive breast cancer with chondroid metaplasia. We performed left mastectomy + sentinel lymph node biopsy + tissue expander insertion and replaced with a silicone implant later. Pathological examination revealed that the patient had triple-negative breast cancer. Four courses of doxorubicin+ cyclophosphamide therapy were performed as adjuvant therapy after surgery. We performed genetic counseling and genetic testing, and the results suggested the germline BRCA1 mutation 307 T> A (L63*). She has currently lived without a relapse for 2 years post-surgery.Conclusions: There have been only 6 cases of metaplastic breast carcinoma with germline BRCA1 mutations including our case. Patients with BRCA1 mutations may develop basal-like subtypes or M type of triple-negative breast cancer besides metaplastic breast cancers.

TI  - Remote sensing strategies to characterization of drought, vegetation dynamics in relation to climate change from 1983 to 2016 in Tibet and Xinjiang Province, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to various land cover changes, vegetation dynamics, and climate, drought is the most complex climate-related disaster problem in Tibet and Xinjiang, China. The purpose of the present study is to analyze the performance of the AVHRR Normalized Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the temporal and spatial differences of seasonal vegetation dynamics by correlating the results with rainfall and temperature data of NASA's MERRA to examine the vegetation dynamics and droughts in Tibet and the Xinjiang Province of China. Our method is based on the use of AVHRR NDVI data and NASA MERRA temperature and precipitation during 1983-2016. Due to the dryness and low vegetation, NDVI is more useful to describe the drought conditions in Tibet and Xinjiang of China. The NDVI, TCI, VHI, NVSWI, VCI, TVDI, and NAP from April to October increased rapidly. While the NDVI, TCI, VHI, NVSWI, NAP, TVDI, and VCI are stable every month in September, again improve in October, and then confirm downward trend in December. The NDVI, TCI, VHI, NVSWI, NAP, VCI, and TVDI monthly values indicate that Tibet and Xinjiang province of China suffered from severe drought in 2006, 2008, and 2012 which were the most drought years. For monitoring drought in Tibet and Xinjiang province of China, the NDVI, TVDI, NAP, VCI, and NVSWI values were selected as a tool for reporting drought events during different growing seasons. Seasonal values of TVDI, NDVI, NAP, NVSWI, and VCI confirmed that Tibet and Xinjiang province of China suffered from severe drought in 2006, 2008, and 2012 and led the durations of severe drought. The correlation between NDVI, TCI, VHI, NAP, TVDI, and VCI showed a significantly positive correlation, while the significantly negative correlation between NVSWI and NDVI showed a good indication for the assessment of drought, especially for the agricultural regions of Tibet and Xinjiang province of China. This shows that the positive sign to support NAP, NVSWI, and TVDI is good monitoring of the drought indexes in Tibet and the Xinjiang province of China.

TI  - Two-step generation of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells from human pluripotent stem cells with reinforced efficacy upon osteoarthritis rabbits by HA hydrogel
T2  - CELL AND BIOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundCurrent studies have enlightened the rosy prospects of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) in regenerative medicine. However, systematic investigation of their signatures and applications with alternative biomaterials in osteoarthritis (OA) remains indistinct.MethodsHerein, we initially took advantage of a small molecule library-mediated programming strategy for hPSC-MSC induction. Then, with the aid of multifaceted analyses such as flow cytometry (FCM), chromosome karyocyte and cell vitality, wound healing and microtubule formation assay and coculturing with T lymphocytes, we systematically evaluated the characterizations of signatures in vitro and the in vivo efficacy of hPSC-MSCs and HA hydrogel composite on rabbit osteoarthritis model.ResultsWe found the combination of LLY-507 and AZD5153 was sufficient for high-efficiency CD73(+)CD90(+)CD105(+)CD31(-)CD34(-)CD45(-)HLA-DR- MSC induction from both hESCs and hiPSCs with stemness (POU5F1/SOX2/NANOG). The programmed hPSC-MSCs revealed conservative transcriptome variations and went through a heterogeneous intermediate-stage with mesenchymal-associated gene expression (NT5E, ENG, VIM and FN1) as well as displayed typical cytomorphology, immunophenotypes and normal karyotyping, multilineage differentiation potential, favorable cell vitality, proangiogenic and immunoregulatory properties in vitro. Meanwhile, the cell population exhibited preferable restorative and ameliorative function on OA rabbits with HA hydrogel in vivo.ConclusionsCollectively, we established a rapid and convenient procedure for hPSC-MSC generation without redundant manipulations. The fundamental and clinical studies upon osteoarthritis (OA) treatment would benefit tremendously from the combination of the inexhaustible hPSC-MSCs and advantageous biomaterials.

AB  - Multilingualism is considered a pathway to European identification but might also undermine national identification. We examine regular foreign language usage and two psychological constructs that can explain the relationship between multilingualism and European and national identification in the Netherlands: greater mental openness and a deprovincialized worldview. Using structural equation modeling, the results of two studies conducted with national Dutch samples show that foreign language usage predicted greater mental openness (cultural in Study 1, and cognitive in Study 2), which then predicted greater European identification. Foreign language usage also predicted greater deprovincialization which, in turn, predicted lower national identification.

TI  - Assessment of Snow Depth over Arctic Sea Ice in CMIP6 Models Using Satellite Data
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow depth over sea ice is an essential variable for understanding the Arctic energy budget. In this study, we evaluate snow depth over Arctic sea ice during 1993-2014 simulated by 31 models from phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) against recent satellite retrievals. The CMIP6 models capture some aspects of the observed snow depth climatology and variability. The observed variability lies in the middle of the models' simulations. All the models show negative trends of snow depth during 1993-2014. However, substantial spatiotemporal discrepancies are identified. Compared to the observation, most models have late seasonal maximum snow depth (by two months), remarkably thinner snow for the seasonal minimum, an incorrect transition from the growth to decay period, and a greatly underestimated interannual variability and thinning trend of snow depth over areas with frequent occurrence of multi-year sea ice. Most models are unable to reproduce the observed snow depth gradient from the Canadian Arctic to the outer areas and the largest thinning rate in the central Arctic. Future projections suggest that snow depth in the Arctic will continue to decrease from 2015 to 2099. Under the SSP5-8.5 scenario, the Arctic will be almost snow-free during the summer and fall and the accumulation of snow starts from January. Further investigation into the possible causes of the issues for the simulated snow depth by some models based on the same family of models suggests that resolution, the inclusion of a high-top atmospheric model, and biogeochemistry processes are important factors for snow depth simulation.

TI  - Possibility of using multiscale normalized difference vegetation index data for the assessment of total suspended solids (TSS) concentrations in surface water: A specific case of scale issues in remote sensing
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The degradation of watersheds creates immense pressure on water quality, especially in arid and semiarid regions. Total suspended solids (TSS) provide essential information to water environmental quality assessments. However, the calibration of direct retrieval models requires complicated preparations and further increases uncertainties. Here, we hypothesized that a common remote sensing index (NDVI, normalized difference vegetation index) could be used to estimate TSS concentrations in water due to the effects of canopy cover. To address this hypothesis, we collected 65 water samples from the Ebinur Lake Watershed, northwest China, to investigate the potential relationships between TSS concentrations and Sentinel-2-based NDVI at various scales (100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 m). Subsequently, we established a classical measurement error (CME) model for the estimation of TSS concentrations. The results showed that TSS concentration is negatively related to the NDVI value at all buffer distances. The 300 m scale mean NDVI value showed the most effective explanation of the variations in TSS concentrations (R-2 = 0.83, P-value < 0.001), which indicated that the TSS concentration can be assessed by NDVI. The CME model showed that NDVI values played an important role in the assessment of TSS concentrations in surface water. Furthermore, the results of both leave-one-out cross-validation and the accuracy measure suggested that this specific method is satisfactory. Compared with previous statistical and field monitoring results, the proposed method is promising for cost-effective monitoring of TSS concentrations in water, especially in data-poor watersheds. This specific method may provide the basis for the conservation and management of nonpoint source pollution in arid regions.

TI  - Sentinel-1 based soil freeze/thaw estimation in boreal forest environments
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A method for the retrieval of soil freeze/thaw (F/T) state in the boreal forest region using SAR is presented in this paper. The method utilizes Sentinel-1 data and is thus suitable for continuous near real-time monitoring. The main challenge with the C-band VV-polarization signal is the sensitivity to vegetation and especially to forest canopies. A relatively simple zeroth-order model is used for the retrieval of the ground and the canopy backscatter contributions in 1 km cell size. These backscatter components are then used to identify the F/T state of the soil by comparing them to corresponding reference values representing frozen and thawed conditions. The classification algorithm is based on threshold values applied on the Euclidian distances between the retrieved backscatter and the reference values. The method is tested for three test areas across Finland, having different forest properties: Sodankyla, Nurmes and Tampere, located in northern, central and southern Finland, respectively. We first evaluated whether the use of canopy cover (CC) or stem volume (SV) as the parameter describing the forest conditions provide better model accuracy. We then assessed the Sentinel-1 based soil F/T estimates by comparing them to automatic in situ observations and the SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) based soil F/T product. The model performance was generally better when SV was used as the forest parameter. Nevertheless, for both CC and SV, the RMSE between the modeled and the observed backscatter was considerably lower than the seasonal variation of the backscatter. In Sodankyla and Nurmes, the Sentinel-1 based F/T estimates were well in line with the in situ observations and the SMOS F/T product. The Sentinel-1 retrievals measuring the top soil layer were fast to react to air temperature changes between negative and positive Celsius degrees, showing similarity of 94-99% with the air temperature measurements. In Tampere the method showed weaker results; the similarity with the air temperature observations was 64%. Overall, a correct vertical freezing pattern of the soil was demonstrated in this study, with Sentinel-1 sensitive to the top soil layer, in situ sensors measuring at 5 cm depth, and SMOS reaching to 5-15 cm soil depth. Additional assessment should be conducted in southern Finland.

T2  - SCIENTOMETRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - A combination of bibliometric and science mapping methods was carried out to explore characteristics of scientific production on the application of orbital remote sensing in fire ecology. The performance analyzes made it possible to identify the main actors responsible for the knowledge (authors, institutions and countries) and the journals selected for dissemination. Through co-occurrence and co-authorship networks we analyze the temporal evolution of knowledge, analyzing the emergence of themes and research methods, in addition to the pattern of interaction between the main actors involved. The research universe consisted of articles published in indexed journals at Scopus. Of the 2602 initial articles identified, 1977 articles were selected and a subsample of 1832 was selected for the period 2000-2019. As a result, we found that the production of articles started in 1973 and increased over time, with great expansion from 2000s, when different themes, tools and techniques were identified. Corroborating these results, we observed keywords networks more complex and richer in themes, tools and techniques in the period 2000-2019. On the topics surveyed, in the most recent period, there was a greater frequency of subjects such as risk, regime, history and severity. These topics are generally investigated based on data on active fire and global burnt area, which is why the articles most cited in the literature mostly dealt with techniques for obtaining these estimates. Regarding those responsible for research, we demonstrate that although scientific knowledge is concentrated in a few geographical centers and institutions, there are high scientific partnerships and cooperation.

TI  - Landsat-based detection of mast events in white spruce (<i>Picea glauca</i>) forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mast seeding in conifers is characterized by the spatially synchronous and temporally variable production of seed cone crops. Large mast seeding events (known as "mast years") can be a visually stunning and ecologically important phenomenon, supporting trophic interactions and survival of seed predators as well as forest regeneration. Documenting patterns in mast seeding is generally labor-intensive, requiring repeated visual cone counts at consistent and widespread locations over long periods to quantify the spatiotemporal variability of cone production. Our goal in this work was to evaluate the correspondence of multispectral vegetation indexes (VIs) from Landsat with ground-based observations of mast seeding in white spruce (Picea glauca) forests of the Kluane region, Yukon, Canada. Given the visual characteristics of mast seeding in white spruce, we tested: 1) whether photosynthesis- and color-oriented VIs can identify senescence of spruce cones in late summer and autumn during mast years, and 2) if moisture-oriented VIs can distinguish the significant drying of seed cones from the surrounding spruce canopy vegetation during that senescence and after seeds are released. We hypothesized that the slope of late season decline in VIs in spruce forests would be related to masting (Le., greater decline in VI during mast years). Using generalized linear mixed-effects modeling (GLMM), we compared more than 100 site-year combinations of mast/non-mast observations to develop VI-based regressions. We found some success identifying mast years with moisture-oriented VIs, while models using the photosynthesis- and color-oriented VIs were not supported, given the data. However, we found that models containing multiple VIs from both categories were more successful than any single-VI model, accurately predicting four of sixteen mast events in site observations. We provide compelling evidence that mast-seeding patterns may be detectable using moisture-oriented Landsat observations over large coniferous forest areas. Additional work is warranted to distinguish the signal for mast events from confounding disturbance-related effects and to differentiate variation in VI signals attributable to masting productivity in contrast to effects of climatological variability on reflectance.

TI  - Applications of soft computing models for predicting sea surface temperature: a comprehensive review and assessment
T2  - PROGRESS IN EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - The application of soft computing (SC) models for predicting environmental variables is widely gaining popularity, because of their capability to describe complex non-linear processes. The sea surface temperature (SST) is a key quantity in the analysis of sea and ocean systems, due to its relation with water quality, organisms, and hydrological events such as droughts and floods. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the SC model applications for estimating SST over the last two decades. Types of model (based on artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic, or other SC techniques), input variables, data sources, and performance indices are discussed. Existing trends of research in this field are identified, and possible directions for future investigation are suggested.

TI  - An Exploratory Study of the Impact of Adoption on Adoptive Siblings
T2  - JOURNAL OF CHILD AND FAMILY STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - There is extensive literature on the effects of early-life trauma in children who are adopted, but limited research on the effects this early-life trauma may have on the other members of the adoptive family system. This qualitative study explored the experience of adoptive siblings, defined as biological children in families who adopt children, and the impact adoption has had on them. A sample of 182 adult adoptive siblings, aged 18-64 years, were surveyed retrospectively about their experience in their families from pre-adoption to post-adoption. Through phenomenological qualitative analysis, responses were categorized based on pre-adoption, the initial adoption transition, and post-adoption. Results of this study indicated that adoptive siblings often felt invisible or resentful. Many adoptive siblings experienced parentification or took on the role of peacemaker in their families. The results also revealed that the impact of adoption for adoptive siblings can lead to personal growth, including empathy, compassion, and maturity, or mental health issues, including an inability to trust others, a jaded worldview, and posttraumatic symptoms. Further, many adoptive siblings decided to foster or adopt as adults or enter the child welfare profession. These results suggest that adoptive siblings are impacted by the experience of adoption in their families, and further, this may lead to long-term effects on their lives. Further research is needed to better understand what factors may be related to more positive or negative experiences with adoption, which could allow for a greater understanding of how to support this population from pre- to post-adoption.

TI  - Spatio-temporal analysis of the effects of biogas production on agricultural lands
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - With the subsidization of energy crops in Germany by the Renewable Energy Act, the production of biogas became increasingly dependent on agricultural land for biomass generation. The effects of increasing biogas plants' capacities on the increase of maize and other energy crops area over the years have raised sustainability concerns in the German society. A periodic assessment of the impacts of biomass production is necessary to determine efficient and environmentally sustainable recommendations for future planning processes. Previous studies have neglected the effects of biogas plant capacity, which is directly linked with the amount of biomass required and, thus, is supposed to be a driver for the impacts of biogas production on agricultural lands. Combining the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) and Landsat satellite data provides a means to study present and past agricultural landscape. The aim of the study was to map the agricultural lands of Northern Hesse from 2000 to 2015, evaluate the change in maize area and structural diversity (i.e. field edge density) of agricultural fields, and assess if biogas production is a major driver of possible changes. Northern Hesse was consciously chosen, as it represents a typical European low-mountain range region with substantial geographical and agricultural variability. Our results show that from 2000 to 2015 on average, the shares of grassland and summer crops areas decreased by 5.7 percentage points (p.p.) and 5.8 p.p., respectively, while the shares of winter crops and maize areas increased by 9.2 p.p. and 2.2 p.p., respectively. Potential drivers of the change in maize area and structural diversity of agricultural fields, such as the mean capacity of biogas plants (kW), and topographical attributes, such as mean elevation (m) and slope (%) were employed as explanatory variables on a municipality level in multiple linear regression models. The mean biogas capacity and elevation were the most significant drivers of change in maize area (p < 0.05), while biogas capacity and slope were the significant drivers of the change in structural diversity. Maize area increased with an increasing capacity of biogas plants at lower elevations of the study area (p < 0.05). A decrease in the structure of fields, which is an indicator for species and habitat diversity, was observed and this was very much associated with the extent of maize and winter crop production. However, the drivers of the changes in the maize area and structure of fields were of low dimensions with model R2 of 0.21 and 0.35 respectively. Overall, our study demonstrates the potential of spatial data from different origins in mapping land-cover over longer time periods for monitoring bioeconomy effects on agricultural landscape.

TI  - Aerosol optical depth (AOD): spatial and temporal variations and association with meteorological covariates in Taklimakan desert, China
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol optical depth (AOD) is a key parameter that reflects aerosol characteristics. However, research on the AOD of dust aerosols and various environmental variables is scarce. Therefore, we conducted in-depth studies on the distributions and variations of AOD in the Taklimakan Desert and its margins, China. We examined the correlation characteristics between AOD and meteorological factors combined with satellite remote sensing detection methods using MCD19A2-MODIS AOD products (from 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015), MOD13Q1-MODIS normalized difference vegetation index products, and meteorological data. We analyzed the temporal and spatial distributions of AOD, periodic change trends, and important impacts of meteorological factors on AOD in the Taklimakan Desert and its margins. To explore the relationships between desert aerosols and meteorological factors, a random forest model was used along with environmental variables to predict AOD and rank factor contributions. Results indicated that the monthly average AOD exhibited a clear unimodal curve that reached its maximum in April. The AOD values followed the order spring (0.28) > summer (0.27) > autumn (0.18) > winter (0.17). This seasonality is clear and can be related to the frequent sandstorms occurring in spring and early summer. Interannual AOD showed a gradually increasing trend to 2010 then large changes to 2015. AOD tends to increase from south to north. Based on the general trend, the maximum value of AOD is more dispersed and its low-value area is always stable. The climatic index that has the most significant effect on AOD is relative humidity.

TI  - A comprehensive evaluation of GPM-IMERG V06 and MRMS with hourly ground-based precipitation observations across Canada
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the performance of multiple high-resolution remotely sensed precipitation estimates at hourly and daily time scales over Canada for 2014-2018. Four products of the recently released Integrated Multi-satEllite Retrievals for Global precipitation measurement (IMERG-V06) and the Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor (MRMS) Precipitation Rate data are analyzed for different seasons. Evaluations are based on a suite of metrics to assess different characteristics of precipitation estimates using quality-controlled hourly gauge data considered as the truth. The results suggest that Calibrated precipitation (PrecipitationCal) outperforms the other IMERG products particularly over the Prairies and during fall and summer. Over the western and eastern coastal regions, IMERG tends to overestimate precipitation intensities by similar to 25%. The discrepancy between satellite and ground-based data is higher for more intense precipitation events. Further analyses indicate that while MRMS tends to overestimate the amount of precipitation, it outperforms the IMERG products based on several metrics, especially in detecting the occurrence of precipitation over the eastern coastal regions. Overall, the study of IMERG V06 and MRMS precipitation estimates at a relatively high temporal resolution indicates that both products have the potential to complement ground-based observations over Canada.

TI  - Detection of Alteration Zone with Multispectral ASTER Data in Ghabaghloujeh Gold Deposit (Kordestan, Iran)
T2  - IRANIAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY TRANSACTION A-SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ghabaghloujeh gold deposit is located in the Sanandaj-Sirjan Zone and is hosted by NE-trending ductile shear zones and younger brittle fractures. The hydrothermal alteration zones are fairly developed within and around the lenticular intrusive body. Since the vegetation coverage is low, multispectral remotely sensed data of ASTER employed to extract the alteration zones; which might vector mineralized zones with mapping of sericitization, chloritization, silicification, and ferrugination, which are product of the chemical interaction between the bedrock minerals and minerals of the solutions. Each alteration is characterized by significant minerals related to these kinds of alterations such as alunite (K/Na), muscovite, kaolinite, illite, chlorite, goethite, hematite, jarosite, calcite, and quartz. Spectral Angle Mapper was applied to map the distribution of hydrothermally altered rocks associated with the possible mineralization. The overall result and comparison with the extensive field works showed that the hyperspectral remotely sensed data are the best tool, and multispectral data are one of the best tools to map the altered rocks.

TI  - Merkel cell carcinoma
T2  - CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) of the skin is a rare, aggressive form of skin cancer that metastasizes to other parts of the body. This cutaneous neuroendocrine tumour mainly affects older people, with most cases generally occurring over the age of 50 years. Merkel cell polyomavirus has been shown to induce gene mutations resulting in this skin cancer, with immunosuppression and ultraviolet radiation being other key risk factors in its pathogenesis. MCC is clinically seen as a rapidly enlarging, isolated, irregular erythematous nodule typically found on sun-exposed sites. Diagnosis is through clinical examination followed by tissue biopsy, which demonstrates characteristic histopathological neuroendocrine features. Immunohistochemistry plays a crucial role in diagnosis with the characteristic perinuclear staining with cytokeratin-20 helping to differentiate it from other morphologically similar tumours. Sentinel lymph node biopsy and imaging is essential for staging and determining prognosis. Surgical excision is the mainstay of treatment for localized disease although adjuvant radiotherapy is often required. Metastatic disease involves a very poor prognosis, and immune checkpoint inhibitors have recently shown promise in the treatment of metastatic disease. Avelumab, a monoclonal antibody that binds to the programmed death-1 receptor, has been approved by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and shown encouraging survival outcomes. It provides an option for treating metastatic carcinoma in adults after they have failed >= 1 line of chemotherapy for metastatic disease.

TI  - A high speed roller dung beetles clustering algorithm and its architecture for real-time image segmentation
T2  - APPLIED INTELLIGENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Several practical applications like disaster detection, remote surveillance, object recognition using remote sensing satellite images, object monitoring and tracking using radar images etc. essentially require real-time image segmentation. In these applications computational complexity of the algorithm play a vital role along with accuracy. In this work image segmentation is dealt as a clustering problem and a bio-inspired algorithm based on the behavior of 'Roller Dung Beetles (RDB)' is proposed to determine effective solutions. The beauty of this proposed RDB Clustering architecture is its lower computational complexity O(N). The software implementation of the proposed algorithm is carried out in MATLAB environment and a hardware architecture is developed in Verilog HDL using Modelsim, Xilinx ISE for FPGA environment. The architecture has a comparison free sorting module, two data storage modules and a parallel threshold comparator unit, all of which use fewer mathematical operations. The performance of the proposed architecture is validated on many synthetic and standard benchmark color images. Further application of the proposed architecture is carried out for real-time segmentation of 8 NASA LANDSAT / ESA satellite images. Performance comparison has been carried out with other existing architectures based on Artificial Immune System (AIS), Genetic, K-means clustering, CNN etc. Simulation results reveal that the proposed RDBC architecture is 42% faster than the K-Means implementation with a clock frequency of 230.52MHz with an increased PSNR of 6.825% and SSIM of 15.55%. Statistical analysis and silhouette index also confirms the superiority of new clustering architecture over existing implementations.Compared to CNN the RDBC architecture is economical both in terms of lower chip-area and power consumption.

T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid damage assessment of natural disasters is essential for the fast recovery and strategic post-disaster reconstructions. In the present study, National Polar-Orbiting Partnership Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP-VIIRS) day/night band (DNB)-extracted night-time lights (NTL) data were explored for damage assessment caused by extremely severe cyclonic storm 'AMPHAN' that struck one of the most populous regions in India. The disaster impact was measured on two parameters: population and crop land area, where NTL density and population density were found to be strongly correlated (r(2) > 0.8). From power outage intensity, three 'crisis zones' indicating the severity of cyclone damage were identified. Finally, the assessment found that the total affected population and crop land area were nearly 70% and 66%, respectively, of the study area. Therefore, NPP-VIIRS DNB image-based rapid damage assessment is potentially a useful tool for generating first hand information about the physical damages caused by extreme events.

T2  - SURGICAL CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) is a rare disorder of heme synthesis. Patients with EPP mainly show symptoms of photosensitivity, but approximately 20% of EPPs are associated with the liver-related complications. We report a case of breast cancer in a 48-year-old female patient with EPP in whom meticulous perioperative management was required in order to avoid complications resulting from this disease. Case presentation The patient was diagnosed with EPP at the age of 33 and had a rich family history of the disease. For right breast cancer initially considered as TisN0M0 (Stage 0), the right mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed, while the final stage was pT1bN0M0, pStage I. In the perioperative period, we limited the drug use and monitored light wavelength measurements. Besides, we covered surgical lights, headlights, and laryngoscope's light with a special polyimide film that filtered the wavelength of light causing dermal photosensitivity. After the surgery, any emerging complications were closely monitored. Conclusions The surgery, internal medicine, anesthesiology, and operation departments undertook all possible measures through close cooperation to ensure a safe surgery for the patient with a rare condition.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Desert dust transported from the Saharan-Sahel region to the Caribbean Sea is responsible for peak exposures of particulate matter (PM). This study explored the potential added value of satellite aerosol optical thickness (AOT) measurements, compared to the PM concentration at ground level, to retrospectively assess exposure during pregnancy. MAIAC MODIS AOT retrievals in blue band (AOT(470)) were extracted for the French Guadeloupe archipelago. AOT(470) values and PM10 concentrations were averaged over pregnancy for 906 women (2005-2008). Regression modeling was used to examine the AOT(470)-PM10 relationship during pregnancy and test the association between dust exposure estimates and preterm birth. Moderate agreement was shown between mean AOT(470) retrievals and PM10 ground-based measurements during pregnancy (R-2 = 0.289). The magnitude of the association between desert dust exposure and preterm birth tended to be lower using the satellite method compared to the monitor method. The latter remains an acceptable trade-off between epidemiological relevance and exposure misclassification, in areas with few monitoring stations and complex topographical/meteorological conditions, such as tropical islands.

TI  - The surgical treatment of non-metastatic melanoma in a Clinical National Melanoma Registry Study Group (CNMR): a retrospective cohort quality improvement study to reduce the morbidity rates
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Reproducible, high-quality surgery is a key point in the management of cancer patients. Quality indicators for surgical treatment of melanoma has been presented with benchmarks but data on morbidity are still limited. This study presents the quality indicators on morbidity after surgical treatment for non-metastatic skin melanoma in an Italian registry. Methods Data were extracted from the Central National Melanoma Registry (CNMR) promoted by the Italian Melanoma Intergroup (IMI). All surgical procedures (WE, SNLB or LFND) for non-metastatic skin melanoma between January 2011 and February 2017 were evaluated for inclusion in the study. Only centers with adequate completeness of information (> 80%) were included in the study. Short-term complications (wound infection, dehiscence, skin graft failure and seroma) were investigated. Results Wound infection rate was 1.1% (0.4 to 2.7%) in WE, 1.3% (0.7 to 2.5%) in SLNB and 4.1% (2.1 to 8.0%) in LFND. Wound dehiscence rate was 2.0% (0.8 to 5.1%) in WE, 0.9% (0.2 to 3.0%) in SLNB and 2.8% (0.9 to 8.6%) in LFND. Seroma rate was 4.2% (1.5 to 11.1%) in SLNB and 15.1% (4.6 to 39.9%) in LFND. Unreliable information was found on skin graft failure. Conclusions Our findings contribute to available literature in setting up the recommended standards for melanoma centers, thus improving the quality of surgery offered to patients. A consensus on the core issues around surgical morbidity is needed to provide practical guidance on morbidity prevention and management.

TI  - O-LCMapping: a Google Earth Engine-based web toolkit for supporting online land cover classification
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover classification is essential for environmental monitoring, sustainable development goals assessment and other fields. Traditionally, it often takes much time and labor costs to copy and pre-process remote sensing images for performing land cover classification with desktop software, which must be installed and licensed. Google Earth Engine (GEE), as a cloud computing platform, provides a large number of remote sensing images, geoprocessing algorithms and massive computational capabilities via web interfaces. However, GEE requires users to possess programming skills of JavaScript or Python language, which can hinder the enthusiasm of many academics without programming skills. This paper developed a web-based and open-access toolkit O-LCMapping for supporting online land cover classification. This toolkit was implemented with JavaScript application programming interfaces of GEE and integrated ten imagery classification algorithms. The toolkit explicitly provides the entire pipeline of land cover classification in the form of user interfaces for end-users with basic knowledge of remote sensing but little programming skills. Concretely, it enables end-users to define study area, select remote sensing data, mark classification samples, set classification algorithms, evaluate accuracy and output results through user interfaces. Three different experimental cases indicate that the toolkit can be easily applied to different fields for various applications of land cover classification.

TI  - Combined toxic effects of dioxin-like PCB77 with Fe-based nanoparticles in earthworm <i>Eisenia fetida</i>
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Iron-based nanomaterials hold promise for in situ remediation of persistent halogenated contaminants such as dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls, however, their complex interactions and joint toxicity toward beneficial soil biological functions remain unknown. This study examined the effects of nano-zero valent iron (nZVI) on the physiological and morphological changes, on the bioaccumulation of co-existed dioxin-like 3,3',4,4'-tetrachloro-biphenyls (PCB77), and the joint toxicity of nZVI and PCB77 in earthworms Eisenia fetida. An orthogonally designed experiment was conducted through the exposure of E. fetida to the combined and separate nZVI and PCB77 at various concentrations in soil for 28 days (nZVI at the levels of g-Fe/kg-soil and PCB77 at the levels of mg-PCB/kg-soil). Results indicated that both nZVI and PCB77 inhibited the growth and reproduction of earthworms, and the combined exposure resulted in a synergistic effect. The addition of 10 g/kg nZVI decreased the contents of PCB77 and significantly increased the accumulation of PCB77 to a level ranging 14-97 mg/kg in earthworms in a nZVI dose dependent manner. The observed synergism might relate to the aggravated damage of earthworm epidermis in the presence of nZVI. PCB77 and nZVI at their corresponding high levels (10 mg/kg and 10 g/kg) induced oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation in the earthworms through the increased levels of reactive oxygen species and the subsequent inhibition of antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase and catalase. Further metabolomics analyses revealed that the normal glutamic acid metabolism and tricarboxylic acid cycle were disturbed in earthworms exposed to the combined treatment of 10 mg/kg PCB77 and 10 g/kg nZVI. Our findings suggested that earthworms as a sentinel species could be readily employed in toxicity and tolerance studies to succeed the safe applications of nZVI and interestingly earthworms themselves also hold promise for vermiremediation owing to the high bioaccumulation potential of PCBs from contaminated soils.

TI  - Development of an Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) aerosol index (AI) data assimilation scheme for aerosol modeling over bright surfaces - a step toward direct radiance assimilation in the UV spectrum
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Using the Vector LInearized Discrete Ordinate Radiative Transfer (VLIDORT) code as the main driver for forward model simulations, a first-of-its-kind data assimilation scheme has been developed for assimilating Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) aerosol index (AI) measurements into the Naval Aerosol Analysis and Predictive System (NAAPS). This study suggests that both root mean square error (RMSE) and absolute errors can be significantly reduced in NAAPS analyses with the use of OMI AI data assimilation when compared to values from NAAPS natural runs. Improvements in model simulations demonstrate the utility of OMI AI data assimilation for aerosol model analysis over cloudy regions and bright surfaces. However, the OMI AI data assimilation alone does not outperform aerosol data assimilation that uses passive-based aerosol optical depth (AOD) products over cloud-free skies and dark surfaces. Further, as AI assimilation requires the deployment of a fully multiple-scatter-aware radiative transfer model in the forward simulations, computational burden is an issue. Nevertheless, the newly developed modeling system contains the necessary ingredients for assimilation of radiances in the ultraviolet (UV) spectrum, and our study shows the potential of direct radiance assimilation at both UV and visible spectrums, possibly coupled with AOD assimilation, for aerosol applications in the future. Additional data streams can be added, including data from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), the Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS), and eventually the Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud and ocean Ecosystem (PACE) mission.

TI  - Coseismic deformation and multi-fault slip model of the 2019 Mindanao earthquake sequence derived from Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2 data
T2  - TECTONOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - From October to December 2019, a sequence of four earthquakes of Mw > 6.0 occurred in southern Mindanao, the Philippines, and revealed complex tectonics in this region. We used Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS)-2 and Sentinel-1A/B Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data to map the coseismic deformation and to constrain both the fault geometry and kinematics of coseismic slip distributions during the four earthquakes. Our observed coseismic deformation field shows that these four earthquakes ruptured two intersected conjugate faults with NE and NW strikes. Based on ascending and descending Interferometric SAR (InSAR) data, we constructed elastic half-space models to search for the optimal fault dip angle and inverted the slip distributions of the four earthquakes. The results show that these four earthquakes were all dominated by left- and right-lateral strike-slip motion. The two conjugate faults clearly had significant differences in terms of slip behaviour and fault kinematics. The static Coulomb stress change indicates that earlier earthquakes had a significant triggering effect on subsequent earthquakes. The static Coulomb stress change induced by the four earthquakes suggests a significant stress loading effect on NW-trending faults. The results of this study show that the potential for future earthquakes on NW-trending faults cannot be ignored; however the magnitudes of future earthquakes should be limited by complex fault geometry and segmentation.

TI  - DecSolNet: A noise resistant missing information recovery framework for daily satellite NO<sub>2</sub> columns
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel statistical method (hereafter referred to as DecSolNet ) for reconstructing satellite NO2 columns is introduced. The method has been developed and evaluated by comparing its performance with fou r benchmark models in three scenarios. When the amount of satellite data is limited, DecSolNet outperforms the benchmark models and its performance does not degrade with noisy inputs. The implementation of DecSolNet consists of: (1) feature extraction, sequential data decomposition in both temporal and frequency domains; (2) NO2 columns reconstruction by training a deep neural network. In three cross-validations, the averaged R-2 score of DecSolNet reaches 0.9 , which is better than that of the most benchmark models. The multi-layer perceptron (MLP) has a higher R-2 score , but it degrades greatly with noisy inputs , while the performance of DecSolNet remains robust with an R-2 of (similar to)0.8. The bias of DecSolNet is small with an average of 1.61 mu g/m(3). In addition, DecSolNet is a reliable learning machine, the averaged loss and standard deviation are 0.42 mu g/m(3) and 0.04 mu g/m(3), respectively.

TI  - Flood susceptibility mapping using a geomorphometric approach in South Australian basins
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Watershed characteristics and their hydrological responses can have severe effects on the occurrence and extent of floods. Therefore, this study focuses on the integration of geospatial techniques and remote sensing data to identify watershed terrain characteristics and evaluate the influence of these characteristics on flood susceptibility in South Australia. Data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and geologic and topographic maps and a geographic information system (GIS) were used to delineate drainage basins, measure morphometric parameters and link different parameters to evaluate the degree of flood vulnerability. Depending on their relations to the flood hazards, the morphometric parameters were categorized into two groups; then, a rank score was assigned to each group. Finally, the flood susceptibility of the basins was visualized, and the basins were classified into low, intermediate and high flood hazard areas. The results show that approximately 45.7, 44.7 and 9.7% of the study area is at risk of high, medium and low degrees of flooding, respectively. The results were validated through secondary data relating to historic floods. The causes of flooding were analysed using rainfall and road density data, while the consequences of flooding were verified by the population distribution across the study area. The findings of this study can be used to support decision-makers in planning and investing in mitigation measures, especially in highly susceptible areas of South Australian basins.

TI  - Evaluation of 18 satellite- and model-based soil moisture products using in situ measurements from 826 sensors
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Information about the spatiotemporal variability of soil moisture is critical for many purposes, including monitoring of hydrologic extremes, irrigation scheduling, and prediction of agricultural yields. We evaluated the temporal dynamics of 18 state-of-the-art (quasi-)global near-surface soil moisture products, including six based on satellite retrievals, six based on models without satellite data assimilation (referred to hereafter as "open-loop" models), and six based on models that assimilate satellite soil moisture or brightness temperature data. Seven of the products are introduced for the first time in this study: one multi-sensor merged satellite product called MeMo (Merged soil Moisture) and six estimates from the HBV (Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenbalansavdelning) model with three precipitation inputs (ERA5, IMERG, and MSWEP) with and without assimilation of SMAPL3E satellite retrievals, respectively. As reference, we used in situ soil moisture measurements between 2015 and 2019 at 5 cm depth from 826 sensors, located primarily in the USA and Europe. The 3-hourly Pearson correlation (R) was chosen as the primary performance metric. We found that application of the Soil Wetness Index (SWI) smoothing filter resulted in improved performance for all satellite products. The best-to-worst performance ranking of the four single-sensor satellite products was SMAPL3E(SWI), SMOSSWI, AMSR2(SWI), and ASCAT(SWI), with the L-band-based SMAPL3ESWI (median R of 0.72) outperforming the others at 50% of the sites. Among the two multi-sensor satellite products (MeMo and ESA-CCISWI), MeMo performed better on average (median R of 0.72 versus 0.67), probably due to the inclusion of SMAPL3ESWI. The best-to-worst performance ranking of the six openloop models was HBV-MSWEP, HBV-ERA5, ERA5-Land, HBV-IMERG, VIC-PGF, and GLDAS-Noah. This ranking largely reflects the quality of the precipitation forcing. HBV-MSWEP (median R of 0.78) performed best not just among the open-loop models but among all products. The calibration of HBV improved the median R by C0 :12 on average compared to random parameters, highlighting the importance of model calibration. The best-to-worst performance ranking of the six models with satellite data assimilation was HBV-MSWEP+SMAPL3E, HBV-ERA5+SMAPL3E, GLEAM, SMAPL4, HBV-IMERG+SMAPL3E, and ERA5. The assimilation of SMAPL3E retrievals into HBV-IMERG improved the median R by C0:06, suggesting that data assimilation yields significant benefits at the global scale.

TI  - Growing Operational Use of FY-3 Data in the ECMWF System
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper reviews the data quality and impact of observations from the FY-3 satellite series used operationally in the ECMWF system. This includes data from the passive microwave radiometers MWHS-1, MWHS-2 and MWRI, as well as observations from the radio occultation receiver GNOS. Evaluations against background equivalents show that the quality of the observations is broadly comparable to that of similar instruments on other polar-orbiting satellites, even though biases for the passive microwave observations can be somewhat larger and more complex for some channels. An observing system experiment shows that the FY-3 instruments jointly contribute significantly to the forecast skill in the ECMWF system. Positive impact of up to 2% is seen for most variables out to the day-2 forecasts over hemispheric scales, with significant benefits for total column water vapor or for temperature and wind in the stratosphere out to day 4.

TI  - A seamless economical feature extraction method using Landsat time series data
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Regional economic development describes the total social and economic activities in a given time and space. An objective understanding of the real regional economy is beneficial for healthy, sustainable societal development. Generally speaking, the understanding of the regional economy is mainly based on social surveying, which incurs time and energy costs and lacks objectivity. Therefore, this study proposes a seamless economical feature extraction method using the advantages of Landsat time series based on the morphologic changes of the earth's surface caused by regional economic development. First, the land-use/cover changes of the earth's surface were collected using Landsat time series; second, the correlations between land-use types and regional economic indices were analyzed and the optimal sensitive factors were selected. Third, a regional economic development model was constructed from the perspective of the land-use/cover change observed by remote sensing technology. Finally, the accuracy was evaluated in order to assess the validity and applicability of the model. The Zhoushan Islands of China were chosen as the research area for the verification experiment. From the results, the construction land is the most significant sensitive factor that correlates closely with various economic indices, and its correlation coefficients R with gross domestic product (GDP), value-added of primary industry (VPI), value-added of secondary industry (VSI), and value-added of tertiary industry (VTI) were 0.9591, 0.9390, 0.9546, and 0.9573, respectively. The regional economic development model constructed is simple, clear, and highly accurate; the determination coefficient R-2 was 0.9884. This study opens up unique opportunities for the objective, seamless understanding of regional economic development from the perspective of land-use/cover change using Landsat time series, as well as the correction of economic survey data, both with a high degree of accuracy.

TI  - Digital mapping of the soil thickness of loess deposits over a calcareous bedrock in central France
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil thickness (ST) plays an important role in regulating soil processes, vegetation growth and land suitability. Therefore, it has been listed as one of twelve basic soil properties to be delivered in GlobalSoilMap project. However, ST prediction has been reported with poor performance in previous studies. Our case study is located in the intensive agriculture Beauce area, central France. In this region, the ST mainly depends on the thickness of loess (TOL) deposits over a calcareous bedrock. We attempted to test the TOL prediction by coupling a large soil dataset (10978 sampling sites) and 117 environmental covariates. After variable selection by recursive feature elimination, quantile regression forests (QRF) was employed for spatial modelling, as it was able to directly provide the 90% prediction intervals (PIs). Averaging a total of 50 models, generated by repeated stratified random sampling, showed a substantial model performance with mean R-2 of 0.33, RMSE of 30.48 cm and bias of -1.20 cm. The prediction interval coverage percentage showed that 86.70% of the validation samples fall within the predefined 90% PIs, which also indicated the prediction uncertainty produced by QRF was reasonable. The relative variable importance indicated the importance of airborne gamma-ray radiometric data and Sentinel 2 products in TOL prediction. The produced TOL map with 90% PIs makes sense from a soil science and physiographic point of view. The final product can guide evidence-based decision making for agricultural land management, especially for irrigation in our case study.

TI  - Enhancing the precision of broad-scale forestland removals estimates with small area estimation techniques
T2  - FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Naional Forest Inventories (NFI) are designed to produce unbiased estimates of forest parameters at a variety of scales. These parameters include means and totals of current forest area and volume, as well as components of change such as means and totals of growth and harvest removals. Over the last several decades, there has been a steadily increasing demand for estimates for smaller geographic areas and/or for finer temporal resolutions. However, the current sampling intensities of many NFI and the reliance on design-based estimators often leads to inadequate precision of estimates at these scales. This research focuses on improving the precision of forest removal estimates both in terms of spatial and temporal resolution through the use of small area estimation techniques (SAE). In this application, a Landsat-derived tree cover loss product and the information from mill surveys were used as auxiliary data for area-level SAE. Results from the southeastern US suggest improvements in precision can be realized when using NFI data to make estimates at relatively fine spatial and temporal scales. Specifically, the estimated precision of removal volume estimates by species group and size class was improved when SAE methods were employed over post-stratified, design-based estimates alone. The findings of this research have broad implications for NFI analysts or users interested in providing estimates with increased precision at finer scales than those generally supported by post-stratified estimators.

TI  - Phosphogypsum as additive for foamed bitumen manufacturing used in asphalt paving
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this work was to use phosphogypsum (FY) waste in a sustainable paving practice involving the production of FY-foamed bitumen for road applications. For this proposal, three FY types coming from different fertilizer industries and a reference natural gypsum were used as foaming agents (10 wt%), including a small quantity of sulfuric acid (0.5 wt%) in the foamed bitumen formulation. The foaming properties and the rheological characterization of their corresponding binder residues were conducted by a distance laser sensor and by dynamic shear rheology, respectively. In addition, a physicochemical characterization of the used materials was carried out in order to evaluate their role in the final product. Knowing that FY is a Naturally Occurring Radioactive Material (NORM) waste, a comprehensive radioactive characterization, by both alpha and gamma spectrometry, and an environmental evaluation, by a Dynamic Surface Leaching Test (DSLT), were performed to comply with the EU radiological regulation of NORM materials for building materials. In conclusion, FY-foamed bitumen displayed enhanced engineering properties compared to that prepared with the reference natural gypsum, satisfying the radioactive and environmental specifications established according to the EU regulations.

TI  - An object based image analysis applied for volcanic and glacial landforms mapping in Sahand Mountain, Iran
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Landform mapping has increasingly become part of the digital domain. While the majority of approaches evaluates Digital Elevation Models (DEM) on a per-pixel basis, some examples exist were object-based image analysis (OBIA) has been applied to terrain data to identify a variety of landforms, including glacial landforms. The main objective of this study is to develop a semi-automated object-based rule set for detecting and delineating volcanic and glacier landforms in the area of the Sahand Mountain, Northern Iran. First, we applied a multi-resolution segmentation algorithm on a freely available Sentinel-2 optical satellite image and then selected the relevant features to define appropriate segmentation scales for each landform category. Object-based rule sets were then developed using spatial (DEM and its derivatives, e.g. slope, aspect, curvature and flow accumulation) and spectral information. Volcanic and glacial landforms were detected and classified into eight classes: caldera, volcanic cone, tuff formation, andesite lava, dacite lava, glacier valley, suspension valley, glacier cirque. An accuracy assessment was applied based on the fuzzy synthetic evaluation technique, together with the error matrix and kappa coefficient, using field data and geomorphological units derived from geological maps and very high resolution aerial photographs. The resulting overall accuracies for each class were 96.2%, 93.3%, 92.4%, 94.2%, 93.01, 95.1, 90.1 and 90.5, respectively. Our research demonstrated that spatial (e.g. density, shape index, length/width) and spectral (e.g. mean, brightness and standard deviation) algorithms together with a grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCMs) were efficient features for detecting and mapping volcanic and glacial landforms. We conclude that the OBIA-based algorithms and features provide a high potential for detecting and classifying landforms. Results of this study are of great importance for geomorphology and geology as well as geo-tourism societies and the semi-automated landform mapping contributes to the framework of GIScience.

TI  - Analysing the spatiotemporal characteristics of climate comfort in China based on 2005-2018 MODIS data
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The traditional temperature-humidity index (THI) based on observation stations has been widely used to evaluate regional climate comfort, but it is impossible to obtain the spatiotemporal characteristics of larger-scale regional comfort. This study uses MODIS remote sensing data combined with a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model to improve the classic THI model, and the results are compared with traditional interpolation methods to analyze the spatiotemporal evolution of annual and monthly average climate comfort in China from 2005 to 2018. The GWR model uses the land surface temperature (LST), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and a digital elevation model (DEM) as independent variables to fit the air temperature and accurately express the surface air temperature. According to the average annual THI change from 2005 to 2018, the cooler-more comfortable area increased to 136.11 km(2), and the annual average comfort level in China changed from cold to comfortable. The Yunnan Province has the most comfortable months, and the central provinces have more comfortable periods than the southeastern coastal provinces. Except for Xinjiang, Tibet, and parts of Northeast China, the spatial distribution of the annual comfort level in China tends to change from comfortable to cold with increasing latitude. Compared with the traditional interpolation method, the THI model based on remote sensing data can more accurately express the spatial distribution characteristics of climate comfort in areas with sparse stations (e.g., northern Qinghai, western Xinjiang, and Hengduan Mountains), especially in mountainous areas in the southwest. This model can also reduce the influence of terrain, elevation, and other factors on the spatial distribution characteristics of comfort.

TI  - Back to the Future: Schauta-Amreich Radical Vaginal Hysterectomy Assisted by Laparoscopy with Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy for Early-stage Cervical Cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF MINIMALLY INVASIVE GYNECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The popularity of laparoscopy to perform radical hysterectomy has massively increased over the last 2 decades. However, oncologic outcomes (overall and disease-free survival) have been found to be better in patients managed by laparotomy compared with laparoscopy, challenging this surgical route. Compared with laparotomy, vaginal access reduces postoperative morbidity, while avoiding potential cancer spread associated with laparoscopy.We describe the procedure of Schauta-Amreich radical vaginal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, assisted laparoscopically, and associated with pelvic sentinel lymph node procedure in a 56-year-old woman with an International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IB2 cervical epidermoid carcinoma.A sentinel lymph node procedure was first performed by laparoscopy. Radical hysterectomy was prepared through laparoscopy by dividing the infundibulopelvic, round, and broad ligaments. The procedure was continued by the vaginal route using the Schuchardt incision. We describe each step of the procedure and provide a video. Histology showed a margin-free resection in both the vagina and parametrium with negative sentinel lymph nodes.This description of the Schauta-Amreich radical vaginal hysterectomy technique with a video file could support the teaching of a procedure that may gain in popularity.

TI  - Advanced analysis of satellite data reveals ground deformation precursors to the Brumadinho Tailings Dam collapse
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Catastrophic failure of a tailings dam at an iron ore mine complex in Brumadinho, Brazil, on 25th January 2019 released 11.7 million m(3) of tailings downstream. Although reportedly monitored using an array of geotechnical techniques, the collapse occurred without any apparent warning. It claimed more than 200 lives and caused considerable environmental damage. Here we present the Intermittent Small Baseline Subset (ISBAS) technique on satellite-based interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data to assess the course of events. We find that parts of the dam wall and tailings were experiencing deformation not consistent with consolidation settlement preceding the collapse. Furthermore, we show that the timing of the dam collapse would have been foreseeable based on this observed precursory deformation. We conclude that satellite-based monitoring techniques may help mitigate similar catastrophes in the future. Ground deformation and a sudden acceleration of movement in the final two months preceded the catastrophic collapse of the Brumadinho Tailings Dam in Brazil, according to advanced analyses of InSAR remote sensing data.

TI  - Spatial and temporal characteristics of surface albedo in Badain Jaran Desert, China
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Obtaining surface albedo of high accuracy and analyzing spatial and temporal characteristics are essential for detecting change mechanism and influencing factors of surface albedo in deserts. Surface albedo from the Operational Land Imager (OLI) was assimilated into black-sky short-wave albedo (BSA) with an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) algorithm, to retrieve the surface albedo of high accuracy in Badain Jaran Desert. The results show that the average relative error decreases from 14.813% to 8.530% when surface albedo based on OLI is assimilated into BSA with the EnKF, and assimilated value can accurately describe the spatial and temporal distribution of surface albedo. The surface albedo has an obvious seasonal difference and presents a U-shape curve in a year, with the highest albedo in winter and lowest in summer. Owing to snow cover in some high-altitude areas, surface albedo is the highest and the spatial difference reaches maximum (variation coefficient=0.14) in winter. The Structure Similarity in surface albedo increases from the hinterland of desert (0.40-0.70) to the outer areas (0.70-0.90), as dune number decreases and distance between dunes increases. Compared with mobile and semi-mobile dunes, the minimum surface albedo of semi-fixed and fixed dunes postpones one month due to lag effect of the vegetation response to precipitation.

TI  - Data fusion of atmospheric ozone remote sensing Lidar according to deep learning
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article aims to realize the combined application of satellite remote sensing data and Lidar data fusion of atmospheric ozone in the ozone distribution prediction in western China. Firstly, the ozone remote sensing data and Lidar vertical monitoring data detected by ozone monitoring instruments are collected from various provinces in western China; the recurrent neural network (RNN) model based on the gated recurrent unit and the convolutional neural network (CNN) model based on time series are constructed and integrated to obtain the RNN-CNN model for ozone concentration prediction, and the prediction performance is compared with that of the RNN and CNN model. Satellite remote sensing data show that the total ozone concentration in western China has obvious spatial distribution characteristics, and can be elevated with the increase in latitude; the ozone concentration in the north is higher and the ozone concentration in the south is lower in different seasons in western China, and it in autumn and summer is lower than that in spring and winter generally. The hour-by-hour change of ozone concentration shows that the ozone concentration in different seasons reaches a trough around 9-10 o'clock, and reaches a peak around 16-17 o'clock. When the RNN-CNN model is applied to predict the hourly change of ozone concentration within a day, it can achieve the best root-mean-squared error (18.13), mean absolute error (11.64), and index of agreement (0.973). The monitoring results of Lidar data at a certain site are compared and analyzed, and the results show that the fitness is the best between the predicted value of ozone concentration obtained by the RNN-CNN model and the actually measured value. This research provides the possibility for the intelligent prediction of atmospheric ozone concentration distribution and has reliable theoretical value and practical significance.

TI  - Global drought monitoring with big geospatial datasets using Google Earth Engine
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought or dryness occurs due to the accumulative effect of certain climatological and hydrological variables over a certain period. Droughts are studied through numerically computed simple or compound indices. Vegetation condition index (VCI) is used for observing the change in vegetation that causes agricultural drought. Since the land surface temperature has minimum influence from cloud contamination and humidity in the air, so the temperature condition index (TCI) is used for studying the temperature change. Dryness or wetness of soil is a major indicator for agriculture and hydrological drought and for that purpose, the index, soil moisture condition index (SMCI), is computed. The deviation of precipitation from normal is a major cause for meteorological droughts and for that purpose, precipitation condition index (PCI) is computed. The years when the indices escalated the dryness situation to severe and extreme are pointed out in this research. Furthermore, an interactive dashboard is generated in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) for users to compute the said indices using country boundary, time period, and ecological mask of their choice: Agriculture Drought Monitoring. Apart from global results, three case studies of droughts (2002 in Australia, 2013 in Brazil, and 2019 in Thailand) computed via the dashboard are discussed in detail in this research.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - It is of great significance for the coordinated development of the environment and the economy to study the impact of the human driving factors of land use change (LUC) on ecosystem service value (ESV). In this study, we combined the biomass and remote sensing data of the Lijiang River Basin (LRB), which is a typical karst basin with a fragile ecological environment, to establish an ESV model to calculate the ESV. We also introduced the Lorenz curve and Gini coefficient to further analyze the impacts of the human driving factors of LUC on ESV. The results show that (1) the ESV in the LRB from 1995 to 2015 decreased from 8640.03 million yuan to 8595.38 million yuan, with a total decrease of 44.65 million yuan, indicating that the overall ESV in the region has a decreasing trend; (2) the obvious changes in land use caused a significant loss in ESV and changes in the structure of ecosystem services; and (3) the human driving factors of the total population, GDP, and urbanization rate are inversely related to the ESV in the LRB.

T2  - INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrestrial and aquatic birds have been proposed as sentinels for the spread of antimicrobial resistant bacteria, but few species have been investigated specifically in the context of AMR in the marine ecosystem. This study contrasts the occurrence of class 1 integrons and associated antimicrobial resistance genes in wild and captive little penguins (Eudyptula minor), an Australian seabird with local population declines. PCR screening of faecal samples (n = 448) revealed a significant difference in the prevalence of class 1 integrons in wild and captive groups, 3.2% and 44.7% respectively, with genes that confer resistance to streptomycin, spectinomycin, trimethoprim and multidrug efflux pumps detected. Class 1 integrons were not detected in two clinically relevant bacterial species, Klebsiella pneumoniae or Escherichia coli, isolated from penguin faeces. The presence of class 1 integrons in the little penguin supports the use of marine birds as sentinels of AMR in marine environments.

TI  - Anomalous collapses of Nares Strait ice arches leads to enhanced export of Arctic sea ice
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The ice arches that usually develop at the northern and southern ends of Nares Strait play an important role in modulating the export of Arctic Ocean multi-year sea ice. The Arctic Ocean is evolving towards an ice pack that is younger, thinner, and more mobile and the fate of its multi-year ice is becoming of increasing interest. Here, we use sea ice motion retrievals from Sentinel-1 imagery to report on the recent behavior of these ice arches and the associated ice fluxes. We show that the duration of arch formation has decreased over the past 20 years, while the ice area and volume fluxes along Nares Strait have both increased. These results suggest that a transition is underway towards a state where the formation of these arches will become atypical with a concomitant increase in the export of multi-year ice accelerating the transition towards a younger and thinner Arctic ice pack. Ice arches that form along Nares Strait, which separates Greenland and Ellesmere Island, act to reduce the export of thick multi-year ice out of the Arctic. Here, we show that there has been a recent trend towards shorter duration arch formation that has resulted in enhanced transport of ice along the strait.

M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The present study aimed to clarify the occurrence rate of lymphedema and prognosis in patients with endometrial cancer according to sentinel lymph node biopsy alone with intraoperative histopathological examination.Methods: The study included 45 consecutive patients with endometrial cancer treated at Tohoku University Hospital between October 2014 and August 2017. All patients had endometrial carcinoma with endometrioid histology Grade 1 or Grade 2 confirmed by biopsy and stage I on magnetic resonance imaging and/or computed tomography at their preoperative evaluation. Sentinel lymph node detection was performed by radioisotope and dye. Patients who were diagnosed intraoperatively as negative for sentinel lymph node metastasis did not undergo further systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy. The occurrence rate of lymphedema and prognosis was evaluated.Results: Bilateral sentinel lymph nodes were detected in 44 of 45 patients (97%). Forty-three patients underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy alone, and only two patients underwent systematic lymphadenectomy. Sentinel lymph node metastases were detected in one patient intraoperatively and two patients postoperatively as ITCs. No patients experienced recurrence. New symptomatic lower-extremity lymphedema was identified in one of 43 patients (2.3%) who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy alone.Conclusion: Sentinel lymph node biopsy alone with intraoperative histopathological diagnosis appears to be a safe and effective strategy to detect lymph node metastasis and to reduce the number of patients with lower-extremity lymphedema among patients with endometrial cancer.

TI  - Stability consistency and trend mapping of seasonally inundated wetlands in Moribund deltaic part of India
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ganga-Padma moribund deltaic zone contains plenty of small seasonal wetlands. In this paper we mapped the temporal hydrological dynamics of floodplain wetlands in the Ganga-Padma moribund deltaic zone. To evaluate the trend in wetland changes over time we used a time-series of Landsat images from 1987 to 2016 and adopted Water Presence Frequency (WPF), Standard Deviation, and Trend Analysis for stability and trend of water presence and change over time. Normalized Difference Water Index is used for wetland mapping for both pre- and post-monsoon seasons using the 30 years Landsat images. The result shows sequential changes in trend of wetland area and nature of deviation in water availability in wetland over time. More than 85% wetland area is prone to shallowing of depth and out of which 25% area is highly infected to this problem as found from wetland trend analysis. Standard deviation approach and trend analysis approach are used for detecting pixel-wise dynamics of wetland and trend of wetland change over the selected period of time based on the same images. The entire time spectrum is subdivided into three phases for detecting phasal change of water presence frequency (WPF) or stability of wetland. Among the total wetland area, 21.22% appeared as highly stable (high WPF) and 43.71% emerged as instable (low WPF). Only 14.56% wetland area recorded low departure in water availability, and these are usually found in the stable wetland part.

TI  - Ongoing anthropogenic eutrophication of the catchment area threatens the Donana World Heritage Site (South-west Spain)
T2  - WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Eutrophication is a major cause of wetland degradation worldwide. In recent decades, reductions in nutrient inputs have led to improvements in water quality in many rivers and lakes in central and northern Europe, but long-term trends are less clear in southern Europe. We conducted the first comprehensive study of water quality in Donana (SW Spain), one of the most important wetland complexes in Europe and the Mediterranean region. The core area of Donana is a large shallow, seasonal marsh (UNESCO World Heritage Site-WHS) that floods during rainy, cool winter months, then dries out during the summer. The marsh is fed by three main streams whose catchments are within a Biosphere Reserve but are impacted by greenhouses (for cultivating fruit, irrigated with groundwater), poorly treated urban wastewaters and tourism. From 2013 to 2016, we monitored nutrient (Total P, Total N, PO4-3, NH4+, NO3-, NO2-) and phytoplankton chlorophyll-a (chla) concentrations in surface waters of the Donana marsh and the three main streams. We quantified changes in greenhouse cover since 1995 using satellite images. Nutrient concentrations in streams were consistently higher than in the marsh, particularly in the Partido and Rocina streams that regularly reached concentrations equivalent to a "bad physico-chemical status" under the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD), and whose catchments suffered a fivefold expansion of greenhouses from 1995 to 2016. The Partido was the most polluted stream, and the most affected by wastewater effluents, and had particularly high concentrations of NH4+ (Geometric Mean = 0.3 mg L-1) and NO2- (GM = 0.52 mg L-1) across seasons. Patterns in chla concentrations were less consistent, but streams (GM = 6.78 mu g L-1) generally had higher concentrations than the marsh (GM = 4.27 mu g L-1). Nutrient concentrations in spot samples within the marsh largely depended on a combination of evaporation (as revealed by higher stable isotope delta H-2 values in the water column) and spatial processes (concentrations increase close to stream entry points, where conductivity is lower). Anthropogenic nutrient pollution in entry streams is a serious problem in Donana, with extensive stretches too toxic for fish. Reinforcement of policies aimed at reducing nutrient inputs to Donana are urgently required to meet the biodiversity conservation and environmental objectives for the WHS and WFD, respectively. Paradoxically, the marsh is currently relied upon to purify the water entering from streams.

However, monitoring the inter- and intra-annual change of these water bodies remains a challenging task because they are typically small (< 10 ha) and occur in high numbers. Therefore, we used two existing Landsat inundation datasets-the U.S. Geological Survey Dynamic Surface Water Extent (DSWE) and the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) Global Monthly Water History-to assess surface water area change of OFRs located in eastern Arkansas, the third most irrigated state in the U.S. that has seen a rapid increase of OFRs occurrence. We used an existent OFRs dataset as ground-truth. We aimed (i) to compare the performance of the DSWE and the JRC when characterizing OFRs of varied sizes and (ii) to assess the impact of climate variables (i.e., precipitation and temperature) on surface water area of OFRs. We found the highest mean percent errors (MPE) in size (similar to 20%) for OFRs between 0 and 5 ha, the smallest size class in our study. The DSWE had a smaller MPE and higher agreement with our ground-truth dataset when compared to the JRC for OFRs smaller than 5 ha (p-value < 0.05). Both inundation datasets enabled us to estimate the seasonality in surface area change of OFRs, with the highest surface water extent between March-May, the months when the region receives most of the annual precipitation. Our results showed that both DSWE and JRC can be used to enhance hydrological assessments in poorly monitored basins that have a concentration of OFRs, and the methods can be applied to other study regions if the inundation datasets are available.

TI  - Monitoring saline intrusion in the Ayeyarwady Delta, Myanmar, using data from the Sentinel-2 satellite mission
T2  - PADDY AND WATER ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Summer rice cannot be grown near the coast of the Ayeyarwady Delta, Myanmar, because of the high salinity in river water during the dry season. This means that saline intrusion should be monitored to manage the irrigated rice-growing area. The aim of this study therefore is to develop a model to estimate the salinity of river water using satellite imagery. The imagery of Sentinel-2 was suitable for monitoring saline intrusion because of their high spatial (10-m) and temporal (10-day) resolutions. We found that the reflectance of the visible bands was correlated with electrical conductivity, which was influenced by the concentration and composition of dissolved salts. When the river water mixed with the salt water from the sea, suspended particles tended to flocculate and settle, as a result, less turbid water was more saline. The best-fitting model was obtained with the green band (coefficient of determination R-2 of 0.776, root mean square error of 4.896 dSm(-1), and mean absolute error of 3.340 dS m(-1)). The saline intrusion showed considerable spatial and temporal variability during the dry season. The salinity intrusion extended approximately 80 km inland at the end of the dry season in March in the Pathein River. The 1 ppt salt concentration line in March marked the boundary between cultivated and non-cultivated areas of paddy field, which indicates that cultivable areas were strongly affected by saline intrusion. The results show that more frequent and higher resolution monitoring than before of the Sentinel-2 can support effective water resource management.

TI  - Soft computing model coupled with statistical models to estimate future of stock market
T2  - NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Almost every organization around the globe is working with uncertainty due to inevitable changes and growth in every sphere of life. These changes affect directly or indirectly the stock market prices which makes forecasting a challenging task. So, the need for reliable, cost-effective, and accurate forecasting models significantly arises to reduce risk and uncertainty in stock market investment. Different time series models have been proposed by data scientists and researchers for accurate prediction of the future with the least errors. Econometric autoregressive time series models such as autoregressive moving average (ARMA) and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models have established forecasting models capable of generating accurate forecasts. Wavelet methods, being capable of handling nonlinear data, combined with autoregressive models generate more accurate forecasts. In this present study, soft computing models of discreet wavelet transformation and wavelet denoising combined with autoregressive models are developed to forecast the weekly and daily closing prices of the BSE100 S&P Sensex index. Statistical error analysis of the forecasting outcomes of coupled models has been made to evaluate the performance of the prediction of these models. The prediction results reveal that soft computing methods coupled with autoregressive models (wavelet-ARIMA and wavelet denoise-ARIMA) generate considerably accurate forecasts as compared to baseline models (simple regression, ARMA and ARIMA models) and coupled models (wavelet-ARMA and wavelet denoise-ARMA models).

TI  - The impact of biomass burning emissions on protected natural areas in central and southern Mexico
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Biomass burning from grassland, forests, and agricultural waste results in large amounts of gases and particles emitted to the atmosphere, which affect air quality, population health, crop development, and natural vegetation. Regional atmospheric circulations can transport those plumes of pollutants over hundreds of kilometers, affecting vulnerable environments such as those considered protected natural areas (PNAs). This study evaluates the spatiotemporal distribution of active fires detected, and associated emissions, in central and southern Mexico from satellite data between March and June 2017, to assess the impact of the smoke plumes on protected ecosystems. The arrival of smoke plumes to selected PNAs (both near large urban centers and in remote areas) is assessed using airmass forward trajectories from selected emission sources. The spatial distribution of the remotely derived aerosol optical depth confirms the regional impact of particle emissions from the observed fires on PNAs, particularly in central Mexico. The identified areas of high fire density are also associated with large coarse particle concentrations at the surface. Moreover, there is a significant contribution of organic carbon to the total coarse particle mass, 60% on average. Finally, while most of the impact in ambient pollution is observed in PNAs located close to the regions with active fires in southern Mexico and Central America, the long-range transport of smoke plumes reaching the USA was also confirmed.

AB  - The electrical conductivity is an important geophysical parameter connected to the thermal, chemical, and mineralogical state of the Earth's mantle. In this paper, we apply the previously developed methodology of forward and inverse EM induction modeling to the latest version of satellite-derived spherical harmonic coefficients of external and internal magnetic field, and obtain the first 3-D mantle conductivity models with contributions from Swarm and CryoSat-2 satellite data. We recover degree 3 conductivity structures which partially overlap with the shape of the large low-shear velocity provinces in the lower mantle.

TI  - Comprehensive evaluation and prediction of tourism ecological security in droughty area national parks-a case study of Qilian Mountain of Zhangye section, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Tourism activities have brought overexploitation of natural ecotourism resources and ecological pressure challenge though it exactly contributes to the economic prosperity of a region. Research on tourism ecological safety is of great importance for tourist destinations to balance the relationship between environmental protection and tourism development. Qilian Mountains National Park (QMNP) has a prominent ecological status and is a vital ecological barrier in the northwest of China, which attracts large numbers of tourists every year for its rich tourism resources in the Zhangye (ZY) region. However, there is still a lack of systematic research on the environmental impact of tourism activities and on achieving sustainable development of ecotourism in national parks. We took QMNP-ZY as the study object, establishing the system of indicators based on the PSR model for the comprehensive evaluation of tourism ecological safety and the diagnosis of the main obstacles. Moreover, the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was introduced to forecast the evolutionary trends of tourism ecological security in QMNP-ZY. The results showed that (1) The tourism ecological security composite values of the QMNP-ZY exhibited a "U"-type evolution of "first fall-then rise" feature, and the pressure layer gradually became the dominant factor. (2) For the main barrier factors, there had been a shift from response factors. (3)The output of the ARIMA model demonstrated that the level of tourism ecological security would rise in a short period and then decline a few years later. Especially, the contribution degree of economic to the tourism eco-security development will weaken with the region's economy growing.

TI  - Three Decades of Nationwide Forest Cover Mapping Using Indian Remote Sensing Satellite Data: A Success Story of Monitoring Forests for Conservation in India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - India is a biodiversity-rich country. The panorama of Indian forests ranges from tropical evergreen rain forests in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, the Western Ghats, and the north-eastern States, to Dry Alpine Scrub high in the Himalayas in the north. On the other extreme, tropical dry deciduous and thorn forest is found in the deserts and dry areas of Rajasthan and Gujarat. The variety and distribution of forest vegetation are large, and India is one of the 17 mega biodiversity regions of the world. Forestry in India supports a sizeable non-wood forest product-based economy apart from timber and fuelwood. In forested landscapes people are integrated with forest and make living out of it. On the other hand urbanization and infrastructure development are putting considerable pressure on forests. These issues need effective and efficient forest monitoring system. Hence in late 1980s, India entrusted Forest Survey of India to evolve robust and scientific method of forest monitoring. Thus, India has taken an early lead in establishing a forest monitoring system. The history of forest cover mapping using satellite images in the country goes back to 1983 when National Remote Sensing Agency (NRSA-now known as NRSC-ISRO) prepared the first-ever forest cover map of India. Later, Forest Survey of India has been mandated with the forest cover mapping of the country in the biennial cycle since 1987. Three decades of forest cover mapping on a regular basis have been a remarkable achievement in the field of natural resource monitoring. India's remote sensing-based periodic monitoring of forest cover, which is unique in the world, has played a major role in conservation and enhancement of forest cover of the country. Evolving with satellite data improvement and technological advancements, the methodology of forest cover mapping by FSI has seen significant changes over the years, wherein Indian remote sensing data, particularly the IRS 1C/1D LISS III data, have been the primary input in the time series mapping. This paper reviews the chronology and significance of this important forest monitoring programme of India.

TI  - Effect of Land Use\Land Cover Changes on Estimated Potential Runoff in the Nablus Mountains Watersheds of Palestine: A Case Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Freshwater is a major concern in arid and semi-arid regions of the West Bank due to political conditions where the Israeli occupation controls the groundwater resources and physical drivers such as land use/land cover (LULC) changes. The Nablus Mountains region receives between 175 and 739.1 mm of annual rainfall. Hence, direct runoff is high and untapped because of surface and rainfall characteristics. This study is aimed to identify the spatial distribution of LULC changes and its impact on potential rainfall-runoff water at the sub-watershed scale for eleven main watersheds in the Nablus Mountains. Remote sensing data (Landsat 5, 7, and 8 images from 1984, 2000, and 2016, respectively) were employed to detect and measure LULC changes. Geographic information systems (GIS) and soil conservation service curve number (SCS-CN) methods were employed to calculate the potential runoff of 487 rainy days (2008-2018). Seven LULC classes were identified using the supervised classification method in GIS (10.5). The findings of this study revealed an increase of 116%, 22%, and 8% in urban areas, bare lands, and agriculture areas, respectively, and a decrease of 14% and 22% in pastures areas, and forests, respectively, between 1984 and 2016. Furthermore, there was a significant increase of 5.8% in the potential annual runoff between 1984 and 2016 due to LULC changes which is around 7.8 (MM)-M-3. The runoff estimation model indicated that the upstream sub-watersheds of Qana, Dair-Balout, and Zoumar watersheds are highly suitable locations for rainwater harvesting and flash floods mitigating projects.

TI  - An Integrated Approach for the Prioritization of Subwatersheds in the Urmodi River Catchment (India) for Soil Conservation using Morphometric and Land Use Land Cover (LULC) factors
T2  - JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The present investigation intends to prioritize the sub-watersheds of the Urmodi River watershed (Maharashtra State, India) for Soil Conservation, which is based on the integrated approach consisting of geomorphometric and Land Use Land Cover (LULC) factors. Prioritization based on Geographic Information Science (GIS) platform, allows us to take informed decisions for managing and safeguarding resources from degradation. Quantitative morphometric analysis of three aspects, namely linearity, shape and relief, were carried out for sub-watersheds encompassing the entire study area. In addition, Remote Sensing (RS) based on high-resolution multispectral data with 10 m spatial resolution captured by Sentinel 2 satellite was analysed to infer the land cover condition. In water-induced soil erosion, morphometric parameters have crucial role in understanding the geo-environmental characteristics of the terrain. Moreover, rainfall effects depend on the pattern of LULC change and each land cover responds differently to the raindrop energy it receives. Therefore, it requires integration of the geomorphological and hydrological characteristics of the sub-watersheds derived from their morphometric parameters with the LULC to generate compounded ranking-based prioritization of the sub-watersheds. During the prioritization analysis, the lower compound value is considered with higher priority for appropriate soil conservation measures. It was found that the integration of morphometric and LULC factors changed the prioritization ranking considerably. Incidentally, Sub-watershed 4 which was having moderate raking based on morphomertic analysis, got highest rank and compound value of 2.38 due to integrated approach. It was evident that the use of an integrated prioritization approach helps us to arrive at better decision-making related to soil conservation.

TI  - Archetypal temporal dynamics of arid and semi-arid rangelands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The way in which temporal dynamics structure ecological systems under the influence of a changing environment has long interested ecologists. Tackling the hierarchical structure of complex temporal patterns is a necessary step towards a more complete description of the fundamental nature of temporal dynamics in ecosystems. In pursuance of this task, remote sensing data provide valuable information to classify and describe functional features of ecosystems across scales. To approach the temporal complexity of ecosystems, we proposed a stepwise procedure based on combinations of big data techniques and time series analyses applied to data series of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The aim was to classify the temporal patterns and identify the differences in temporal dynamics of vegetation, by means of the frequency-domain and time-frequency domain components of a 20-year period of NDVI time series, respectively. In addition, we analysed the influence of climate in the temporal dynamics of vegetation. In particular, we applied archetype analysis to fast Fourier transform coefficients, using pixels as analytical units and frequencies as variables, of a large study area from North Patagonia, Argentina. Then, the most representative pixels for each archetype were used to analyse the explained variance by climatic predictor variables (temperature and precipitation) using a multiplicative model, whereas NDVI temporal dynamics was also described by means of time-frequency domain components with wavelet analysis, respectively. Six archetypes of temporal dynamics of arid and semi-arid rangelands were identified, as well as the main patterns of their distinctive frequencies through time and spatial location, respectively. The differences in temporal dynamics among archetypes were partly associated with climate and spatial features such as topography. The procedure was sensitive to capturing these temporal patterns, even those with a low data representation or noisy series while synthesizing information for an easy interpretation. Results are discussed in the light of future opportunities to combine this kind of information with other sources of information, aiming at the development of reliable land degradation and desertification assessment and monitoring tools.

T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate information on the rate of land-use pattern changes and urban expansion is essential for the sustainable development and management of natural resources. The rapid urban growth is a major challenge for local government and urban planners in small cities of India due to an insufficient database and inadequate analysis of chaotic urban expansion. The present paper has evaluated the land use/land cover change (LULCC) dynamics of the Barrackpore Subdivision area, India using remote sensing data and utilized the urban growth. Multi-temporal Landsat images with the maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) method were applied to generate the land use land cover maps. The spatiotemporal changes were performed by the "from-to" change matrix identifier to study land transformation. LULCC matrix demonstrated that vegetation cover, agricultural/cropland, wetland, and water bodies have decreased area under 23%, 7%, 6%, 1.7%, while the area under built-up and fallow lands have increased by 32.2% and 6.3% during 1972-2016. The results also revealed marked variation in the growth of built-up areas. The positive correlation between population and built-up land growth indicated that the impact of population pressure has contributed to faster growth of built-up land in the study area. The study calls for policies for proper land use management and sustainable urban development.

TI  - Causal Stories and the Role of Worldviews in Analysing Responses to Sorcery Accusations and Related Violence
T2  - FOUNDATIONS OF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper uses the concept of causal stories to explore how death, sickness and misfortune lead to accusations of sorcery or witchcraft. Based on empirical research in Papua New Guinea, we propose a new analytical framework that shows how negative events may trigger particular narratives about the use of the supernatural by individuals and groups. These narratives then direct considerations about the cause of the misfortune, the agent who can heal it, and the appropriate response from those affected by the misfortune. We also categorise the factors that attract people towards magical causal narratives or towards competing non-magical causal narratives. We situate our analysis within a context of worldview pluralism, where individuals possess multiple worldviews, such as a magical worldview or a scientific worldview. We argue that causal stories operate to activate the dominance of one worldview or a combination of worldviews in given circumstances. Our theoretical contribution may be extended to discrimination and violence against those suffering from health-related stigma, as this too gives rise to competing causal stories that either take hold or are ignored depending upon diverse factors.

TI  - Prediction of axillary nodal burden in patients with invasive lobular carcinoma using MRI
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose To investigate clinical and imaging features associated with a high nodal burden (>= 3 metastatic lymph nodes [LNs]) and compare diagnostic performance of US and MRI in patients with invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). Methods Retrospective search revealed 239 patients with ILC and 999 with IDC who underwent preoperative US and MRI between January 2016 and June 2019. Patients with ILC were propensity-score-matched with patients with IDC. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine factors associated with >= 3 metastatic LNs. Results 412 patients (206 ILC and 206 IDC) were evaluated. Of all patients with ILC, 27.2% (56/206) were node-positive and 7.8% (16/206) showed a high nodal burden. In multivariate analysis, the clinical N stage was the only independent factor associated with a high nodal burden in patients with IDC (odds ratio [OR] 6.24; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.57-24.73; P = 0.009), but not in patients with ILC. Increased cortical thickness with loss of fatty hilum on US was associated with a high nodal burden in patients with ILC (OR 58.40; 95% CI 5.09-669.71; P = 0.001) and IDC (OR 24.14; 95% CI 3.52-165.37; P = 0.001), while suspicious LN findings at MRI were independently associated with a high nodal burden in ILC only (OR 13.94; 95% CI 2.61-74.39; P = 0.002). Conclusion In patients with ILC, MRI findings of suspicious LNs were helpful to predict a high nodal disease burden.

TI  - A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Gastric Cancer, an Optimization of Imaging Protocol for Tracer Mapping
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) plays an essential role in the evaluation of lymph node (LN) metastasis status and the extent of LN dissection in gastric cancer. The aim of our study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis for corresponding identification rate and sensitivity of different SLNB techniques. Methods Systematic search using PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane library databases was conducted for studies on SLNB in patients with gastric cancer. Studies were stratified according to the sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy technique: blue dye (BD), radiocolloid tracer (RI), indocyanine green (ICG), a combination of radiocolloid with blue dye (RI + BD), and a combination of radiocolloid with ICG (RI + ICG). A random-effect model was used to pool the identification rate, sensitivity, and accuracy. Results A total of 54 eligible studies (3767 patients) was included. The pooled identification rates of SLNB using BD, RI, ICG, RI + BD, RI + ICG were 95% (95%CI: 92-97%), 95% (95%CI: 93-97%), 99% (95%CI: 97-99%), 97% (95%CI: 96-98%), and 95% (95%CI: 87-99%), respectively. The pooled sensitivities were 82% (95%CI: 77-86%), 87% (95%CI: 81-92%), 90% (95%CI: 82-95%), 89% (95%CI: 84-93%), and 88% (95%CI: 79-94%), respectively. The pooled accuracies were 94% (95%CI: 91-96%), 95% (95%CI: 92-97%), 98% (95%CI: 95-99%), 97% (95%CI: 95-99%), and 98% (95%CI: 95-99%), respectively. Conclusions The current meta-analysis provides reliable evidence that favors the use of ICG and dual tracer method (RI + BD/ICG) for the identification of the SLN. Considering the high costs and potential biohazard of using radioactive substances in dual tracer method, performing SLNB with ICG is the technique of choice for experienced surgeons.

TI  - Encapsulated papillary carcinoma with and without frank invasion: Comparison of clinicopathologic features and role of axillary staging
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - To investigate clinical and pathologic features of encapsulated papillary carcinomas (EPCs) that may be associated with invasive disease and characterize the axillary staging practices for EPCs at our institution. A pathology database search for cases containing "papillary carcinoma" was performed. Slides were reviewed by two pathologists. Clinicopathological features and axillary staging practices of EPCs with and without invasion were compared. Twenty-five cases of EPCs were identified. Fifteen cases contained a frank invasive tumor (60%), which were all pT1 (0.7 +/- 0.56 cm), and the majority were ER-positive, HER2-negative, low-grade IDC-NST. Seventeen patients underwent sentinel lymph node biopsies (SLNB). No nodal metastases were identified. Follow-up was available for 24 patients (mean = 39 +/- 29 months); 23 had no NED. Patients that presented with a self-palpated mass (versus screening) were more likely to have an invasive component; however, no pathologic or radiologic features differentiated EPCs with and without frank invasion. Pathologic and radiologic characteristics did not differentiate EPCs with and without frank invasion. EPCs have an excellent prognosis supported by the notable disease-free survival and negative nodal status in our cohort, which supports the notion that patients with EPCs may forgo axillary staging.

TI  - Himalayan Cryospheric Science: A Paradigm Shift By IRS 1C/1D DATA
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Himalayan region is a water tower (W.T.) of Asia due to a large concentration of cryosphere. The area generates a large amount of water and used by the millions of people living in the Indo-Gangetic plains. The W.T. provides a sustainable source of water for Indus, Ganga, and Brahmaputra river basins. By considering the importance of the Himalayan cryosphere, the field-based glaciological programme started in the mid-1970s. It provided limited information about the Himalayan cryosphere. Therefore, based upon minimal observations, numerous conclusions were made about glacier mass, length, and area loss, leading to the erroneous conclusion by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2007. At the same time, the results from a cryosphere programme of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) started to arrive, where satellite data of Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS) 1C and 1D were analysed. The information helped to resolve IPCC controversy and provided invaluable insight into Himalayan cryosphere. New models, techniques, and methods were developed in the ISRO programme, providing information on the distribution of snow and glaciers, the formation of glacier lakes, glacier retreat, and mass loss. The information was unique and otherwise not available to the scientific community. The data were also extensively used for developmental activities and to assess national security. These include monitoring of snow in Ladakh, hydropower development in Himachal Pradesh, and risk assessment from glacier lakes in Uttarakhand. The methods and techniques are still being used or improved upon, making remote sensing as an indispensable tool to study the Himalayan cryosphere.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy after introducing Twirl® breast markers into suspicious lymph nodes in breast cancer patients
T2  - BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Ten stage I/II breast cancer patients with one or two suspicious lymph nodes (LNs) detected on ultrasonography underwent sentinel LN biopsy (SLNB) after the introduction of Twirl (R) breast markers into each suspicious LN revealed that each Twirl (R)-marked LN was SLN and was likely the first SLN. Three patients had less than three SLN metastases and were candidates for sparing completion axillary lymph node dissection (cALND). Indeed, of them, one underwent breast-conserving surgery without cALND and the other two underwent total mastectomy with cALND. These results suggest that, as all suspicious LNs are SLNs, patients can be treated with SLNB alone if they fulfill the ACOSOG Z-0011 criteria, despite suspicious LNs yielding positive results on preoperative fine-needle aspiration cytology.

TI  - The Role of Oncotype DX(R) Recurrence Score in Predicting Axillary Response After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Breast Cancer
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Oncotype DX(R) recurrence score (RS) is well-recognized for guiding decision making in adjuvant chemotherapy; however, the predictive capability of this genomic assay in determining axillary response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) has not been established. Methods Using the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB), we identified patients diagnosed with T1-T2, clinically N1/N2, estrogen receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (ER +/HER2 -) invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast between 2010 and 2015. Patients with an Oncotype DX(R) RS who received NCT were included. RS was defined as low (< 18), intermediate (18-30), or high (> 30). Unadjusted and adjusted analyses were performed to determine the association between axillary pathologic complete response (pCR) and RS. Results This study included a total of 158 women. RS was low in 56 (35.4%) patients, intermediate in 62 (39.2%) patients, and high in 40 (25.3%) patients. The majority of patients presented with clinical N1 disease (89.2%). Axillary pCR was achieved in 23 (14.6%) patients. When stratifying patients with axillary pCR by RS, 11 (47.8%) patients had a high RS, 6 (26.1%) patients had an intermediate RS, and 6 (26.1%) patients had a low RS. Comparing cohorts by RS, 27.5% of patients with high RS tumors had an axillary pCR, compared with only 9.7% in the intermediate RS group, and 10.7% in the low RS group (p = 0.0268). Conclusion Our findings demonstrate that Oncotype DX(R) RS is an independent predictor of axillary pCR in patients with ER +/HER2 - breast cancers receiving NCT. A greater proportion of patients with a high RS achieved axillary pCR. These results support Oncotype DX(R) as a tool to improve clinical decision making in axillary management.

TI  - Contribution of IRS-1C Data to Agricultural Monitoring: A Review
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) program has always focused on food security needs and applications. IRS-1C was the fourth satellite on the IRS platform after many successful applications from IRS-1A, 1B, and P2 satellites. The LISS-I and LISS-II camera onboard IRS-1A/1B/P2 platform provided useful data for various natural resource management applications of country, including inventories of major crops (Wheat, Mustard, Rice, etc.), at the district level. Looking at specific requirements of assessment of multiple crops and associated small field sizes (< 1 ha) in which they are sown, it was felt that spatial and spectral resolution should be improved for assessing more crops and for improved crop discrimination. It was also decided to cater to the needs of village-level crop inventories as well as national-scale crop assessment. Hence, two new sensors, i.e., PAN (spatial resolution 5.8 m) and WiFS (spatial resolution 188 m) camera were introduced in the IRS-1C mission along with LISS-III (spatial resolution 23.5 m). Additionally, the LISS-III sensor, with the inclusion of the SWIR band, led to a significant improvement in crop classification and paved the way for monitoring both mono-cropped and multi-cropped regions. The availability of WIFS data with high temporal resolution (5 days) and large swath (810 km) gave newer applications like the national-level inventory of wheat crop. Pan-sharpened LISS-III data were found to be useful in cadastral level mapping. This paper reviews how the improvements in spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions in IRS-1C helped in carrying out various agricultural applications including crop inventory at different scales, yield modeling, crop rotation mapping, cropping system analysis, drought assessment, irrigation management, and infrastructure planning.

TI  - Mapping <i>Phragmites</i> cover using WorldView 2/3 and Sentinel 2 images at Lake Erie Wetlands, Canada
T2  - BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steudel subspecies australis is an aggressive plant invader in North American wetlands. Remote sensing provides cost-effective methods to track its spread given its widespread distribution. We classified Phragmites in three Lake Erie wetlands (two in Long Point Wetland Complex (LP) and one in Rondeau Bay Marsh (RBM)), using commercial, high-resolution (WorldView2/3: WV2 for RBM, WV3 for LP) and free, moderate-resolution (Sentinel 2; S2) satellite images. For image classification, we used mixture-tuned match filtering (MTMF) and then either maximum likelihood (ML) or support vector machines (SVM) classification methods. Using WV2/3 images with ML classification, we obtained higher overall accuracy for both LP sites (93.1%) compared with the RBM site (86.4%); both Phragmites users' and producers' accuracies were also higher for LP (89.3% and 92.7%, respectively) compared with RBM (84.3% and 88.4%, respectively). S2 images with SVM classification provided similar overall accuracies for LP (74.7%) and for the RBM (74.3%); Phragmites users' and producers' accuracies for LP were 85.3% and 76.3%, and for the RBM, 69.1% and 79.2%, respectively. Using WV2/3, we could quantify small patches (percentage cover >= 20%; shoots >= 1 m tall; stem counts > 25) with accuracy > 80%, whereas parallel effort with S2 images only accurately quantified high density (> 60% cover), mature shoots (> 1 m tall; Stem counts > 100). By simultaneously mapping young or sparsely distributed Phragmites shoots and dense mature stands accurately, we show our approach can be used for routine mapping and regular updating purposes, especially for post-treatment effectiveness monitoring.

TI  - Response in breast vs axilla after neoadjuvant treatment and implications for nonoperative management of invasive breast cancer
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Improved imaging and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAT) have led to higher pathologic complete response rates (pCR) in patients with invasive breast cancer. This has questioned the necessity of surgery and axillary lymph node (ALN) dissection in these patients. Prospective clinical trials are implementing extensive core biopsies of the tumor bed of patients with clinical complete response as a means to identify and spare them breast surgery. In addition, it is anticipated that patients with pCR are most likely going to have no or minimal disease in ALN as well. To verify the feasibility of these trials, we performed a pathologic analysis of all our patients who have undergone NAT from 2009 to present. Using pathology data base, we identified 362 patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery. Clinical and pathologic information including gross and microscopic descriptions as well as biomarker status was collected. pCR was 50% for patients with negative ALN pretreatment but only 28% for patients with positive ALN at diagnosis. Despite achieving pCR in the breast, up to 10% of patients with positive ALN and 1% with negative ALN had persistent disease. Eight percent of patients that were presumed to have no ALN disease either clinically and or by imaging were found to have metastatic carcinoma in ALN. The metastases were predominantly (80%) <5 mm, and not palpable on physical examination and or due to biopsy sampling error. pCR in breast and ALN directly correlated with tumor size, ALN disease, and Her2 positive and triple negative receptor phenotype. In breast cancer patients who are node positive at time of diagnosis with pCR in the breast after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, residual lymph node disease was very uncommon. Further study is warranted to select patients who may avoid breast and axillary surgery post neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

T2  - GASTRIC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To investigate the quality of life (QOL) of patients after laparoscopic sentinel node navigation surgery (SNNS) compared to conventional laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy (LADG) in early gastric cancer patients. Methods Patients recruited for laparoscopic SNNS surgery between July 2010 and April 2013 were assessed for their QOL. A historical control group was established, consisting of patients who underwent conventional LADG with radical lymphadenectomy from the same institution. QOL questionnaire was taken serially from preoperative week 1 until 12 months postoperatively (1, 3, 6, and 12 months) using the Korean version of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QOL questionnaire-core (QLQ-C30) and gastric cancer-specific questionnaire (STO22). Results A total of 80 prospectively gathered patients who received SNNS were categorized into the comparison group (SNNS group). The QOL was compared with 78 patients identified to have received LADG from the gastric cancer database of our institution and were sorted into the control group (LADG group). In QLQ-C30, SNNS group showed better functioning scales in all except role functioning and better scores from the symptom scales in fatigue, insomnia, and diarrhea compared to the LADG group. In QLQ-STO22, scores on dysphagia, eating restriction, anxiety, and body image disturbance were better in SNNS group. Conclusions Postoperative QOL in laparoscopic gastrectomy combined with SNNS is superior compared to conventional laparoscopic distal gastrectomy in patients with stage I gastric cancer.

TI  - High spatial resolution remote sensing image segmentation based on the multiclassification model and the binary classification model
T2  - NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Semantic segmentation technology is an important step in the interpretation of remote sensing images. High spatial resolution remote sensing images have clear features. Traditional image segmentation methods cannot fully represent the information in high spatial resolution images and tend to yield unsatisfactory segmentation accuracy. With the rapid development of deep learning, many researchers have tried to use deep learning algorithms for remote sensing image segmentation. This paper uses U-Net for multiclassification and binary classification of Gaofen-2 high spatial resolution remote sensing image data. Six types of features, which were build-up, farmland, water, meadow, forest and others, were labeled in the image. A "neighborhood voting" method was used to determine the category of uncertain pixels based on spatial heterogeneity and homogeneity. Through U-Net neural network multiclassification, the overall accuracy of the training data is 93.83%; the overall accuracy of the test data is 82.27%; and the test accuracy of the binary classification algorithm is 79.75%. The results show that the two models yield high accuracy and credibility in remote sensing image segmentation.

TI  - Predicting potential fishing grounds of ribbonfish (<i>Trichiurus lepturus</i>) in the north-eastern Arabian Sea, using remote sensing data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ribbonfish (Trichiurus lepturus) is one of the major fishery resources of the north-eastern Arabian Sea having significance from commercial as well as ecological point of view. Information on habitat of the resource and its spatio-temporal variations is sparse limiting precise prediction of the grounds for efficient harvest and management of the resource. Habitat suitability modelling was applied to the ribbonfish presence/absence data from commercial trawlers using Generalized Additive Model (GAM) and Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) model along with environmental variables (euphotic depth (Z (eu)), Sea Surface Temperature (SST), bathymetry and Sea Surface Height anomaly (SSHa) to understand the influence of these on the spatio-temporal variation of ribbonfish in the north-eastern Arabian Sea. The model predictive performances of the models were compared with Area Under the Curve (AUC) and maximum kappa shows BRT model performed slightly better in predicting ability than GAM. Euphotic depth (28.5%) was observed to be the most significant contributor to the spatio-temporal distribution of ribbonfish followed by SST (24.3%), bathymetry (23.8%), and SSHa (23.5%) in the BRT model. Spatial variation of ribbonfish over the months modelled from BRT model indicated fish was strongly linked with bio-physical environment and the potential fishing grounds occurred along off Maharashtra coast during post-monsoon season. Field demonstration of the model was carried out by comparing the daily fish catch locations with weekly prediction maps. Analysis indicated the model to be in good agreement with the catch data and reliable for prediction of spatio-temporal variation in potential fishing grounds of ribbonfish in the north-eastern Arabian Sea.

TI  - Water balance trends in irrigated canal commands and its implications for sustainable water management in Pakistan: Evidence from 1981 to 2012
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Indus Basin Irrigation System (IBIS) of Pakistan is a major user of surface and groundwater and provides food and economic security for about 207 million people. To assess the impact of agricultural development on water resources, we developed surface water balances for its canal commands and examined trends from 1981-82 to 2012-13. In this semi-arid environment, crop water use is the major water balance term. We estimated it by computing actual evapotranspiration (ETa) from two different remote sensing methods, ETLook and CMRSET, to account for method uncertainty. Net groundwater use was a small component of the water balance in most canal commands, particularly in the Sindh province. The measured or estimated known terms in the water balance did not result in its closure; and a balance term of unaccounted outflows and inflows was required to close it. Measured and readily estimated components amounted to 80 - 90% of the water balance components, with unaccounted inflows and outflows accounting for the remaining 10 - 20%. Of the measured water balance terms, rainfall showed no statistically significant trend in any canal command, whereas canal deliveries decreased significantly in many canal commands. Overall, ETa generally increased in Punjab and decreased slightly in Sindh. The magnitude of the increases in ETa differed between the ETLook and CMRSET estimates. The historical trends in the balance term (unaccounted outflows and inflows) together with falling groundwater levels show that water use is becoming less sustainable in several canal commands, especially in the Punjab province. The trend to a less sustainable position results particularly from water use in the dry Rabi season.

TI  - Monitoring urban physical growth in tsunami-affected areas: a case study of Banda Aceh City, Indonesia
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Building back better-based urban planning is an integral part of efforts to increase urban resilience. Therefore, urban physical growth needs to be monitored to prevent built-up areas from expanding into hazard zones. This study analyzed the dynamics of urban physical growth and its driving forces in tsunami-affected areas of Banda Aceh after the 2004 tsunami. Built-up areas were extracted from Landsat images. The annual growth rate equation was used to estimate the growth characteristics in the tsunami-affected and safe areas. In-depth interviews and extensive literature reviews were also conducted to identify the determinant factors of urban redevelopment in tsunami-affected areas. Results showed that the annual growth rate was high in the areas during the disaster recovery period (2005-2009). Nevertheless, urban physical growth dominated in the safe areas during 2009-2019. The study also identified several driving forces of urban physical growth in the hazard zones: (1) population growth, (2) spatial planning, (3) distance to old city center, (4) land ownership and prices, and (5) socio-economic factors. This study provided new insights for urban planners to reduce disaster risk in urban areas.

TI  - Investigating the capabilities of multispectral remote sensors data to map alteration zones in the Abhar area, NW Iran
T2  - GEOSYSTEM ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Economic mineralization is often associated with alterations that are identifiable by remote sensing coupled geological analysis. The present paper aims to investigate the capabilities of Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data to map iron oxide and hydrothermally alteration zones in the Abhar area, NW Iran. To achieve this goal, the principal component analysis (PCA) and two machine learning methods including support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) were employed. PCA method was carried out on four bands of all data and then the appropriate principal components were selected to map alterations. Due to the high precision of ASTER data within the short-wave infrared range, these data results are more satisfactory compared with Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 sensors in detecting hydrothermally alterations through the PCA technique. Based on the obtained maps, the performance of all data types was approximately similar in the detection of iron oxide zones. Our desired data were classified by two methods of SVM and ANN. The results of these algorithms were presented as confusion matrix. According to these results, for hydrothermally alterations, ASTER data showed better performance in both SVM and ANN than other datasets by gaining values greater than 90%. These data did not perform well in the iron oxide zones detection, while Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 have been more successful. For iron oxide, based on confusion matrix, Landsat-8 data have obtained the values of 78% and 79% through SVM and ANN algorithms, respectively, and also Sentinel-2 has acquired the values of 88.11% and 90.55% via SVM and ANN, respectively. Therefore, to map iron oxide zones, Sentinel-2 data are more favorable than Landsat-8 data. In addition, the ANN algorithm in ASTER data has represented the highest overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient with the values of 88.73% and 0.8453, respectively.

TI  - Visual analysis of meteorological satellite data via model-agnostic meta-learning
T2  - JOURNAL OF VISUALIZATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellites detect the distribution of meteorological data worldwide. However, due to the orbital constraints, the satellite can only reach the same area again after one orbiting cycle. The interval between two detections in the same area is long, and the variation of meteorological data between the two detections is unknown. Moreover, meteorological satellite data are only located near the orbit in one cycle, while the global distribution of meteorological data is unknown. Our method allows to train a regression model with only few meteorological satellite data by taking advantage of the recent advances in deep learning. In detail, we train a model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) model with data from ground stations instead of meteorological satellites and get the initial network parameters. Based on the initial network parameters trained by MAML, we train the regression models again for different areas. We sample the regression curves of all areas by time and get a time series of global meteorological data distribution. Through case studies conducted together with domain experts, we validate the effectiveness of our method. Graphic abstract

TI  - Assessment of urban sprawl characteristics in Indian cities using remote sensing: case studies of Patna, Ranchi, and Srinagar
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid urban growth in mid-sized cities of developing nations has induced conflict between development and the environment, often leading to urban sprawl. However, studies focusing on the assessment of urban sprawl in mid-sized cities are comparatively rare. Therefore, this paper assesses the spatio-temporal urban sprawl characteristics of three typical mid-sized Indian cities, such as Patna Urban Agglomeration (UA), Ranchi UA, and Srinagar UA, from 1991 to 2018 using Landsat images. The population density, landscape metrics, and urban expansion index were employed to detect and assess urban sprawl characteristics. A multivariable integrated urban sprawl index was computed using Z-score to examine the intensity of urban sprawl. The results revealed robust evidence of the built-up growth in all three cities. The rise in built-up was observed due to the conversion of fallow and agriculture land covers in Patna UA and Ranchi UA, while water body and fallow land covers in Srinagar UA. Despite an increase in the total population and built-up, population density declined in all three cities. The analysis using landscape metrics exhibited continuous outward expansion with an increase in shape irregularity of built-up patches. The urban expansion index indicated the prevalence of edge expansion typology of urban sprawl. Patna UA exhibited the highest intensity of urban sprawl as per the multivariable integrated urban sprawl index. The obtained results will benefit the urban planners and officials to promote urban sustenance by preparing relevant strategies under the Smart City Mission. This study demonstrated an effective utilization of scientific approaches to assess urban sprawl characteristics in mid-sized cities.

AB  - This article examines a still contentious question: how conservative and liberal elements are combined in Boris N. Chicherin's worldview and political doctrine. It considers several points of view on this issue (expressed by Nikolai Berdyaev, Petr Struve, Georgii Plekhanov, Vasilii Zen'kovskii) and analyzes Chicherin's works of the 1850s-1860s that have provoked the most heated debates. The author attempts to show that assessing the conservative element in Chicherin's worldview is not as straightforward a task as is commonly assumed. His concepts of conservatism and "protective principles" do not fit within broader understandings of conservatism. This article pays particular attention to analyzing the dramatic experience of Chicherin's cooperation with the authorities and the reasons his political position radicalized.

T2  - JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The existence of the Mid-Mediterranean Jet (MMJ) as part of the pathway of the Atlantic Water (AW) in Eastern Mediterranean is still debated and the reasons for its formation are unknown. The MMJ was investigated over the 2000-2015 summers using thermal and altimetry satellite data and 'in situ' casts. In the Levantine basin, the AW flowing along the Libyan-Egyptian coast splits into an along-shore and an offshore branch, the latter following the northern border of the warm anti-cyclones located near the African coast (Libyan-Egyptian Eddies, LEEs). The MMJ is triggered when a surface cold water mass formed south-east of Crete, in part outflowing the Aegean Sea and in part generated within the Rhodes Gyre, moves southward and intrudes the middle Levantine basin. The surface cold water overlays the AW flowing along the northern periphery of LEEs that sinks dozens of metres below increasing its budget of anti-cyclonic vorticity and causing the formation of the jet. Satellite data show that the MMJ formed every summer from 2003 to 2015, sometimes for limited periods of time and at different latitudes, with the exception of summers 2005-2006, probably due to the weakness of the African anti-cyclones that in those years did not advect AW offshore.

TI  - Investigating the potential of Sentinel-1 to detect varying spatial heterogeneity in pasture cover in grasslands
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Selective grazing by livestock may be indicative of a site's grass species diversity and depending on the grazing intensity; this may or may not promote further diversity. However, the detection of sites with spatial heterogeneity in pasture cover as a manifestation of selective grazing has not yet been investigated using satellite remote sensing. Thus, this study was conducted to address the question; can Sentinel-1 detect spatial heterogeneity induced by livestock grazing in grassy fields? Since Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging is noted to be sensitive to vegetation architectural arrangement, this study used Sentinel-1 C-band SAR to detect spatial heterogeneity created by selective livestock grazing. The study examined a range of semivariogram, grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), and eigenvector-eigenvalue polarimetric decomposition features. The coefficient of variation estimates of the GLCM contrast feature consistently produced the strongest correlation (R (2) = 0.71) with Lloyd's Patchiness Index and semivariogram sill while the polarimetric scattering entropy (range estimates) produced a significant linear correlation with semivariogram sill (R (2) = 0.55, p < 0.05). Inferably, the GLCM contrast and polarimetric scattering entropy can predict spatial heterogeneity in a grazing environment. This is the first time polarimetric scattering entropy estimated from Sentinel-1 has been used for the detection of spatial heterogeneity in a grazing landscape, which makes this study different from past similar studies. Nonetheless, we recommend the testing of this parameter (polarimetric scattering entropy) with a multitemporal SAR data and encourage future studies to investigate the potential of Sentinel-1 for the detection of spatial distances between grass clumps.

TI  - Future scenarios based on a CA-Markov land use and land cover simulation model for a tropical humid basin in the Cerrado/Atlantic forest ecotone of Brazil
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, the advancement of agriculture in Brazil has caused very serious problems, such as deforestation and an increase in the amount of pesticides and suspended sediment that have negatively impacted the environment, especially in the Prata River basin, which is located in the Serra da Bodoquena region, Brazil. Thus, the objective of this study was to analyze the future changes in land use and land cover of the advancement of agriculture in the native vegetation areas of the Cerrado/Atlantic forest ecotone in the Prata River basin in 2033, 2050, 2080 and 2100. To map the future land use and land cover (LULC) in the study area, an object-based classification approach was used on Landsat satellite imagery from 1986, 1999, 2007 and 2016. The future LULC scenarios were created with a cellular automata-Markov forecast model. The simulation results of the LULC changes were considered satisfactory, as evidenced by the values obtained from the kappa for agreement (kappa(standard)) = 0.73, kappa for no information (kappa(no)) = 0.79 and kappa for grid-cell level location (kappa(location)) = 0.85 indices. The modeled future scenarios of LULC indicated the advancement of crop agriculture and decreases in wetlands (banhado), savannahs, riparian forests, seasonal semideciduous forests and wet grasslands, which can be considered a warning about the loss of biodiversity of fauna and flora in the Serra da Bodoquena National Park, mainly in the Prata River basin.

TI  - Analysis of urban - industrial expansion and increasing level of ozone concentration as subsiding an environmental management plan for the east of Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area - Brazil
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The disorderly growth of metropolitan regions, combined with the lack of efficient air quality management strategies, contributes to the potential increase in O3. That impact might undoubtedly cause harmful and immediate and continuous effects on living organisms. In this sense, the primary objective of this research work is to identify and evaluate the threshold values of the O-3 concentration pattern in the expanded region of the Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan Area (RJMA). Landsat images were retrieved and showed that there was an expansion to the east and west of the RJMA at an average rate of 32 km(2). year(-1). After analyzing the air quality data in the region for the period between 2010 and 2018, excess concentrations of O-3 were registered to occur every month and across all weather seasons, mainly from October to March (spring and summer), concerning air quality standards, There are significant differences in ozone violations between Paqueta weather station (t = 184 days, 53.2 %) and Porto das Caxias weather station (t = 105 days, 30.2 %). The annual time series of O-3 violations during the study period was highly variable, with peaks in the years 2012 (14.3 +/- 20.1 violations), 2013 (12.3 +/- 15.7 violations), and 2015 (23 +/- 15.7 violations). Furthermore, there was an increase in the value of surpluses of O-3 along 2016, marked by a longer period of excess concentration from August to March. Despite advances in environmental legislation, air quality management protocols still lack effective measures to mitigate the impacts of O-3 on the environment, which highlights the need for developing timely and additional interdisciplinary investigations in the coming future.

T2  - Transactions of the Royal Society of South Africa
M3  - Article
AB  - The goal of this study was to understand land use and land cover (LULC) changes within the lower uMfolozi floodplain system, South Africa, and relate those changes to wetland loss. Changes in LULC were assessed using a geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) algorithm to classify multi-date Landsat images into eight cover types over a period of 20 years, between 1997 and 2017. Post-classification accuracy assessment of all map-outputs was conducted by compiling confusion matrixes and calculating producer, user, and global accuracies and kappa coefficients (K) for each map-output. Levels of accuracy for all map-outputs were within acceptable limits, ranging between 79% and 88% (K = 0.76 and 0.86, respectively). Thereafter, paired t-tests were applied to determine whether the changes in LULC over the study period were significant. Results of this investigation showed a significant (p-value, < 0.01) conversion of wetland to cultivation, by 14%. This finding is important because it demonstrates that in this environment, human agency is one of the major drivers of a persistent decrease in the wetland ecosystem. The major insight from this observation is that there is an urgent need to formulate and implement objectively informed interventions to enhance the sustainability of the uMfolozi floodplain system and that of others elsewhere.

TI  - Parameterization of the AquaCrop model for simulating table grapes growth and water productivity in an arid region of Mexico
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, the AquaCrop model has been widely tested for many fruit/grain crops; root and tuber crops; leafy vegetables, or forage crops, but is restricted to annual herbaceous species, while deciduous crops have received less if no attention. In this context, this study aims to test for the first time the ability of the AquaCrop model to simulate canopy cover (CC), actual evapotranspiration (ETa), total soil water content (TWC), biomass (B) and fruit yield (FY) of table grapes vineyards (Vitis vinifera L., cvs. Perlette and Superior) at the Costa de Hermosillo, Sonora in Northwest Mexico. Observed weather and soil physical parameters, with measured crop parameters from an experiment conducted during 2005 were used to develop climate, soil and crop input files for AquaCrop and for calibrating the model. While collected data during the 2006 growing season were used to validate the model. The model adequately simulated CC, ETa and TWC during 2005 and 2006. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between observed and measured CC, ETa and TWC were 5.18%, 0.46 mm/day and 10.11 mm during 2005, and 8.82%, 0.84 mm/day and 9.1 mm during 2006, respectively. The good accuracy of simulations of CC, ETa and TWC by the model have been confirmed by additional statistical parameters like the coefficient of determination (R-2), The Mean Bias Error (MBE), the Willmott's index of agreement (d) and the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE).For the B and FY simulations, the results showed that the model correctly reproduced the B and FY with NRMSE value of 8.8%. The estimated average value of FY (14.56 t/ha) for both seasons are in the range of the potential yield (14-18 t/ha) of table grapes in the irrigated Costa de Hermosillo in northwest Mexico.After the validation of the AquaCrop model, it was used to evaluate the irrigation scheduling by the farmer as well as to assess the water productivity computed as the ratio of crop production to crop water use. The results showed that, the recommended irrigation by the model was about 547 mm and 509 mm, which it is about half of that applied by the farmer (1006 mm and 929 mm) during 2005 and 2006, respectively. This large difference, which represents approximately 54% and 57% of the irrigation supply, is lost through deep percolation and could be saved without vegetation suffering from water stress while maintaining the same yield. The high loss of water by percolation affects significantly the water productivity (WP), which decreases from 3.22 to 1.74 kg/m(3) if we consider the transpiration (WPTr), and the sum of ETa and Percolation (WPETa+Pr) for WP computations, respectively. Consequently, the AquaCrop model can be used as an operational tool by decision makers and growers to improve irrigation management. This is of crucial importance in arid and semi-arid regions where water is becoming increasingly scarce.

AB  - This research aims to provide a brief evaluation of remotely sensed estimates in representing gross primary production (GPP) over pasture in the Northeast Region of Brazil. We used GPP data measured in situ during a micrometeorological experiment performed in a pasture area located in the NEB region using the eddy covariance technique. Remotely sensed GPP was obtained through the MOD17A2H product of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor on board the Terra satellite. We concluded that the MOD17A2H product moderately represents surface-measured GPP in the studied site, highlighting the need for improvements in the quality of the remotely sensed GPP estimates over this type of ecosystem.

M3  - Article
AB  - Reports of English Christian socialism's death at the end of the Second World War were greatly exaggerated. Like their Catholic counterparts in much of western Europe, Anglican Christian socialists contributed to debates about post-war reconstruction, issuing warnings against an impersonal or bureaucratic state and experimenting with small-scale community initiatives such as industrial missions, parish meetings and housing associations. From the 1950s, the worldview inherited from Victorian Christian socialism began to be challenged by affluence, anti-colonialism, the decline of deference and eventually by the rise of identity politics. Criticism also came from radical Christian socialists like David Nicholls who found the incarnationalist tradition of Henry Scott Holland too comfortable and paternalistic. Nevertheless, Anglican ideas of national community retained some of their attraction into the late 20(th) century, particularly offering an alternative vision of society to Thatcherism in the 1980s. This article is based on a lecture given to the 2020 Scott Holland symposium.

TI  - Analysis of Land Use Land Cover Dynamics and Driving Factors in Desa'a Forest in Northern Ethiopia
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the dynamic of land use/land cover (LULC) can assist relevant authorities in implementing them along with management options for natural forests like Desa' a forest in Northern Ethiopia. It is worth mentioning that no comprehensive study has been done so far on the overall change of LULC within the surrounding of Desa'a forest areas. This study aimed at analyzing the LULC changes and driving factors in Desa'a forest through Landsat images (i.e., 1973 (MSS), 1986 (TM), and 2015 (OLI)) and maximum likelihood supervised classification. Post classification pixel to pixel comparison was also performed to detect changes from year to year. Finally, focus group discussions were made to identify the LULC change drivers and support the computer-based classifications accuracy. Results demonstrated that both dense (54.11%) and open forest (28.48%) in 1973 covered almost 83% of the total forest area while only 17% was covered by grasslands (10%), farmland (3%), and bare land (4%). This is despite the fact that woody vegetation covered only 39% of the total forest reserve in 2015. During the study period, almost 54,000 ha of grasslands and open and dense forests have been converted to either bare land or farmland, of which 48,163 ha were previously open dense forests. Continuing with such a trend will lead to more severe deforestation and it is necessary to identify and modify the driving variables in Desa'a forest. The results also showed that fire, agricultural expansion, grazing and browsing effect, drought, extraction of wood, and lack of government attention are the major deforestation driver in Desa'a forest. The results of this study can provide a practical perspective for land use planners to manage LULC changes, reduce greenhouse gases, and enhance the biodiversity conservation in the region. In addition, the findings of the current study could provide a perfect source for calculations and choosing the best policy-making decisions to protect and manage plans for Desa'a forest.

TI  - November 08, 2019 Turkmanchay earthquake (Mw: 5.9) in NW Iran: an assessment of the earthquake using DInSAR time-series and field evidence
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The arc-shaped Bozgush Mountains is a remarkable morphological feature bounded by active faults in northwest Iran. The southern and northern parts of the mountain belt are limited by the South and North Bozgush Fault Zones, which produced numerous destructive earthquakes in historical and instrumental periods. We employed the Sentinel-1A Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) method to map the deformation details of the November 08, 2019, Turkmanchay earthquake (Mw: 5.9) along the South Bozgush Fault Zone to understand the earthquake-triggered surface deformations and seismogenic faulting characteristics. The results of the DInSAR time-series analysis show that subsidence and uplift range from - 5 cm to + 6 cm, respectively. The total line of sight (LOS) displacement was approximately 11 cm. Interferogram fringes and deformation patterns indicate that the direction of the potential seismogenic fault is WNW-ESE. These patterns are consistent with the orientation of the South Bozgush Fault Zone, including primarily right-lateral strike-slip characteristics with reverse components. Continuous patterns of the obtained interferogram fringes indicate that surface rupture did not occur during the earthquake. Our Coulomb failure function results in preferred faults derived from geological structures, indicating that the stress rate was positive and high in several segments of the South and North Bozgush Faults, revealing that the main earthquake event might trigger those faults. The large aftershocks that occurred on the same faults supported our results, and the distribution of aftershocks in the Bozgush Mountains suggests that the WNW-ESE orientation is consistent with the orientation of segments constituting the South Bozgush Fault Zone.

TI  - Developing a satellite-based frost risk model for the Southern African commercial forestry landscape
T2  - SOUTHERN FORESTS-A JOURNAL OF FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Frost is a sporadic meteorological event affecting the productivity of commercial forests in South Africa. Severe frost occurrences may cause irreversible damage to forest stands, slowing down tree growth or leading to tree mortality. Using the Moderate Imaging Spectrometer (spatial resolution: 1 km by 1 km, swath: 1 200 km by 1 200 km) night-time land surface temperatures between 2002 and 2011, this study mapped frost risk classes using six satellite-derived variables at the landscape level. These variables included calculated thresholds of minimum temperature, probability of frost occurrence, mean temperature, total number of frost days, frost duration and the frost severity index. Results show that, using an unsupervised random forest approach with partitioning around medoids, clustering was successful in mapping frost risk using eight optimal clusters. The methodology developed in this study contributes to building a robust frost-risk model to manage and mitigate forest frost damage.

TI  - Prediction of 3D deformation due to large gradient mining subsidence based on InSAR and constraints of IDPIM model
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - After underground coal resources are mined out in mining areas, large-gradient deformation is prone to occur on the ground surface during a short period of time. When the deformation gradient exceeds the threshold value of the gradient monitored by the D-InSAR (Differential Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar) technology, the conventional D-InSAR technology is likely to cause the failure of InSAR (Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar) phase unwrapping algorithms. In this case, neither the conventional D-InSAR technology nor the method of prior model + InSAR can obtain the 3D (three-dimensional) deformation field of mining-induced subsidence. Aiming at these problems, a method of monitoring 3D deformation of mining subsidence with large gradient was developed in this paper, which combines the improved dynamic prediction model and a single pair of D-InSAR. The probability integral method was firstly improved, and its problem of fast convergence at the edge of the subsidence basin was solved. Secondly, according to the geometric projection relationship between the LOS (Light Of Sight) deformation of D-InSAR in the mining area and the 3D surface deformation, the observation condition equation of the mining subsidence monitored by D-InSAR based on the improved dynamic model of PIM (Probability Integral Method) was established. Then, the solving model of prediction parameters of the improved dynamic model of PIM was constructed according to the GA (Genetic Algorithm) theory. Finally, based on the LOS deformation obtained by D-InSAR technology, the 3D deformation of mining subsidence is obtained by the 3D deformation predicting method proposed in this paper. The feasibility of the method was verified by the simulation experiment results. The LOS deformation at the edge of the subsidence basin was obtained by the differential interference processing of data from two images of Sentinel-1A on 16 November 2017 and 10 December 2017 of 1613 working face of Guqiao South Mine. The 3D deformation of the surface in the mining area during this period were obtained by using the method proposed in this paper. The predicted subsidence value was compared with the measured surface subsidence value. The result is as follow: the maximum error value of subsidence was 60 mm, about 9.1% of the maximum value of subsidence, and the fitting error of mean square of subsidence was +/- 26.21 mm. The results show that the predicting 3D deformation method of D-InSAR for large gradient of mining subsidence based on constraints of improved dynamic prediction model proposed in this paper has certain engineering application values.

TI  - Remembering IRS-1C Imaging Payloads: A Giant Leap in Indian Space Imaging System Evolution
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) programme started in 1970s and has grown very systematically in all aspects of sensors, data products and applications for resources survey. Imaging systems onboard IRS-1C satellite, flown in 1995, made a remarkable impact by providing on a single platform, the ability to simultaneously image in multiple spectral channels, multiple geometric resolutions and multiple revisit times in addition to stereo viewing. This development of three-tier imaging system of IRS-1C had been a giant leap in Indian space imaging systems evolution. It required development of compact high-resolution sensor, medium-resolution multispectral system and wide swath imager. This review article brings out the innovative solutions adopted, some of the major challenges faced and new technologies developed. In addition, it briefly provides the foundational research that was carried out in sensors prior to IRS-1C and the improvements carried out in spacecraft systems to cater to the requirements of imaging. The development of IRS-1C made significant impact on the development of subsequent imaging systems, and these aspects are discussed in terms of growth of three-tier imaging, high-resolution systems, etc.

TI  - Inter comparison of post-fire burn severity indices of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 imagery using Google Earth Engine
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires are significant catastrophic events that affect the landscape and vegetation in forested lands. They cause loss of biodiversity, land degradation & ecological imbalance. As the forest fires cause extreme damage to the habitat, it is of utmost necessity to assess the impact of fire on canopy/vegetation. Post-fire assessment is an essential element for finding the effects of fire on vegetation and implementing mitigation strategies. In this article, a Post-fire burn severity assessment was carried out with high-resolution multi-spectral images such as Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 employing Google Earth Engine (GEE) to locate the burnt areas and fire severity. Three commonly used fire severity indices based on pre-fire Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) and post-fire NBR, namely differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR), Relativized Burn Ratio (RBR), and Relativized dNBR (RdNBR) are computed and compared based on their accuracy with the active fire points provided by MODIS & VIIRS. Both Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 exhibited a similar trend in mapping burn severity. The RdNBR resulted in high accuracy over heterogeneous landscapes with 61.52% for Sentinel-2 and 64.1% for Landsat-8 followed by dNBR (41.67% for Sentinel-2 and 47.44% for Landsat-8) and weak performance by RBR with 32.69% for Sentinel-2 and 26.92% for Landsat-8. Hence RdNBR burn severity maps are considered highly appropriate for mapping burnt areas. Even though severity analysis from both Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 is at an acceptable level, the Landsat based burn severity maps provided an adequate assessment of the degree of damage.

TI  - Impact of urban heat island formation on energy consumption in Delhi
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Reducing electricity consumption has emerged as a key area of concern according to the National Mission of Sustainable Habitat of Government of India. Among the Indian cities, Delhi?s electricity consumption is the highest. This paper aims to evaluate the impact of UHI on electricity consumption of Delhi. The study utilizes the satellite land surface temperature (LST) data to compute the district-wise urban heat island intensity (UHII) in Delhi. The electricity consumption and LST data are used to examine the association between them. The scatter plots between per capita net electricity consumption and night-time LST of each district show strong association between them and polynomial curves best fit this association. The equations of these polynomial curves are then used to estimate the electricity consumption of each district assuming their LSTs to be equal to that of the surrounding rural strip (i.e. without UHI effect). The difference between the observed and estimated electricity consumption at observed and assumed (i.e. rural) LSTs provided the increase in electricity consumption due to UHI. The study shows that UHI formation caused an increased electricity consumption of 2600 GWh (i.e. 11.4%) annually on an average over eight districts of Delhi during the period April 2012 to March 2017.

TI  - Conspiracist cognition: chaos, convenience, and cause for concern
T2  - JOURNAL FOR CULTURAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - There has been much concern with the abundance of misinformation in public discourse. Although misinformation has always played a role in political debate, its character has shifted from support for a specific position to a 'shock and chaos' stream of misinformation and conspiracy theories. Exposure to conspiracy theories can have considerable adverse impact on society. I argue that scholars therefore have a responsibility to combat conspiracy theories and misinformation generally. Exercising this responsibility requires an understanding of the varied rhetorical roles of conspiracy theories. Here I focus on instances in which people reject unequivocal scientific evidence and invoke conspiracy theories, or radical anti-institutional positions, based on ideological imperatives. I argue that those positions do not always reflect true attitudes. Instead, people may deploy extreme rhetoric as a pragmatic tool of political expression. I investigate this possibility by focusing on the role of conspiracy theories in the rejection of science. Conspiracist cognition and rhetoric violate the epistemic standards that underpin science. Ironically, this violation of epistemic standards renders conspiracy theories useful as a rationally deployed tool that serves political purposes. I present a study that confirms that conspiracy theories can be deployed to support worldview-motivated denial of science. I provide suggestions how scholars can debunk or defang conspiratorial rhetoric.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SPATIAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Winter fallow farmland is increasing dramatically in some regions in China. Our goal was three-fold: (1) to develop a consistent procedure to identify winter fallow farmland from satellite images; (2) to examine the driving factors of winter fallow farmland; and (3) to identify additional determinants affecting the spatial distribution of winter fallow farmland. We applied geographically weighted regression to examine the spatial interactions of these driving factors. High percentages of winter fallow farmland in the north-eastern region were largely attributed to elevation, income, farmland area, and slope. Geography had a strong impact on the occurrence of fallow farmland.

I argue that the Iraq war served as a formative event in the development of Obama's worldview. He derived distinct lessons from this policy failure, leading him to articulate a restrictive set of conditions that should be met before the United States considered intervening in the internal politics of another nation, absent a direct threat to national security. I undertake a detailed examination of two case studies - the administration's debates leading to the 2011 intervention in Libya and the decision not to intervene in Syria in 2013 - and demonstrate how the lessons of Iraq shaped Obama's policy choices at critical junctures in the deliberations.

TI  - Prediction of Urban Heat Island Effect over Jinan City Using the Markov-Cellular Automata Model Combined with Urban Biophysical Descriptors
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The feasibility of integrating urban biophysical descriptors into land surface temperature (LST) prediction in a rapidly urbanizing region, Jinan, China, was explored. We combined several models, including LST and an urban biophysical descriptor generation algorithm, through regression analysis and cellular automata-Markov modeling. First, the relationship between the indices, including the soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI), index-based built-up index (IBI), and the LST was established; then, the future LST was simulated and predicted. The results showed that LST has a negative correlation with SAVI (R-2 = 0.905, P < 0.01) and MNDWI (R-2 = 0.911, P < 0.01) while having a high positive correlation with IBI (R-2 = 0.801, P < 0.01). Additionally, correlations between the simulated values and retrieval of different land use/cover types show good agreement, with a mean R from 0.6 to 0.9, such that this method can be used to simulate future urban heat island effects. If the development trend remains unchanged, the urban heat island effect of Jinan will continue to strengthen by 2030 because of the increase in impervious ground and reduction in green vegetation. These results can provide guidance for Jinan's urban construction and planning, which promote sustainable urbanization.

TI  - Using enhanced data co-registration to update Spanish National Forest Inventories (NFI) and to reduce training data under LiDAR-assisted inference
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The estimation of forest attributes at the local scale as well as in wall-to-wall approaches benefits from the integration of remote sensing data such as airborne laser scanning (ALS). A poor level of spatial co-registration between ALS data and ground National Forest Inventories (NFI) data has traditionally restricted the application of area-based (ABA) methods. Improving the reliability of the spatial co-registration in NFI can enhance the statistical inference. We evaluated the improvement of ABA models in six forest ecosystems in Spain when upgrading NFI plot positions using commercial-grade global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). The new ABA models based on more accurate NFI positioning reduced the root mean squared error (RMSE) for mean stand volume and basal area by 9.3% and 9.4%, respectively, and 2.1% for mean tree height compared to ABA models based on previous NFI positioning records. The model error and its variability showed a major decrement for the upgraded ABA models when iteratively fitting and using cross-validation. The variability of RMSE estimates decreased at a faster rate compared to ABA models based on less accurate NFI positions. Hence, we derived the minimum sampling intensity needed to control the variability of the RMSE. The results showed that upgraded ABA models required fewer training sample plots, although results were dependent on the assessed forest attribute and the forest ecotype. The observed marginal benefit of improving data co-registration can increase the operational efficiency of NFI designs. With this work, we provide further insights for the measuring of NFI samples considering both ALS-assisted inference and the effect of forest structure.

TI  - Slum Extraction from High Resolution Satellite Data using Mathematical Morphology based approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes different mathematical morphology-based approaches to detect the urban slums from urban buildings using Very High Resolution (VHR) satellite images. Due to the rapid growth of urbanization activities, slum regions are the most evolving regions in South India whose locations are improper in official maps and statistics. Thus, automatic location identification of urban slums provides vital information for urban planners to formulate pro-poor policies and allocate resources properly. To detect the slums automatically from VHR satellite images, Multi Shape-Multi Size-Morphological Profile (MSh-MSi-MP) technique is proposed in this work. The development of this algorithm is motivated by modelling the urban slums using the conventional Morphological Profile (MP) which fails to model different structures in an image. On the other hand, the proposed MSh-MSi-MP is built by the sequence of morphological opening and closing profiles with different shapes and different sizes of structuring elements. Though MSh-MSi-MP yields high accuracy, some open areas in informal settlements and roofline structures of formal settlements are still classified as slums. To optimize these misclassification results, Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis (MSPA) is used as a post-processing operation. The four different very high-resolution satellite images of Madurai city, South India acquired by WorldView-2 Sensor (1.84 m) proved the ability of the proposed approach to identify urban slums from other features by generating higher classification accuracy than any other methods.

TI  - Contemporary comparative assessment of atmospheric correction influence on radiometric indices between Sentinel-2A and Landsat 8 imagery
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric correction is used to remove atmospheric effects on remotely sensed imagery, so it could change its properties and, in the end, all the derived results from it. The objective of this research was to analyse the effect of different atmospheric corrections on radiometric indices using Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 satellite. Radiometric indices used in this research are Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), Normalized difference water index (NDWI), Soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) and Modified soil-adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI). The analysis was done using five pairs of contemporary images from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2. On the basis of those images, our results indicate that NDVI values between those two datasets did not have a statistically significant difference (p > 0.05) and have the strongest correlation for all used atmospheric corrections (r1 = 0.989, r2 = 0.967, r3 = 0.983). We concluded that it is possible to combine radiometric indices values from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 data.

TI  - The enduring legacy of Indigenous parrhesiastes
T2  - HIGHER EDUCATION RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Indigenous academics are often faced with a balancing act between the danger and risk of critiquing the institutions within which they reside, and the duty or obligation they feel to do so. As Indigenous Maori academics located within three different business schools across Aotearoa New Zealand, our work in both research and teaching is often highly critical of the institution, which can leave us exposed, vulnerable and grasping to hold onto a fragile sense of identity in the academy. We use the conceptual framework of parrhesia as a critical response to the institutional landscape of business schools and higher education in general. Parrhesia can be described as free speech directly critiquing hegemonic norms and practices. In this article, we share our experiences as episodes of parrhesia, as voice and action derived from our Indigenous worldview, to illustrate the utility of Indigenous parrhesiastes. Finally, we suggest that parrhesia offers us as Indigenous academics mode and mechanism with which we can challenge institutional power structures in different ways to effect change through the advance of safe and purposeful inclusion of Indigenous epistemologies, identities and pedagogies in the academy.

TI  - Recognition of different yield potentials among rain-fed wheat fields before harvest using remote sensing
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - An algorithm was proposed to classify wheat fields into high-productive and low-productive classes using satellite images according to a threshold value for rain-fed wheat ETa in the anthesis stage. Since the classification process was based on the ETa values in the rain-fed wheat pixels, an algorithm was proposed to map wheat fields using the combination of MODIS and Landsat-8 images. The wheat area mapping method included two major processes in which the first one used a step by step elimination process of non-wheat pixels which did not follow the standard wheat vegetation index time series; the second one used supervised classification methods for detecting the rain-fed wheat pixels. The assessment of the wheat area map was performed statistically using surveyed wheat plots. After detecting the wheat parcels, the threshold value was determined using a frequency analysis on actual evapotranspiration values in the parcels. The rain-fed wheat ETa values estimated from the SEBAL algorithm and were compared to the results from the Eagleman-Affholder method and MOD16A2 products. To assess if the wheat fields in productivity classes have been categorized correctly, yield values in the two classes were compared with each other. The rain-fed wheat yield was estimated using the light use efficiency model and compared to provincial census data for accuracy assessment. Results showed that the overall accuracy, Kappa coefficient, and F1 score values for the 250-m resolution map from the MODIS images were 82, 0.61, and 0.71, respectively. In the same order, these statistics for the 30-m resolution map from the Landsat-8 images were 92, 0.62, and 0.77, respectively. Both the SEBAL and the Eagleman-Affholder methods closely estimated the average wheat ETa value in the anthesis stage equal to 2.4 mm/day. The mean of the rain-fed wheat yield value from the LUE model in 2015 was 10% lower than the census data. Relying on the low amount of the absolute error between the LUE model and the census data, the mean of the yield values in both high-productive and low productive classes were compared with together. Results showed that the mean amount of yield in high productive class was 33% (271 kg/ha) more than that of in low-productive class.

TI  - Current Status of Advance Care Planning and End-of-life Communication for Patients with Advanced and Metastatic Breast Cancer
T2  - ONCOLOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Advance care planning (ACP) is a process that supports adults in understanding and sharing their personal values, life goals, and preferences regarding future medical care. We examined the current status of ACP and end-of-life (EOL) communication between oncologists and patients with metastatic breast cancer.Materials and Methods We conducted a survey among 41 institutions that specialize in oncology by using an online tool in October 2019. Participants (118 physicians) from 38 institutions completed a 39-item questionnaire that measured facility type and function; physicians' background and clinical approach, education about EOL communication, and understanding about ACP; and the current situation of ACP and EOL discussions.Results Ninety-eight responses concerning physicians' engagement in ACP with patients were obtained. Seventy-one (72%) answered that they had engaged in ACP. Among these, 23 (33%) physicians used a structured format to facilitate the conversation in their institutions, and only 6 (8%) settled triggers or sentinel events for the initiation of ACP. In the multivariable analysis, only the opportunity to learn communication skills was associated with physicians' engagement with ACP (odds ratio: 2.8, 95% confidence interval: 1.1-7.0). The frequency and timing of communication about ACP and EOL care with patients substantially varied among the oncologists. Communication about patients' life expectancy was less frequent compared with other topics.Conclusion The opportunity to improve EOL communication skills promoted physicians' engagement with ACP among patients with metastatic/advanced breast cancer. However, there were still substantial variabilities in the method, frequency, and timing of ACP and EOL communication among the oncologists.Implications for Practice This study found that the opportunity to improve end-of-life (EOL) communication skills promoted physicians' engagement in advance care planning (ACP) among patients with metastatic/advanced breast cancer. All oncologists who treat said patients are encouraged to participate in effective education programs concerning EOL communication skills. In clinical practice, there are substantial variabilities in the method, frequency, and timing of ACP and EOL communication among oncologists. As recommended in several clinical guidelines, the authors suggest a system that identifies patients who require conversations about their care goals, a structured format to facilitate the conversations, and continuous measurement for improving EOL care and treatment.

TI  - Measuring relational values: do people in Greater Tokyo appreciate place-based nature and general nature differently?
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Relational values have been gaining increasing attention in recent years, overcoming the dichotomy of intrinsic and instrumental values, and allowing more pluralistic perspectives in evaluating nature and nature's contributions to people. Although various theoretical and qualitative studies on relational values have been published, studies based on empirical evidence are limited. Building on the conceptual framework presented by Chan et al. (Proc Natl Acad Sci 113(6):1462-1465, 2016, ), which included several constructs of relational values, this study aimed to quantitatively explore the structure of relational values. A questionnaire was developed based on a review of existing quantitative studies on the preferences, principles, and virtues associated with the human-nature relationship that are included in the framework. The sample consisted of a total of 1862 residents of the Greater Tokyo Area in Japan. Exploratory factor analysis (n = 931) and confirmatory factor analysis (n = 931) were conducted to explore and validate the structure of relational values. Results supported a six-factor model that was mostly in line with the conceptual framework based on Chan et al. (Proc Natl Acad Sci 113(6):1462-1465, 2016, ): individual identity, satisfaction from local stewardship (place-based stewardship eudaimonic), satisfaction from being eco-friendly (general stewardship eudaimonic), worldview, social responsibility, and social cohesion. This finding suggests that the relational values proposed by Chan et al. (Proc Natl Acad Sci 113(6):1462-1465, 2016, ) are likely to be present over a wide age range. Satisfaction factors were highly correlated with each other yet extracted as individual factors. The results suggest that except for stewardship eudaimonic, people are unlikely to distinguish between relational values about place-based nature and nature in general.

TI  - Remote sensing of urban green spaces: A review
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Review
AB  - A knowledge of the characteristics of urban green spaces (UGSs) such as their abundance, spatial distribution and species composition, has an important role in a range of fields such as urban geography, urban planning and public health. Remote sensing technologies have made great contributions to the analysis of UGSs. However, a comprehensive review of the current status, challenges and potential in this area is lacking. In this paper, we scrutinize major trends in remote sensing approaches for characterising UGSs and evaluate the effectiveness of different remote sensing systems and analytical techniques. The results suggest that the number of studies focusing on mapping UGSs and classifying species within UGSs have increased rapidly over recent decades. However, there are fewer examples of non-tree species mapping, change detection, biomass and carbon mapping and vegetation health assessment within UGSs. Most studies have focused on UGSs (mainly trees) which cover large areal extents, with fewer studies of smaller patches such as street trees, urban gardens, recreational spaces and public parks, even though collectively such patches can cover substantial areas. Hence, we encourage future investigations to focus on a wider variety of different UGSs, particularly small-scale UGSs. We also recommend that research focuses on developing more effective image time series analysis techniques, methods to capture the complexity of UGSs and the use of SAR in studies of UGSs. At the same time, further research is needed to fully exploit remote sensing data within thematic applications such as monitoring changes in UGSs over time, quantifying biomass and carbon mapping and assessing vegetation health.

TI  - Spark-based adaptive Mapreduce data processing method for remote sensing imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Existing Hadoop-based remote sensing data processing approaches are insufficient for efficiently meeting the requirements of applications, especially when large remote sensing datasets are involved. This paper proposes an adaptive Spark-based remote sensing data processing method on the cloud that achieves improved efficiency and stability. The method includes a remote sensing data storage scheme on the cloud that employs the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and adaptive MapReduce mechanisms for use with remote sensing data; specifically, a mapping strategy for use with image tiles, a reducing strategy for use with adjacent tiles, and a mechanism for merging the results are proposed. An image classification experiment is conducted using Land Remote-Sensing Satellite System (Landsat) Thematic Mapper (TM) data, and the proposed method displays improved performance, stability and scalability compared to the existing Hadoop-based method. Hence, the proposed method is more suitable for processing large volumes of remote sensing data.

TI  - Land use change in the Ecuadorian paramo: The impact of expanding agriculture on soil carbon storage
T2  - ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Andean paramo is notable for high soil carbon storage and its contribution to ecosystem services. However, the paramo's ability to maintain high soil carbon levels is threatened by land use change from tussock grassland and shrublands to agricultural uses. A chronosequence study was conducted in the paramo around Quito, Ecuador, to determine the rate of soil carbon loss from traditional fallow agriculture. In parallel, a land use and land cover classification of Landsat images was used to measure the change in agricultural areas between 1991 and 2017. There was a significant negative relationship between the time since initial cultivation of a field and soil C: Older agricultural sites had significantly less C compared to natural ecosystems due to an average loss of 0.045 percent soil C per year. Undisturbed sites had significantly more soil C than cultivated sites but not pastures or fallow fields, indicating that cultivation is the most detrimental stage of the fallow agricultural cycle for soil C storage. There was an 838 percent increase in cultivated land between 1991 and 2017 but a 10 percent decrease in pastures, indicating a trend away from traditional regenerative agriculture toward land use types that lead to substantial losses in soil carbon.

TI  - Agricultural Field Detection from Satellite Imagery Using the Combined Otsu's Thresholding Algorithm and Marker-Controlled Watershed-Based Transform
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An accurate detection of agricultural fields is often needed for agricultural-related applications, such as subsidies monitoring, field-based crop yield estimation and agricultural statistics extraction. High-resolution space images have become the fundamental source to extract agricultural field boundaries. Manual boundary delineation is not practical. In this study, we present an approach to detect agricultural fields from satellite images on the basis of agricultural field blocks. An agricultural field block consists of one or more fields that are owned by the farmers. The approach combines the Otsu's thresholding algorithm and marker-controlled watershed (MCW)-based segmentation. First, the well-separated field segments within a field block being considered are detected through recursive processing of the Otsu's thresholding algorithm. Then, these distinct field segments are used to generate a marker image, and further extraction of individual fields is carried out through a marker-controlled watershed (MCW)-based segmentation. The approach was tested using 10-m resolution Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT)-5 multi-spectral (XS) image, 4-m resolution IKONOS XS image, 2.40-m resolution QuickBird XS image, and 0.60-m resolution QuickBird pan-sharpened (PS) image. The results were evaluated using the reference field boundary dataset. The achieved overall accuracies were 89.7, 83.2, 81.0, and 77.4% for the IKONOS XS, QuickBird XS, SPOT-5 XS, and QuickBird PS images, respectively. The results are promising and indicate that the approach can be used for the extraction of agricultural fields from space imagery.

TI  - Drought monitoring of the maize planting areas in Northeast and North China Plain
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing technology can cost-effectively access to a wide range of real-time land surface spatial information, therefore it is widely used in agricultural crops monitoring. And timely assessment of drought stress using remote sensing is valuable for improving the crop management level. In this study, the drought stress was evaluated in the maize planting areas of the Northeast and North China Plain using satellite remote sensing technology. The absolute distance index was used to identify the spatial pattern of the maize planting areas using the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) derived enhanced vegetation index data that processed with Savitzky-Golay filter. The temperature vegetation drought index (TVDI) was derived from MODIS normalized difference vegetation index and land surface temperature data. Simultaneously, soil moisture content (SMC) was obtained for an eight-day period and matched with satellite remote sensing data to characterize the drought stress of maize. After estimating the field capacity and wilting point, the SMC was further transformed into the real available water content (RAWC) of the soil. Our results indicated that negative correlations between RAWC and TVDI was observed for the 0-10 cm (R-2 = 0.594) and 20-30 cm (R-2 = 0.641) soil layers, respectively, which was significantly better than the correlation between the SMC and TVDI in the 0-10 (R-2 = 0.396) and 20-30 cm (R-2 = 0.499) soil layers. Moreover, the sensitive period regarding the maize water demand were identified (day of year 161, 169, 233, 241, and 249) via the linear regression analysis of the measured maize yield and TVDI for eight-day intervals. Furthermore, the weights of the water demand of maize in different growth stages was determined via multiple linear regression analysis, and a comprehensive drought index (TVDISW) was established to evaluate the drought stress in the whole maize growth period. Eventually, a comprehensive analysis for the drought stress in the study area was conducted combined with various environmental factors. Furthermore, the performance of this method was independent of the meteorological and field survey data, which may facilitate the mapping of drought monitoring of crops planting areas at a large scale.

TI  - Using an explicit multi-feature decision tree for wetland information extraction in Qomolangma national nature reserve
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Qomolangma National Nature Reserve (QNNR) has complex geomorphological characteristics of the high altitude Tibetan Plateau and aunique plateau wetland environment. In order to extract the wetland information effectively and accurately, this research utilizes an explicit decision tree (DT) classification strategy that incorporates multiple feature nodes by using the Landsat-8 OLI imagery as the main data source to interpret the spectral signatures and spatial distribution of the wetlands, and to construct acomprehensive DT classification process for wetland information extraction in QNNR. The multiple feature nodes include snow cover, non-wetland distribution, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), digital elevation model (DEM), land surface temperature (LST) and slope. This strategy produces amore accurate wetland classification in QNNR where there are various interfering factors such as snow, mountain shadows, mineralized regions, grassland and woodland. The method is straightforward and easy to implement. Its classification result has an overall accuracy of 92.75%. This method could be applied to the plateaus with vertical-step ecosystems.

TI  - Performance of random forest and buffer analysis of Sentinel-2 data for modelling soil salinity in the Lower-Cheliff plain (Algeria)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Modelling approaches are becoming an efficient tool in the forecasting of the salinization spread impact on the local and global scales. In the Lower-Cheliff plain, updating the information on soil salinity expansion is more than required as it continues to damage the agricultural environment in there. Through this study, we adopted an artificial methodology that consists of a combination of buffer analysis using Sentinel-2 data and machine learning modelling to assess their aptitude in the prediction and mapping of soil salinity. The adopted random forest (RF) algorithm included the reflectance information from of the bands from Blue (rho(Blue)), Green (rho(Green)), Red (rho(Red)), Near infrared (NIR), Vegetation red-edge (VRE) and Shortwave Infrared (SWIR), optimized with the geospatial buffering based on the 91 soil random samples collected during the summer of 2019 and measured for the Electrical Conductivity (EC) in the laboratory. The outputs from the geospatial buffering refined the goodness of the correlation between field data and the variables set from bands reflectance and selected salinity indices. The obtained coefficient of determination (R-2) with Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Partial Least Square regression (PLS) models proved an improvement in the multivariable prediction of soil salinity with the optimized Sentinel-2 data (R-2 = 0.61 and 0.68 + RMSE of 3.36 and 2.87 dS m(-1) respectively), compared to the results from the 2015 multiple regression model, Given the high values of R (2) = 0.77 and 0.95 and the low values of RMSE = 2.29 and 1.18 dS m(-1) respectively; the RF regressor was very efficient in predicting EC either with all variables or with selected variables from the variable importance measure based on the mean decrease accuracy (MDA). The random forest classifier performed top of the range classification with an overall Accuracy (OA) about 99%, estimating that over 75% of the study area surface is suffering from the salinization extent.

TI  - PolSAR additive noise estimation based on shadow regions
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Additive noise results from the thermal noise of the radar receiver or antenna, and often has an adverse effect on the subsequent applications. To weaken the influence of additive noise, it is crucial to know the actual additive noise level. However, the system noise level is not always provided in some single- or full-polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) products. As one of the typical low backscattering objects (LBOs) in PolSAR images, shadow occurs as soon as the depression angle of the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system reaches a more value than the slope away from the radar illumination, and thus provides a feasible way to measure additive noise. This paper proposes a framework to automatically extract shadow regions by a trained model using the bag of words (BoW) model with data from different scenes. The additive noise can then be estimated across a large area based on the extracted shadow. The experiments based on single- and full-polarimetric Radarsat-2 data suggest that the shadow-based framework is an effective way to estimate additive noise.

TI  - Integrated evaluation on multi-scale land surface temperature grading and bio-temperature suitability-a case study in Tianjin China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The suitable thermal environment is a prerequisite for biological survival. In order to evaluate the change of land surface temperature (LST) and its effect on organisms, in this study, the Land satellite (Landsat) series data was used to invert the LST from 1988 to 2018 in Tianjin. The main surface features were extracted from the remotely sensed images using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) and normalized difference impervious surface index (NDISI). A multi-scale temperature grading method based on biological heat reaction was proposed to classify the LST. In terms of the suitability of the organism to temperature, the land surface temperature suitability (LSTS) model was established based on the niche suitability analysis method, and the suitability of organisms to temperature was evaluated based on the model. In the aspect of land area change, both the land surface temperature area (LSTA) model and the average relative contribution (ARC) were proposed to comprehensively evaluate the impact of the area change of surface features on LST. The results indicated that the temperature suitability of most organisms had decreased. The change of LST was related to the comprehensive change of surface features. In conclusion, the rise of LST had adverse effect on most organisms in Tianjin. Limiting the occupation of water area and cultivated land may inhibit the continuous rise in LST. Besides, the evaluation method novelty proposed in this study could provide new ideas to study the development trend of spatial objects in their environment thus would be applied widely.

T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - With the maturation of satellite technology, Hyperspectral Remote Sensing (HRS) platforms have developed from the initial ground-based and airborne platforms into spaceborne platforms, which greatly promotes the civil application of HRS imagery in the fields of agriculture, forestry, and environmental monitoring. China is playing an important role in this evolution, especially in recent years, with the successful launch and operation of a series of civil hyperspectral spacecraft and satellites, including the Shenzhou-3 spacecraft, the Gaofen-5 satellite, the SPARK satellite, the Zhuhai-1 satellite network for environmental and resources monitoring, the FengYun series of satellites for meteorological observation, and the Chang'E series of spacecraft for planetary exploration. The Chinese spaceborne HRS platforms have various new characteristics, such as the wide swath width, high spatial resolution, wide spectral range, hyperspectral satellite networks, and microsatellites. This paper focuses on the recent progress in Chinese spaceborne HRS, from the aspects of the typical satellite systems, the data processing, and the applications. In addition, the future development trends of HRS in China are also discussed and analyzed.

TI  - The origin and history of shamanistic death ritual material culture : Focusing on the symbol of the shamanistic death ritual decoration

AB  - The purpose of this study is to examine the origin and history of shamanistic death ritual material culture, focusing on the shamanistic death ritual decoration, in order to identify the belief system inherent in it. Although focusing on material culture, the process before the expression of its meaning was examined in consideration of the acceptance of other religious worldviews and social situations.The place of the death ritual is a non-routine space where the present world and other worlds coexist. The postmortem of the dead can be condensed into these terms- journey and other worlds. The journey is related to the intermediate role of connecting the dead in present world-the other world and when moving through space in the other world. The other world includes the next world related to sin and judgement, hell, and the Western Paradise. The essential purpose of the death ritual in shamanism is to ensure a positive future of reincarnation or paradise through judgement after the safe delivery of the dead to the other world. Accordingly, it was analyzed that the ritual of death was decorated with symbols related to Gods of the other world, the journey to the other world, and the other world.In the process of accepting the Buddhist Death Rite Worldview, shamanism reinterpreted it based on shamanism's unique belief system and established the own Death Rite Worldview. In general, it was analyzed that symbols based on Amitabha's ideas were introduced from the Tang Dynasty to the Silla Dynasty, and that the Ten Kings were introduced to the Goryeo Dynasty in the period of transition from Tang to Song Dynasty. It is assumed that shamanism accepted it during the period when Buddhist rituals were common, and most conceptions of Gods and symbols related to other worlds and journeys were accepted around the 12th century. It was also estimated that the worldview and ritual establishment of shamanistic death rites were related to the increase in death ritual consumption due to two big wars and the spread of plague between the 16th and 19th centuries. The place of death ritual has become a space for both the present world and the other world, and it can be said that the worldview of shamanism has been embodied through the shamanistic decorations representing the other world.

AB  - The article touches upon philological analysis of the novel written by Soviet writer and mathematician I. Grekova (1907‑2002). The main topic of the novel is a description of daily research institution life. It seems interesting that music theme takes an important place in the book with scientific life idea. However, it demonstrates authors personal worldview and has a connection with her life experience. According to this point the text is a combination of individual and general. It includes peculiar understanding projected on real life.The target of the paper is to show personal literary MUSIC concept. It is represented on different fictional text’s levels such as conceptual, denotative, emotive and even stylistic. It is spoken in details about concept content which consists of many parts (zones) and the verbal representatives.On the one hand, the majority of the parts are common for general linguistic concept and its personal literary interpretation. It can be found in the explanatory dictionaries or encyclopedias: music is a piece of art, music is sounding, music is an instrument etc.On the other – the unique author’s comprehension of the concept occurs on the on different levels, firstly on the apprising level. For example, classical music estimated as a high, special music, pop music – as common one. Consequently the sounding of classics is pleasant for hearing, pop music sounds often are annoying in contrast. The felling arising after classics audition appear to be rich, however poor feelings is due to pop perception. Besides the classics follower intellectual abilities and moral qualities turn up much higher than pop fans. It caused by the necessity of special music education to understand the classics difficult code.

TI  - A Rock-fall Early Warning System Based on Logistic Regression Model
T2  - INTELLIGENT AUTOMATION AND SOFT COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rock-fall is a natural hazard that results in many economic damages and human losses annually, and thus proactive policies to prevent rock-fall hazard are needed. Such policies require predicting the rock-fall occurrence and deciding to alert the road users at the appropriate time. Thus, this study develops a rock-fall early warning system based on logistic regression model. In this system, the logistic regression model is used to predict the rock-fall occurrence. The decision-making algorithm is used to classify the hazard levels and delivers early warning action. This study adopts two criteria to evaluate the system predictive performance, including overall prediction accuracy measures based on a confusion matrix and the area under a receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The results show that the correct prediction accuracy was approximately 79.9%, and the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.85 during the model training. During the validation process, the overall accuracy is 81.0%, and (AUC) is 0.90. The result indicates that this system has high predictive power, strong robustness, and stable performance. That confirms the usefulness of a logistic regression model for predicting a rock-fall occurrence probability.

T2  - ISJ-INVERTEBRATE SURVIVAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Oxidative stress represents a main regularly informed mechanism of nanoparticles (NPs) toxicity. The present work was designed to evaluate the oxidative stress in haemolymph and digestive gland of snail Helix aspersa after exposure to different dermal doses: 10.8 and 2.17 mu g snail(-1) for titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO(2)NPs), and 8.0 and 1.6 mu g snail(-1) for Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes (SWCNTs) during 48 h. The results indicated that, both nanomaterials (NMs) induced significant increases in malondialdehyde (MDA) as biomarker for lipid peroxidation (LPO). However, SWCNTs induced significant decline in reduced glutathione (GSH) content compared with the control. Catalase (CAT) activity significantly increased for the all treatments greater than the control. On the other hand, activities of glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) slightly decreased for both NMs. Nanoparticles (NPs) of TiO2 increased activity of glutathione reductase (GR) in both haemolymph and digestive gland homogenates, while SWCNTs treatments exhibited activities did not exceed the value of the control (0.08 U mg(-1) protein). The present findings indicate that, alterations of antioxidant enzymes activity and levels of MDA and GSH are recognized to oxidative stress. Consequently, the use of snail, H. aspersa can offer a respectable sentinel model to assess ecotoxicological effects of NMs on the gastropods.

TI  - Integrated studies to identify site-specific parameters for environmentally benign mining operations: A case study from the Sukari Gold Mine, Egypt
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study integrates observations fromfield and remote sensing data, along with geochemical and isotopic analyses, to assess the environmental impacts of cyanidation and mining activities in the Sukari gold mine (SGM), Eastern Desert, Egypt, in particular, and the orogenic gold deposits of the Arabian-Nubian Shield (ANS) in general. Our findings indicate: (1) groundwater flows south to north in the highly fractured basement aquifer related to the brittle deformation associatedwith the Najd Fault System; (2) massive gabbroic bodies separate the fractured basement aquifer into east andwest conduits; (3) the tailings storage facility (TSF) pond and leach pad were constructed over the west conduit; and (4) cyanide-richwastewater has leaked downward through tears and cuts in the lining of the TSF pond into the fractured aquifer and cyanide contaminants have migrated northward along the west conduit. Evidence for the latter includes: (1) toxic concentrations of cyanide (total: 0.018-9.4 mg/L; free weak-acid dissociable: 0.003-0.7 mg/L) were observed in groundwater samples north of the TSF pond; (2) similarities in electrical conductivity (EC) values and chloride/bromide (Cl-/Br-) ratios between groundwater north of the pond (EC: 88.8 mS/cm; Cl-/Br-: 346 to 363) and those of the TSF pond water (mean EC: 99 mS/cm; Cl-/Br-: 242 to 383) were observed; (3) the geochemical (e.g., sodium [Na+], Cl-) and isotopic compositions (delta O-18 and delta H-2 values) of groundwater are consistent with mixing of groundwater upgradient from the SGM with isotopically enriched pond water; and (4) cyanide contamination could not have resulted from an overflow of the TSF pond during flash flood events, given that rainfall is negligible and effective flood control systems are in place. Our findings show that the international codes/regulations do not fully address site-specific characteristics and highlight the importance of considering these parameters in mining of orogenic gold deposits in the ANS.

T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The goal of this study is to provide a fine detection and monitoring of olive orchard trees over large areas to anticipate any damage. We developed an original method to assess the spatiotemporal dynamics of biophysical parameters in the olive orchards using satellite observations and radiative transfer models. Sentinel-2 time-series data collected over a four-year period were fused with Planet images from the same time period to enhance the temporal trends in olive orchards in the Sfax region located in southern Tunisia. These images also served to extract soil spectrum variations required by the 3-D discrete anisotropic radiative transfer model to account for canopy background effect. As a backward model, we developed an original technique based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo method that has the advantage of being able to model sensor noise and account for spatial and temporal regularization. It allows retrieving key parameters such as leaf area index (LAI), chlorophyll content, water content, and mesophyll structure. Taking advantage of 1) the Sentinel-2 images downscaled to a moderate resolution of 80 m to ensure representative pixels of the local mixing (i.e., trees and soil); 2) the appropriate soil signature derived from high spatial and spectral resolution image; and 3) the accuracy of the direct and inverse modeling, it was possible to retrieve the plant properties even when LAI values are less than 0.14. Indeed, our inversion results show that the estimated parameters are strongly correlated especially with the LAI field measurements with R-2 =0.9937.

AB  - This study was conducted to monitor the manifestations of land degradation in the area located within the administrative boundaries of the governorates of Dhi Qar, Qadisiyah and Muthanna, which has a surface of 37,984 km and specified by the space coordinates of Path = 167 and 38 = Row with the help of remote sensing technology through the use of satellite visuals from Landsat 8 satellite with field observations. A map of soil units was prepared using the software Arc GIS. Soil samples were taken from each site for physical and chemical analysis. The results obtained from the research showed that when using the spectral index represented by the plant difference index (NDVI) its value ranged between (-0.68 to 0.78). It was found that the study area suffers from a lack of vegetation cover by 72%. As for the salinity index values, they ranged between 0.68 to-0.78. Therefore, the study area suffers from a chemical deterioration represented by the salinity of the soil, estimated at 61%. For arid lands, the index ranged between-399.4 to-28.30, and the total surface of decertified lands represented 45%. As for the land degradation index, its value ranged from 1.21 to 2.84 and the percentage of degraded lands was estimated at 75% of the total lands that were study.

TI  - Prediction of seasonal urban thermal field variance index using machine learning algorithms in Cumilla, Bangladesh
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The intensity and formation of urban heat island (UHI) phenomena are closely related to land use/land cover (LULC) and land surface temperature (LST) change. The effect of UHI can be described quantitatively by urban thermal field variance index (UTFVI). For measuring urban health and ensuring sustainable development, the analysis of LST and UTFVI are receiving boosted attention. This study predicted LULC, seasonal (summer & winter) LST, and UTFVI variations using machine learning algorithms (MLAs) in Cumilla City Corporation (CCC), Bangladesh. Landsat 4-5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI satellite images were used for 1999, 2009, and 2019 to predict future scenarios for 2029 and 2039. MLAs such as Cellular Automata (CA) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methods were used to predict the future change in LULC, LST, and UTFVI. The result suggests that, in the year 2029 and 2039, the urban area will likely to be increased by around 8 % and 11 %, where significant decrease will be taken place in green cover by 9 % and 14 %. If the rapid urban growth continues, more than 30 % of the CCC area will likely to be experienced more than 33 degrees C temperature and strongest UTFVI effect in the year 2029 and 2039. In addition, an average 4 degrees C higher LST was recorded in the urban area compared with vegetation cover. In urban construction practice, avoiding concentrated impermeable layers (built-up areas) and increasing green covers, are effective ways of mitigating the effect of UTFVI. This study will contribute in achieving sustainable development and provide useful insights to understand the complex relationship among different elements of urban environments and promotion of city competence.

TI  - Assessment of irrigation expansion and implications for water resources by using RS and GIS techniques in the Lake Tana Basin of Ethiopia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding irrigation expansion and its implications on water availability is critical for development of decision support tools for sustainable water resources planning. Irrigation expansion in the Lake Tana Basin of Ethiopia from 1986 to 2016 was examined using image classification from thematic maps and remote sensing imagery (Landsat5-8 TM/ETM+, OLI). The soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) imagery was used to identify irrigated cropland based on greenness. Irrigation water consumption was determined by calculating irrigation water requirements of the major crops grown with irrigation and using the estimated irrigated land size of the basin. Irrigated croplands have increased in area from 55 to 65 % in the last past 30 years (from 1986 to 2016). The classification obtained is accurate to the level of 89.6% and Kappa coefficient of 0.83. The Landsat imagery is useful in tracking of the spatiotemporal patterns of irrigated croplands for water management purposes, especially in data deficient areas dotted sparsely by small holder irrigated farms. The results indicated that irrigation consumption in the basin increased from 0.380 km(3) year(-1) in 1986 to 0.798 km(3) year(-1) in 2016. It is found that the available water cannot sustain the projected irrigation expansion unless alternative water sources are found. Also, more precise irrigation technologies have to be implemented to minimize water losses.

AB  - Massive wildfires not only in Australia, but also worldwide are burning millions of hectares of forests and green land affecting the social, ecological, and economical situation. Widely used indices-based threshold methods like Normalized Burned Ratio (NBR) require a huge amount of data preprocessing and are specific to the data capturing source. State-of-the-art deep learning models, on the other hand, are supervised and require domain experts knowledge for labeling the data in huge quantity. These limitations make the existing models difficult to be adaptable to new variations in the data and capturing sources. In this work, we have proposed an unsupervised deep learning based architecture to map the burnt regions of forests by learning features progressively. The model considers small patches of satellite imagery and classifies them into burnt and not burnt. These small patches are concatenated into binary masks to segment out the burnt region of the forests. The proposed system is composed of two modules: 1) a state-of-the-art deep learning architecture for feature extraction and 2) a clustering algorithm for the generation of pseudo labels to train the deep learning architecture. The proposed method is capable of learning the features progressively in an unsupervised fashion from the data with pseudo labels, reducing the exhausting efforts of data labeling that requires expert knowledge. We have used the real-time data of Sentinel-2 for training the model and mapping the burnt regions. The obtained F1-Score of 0.87 demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model.

AB  - We derive bathymetry with the Sentinel-2 medium-resolution (20m) satellites, using the shallow depth wave dispersion relationship. Our test area is the Golfe d'Arguin, Mauritania, a shallow shelf extending 120 km from shore. A semi-enclosing shoal (the Arguin Shoal) divides the area into a very shallow inner basin and an outer shelf. The ground truth for validation is a 1962 French Hydrographic Survey in the area of the infamous 1816 Medusa stranding on the Arguin Shoal. Our bathymetry accurately located the edge of the shoal (8 m isobath) and mapped the outer shelf to 35 m depth. The Sentinel-2 maps the bathymetry with 200 m resolution, significantly better than the (at best) 2 km resolution of International Hydrographic Organization charts (commonly known as GEBCO). Of particular note (and relevance to navigation safety), we found an uncharted 6-8 m deep reef in the outer shelf with mounds rising from the reef floor to 2-3 m depth. Based on the Golfe d'Arguin results, we conclude that Sentinel-2 satellites may be applied in other coastal areas with suitable waves and sun illumination. The optimum conditions are long wavelengths (peak wavelength >= 100 m) waves, and sun zenith angles 20 degrees-40 degrees. The most promising are coasts in tropics and mid-latitudes exposed to Atlantic, Pacific, or Indian oceans storm waves.

TI  - Deformation Monitoring of Large-Scale Rockfill Dam Applying Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) Using Sentinel-1 SAR Data
T2  - 2021 7TH ASIA-PACIFIC CONFERENCE ON SYNTHETIC APERTURE RADAR (APSAR)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 7th Asia-Pacific Conference on Synthetic Aperture Radar (APSAR)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - The Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) analysis accurately estimates the change over time of only the PS points on the ground surfaces using the time variation of the phase change of pixels with a small amount of noise called Persistent Scatter (PS).The riprap on the external surface of a rockfill dam is well reflected by radar, and since many PS points can be obtained over the entire external surface of the dam, the amount of external deformation can be grasped in a planar manner. In this paper, the PSI analysis was conducted for six large-scale rockfill dams of TEPCO Renewable Power using the SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) data from Sentinel-1 C-band, with 22 to 32 scenes of southbound and northbound trajectories in FY2020, respectively. The external displacement of the rockfill dams was measured using the SAR data. As a result of comparing the results of PSI analysis with the external deformations measured by surveying, it is concluded that the results of PSI analysis could be used to evaluate the deformation of the rockfill dam for maintenance management.

TI  - "Fortune amidst misfortune": The impact of Covid-19 city lockdowns on air quality
T2  - SUSTAINABLE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution is one of the major causes of health risks as it leads to widespread disease and death each year. Countries have invested heavily in fighting air pollution, arguably without convincing results. The outbreak of the highly infectious disease COVID-19 in December 2019 has been declared a pandemic and a worldwide health crisis by World Health Organization (WHO). Countries resorted to city lockdowns that sternly curtailed personal mobility and economic activities to control the spread of this deadly coronavirus disease. This paper examines the impact of Covid-19 city lockdowns on air quality. The researchers adopted a comprehensive interpretative document analysis for this study, which guided the careful but rigorous examination of air quality and coronavirus data. This method affirmed the authenticity of the information examined and interpreted in the US, Italy and China, the study areas. The study found that Covid-19 city lockdowns have contributed to a significant improvement in air quality within the first four months of the outbreak of Covid-19. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) had reported that NO2 concentrations in the study areas had reduced significantly using evidence from their Sentinel-5P instrument. Air quality in Covid-19 cities' lockdowns also improved because of the enforcement of other types of measures enacted to battle the virus. WHO still believes that the amount of NO2 concentration in the atmosphere is still high per their standards and regulations. Based on this, the researchers recommend that governments and other stakeholders put in much effort in terms of legislation to "win the war" against air pollution.

AB  - Introduction. Objective: linguacultural analysis of the edification words collected in a free associative experiment (FAE) and published in the << Kazakh Associative Dictionary >>.Materials & Methods. Set of associations of instructive character singled out by the continuous sampling method into a separate fragment of the world paremiological image is a unique representative research material included into the Kazakh Associative Dictionary, in the 23 655 associative reactions of the students of different universities in Shymkent city for 112 stimulus words, 272 sayings - edifications recorded in 200 questionnaires. Archetypal layers of the ethnic linguistic consciousness represented in the edifying paremias reflect the Kazakh spiritual and moral values. The content of the FAE and Kazakh Associative Dictionary reflects the indicative feature of the study, i.e. introduction of the gender factor differentiating the men and women associations; it provided for revealing and presentation of the reliable characteristics of the gender determined linguistic consciousness of the informants. The content of the sayings-edification mainly relates to the moral life of the nation, they enshrine the generally accepted ethical norms.Results. Gender irrelevant positions: evil and good are equally evaluated differently; respect for elders is clearly manifested. Gender marked positions: for men - duty to the homeland, responsibility for the family; desire to work together; for women - the desire to protect family values, to correspond to the accepted world order, androcentrism.Conclusions. The linguistic consciousness of the ethnos (in particular, its fragment as an actively demanded paremiological fund) reflects archetypal ideas about the ethnic spiritual and moral worldview values, on which stable elements of the modern Kazakh linguistic culture are formed and actively functioning; being vital for the ethnic integrity.

TI  - A New Data Augmentation Technique for the CNN-based Classification of Hyperspectral Imagery
T2  - IMAGE AND SIGNAL PROCESSING FOR REMOTE SENSING XXVII
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Image and Signal Processing for Remote Sensing XXVII
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Deep Learning (DL)-based classification schemes for hyperspectral remotely sensed data have been introduced in the last few years with remarkable success due to their capability to learn the non-linear nature of the information that conforms hyperspectral images. In particular, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been successfully used for solving problems requiring multi-class classification in the remote sensing field involving feature extraction. CNNs operate over small cubes of the dataset called patches centered in the pixels of the image instead of relying only on the spectral information corresponding to each pixel. These networks require a high number of observations to properly produce a generalized model. In these circumstances data augmentation techniques can help alleviate the problem by generating new, synthetic samples from existing data. Imputation is a statistical technique consisting in filling or replacing missing observations or values of a subset of observations by others obtained via inference from the original dataset. In this paper, a preliminary idea for a data augmentation technique based on the use of data imputation techniques for CNN classification is presented. Different hyperspectral images of the Earth surface widely used in the remote sensing field have been considered as test datasets. The results show the viability of the preliminary idea.

TI  - The use of a two-eyed seeing approach to include Indigenous Knowledge in Early Childhood Care and Development in Ghana
T2  - INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION JOURNAL-COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVES
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, there are increasing demands to decolonize education. As a result, the integration of Indigenous Knowledges and worldviews into Early Childhood Education has become a pertinent issue. Few studies have examined methodological frameworks for integrating Indigenous Knowledges into early learning in Ghana. This article examined the integration of Indigenous Knowledge into Early Childhood Education at a rural primary school. A two-eyed seeing Indigenous methodology was employed to integrate the local Kasena Indigenous Knowledge into a Kindergarten 2 classroom environmental studies topics. The ages of the children ranged from 6-8 years. As the holders of Indigenous knowledge, two Kasena Indigenous Elders helped to integrate Indigenous Knowledge into topics by visiting the school to teach and take children out on outdoor learning activities. After this, in-depth interviews were held with research participants. This paper focuses specifically on the methodology employed and highlights some of the outcomes. The study found that adopting a two-eyed seeing approach challenged Western knowledges' dominance over Indigenous knowledges in early learning, provided a framework to guide practice for integrating Indigenous knowledges, and created awareness of the existence of an Indigenous worldview.

AB  - We identified and interpreted surface deformation associated with the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquake sequence using L-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images acquired with the Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS2). We produced "low coherence interferometric SAR" (LC-InSAR) images which contain differential InSAR (DInSAR) and coherence analysis information. Phase discontinuity lines that indicate surface rupture and displacements were interpreted from those LC-InSAR images. We also conducted pixel offset tracking to measure the offset between pixels of the same area in two different SAR images. By comparing these results, we found that LC-InSAR analysis is an effective method for detecting relatively small surface displacements, and pixel offset tracking is advantageous in that it can show clear boundary and slip direction of the main fault trace. We also compared our mapping of phase discontinuity lines with a previous study results that infer surface fractures with C-band SAR data from Sentinel-1 satellite. ALOS-2 images can detect surface displacements that occurred near the main fault in more detail, whereas Sentinel-1 images can detect smaller displacements that are distributed away from the main fault. Our study suggests that proper combination of LC-InSAR and pixel offset tracking depending on the scale and direction of the displacements is a key to a better understanding of the characteristics of surface deformation. Moreover, SAR data with different wavelength can help us to understand more detailed mapping of surface deformation.

TI  - Aetiological Explanations of Epilepsy and Implications on Treatments Options among Yoruba Traditional Healers in Southwest Nigeria
T2  - AFRICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - In Nigeria, traditional healers play major roles in the treatment of patients living with epilepsy and their status as well as worldview have a considerable influence on the therapies or treatments that are provided, thereby affecting the quality of care and rights of their clients. With the dearth of studies on these healers' management of clients with epilepsy, this study explored their perspectives on the aetiology of epilepsy and how their view and understanding of the condition shape the treatments and therapies that are accessible to their clients. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 24 traditional healers considered as experts in the treatment of epilepsy in two Yoruba communities in Southwest Nigeria. Findings showed these healers perceived epilepsy as a health condition that is highly stigmatised and fearfully avoided among the Yoruba people. A multicausal view was advanced in their aetiological explanations of the causes of epilepsy ranging from natural, hereditary, and the supernatural. Each epilepsy case requires clear divination to understand the underlying cause and possible regimen to adopt in providing help and recovery. Treatments are often in stages and mixed as the individual progresses towards recovery. Of all the aetiologies, epilepsy cases that are attributed to preternatural and supernatural forces were considered most difficult to treat. The paper concludes that with the traditional healers' status in the community, and acceptance of their treatment modalities, the absorption of traditional medical practice will aid the supervision of their practice and help reduce exploitation and improve the quality of care.

TI  - African literature, metonymic gaps, and the <i>Gandasation</i> of metropolitan language in Jennifer Makumbi's <i>Kintu</i>
T2  - TYDSKRIF VIR LETTERKUNDE
M3  - Article
AB  - African literature has its roots in the continent's oral traditions, while its written mode started as an offshoot of European colonialism. The literature is characterised by paradoxes, one of which is linguistic dissonance. The linguistic incongruity draws attention to the illogicality of African literature ventilating indigenous episteme through exogenous tongues. Though the question of linguistic discordance in African literature is not new, it still generates ripples, and currently attracts tremendous interest of the present crop of African women writers who produce texts that conflate both indigenous and exogenous languages to possibly strengthen the conviction that one language is no longer the sole organiser of worldview. Jennifer Makumbi is one such writer. The Ugandan has succeeded in writing herself into global reckoning by telling a completely absorbing, canon-worthy epic. In her narration of a riveting multi-layered historiography of Buganda/Ugandan nation in Kintu (2014), the novelist bridges metonymic gaps between Luganda and English. She attenuates the expressive strength of English and projects Luganda as another veritable source of knowledge generation. In this article I examine how Makumbi bridges cultural and linguistic gaps in the novel. I employ metonymic gaps as a conceptual model to expound the deployment of indigenous knowledges in a Europhone African text. I mine the overall implications of this practice in African literature, and argue that Makumbi aggrandises Luganda epistemology to resist European heteronomy of African literary expression. Consequently, her text becomes a site of postcolonial disputations where marginal and minor literatures/cultures jostle for supremacy.

TI  - Social-Ecological Archetypes of Land Degradation in the Nigerian Guinea Savannah: Insights for Sustainable Land Management
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Nigerian Guinea Savannah is the most extensive ecoregion in Nigeria, a major food production area, and contains many biodiversity protection areas. However, there is limited understanding of the social-ecological features of its degraded lands and potential insights for sustainable land management and governance. To fill this gap, the self-organizing map method was applied to identify the archetypes of both proximal and underlying drivers of land degradation in this region. Using 12 freely available spatial datasets of drivers of land degradation-4 environmental; 3 socio-economic; and 5 land-use management practices, the identified archetypes were intersected with the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived land-degradation status of the region, and the state administrative boundaries. Nine archetypes were identified. Archetypes are dominated by: (1) protected areas; (2) very high-density population; (3) moderately high information/knowledge access; (4) low literacy levels and moderate-high poverty levels; (5) rural remoteness; (6) remoteness from a major road; (7) very high livestock density; (8) moderate poverty level and nearly level terrain; and (9) very rugged terrain and remote from a major road. Four archetypes characterized by very high-density population, moderate-high information/knowledge access, and moderate-high poverty level, as well as remoteness from a major town, were associated with 61.3% large-area degradation; and the other five archetypes, covering 38.7% of the area, were responsible for small-area degradation. While different combinations of archetypes exist in all the states, the five states of Niger (40.5%), Oyo (29.6%), Kwara (24.4%), Nassarawa (18.6%), and Ekiti (17.6%), have the largest shares of the archetypes. To deal with these archetypical features, policies and practices that address increasing population in combination with poverty reduction; and that create awareness about land degradation and promote sustainable practices and various forms of land restoration, such as tree planting, are necessary for progressing towards land-degradation neutrality in the Nigerian Guinea Savannah.

AB  - The effective management of suspended solids and their accompanying contaminants in water bodies requires information on the sources of sediments. Clear water reflects small amounts of solar irradiance, while water loaded with suspended materials (SM) has the potential of reflecting large amounts of sunlight. This study focused on the analysis of SM in Lake Mead, which lies on the Colorado River, using remote sensing spectral indices. Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) satellite images were used to determine the spectral indices such as normalized suspended material index (NSMI), normalized difference suspended sediment index (NDSSI), and band ratio (BR). This paper established relationship between the satellite image and ground truth data obtained from United States Geological Survey (USGS) data. A map of spatial distribution of suspended sediments in Lake Mead was produced. The map showed that high suspended sediments were generally identified at the entry points of Lake Mead, with lower suspended sediments being concentrated at the basins of the lake. Results also showed that an increase in suspended sediment concentration (SSC) produces a corresponding increase in NSMI values. An exponential relationship between SSC and NSMI values, with coefficient of determination (R 2 ) of approximately 0.96, was developed in this study.

AB  - Badung Regency is one area that mostly suffered from Covid-19 pandemic. Their gross regional domestic product has decreased 21.5% from 2019 to 2020 because of sluggishness of the tourism sector. It also affects the physical development of Badung Regency as a fast-changing area. To map the change of its land cover, satellite imagery-based classification was conducted Both optical and radar imagery has its own deficiencies due to cloud cover in optical imagery and difficulties in interpretation in radarimagery. Therefore, combining optical and radar imagery and classifying the land cover through machine learning (ML) algorithm is necessary. In this study, we compare two methods of ML which are Random Forest and Extreme Gradient Boost Sentinel 1 and 2 imageries utilized as the input to derive land cover change from 2016 to 2020. The data is classified into five classes: dense vegetation, sparse vegetation, bare land, water body, and urban, using supervised classification. As for training and validation, the field survey data was conducted With similar input and set of training data, Extreme Gradient Boost (XGB) methods yield higher average accuracy than Random Forest (RI). The XGB has around 93% of accuracy, while RF has around 76% accuracy. From the result of land cover change using XGB method, bare land and water bodies are decreasing 22.9% and 4. 1% consecutively. While urban areas and sparse vegetation, slightly develop around 5.6% and 1.26%. Dense vegetation has almost not changed with increasing 0.34% of its area.

AB  - The "biblical origin" of the basic ideas of Hellenic philosophy. This idea, perhaps strange to the modern reader, was almost universally accepted in the first centuries of CE and goes back at least to Aristobulus and Philo of Alexandria. Lately this concept, very useful indeed in justifying philosophy and the legitimacy of its inclusion in the Judeo-Christian worldview, became quite widespread. Clement (the first Christian author to refer openly to Philo) does not doubt the simple fact that the Greek sages either borrowed their teachings directly from Moses and the Jewish ministers themselves, or received them from above as a revelation of the true God, which must therefore be no different from the law given to Moses. The purpose of this publication is to illustrate this aspect of ancient intellectual history by a selection of relevant sources.

TI  - Formation of an ice dam in the lower reaches of the Mezen and Kuloy rivers from 1983 to 2020 (the White Sea basin)
T2  - LED I SNEG-ICE AND SNOW
M3  - Article
AB  - The features of ice cover formation within the macro-tidal estuaries of the Mezen River and the Kuloy River are considered. The investigated rivers flow into the Mezen Bay of the White Sea. The main sources of information for the ice monitoring were the high spatial resolution images from the satellites Landsat 5-8 and Sentinel 1.2 with addition of medium spatial resolution images of MODIS/Terra and VIIRS/SuomiNPP. Every year, zones of continuous hummocks and ice dams are formed in the estuaries, which exert influence upon characteristics of the tidal waves. The fast ice and drifting ice areas are observed below the ice dam. Above the dam, amplitude the tidal fluctuations in the water level is reduced by 3-4 times. According to the data for the period 2017-2020, the area of relatively smooth ice cover is located at the distance of 48-49 km above the mouth of the Mezen River and 40-42 km above the same of the Kuloy River. Advancing of the ice edge to the mouth is accompanied by the formation of hummocky ice bridges, the position of which is confined to the narrowing and sharp turns of the channel. According to satellite images, it is established that the ice dam changes its position from year to year. In the period from 1983 to 2020, on the Mezen River, the ice dam was located at a distance of 21.0 to 30.5 km from the mouth, and on the Kuloy - from 13.7 to 27.5 km above the mouth. The position of the ice dam is weather dependent. In severe winters, the dam is located closer to the mouth gauge line. Snow, falling in November and December on areas of open water, delays advancing of the ice edge to the mouth. For Mezen, the relation between the position of the ice dam and three following predictors had been obtained: the sum of precipitation for November and December at the air temperature below -5 degrees C, the sum of air temperatures below -5 degrees C for January and March, and the sum of positive air temperatures for February. The proposed dependence made it possible to restore the positions of the ice dam for the years which were not provided with satellite data. These are 1994 and 1999.

AB  - Opencast mining is accompanied by the destruction of landscapes. Based on cartographic materials, satellite data and field studies, landscape maps of the Balaklava vicinities in the southwestern part of the Crimean Peninsula have been compiled, where flux limestone mining has been carried out since the 30s of the last century. The analysis of landscape maps for the period from 1836 to 2017 showed that active technogenic activity has led to a radical replacement of natural landscapes by human-made ones. From 1836 to 2017 the area of natural landscapes has decreased more than two times and constitutes 37.9% of the investigated territory. They are represented by petrophytic steppes, juniper woodland and shibliak forest.At present, anthropogenic landscapes occupy about 60% of the studied area. Their area increased more than five times from 1836 to 2017. In 1836 there were two classes of anthropogenic landscapes (residential and agricultural), in 1957 there were four classes (residential, agricultural, industrial and military), in 2017 there were seven classes (residential, agricultural, industrial, forest, water, recreational and military). Today, the largest areas (31%) are occupied by industrial landscapes.

TI  - Genome-scale molecular and phylogenetic characterization of Middle Point orbiviruses from Australia
T2  - JOURNAL OF GENERAL VIROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Middle Point orbivirus (MPOV) is an Australian arbovirus, belongs to the Yunnan orbivirus species found in China. First detected and reported from Beatrice Hill, Northern Territory (NT), MPOV has to date, only been exclusively reported from the NT, Australia. Whilst genetic characterization of MPOV has been previously described, only restricted to sequence information for segments 2 and 3 coding core protein VP2 and outer capsid protein VP3, respectively. This study presents for the first time nearly full-length genome sequences of MPOV, which represent 24 isolates collected over a span of more than 20 years from 1997 to 2018. Whilst the majority of isolates were sampled at Beatrice Hill, NT where MPOV is most frequently isolated, this report also describes the first two isolations of MPOV from Queensland (QLD), Australia. One of which is the first non-bovine isolate obtained from the mosquito vector Aedes vittiger. We further compared these MPOV sequences with known sequences of the Yunnan orbivirus and other known orbivirus sequences of mosquito origin found in Australia. The phylogenetic analyses indicate the Australian MPOV sequences are more closely related to each other than other known sequences of Yunnan orbivirus. Furthermore, MPOV sequences are closely related to sequences from the Indonesian isolate JKT-8650. The clustering of Australian sequences in the phylogenetic tree suggests the monophyletic lineage of MPOV circulating in Australia. Further, ongoing surveillance is required to assess the existence and prevalence of this or other yet undetected lineages of MPOV and other orbiviruses in Australia.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Changes in Land Use in High-growth And High-density Remote Rural India: A Case of Bihar
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study quantifies the spatiotemporal changes in high-population growth and high -density rural regions of India, areas that are also referred to as "urural." The urural areas are remote, high-density rural areas far from zones of urban influence, experiencing growing population pressures. Using satellite-borne remote sensing data and its analysis of select districts in the State of Bihar, the study confirms the hypothesis that land use changes are underway in these remote rural regions while drawing attention to the alarming degree of these changes. High population density, population pressure, and economic changes in remote rural regions are the leading causes of significant land use transformations. The transformations are so substantial that these areas can no longer be characterized as rural by definition. Dramatic changes in all types of land use are evident, but most notable are decreases in land dedicated to agricultural use, receding water bodies, and rampant deforestation, with significant increases in built-up areas and bare land. Further, more land is being used for brick manufacturing to satisfy rampant building construction, degrading prime agricultural land to become bare and barren. The situation calls for an urgent and multi-pronged intervention from all levels of the government. As a start, the urural areas urgently need urban amenities, especially water, drainage, sanitation, and healthcare.

T2  - ALTRE MODERNITA-RIVISTA DI STUDI LETTERARI E CULTURALI
M3  - Article
AB  - This article analyzes the novel El palacio de la risa (1995) by German Marin as an infernal allegory of the dictatorship's experience. The objective is to stage the figures of blindness and vision, understood as a sensory dialectic between the possibility of seeing and not seeing. In biopolitical terms, a metaphorical relationship is established that implies health/desease, capacity / disability, knowledge / ignorance and submission / resistance in the political prisoners of Villa Grimaldi, as well as in the story. These figures will allow us to propose, preliminary, that Marin's text is a testimony of personal, historical and cultural reconstruction that approaches new ways of seeing centered on perception and imagination. Being a situation conditioned by a dictatorial regime, the imaginary or worldview becomes infernal allegory.

TI  - Pantropical modelling of canopy functional traits using Sentinel-2 remote sensing data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forest ecosystems are undergoing rapid transformation as a result of changing environmental conditions and direct human impacts. However, we cannot adequately understand, monitor or simulate tropical ecosystem responses to environmental changes without capturing the high diversity of plant functional characteristics in the species-rich tropics. Failure to do so can oversimplify our understanding of ecosystems responses to environmental disturbances. Innovative methods and data products are needed to track changes in functional trait composition in tropical forest ecosystems through time and space. This study aimed to track key functional traits by coupling Sentinel-2 derived variables with a unique data set of precisely located in-situ measurements of canopy functional traits collected from 2434 individual trees across the tropics using a standardised methodology. The functional traits and vegetation censuses were collected from 47 field plots in the countries of Australia, Brazil, Peru, Gabon, Ghana, and Malaysia, which span the four tropical continents. The spatial positions of individual trees above 10 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) were mapped and their canopy size and shape recorded. Using geo-located tree canopy size and shape data, community-level trait values were estimated at the same spatial resolution as Sentinel-2 imagery (i.e. 10 m pixels). We then used the Geographic Random Forest (GRF) to model and predict functional traits across our plots. We demonstrate that key plant functional traits can be accurately predicted across the tropicsusing the high spatial and spectral resolution of Sentinel-2 imagery in conjunction with climatic and soil information. Image textural parameters were found to be key components of remote sensing information for predicting functional traits across tropical forests and woody savannas. Leaf thickness ((R)2 = 0.52) obtained the highest prediction accuracy among the morphological and structural traits and leaf carbon content (R-2 = 0.70) and maximum rates of photosynthesis (R-2 = 0.67) obtained the highest prediction accuracy for leaf chemistry and photosynthesis related traits, respectively. Overall, the highest prediction accuracy was obtained for leaf chemistry and photosynthetic traits in comparison to morphological and structural traits. Our approach offers new opportunities for mapping, monitoring and understanding biodiversity and ecosystem change in the most species-rich ecosystems on Earth.

TI  - Antimicrobial resistance and recovery of <i>Salmonella</i>, <i>Campylobacter</i>, and <i>Escherichia coli</i> from chicken egg layer flocks in Canadian sentinel surveillance sites using 2 types of sample matrices
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY RESEARCH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE RECHERCHE VETERINAIRE

AB  - Eggs are important to the diet of Canadians. This product is one of the supply-managed commodities in Canada, but unlike other commodities, where food safety risks are extensively explored and reported, information on the prevalence of enteric organisms (e.g., Salmonella, Campylobacter) and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in layers in Canada are limited. This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of select bacteria and the associated AMR patterns in layer flocks using 2 sample matrices. Farms were located within FoodNet Canada and the Canadian Integrated Program for Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance sentinel sites (SS). Fecal samples (Ontario: ONSS1a, ONSS1b) and environmental sponge swabs (British Columbia: BCSS2a) were collected. Salmonella prevalence was 29% and 8% in ONSS1a and ONSS1b, respectively, and 7% in BCSS2a. S. Kentucky and S. Livingstone were the most frequently isolated serovars and no S. Enteritidis was detected. Campylobacter was not detected in the BC sponge swabs but was isolated from 89% and 53% of Ontario fecal samples (ONSS1a and ONSS1b, respectively). Seven C. jejuni from Ontario were ciprofloxacin-resistant. Escherichia coli prevalence was high in both sample types (98%). Overall, tetracycline resistance among E. coli ranged from 26% to 69%. Resistance to ceftiofur (n = 2 isolates) and gentamicin (n = 2) was relatively low. There were diverse resistance patterns (excludes susceptible isolates) observed among E. coli in Ontario (10 patterns) and British Columbia (14 patterns). This study revealed that fecal samples are more informative for farm-level monitoring of pathogen and AMR prevalence. Without further validation, sponge swabs are limited in their utility for Campylobacter detection and thus, for public health surveillance.

AB  - The growth of Jakarta metropolitan area as capital city is increase from time to time. Even the rate of population growth tends to decline, but population still stresses Jakarta environment. The surface changes and ground deformation related to city growth can be observed continuously by satellite-based remote sensing. The launch of Sentinel-1 satellite with radar mission through Copernicus, which is a joint initiative of the European Commission and European Space Agency, enables continuous observation of earth's surface. This paper describes a study of ground deformation rate of Jakarta metropolitan area observed by processing Sentinel-1 data based on interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar method. Only small perpendicular baselines of SAR data pairs are selected from 2015 to 2019 to avoid the use of external Digital Elevation Model data. The land subsidence rate is obtained by stacking the unwrapped phase and it is found that the rate is different across the region. In the western part, the rate is around -2cm/year whereas in the eastern part is around -3cm/year. The pattern and the rate of land subsidence are confirmed by ascending and descending orbit direction.

AB  - Rainfall is one of the essential climatic elements that affects the instability of geostructures. In recent years, extreme events, such as rainstorms in semiarid to arid regions subjected to long drought periods, have exacerbated the failure of natural and artificial earth fill slopes. Such severe instabilities were reported in parts of a railway embankment in southeastern Iran during the 2020-spring rainstorm. Most hazards, such as landslides due to floods, are specific extreme events in the north of Iran. However, most of the analyses have been focused on the maximum rainfall amount obtained from the rainfall station output data as the worst-case scenario, which has been proved that may not always be the case. More importantly, the distribution of rain stations in remote areas is very sparse in the order of tens to hundreds of kilometers. In other words, the uncertainty of rainfall events becomes even more pronounced. Therefore, the primary purpose of this study is to explore the application of an alternative method based on evenly distributed satellite data. To achieve this goal, monthly precipitation from 2015 to 2020 is compared between Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) data and rain gauge data recorded in the southern and northern regions. Afterward, rainfall data are examined based on the quantitative statistical criteria, and the most appropriate probability distributions are estimated and proposed accordingly. The Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution is the most suitable one for low-to-intermediate rainfall. The Logistic and Frechet distributions are presented for heavy rain. The satellite precipitation distribution of the southern region is eventually modified based on the more reliable and robust correlations for the northern region. Results suggest that the underestimated rainfall amount obtained from traditional rain station records could be a potential reason for the unconventional design and consequential damage to some infrastructure in the southern region.

TI  - A First Assessment of the 2018 European Drought Impact on Ecosystem Evapotranspiration
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The combined heatwave and drought in 2018 notably affected the state and functioning of European ecosystems. The severity and distribution of this extreme event across ecosystem types and its possible implication on ecosystem water fluxes are still poorly understood. This study estimates spatio-temporal changes in evapotranspiration (ET) during the 2018 drought and heatwave and assesses how these changes are distributed in European ecosystems along climatic gradients. We used the ET eight-day composite product from the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) together with meteorological data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF ERA5). Our results indicate that ecosystem ET was strongly reduced (up to -50% compared to a 10-year reference period) in areas with extreme anomalies in surface air temperature (T-sa) and precipitation (P) in central, northern, eastern, and western Europe. Northern and Eastern Europe had prolonged anomalies of up to seven months with extreme intensities (relative and absolute) of T-sa, P, and ET. Particularly, agricultural areas, mixed natural vegetation, and non-irrigated agricultural areas were the most affected by the increased temperatures in northern Europe. Our results show contrasting drought impacts on ecosystem ET between the North and South of Europe as well as on ecosystem types.

TI  - ANALYSIS OF CLIMATIC VARIATION AND DETECTION OF LAND USE CHANGES USING GEO-SPATIAL TECHNIQUES IN BAHAWALPUR DISTRICT, PAKISTAN
T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is directly related to our livelihoods and needs to be studied in order to form mitigation and adaptation policies. Climate change is a global phenomenon and poses diverse implications in form and type for different ecologies. Human activities are greatly disturbing the nature through using the land for different types of anthropogenic activities like cultural, financial matters, environmental aspects. land policy and land development plans. The present study aims to analyze the climatic variation and assess the land use change of district Bahawalpur having total area of 24,830 km(2). Climatic data (minimum temperature, maximum temperature and rainfall) were collected for a period of 30 years (1989-2018). Monthly mean minimum and maximum temperature, annual rainfall, Diurnal Temperature Range (DTR) and their anomalies were calculated using secondary data for the study area. Land use data were collected in the form of Landsat satellite images of last 30 years (1990-2019) with 10 yeas interval from different online sources. Landsat ETM and ETM + satellite imagery were processed in ArcGIS software. Results showed that there is a great variation in maximum temperature anomaly during the entire study period. Minimum temperature anomaly shows positive and negative trend during the entire study period from 1989 to 2019. There is a great variation in DTR anomaly during the study period. 10-years moving average of DTR anomaly remained positive during most of the time. There is variation in annual rainfall anomaly, with both positive and negative values. As in the whole time span of 30 years, built-up land increased from 2.54% (631 Km(2)) in 1990 to 4.66% (1,157 Km(2)) at the end of 2019. Agricultural land use also increased from 3,439 Km(2) (13.85%) to 5,168 Km(2) (20.81%). Forest land use decreased from the 1,321 Km2 (5.32%) to 775 Km(2) (3.12%) at end of 2019. Water occupied land with the high fluctuation was 109 Km(2) (0.44%) in 1990 and in 2019 it recorded 148 Km(2) (0.60%). The main land use class desert land also decreased from an area of 19,330 Km(2) (77.85%) to 17,582 Km(2) (70.81%). Correlation of land use change classes in last 30 years showed relationship intensity between different land use changes. Agricultural land and built up land have strong relationship with the value of 0.98. Desert land and agricultural land have strongly negative relationship with the value of -0.94. This study found how rapidly changes occurred in the land use with rate of land use change is a mile stone for the planners, researchers and scholars for the better understanding towards land use change in district Bahawalpur.

AB  - The aim of this article is to study the general characteristics of Abraham Kuiper's Reformed Aesthetics.Reformed Aesthetics is the aesthetics which has been developed by Neo-Calvinistic scholars. They have followed the theology of reformer, John Calvin. The presupposition of Reformed Aesthetics is Christian (Reformed) worldview. The worldview consists of key concepts, namely ‘creation', 'fall', and 'redemption'. So Kuyper regards the created world as beauty. According to kuyper, the true beauty is in this created world which shows the existence of God's perfection. Also he put great emphasis on the thought that there is no one inch of the area of our human existence which does not belong to Christ who has sovereignty over all things in the world. So one can see the most beautiful glory of God in this world through our Lord Jesus Christ.In this regards, Kuyper suggests that a crisis of contemporary arts in this world can be reformed via Reformed Aesthetics. I think Kuyper's aesthetics gives three factors to questions about the matter. First, according to reformed aesthetics, the most abundant source of arts is the realm of Christian religion. This wealth of artistic inspiration was also associated with the eternal God. Secondly, common grace should be the foundation of aesthetics, since God's great plan for creation is achieved through common grace. With these two factors, thirdly, there is now  possibility that the modern reformed aesthetics will make a full reality.

M3  - Article
AB  - Changes taking place along the shoreline are attributed to several physical and dynamical processes. Sindh Coast of Pakistan particularly Karachi is continuously under the process of morphological changes due to anthropogenic activities and natural processes. This study examined spatiotemporal morphological changes over five decades (1972-2020) along Karachi Coast bordering Arabian Sea using SRS and GIS techniques. This study reveals major morphological changes along the shoreline of Karachi in the vicinity of Karachi Port, Clifton Beach, Bundal Island and Port Qasim, which have been calculated in the form of erosion and accretion using erase tool of ArcGIS software. Quantitative analysis shows highest accretion of >15.50 km(2), at the Eastern End of Clifton Beach due to human intervention. Natural processes caused major erosion (10.95 km(2)) and accretion (19.50 km(2)) during 1972-2020 in the vicinity of Bundal Island. During 2011-2020, significant change (2.40 km(2)) is observed opposite to Port Qasim causing damage to mangrove vegetation of 1.40 km(2) calculated using NDVI. Highest rate of erosion (0.31 km(2)year(-1)) and highest rate of accretion (0.70 km(2)year(-1)) are found in Bundal Island during 1972-1987 and 1987-1999, respectively. Maximum increase in the length of shoreline (6.78 km) is depicted at Eastern End of Clifton Beech between 1999-2010.

AB  - Climate change is having an adverse effect on the environment especially in sub-Sahara Africa, where capacity for natural resource management such as water is very low. The scope of the effect on land use types have to be estimated to inform proper remedy. A combined estimation of transpiration and evaporation from plants and soil is critical to determine annual water requirement for different land use. Evapotranspiration (ET) is a major component in the world hydrological cycle, and understanding its spatial dimensions is critical in evaluating the effects it has on regional land use. A measure of this component is challenging due to variation in rainfall and environmental changes. The mapping evapotranspiration with high resolution and internalized calibration (METRIC) method is employed to create evapotranspiration map for land use, using remotely sensed data by satellite, processed, and analyzed in ArcGIS. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was related to the availability of water for vegetation on different land use, and the results indicate a high evapotranspiration for vegetated land use with high NDVI than land use with low NDVI.

M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, radiometric datasets which are best interpreted in conjunction with multispectral remote sensing data were applied in discriminating and classifying the lithologies of the Kebbi-Sokoto basement terrain for effective lithological mapping of the region. K/Th/U radiometric and Landsat-8 remote sensing data were enhanced through several processing techniques to display the characteristics of surface responses needed as input parameters in the classification of the surface rocks. Potassium radioelement concentration, Th/K channel ratio, normalization and ternary maps were produced using radiometric data while band combination and band ratio images were obtained from the Landsat-8 data. Several band ratios highlighted the major rock-forming minerals in the area such as feldspar, quartz, hematite, goethite, illite, kaolinite, biotite, amphibolite and dolomite. The major lithological expressions deduced from the combined data analysis namely; sandstone, felsic gneiss, clay, migmatite, granitoid and carbonates were used as representative classes to train the classification algorithm for the lithological interpretation. Supervised classification algorithm employing maximum likelihood classifier was used to obtain the lithological classification for basement rock units in the region. The classification results which were tested on band ratio b6/b2, b6/b7, b6/b5*b4/b5 image, b4/b2, b5/b6, b6/b7 image and b4/ b2, b6/b7, b6/b5 image using a contingency table produced overall classification accuracy values of 79%, 92%, and 88% respectively. The classified images displayed quite similar geological feature discrimination with the radiometric ternary map and geological map of the area. The study emphasized the benefit of using geophysical and multispectral datasets to produce a more complete classification of the surficial Precambrian rocks exposed in the region.

AB  - Although located in the Great Plains, over 24,000 slope failures have been observed in North Dakota. These failures present a number of issues including blocking roads, damaging pavements, and posing numerous safety concerns. A geospatial database of these slope failures is presented in this study. The database is used to examine the geologic, topographic, and pore fluid salinity patterns at these slope failures. The majority of slope failures occur in the Sentinel Butte Formation, which primarily covers the western part of the state. McKenzie and Billings Counties contained the largest number of slope failures accounting for 21% and 14%, respectively, of the total. Approximately 6% of the slope failures have areas larger than 100,000 m (2), nearly 23% have areas between 2,100 and 6,100 m(2), and 0.1% have areas less than 100 m(2). Slope failures appear to concentrate in relatively gentle slopes with inclinations between 8 degrees and 12 degrees. Additionally, the majority of the failures were in soils with low salt concentrations in the pore fluid, which is notable since the presence of high salt concentrations in soils is considered nearly ubiquitous across most of North Dakota.

AB  - To transmit satellite data with a large capacity to ground stations can be overcome by increasing the bandwidth. DGS (defected ground structure) method can increase the antenna bandwidth and has a miniaturization effect making it suitable for satellite application design. The antenna has been designed with circular polarization to overcome polarization loss. DGS pattern with dual-slot X-shaped is used. DGS dimensions such as slot length, slot width, and distance between DGS slots are optimized using CST software. The antenna was designed by using Roger 5880 and Roger 4350 substrate to obtain a miniaturization effect and wider beamwidth. Measurements on Roger 4350 substrate obtained a bandwidth of 97MHz or 4.3% Gain 3.63dB at frequency of 2220MHz and beamwidth of 90 degrees. Measurement of the antenna with Roger 5880 substrate bandwidth obtained 92MHz or 4.1% The antenna gain is 5.85dB at 2220MHz frequency and 85 degrees of beamwidth. Antenna with Roger 4350 substrate has a miniaturization effect of 35.3% on Roger 5880 substrate. Antenna with the use of DGS on Roger 4350 obtained reduction effect is 4.8% and the Roger 5880 substrate obtained reduction effect 1.84% The results obtained indicate that the DGS method with an X-shaped dual-slot pattern can reduce the antenna size and increase the antenna bandwidth.

AB  - There is a need for mapping of forest areas with young stands under regeneration in Norway, as a basis for conducting tending, or precommercial thinning (PCT), whenever necessary. The main objective of this article is to show the potential of multitemporal Sentinel-1 (S-1) and Sentinel-2 (S-2) data for characterization and detection of forest stands under regeneration. We identify the most powerful radar and optical features for discrimination of forest stands under regeneration versus other forest stands. A number of optical and radar features derived from multitemporal S-1 and S-2 data were used for the class separability and cross-correlation analysis. The analysis was performed on forest resource maps consisting of the forest development classes and age in two study sites from south-eastern Norway. Important features were used to train the classical random forest (RF) classification algorithm. A comparative study of performance of the algorithm was used in three cases: I) using only S-1 features, II) using only S-2 optical bands, and III) using combination of S-1 and S-2 features. RF classification results pointed to increased class discrimination when using S-1 and S-2 data in relation to S-1 or S-2 data only. The study shows that forest stands under regeneration in the height interval for PCT can be detected with a detection rate of 91% and F-1 score of 73.2% in case III as most accurate, while tree density and broadleaf fraction could be estimated with coefficient of determination (R-2) of about 0.70 and 0.80, respectively.

TI  - EVALUATION OF SOIL AND GROUNDWATER CHARACTERIZATION IN KARBALA PROVINCE USING GEOMATIC TECHNIQUES
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND STATISTICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was carried out in some desert soils from Karbala province to adopt the mechanisms of implementation within future surveys and classification of agricultural soils through the adoption of geomatic techniques by the Directorate Agriculture of Holy Karbala to characterize the characteristics of soil and groundwater with an assessment of the state of vegetation cover based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from remote sensing data (L and sat8 OLI). This study found the predominance of sand in the soil, which contributed to the desert environment, in addition to that 56% of the area of the study area has sandstone parent material, which affected the soil textures that fall within the coarse types where sand, loamy sand, sandy clay loam, loam and sandy loam each occupy 33%, 31%, 18%, 13% and 5% of the study area, respectively. The study area was also characterized by natural drainage, mostly moderate to good and it is soils level slopes, except for some geomorphological features such as sand dunes, which do not exceed 11% of the area of the study area. Our study concluded that the chemical nature in the study area is based mainly on the local conditions represented by the dry climate and limestone parent material which occupy 44% of the study area. Our study also found that 23% of the study area has more than 20% gypsum and morphologically is deposited in a rocky state and sometimes with the appearance of the petrogypsic horizon. Our study also found that 37% of the area with low to moderate salinity is suitable for growing different economic plants, while 63% of the area is affected by very high and very high salinity and we found that 35% of the study area has a low content of organic matter and 65% of it is moderate in its content of organic matter, as we believe that the absence of vegetation cover due to drought is the most prominent reason for this situation. In this study and through two evaluations of the characteristics of soil management, we found that 96% of the area of the study area can be invested for the establishment of future agricultural projects, provided that it is preserved from erosion conditions, since 59% of the area of the study area is affected by water and wind erosion and therefore it is sensitive. Also, our use of remote sensing data represented by Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Vegetation Cover Percentage Index (VCPI) showed us that 24% of the study area is agriculturally exploited and that 10% of the area of the study area has good vegetation cover, while the barren land constitutes 72%. Our study showed that the hydrochemical characteristics of groundwater did not indicate a danger of its salinity compared to the sodium adsorption ratio. Overall, the groundwater of suitable quality for irrigation occupies 56% of the area of the study area.

TI  - Physical trauma and injury: A multi-center study comparing local residents and refugees in Lebanon
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLOBAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Refugees are susceptible to various types of injury mechanisms associated with their dire living conditions and settlements. This study aims to compare and characterize the emergency department admissions due to physical trauma and injuries among local residents and refugees in greater Beirut.Methods This epidemiological study analyzes injury incidence and characteristics of patients presenting to Emergency Departments of 5 sentinel hospitals between 2017 and 2019. Using the WHO Injury Surveillance Guidelines and Pan-Asia Trauma Outcomes Study form, an injury data surveillance form was designed and used in hospital settings to collect data on injuries. Chi-square test analysis was performed to determine differences in injury characteristics between local residents and refugees. Regression models were constructed to assess the effect of being a refugee on the characteristics of injuries and outcomes of interest.Results A total of 4847 injuries (3933 local residents and 914 refugees) were reported. 87.4% of the total injuries among refugees were sustained by the younger age groups 0-45 years compared to 68.8% among local residents. The most common injury mechanism was fall (39.4%) for locals and road traffic injury (31.5%) for refugees. The most injured body part was extremities for both populations (78.2% and 80.1%). Injuries mostly occurred at home or its vicinity (garden or inside the camp) for both populations (29.3% and 23.1%). Refugees sustained a higher proportion of injuries at work (6%) compared to locals (1.3%). On multivariate analysis, refugee status was associated with higher odds of having an injury due to a stab/gunshot (odds ratio (OR) = 3.392, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.605-4.416), having a concussion injury (OR = 1.718, 95% CI = 1.151-2.565), and being injured at work (OR = 4.147, 95% CI = 2.74-6.278). Refugee status was associated with increased odds of leaving the hospital with injury-related disability (OR = 2.271, 95% CI = 1.891-2.728)]Conclusions Injury remains a major public health problem among resident and refugee communities in Beirut, Lebanon. Refugees face several injury-related vulnerabilities, which adversely affect their treatment outcomes and long-term disabilities. The high prevalence of occupational and violence-related injuries among refugees necessitates the introduction of targeted occupational safety and financial security interventions, aiming at reducing injuries while enhancing social justice among residents.

TI  - Impact of the urban heat island effect on the climate of the State of Qatar
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GLOBAL WARMING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid urbanisation and expansion of the built environment in large cities are attracting increasing attention among the global scientific community to understand the relationship between urban expansion and heat island effect (UHI). This study investigates the relationship between urban expansion and the UHI effect employing an integrated approach, including topographic analysis and land surface temperature analysis based on remote sensing and ground-based urban temperature analysis over 30 years of data. Results suggest that: 1) long-term UHI intensity trends in Doha city are statistically significant for seasonal and annual night time temperature; 2) based on the remote sensing data analysis significant urban expansion in Doha city was observed over the past 30 years; 3) day and night time temperature in Doha city was comparatively higher than other localities; 4) the spatiotemporal variations in the UHI are consistent with the urban expansion. Improvement in energy efficiency practices, urban green space optimisation, green rooftop and the use of reflective materials will mitigate the UHI effects. These results are suggested to help future urban planning and development, which will help to achieve sustainable development goals.

T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Geographic information systems and remote sensing data were used to monitor the natural resources in Jerash Governorate, Land use and land cover (LULC), and Spatio-temporal changes between 1990 and 2019 were analyzed. The post classification analysis technique was used for processing the data of digital satellite images to detect the temporal changes in the target area during the specified period. Remote sensing techniques were adopted to classify the satellite images and illustrated land cover maps revealed the expansion and contraction of the land cover from 1990 to 2019. Supervised classification was used to categorize the Landsat images into five classes using the maximum-likelihood classification tool of ArcMap 10,4 software, The results indicated an increase in urbanization and cultivated lands at the cost of bare lands and forests. The results also depicted a significant increase in agricultural (101,4 sq, km), urban (45.5 sq. km), and water covered lands (1.3 sq. km) in 2019 as compared to 1990, which symbolizes an expansion of 28.8 %, 101.3%, and 225 respectively. Contrarily, a decline in both bare lands (16.2%) and forests (8%) was noted. The total accuracy of classified images was quite significant and remained at 86% and 89% for 1990 and 2019 respectively.

TI  - An Integrated Approach to Analysing the Urban Growth Patterns: The Case of Sialkot, Punjab, Pakistan
T2  - INTERNATIONAL REVIEW FOR SPATIAL PLANNING AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban growth is a worldwide phenomenon, and urbanisation is increasing rapidly, particularly in developing countries. The high pace of unmanaged urbanisation and consequent low-density urban sprawl poses severe challenges to most big cities globally. Such growth features are primarily contributing to haphazard changes in land uses, leading to agricultural loss. This research adopts an integrated approach to analysing the urban growth patterns in Sialkot, Pakistan. It utilises Landsat satellite data and examines the change of land use and land cover (LULC) over 28 years (1990 - 2018). It estimates the agricultural area converted into built-up area during this time frame. Moreover, a spatiotemporal saturation analysis is also performed to analyse the nature of urban growth further. This change analysis is then compared to urban growth strategies introduced under previous urban master plans. The results indicate that the built-up area of Sialkot city has increased from 2,786.49 ha (28.89%) to 7,191.63 ha (74.56%) during the years 1990 - 2018. In comparison, the agriculture area has reduced from 69.5% to 24.84%. Similarly, the saturation value has decreased from 0.85 to 0.75, depicting the city is moving towards urban sprawl. The policy review and interview results indicate a lack of focus toward implementation of urban master plans, which has contributed to ribbon development in Sialkot. The study provides recommendations for concerned urban planning authorities to control urban sprawl in Sialkot.

TI  - 'Tacit Knowledge Management Contradiction': Practical Insights from the Buddhist Knowledge Discourses
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 22ND EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT (ECKM 2021)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 22nd European Conference on Knowledge Management (ECKM)
CL  - Coventry Univ, ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - This paper revisits the 'tacit knowledge management contradiction'; a contemporary debate in knowledge management literature, and views it from a novel perspective through discourses in the Buddhist epistemology/theory of knowledge. The explicit-tacit dichotomy, which has epistemologically originated from the Cartesian worldview, which regards mind-body from a dualist perspective, serves as the foundation of the mainstream knowledge management approaches. Based on this dichotomic treatment, mainstream approaches advocate converting tacit knowledge to explicit forms for its management. Many criticisms are levied on mainstream approaches for disregarding unintended consequences of such conversion, and the issues related to objectifying knowledge from the knowledge subject are paramount. Conversely, the Buddhist theory of knowledge has a non-dualist standpoint. Discourses (sutra) outlined in this theory elaborate on the human-knowledge-production process, which signifies a person's 'psychophysical' nature, due to which the mind-body [termed namarupa] takes a non-dualist perspective. Therefore, revisiting the tacit knowledge management contradiction from this perspective overcomes the said criticisms on knowledge objectification attempts. In accomplishing this aim, the paper takes a qualitative approach and uses semi-structured interviews for data gathering. Three narratives of knowledge workers' experience on knowledge management practices were derived from a poststructuralist discourse analysis of the interview texts. These narratives disclose impediments in managing tacitly held knowledge using dichotomic approaches. In order to overcome these impediments, a socially interactive approach to manage tacit knowledge is suggested. This approach is epistemologically founded on non-dualism, which is justified using relevant discourses in the Buddhist epistemology. These discourses were subjected to a poststructuralist reading to use them for the secular purpose of managing knowledge. The paper contributes practically and theoretically to the existing corpus by empirically establishing the aptness of socially interactive approaches for managing tacit knowledge and elevating the non-dualist knowledge management discussion through the Buddhist epistemology, respectively.

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - In this paper, we present an analysis of urban form, defined as the spatial distribution of macroeconomic quantities that characterize a city such as population, built environment, and energy use. In particular, we develop a framework to study the question of "mismatch" between the spatial distribution of lighting levels observed in a city (which was previously shown to be a proxy for energy access and wealth levels) and that city's population density and built area distribution. This allows us to rank cities globally by their ability to, intuitively, "match people with lighting/energy access". For this, we develop and make available a derived dataset we call CityNet that is based on best-available open-source remote sensing data products for the world's largest 30,000 cities. We first describe how cities may be grouped into a few classes by the scalemagnitude of these key quantities. Then we introduce simple quantities to measure their spatial distributions such as the average radial profile, the discrepancy between the radial profile of population and that of other quantities, and the effort of transforming the distribution of a given quantity to match that of the population density. To compare a given city against its "peers", we define a simple benchmark model of urban form. We use this model to rank cities by the relative magnitude of the lack of access to built and energy infrastructure. The key observation we make is that in many parts of the world, development (including built area density and energy access and use) does not follow the spatial population distribution.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF WASHINGTON
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel trap designed for monitoring parasitoids of spotted-wing Drosophila (SWD) is described. This new trap utilizes host fruits that are known host substrates for SWD and chocolate or vanilla baits, yielding a more accurate measure of SWD-parasitoids populations than banana traps. Fieldwork was carried out in Michoacan, Mexico, and the dominant parasitoids captured were all Figitidae: Leptopilina boulardi Barbotin, Carton and Kelner-Pillault and Ganaspis brasiliensis Ihering. The capture of Ganaspis brasiliensis is the first record of this species in Michoacan, and using DNA 'COI barcode' data, this Mexican population is consistent with the G5 population. We conclude that it is possible to promote this species as a biological control agent through inoculation and conservation in organic production of blackberry against D. suzukii, through an "Augmentoria" strategy using our sentinel trap with chocolate baits and preferred host of SWD to attract more SWD-parasitoids.

AB  - Multi-spectral images are crucial to detect and to understand phenomena in marine observation. However, in coastal areas, these phenomena are complex and their analyze requires multi-spectral images with both a high spatial and spectral resolution. Unfortunately, no satellite is able to provide both at the same time. As a consequence, multi-sharpening techniques-a.k.a. fusion or super-resolution of multi-spectral and/or hyper-spectral images-were proposed and consist of combining information from at least two multi-spectral images with different spatial and spectral resolutions. The fused image then combines their best characteristics. Various methods-based on different strategies and tools-have been proposed to solve this problem. This article presents a comparative review of fusion methods applied to Sentinel-2 MSI (13 spectral bands with a spatial resolution ranging from 10 to 60 m) and Sentinel-3 OLCI (21 spectral bands with a spatial resolution of 300 m) images. Indeed, both satellites are extensively used in marine observation and, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the fusion of their data was partially investigated (and not in the way we aim to do in this paper). To that end, we provide both a quantitative analysis of the performance of some state-of-the-art methods on simulated images, and a qualitative analysis on real images.

AB  - A key challenge of supervised learning is the availability of human-labeled data. We evaluate a big data processing pipeline to auto-generate labels for remote sensing data. It is based on rasterized statistical features extracted from surveys such as e.g. LiDAR measurements. Using simple combinations of the rasterized statistical layers, it is demonstrated that multiple classes can be generated at accuracies of similar to 0.9.As proof of concept, we utilize the big geo-data platform IBM PAIRS to dynamically generate such labels in dense urban areas with multiple land cover classes. The general method proposed here is platform independent, and it can be adapted to generate labels for other satellite modalities in order to enable machine learning on overhead imagery for land use classification and object detection.

TI  - Towards a massive sentinel-2 LAI time-series production using 2-D convolutional networks
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Biophysical parameters and more specifically the leaf area index provide an absolute quantification of the biomass of vegetation allowing an overview of the development status of a plant. However, the estimation of the leaf area index requires sophisticated and complex algorithms. This paper proposes a new procedure to estimate the leaf area index using Sentinel-2 data. The proposed procedure relies on the 2-D convolutional network known as the UNet algorithm for regression. The architecture of the UNet algorithm is adapted to account for the processing of large chunks of Sentinel-2 data. Moreover, the adopted procedure makes use of the dropout as a Bayesian approximation at the inference step in order to allow estimating the algorithm confidence interval, which is a very important quality indicator for the production of biophysical parameters. The proposed procedure is validated on multiple Sentinel-2 tiles and years and compared to the multilayer perceptron algorithm and the Sentinel Application Platform of the European Space Agency, also known as SNAP. The UNet and multilayer perceptron algorithms provide coherent results when compared to the results obtained using the SNAP software with an average correlation of 0.99 for both algorithms. However, the UNet algorithm provides better results in terms of average Euclidean distance, mean squared error and R-2 score. One main advantage of the UNet algorithm is the vast reduction of inference time when compared to the SNAP software and the multilayer perceptron regressor. The estimation of the leaf area index of a Sentinel-2 tile at 20 m requires 18 s, 13.5 min and 15 min using the UNet, multilayer perceptron and SNAP, respectively. This advantage allows a massive production of temporal sequences of leaf area index based on Sentinel-2 images. Furthermore, experiments conducted on multiple crop types prove that the proposed approach can serve as a generic procedure to estimate the leaf area index regardless of the crop type.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Workshop on Metrology for the Sea - Learning to Measure Sea Health Parameters (MetroSea)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Coastline extraction techniques from multispectral satellite images are of great interest for protection and monitoring of coastal areas. In this regard, the Sentinel-2 satellites can give a great contribution thanks to their wide coverage of the earth's surface. These images can be processed by GIS software, so as to detect the sea from all the rest. However, the traditional supervised classification requires the involvement of the operator to create suitable training sites: this approach, in addition to being associated to the operator's skill, often takes a long time to be completed. This contribution presents a study carried out on Sentinel-2 dataset and proposes the application of an unsupervised classification method, the k-means, on four different classification indices. The coastlines extracted by unsupervised classification are therefore compared with the coastline manually vectorized from the RGB composition. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of k-means for distinguishing, in the images produced by the indices application, two clusters (water / no-water) in a reduced time lapse if compared with the traditional supervised techniques.

TI  - Weaving with the mind: the<i> chumbe</i> inga from the colombian Alto Putumayo as mental and cultural artifact
T2  - ESTUDIOS ATACAMENOS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents the findings of an investigation about the sash named chumbe, made by the inga weavers of the Santiago-Manoy town of the upper Putumayo in Colombia. The objective of this work is to elucidate and comprehend the characteristics of the inga chumbe as cultural and mental artifact, in so far as it condenses and it's a place of inscription of the significance nets of the inga people culture. The methodology used is qualitative. The tools applicated at the field work were semi-structured interview, the participant observation and a photographical register of the chumbe and the pictograms it contains. One of the main conclusions is that the Chumbe Inga, as a mental and cultural artifact, is an 'art of memory' in which the Inga people express their worldview and their ancestral technical and aesthetic knowledge.

AB  - Earth Observation (EO) based on Remote Sensing (RS) is gaining importance nowadays, since it offers a well-grounded technological framework for the development of advanced applications in multiple domains, such as climate change, precision agriculture, smart urbanism, safety, and many others. This promotes the continuous generation of data-driven software facilities oriented to advanced processing, analysis and visualization, which often offer enhanced computing capabilities. Nevertheless, the development of knowledge-driven approaches is still an open challenge in remote sensing, besides they provide human experts with domain knowledge representation, support for data standardization and semantic integration of sources, which indeed enhance the construction of advanced on-top applications. To this end, the use of ontologies and web semantic technologies have shown high success in knowledge representation in many fields, in which the Earth Observation is not an exception. However, as argued by the research community, there is large room for improvement in the specific case of remote sensing, where ontologies that consider the special nature and structure of different satellital and airborne data products are demanded. This article addresses, in first instance, part of this need by proposing a semantic model for the consolidation, integration, reasoning and linking of data (and meta-data), in the context of satellital remote sensing products for EO. With this objective, an OWL ontology has been developed and an RDF repository has been generated to allow advanced SPARQL querying. Although the proposal has been designed to consider remote sensing data products in general, the current study is mainly focused on the Sentinel 2 satellite mission from the Copernicus Programme of the European Space Agency (ESA). Four different use cases are showcased to check potentials of the proposed semantic model in terms of ontology integration, federated querying, data analysis and reasoning.

TI  - Estimation of Crop Yield From Combined Optical and SAR Imagery Using Gaussian Kernel Regression
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometric coherence can complement optical data for the estimation of crop growth parameters, but it has not been yet investigated for predicting crop yield. Many studies have used machine-learning methods, such as neural networks, random forest, and Gaussian process regression, to estimate crop yield from remotely sensed data. However, their performance depends on the amount of available ground truth data. This study proposed Gaussian kernel regression for rice yield estimation from optical and SAR imagery using a limited amount of ground truth data. The main objective was to investigate the synergetic use of Sentinel-2 vegetation indices and Sentinel-1 interferometric coherence data through Gaussian kernel regression for estimating rice grain yield. The prediction accuracy was assessed using in situ measured yield data collected in 2019 and 2020 over Xinghua county in Jiangsu Province, China. In all cases, Gaussian kernel regression outperformed the probabilistic Gaussian regression and Bayesian linear inference. With the independently used optical and SAR data, a better prediction accuracy was achieved with the optical red edge difference vegetation index (RDVI1) (r(2) = 0.65, RMSE = 0.61 t/ha) than with the interferometric coherence (r(2) = 0.52 and RMSE = 0.79 t/ha).The highest prediction accuracy can be achieved by combining RDVI1 with interferometric coherence at the heading stage (r(2) = 0.81 and RMSE = 0.55 t/ha). The results suggest the value of synergy between satellite interferometric coherence and optical indices for crop yield mapping with Gaussian kernel regression.

TI  - The Paradigm of Science Education: an Attempt of Philosophical and Conceptual Foundations Explication
T2  - STUDIA WARMINSKIE
M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents the issues related to the science teaching paradigm, which extends the traditional understanding of the goal of education as an experience of humanity acquired through continuous progress and development. It has been proven that J. Dewey's pragmatic philosophy, like all contemporary epistemology, assumes that the cognitive goal of the processes of establishing and confirming meaning is a valuable and pragmatic confrontation of the acquired knowledge. It follows that there are specific philosophical positions in the research process: subjectivism as an individual search for an innovative way to solve a problem, and objectivity, reflecting the de-personification of experimental procedures and methods, and consensus in this context means using a formalized language to publish the results. According to the principles of constructivism, the process of education itself should be treated as a construction of a certain type of worldview, evaluation, and behavior. Learning, in line with the science teaching paradigm, is the concretization and interpretation of society's enduring discursive practices. The educational process is an interaction in determining a collective way of defining and understanding phenomena and processes. In science education, it is postulated to reject the traditionally established practices of academic theorizing and adopt the position of authority uncritically. Instead, there is a problematization of the fundamental discourse.

TI  - Surface Tradeoffs and Elevational Shifts at the Largest Italian Glacier: A Thirty-Years Time Series of Remotely-Sensed Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Biodiversity loss occurring in mountain ecosystems calls for integrative approaches to improve monitoring processes in the face of human-induced changes. With a combination of vegetation and remotely-sensed time series data, we quantitatively identify the responses of land-cover types and their associated vegetation between 1987 and 2016. Fuzzy clustering of 11 Landsat images was used to identify main land-cover types. Vegetation belts corresponding to such land-cover types were identified by using species indicator analysis performed on 80 vegetation plots. A post-classification evaluation of trends, magnitude, and elevational shifts was done using fuzzy membership values as a proxy of the occupied surfaces by land-cover types. Our findings show that forests and scrublands expanded upward as much as the glacier retreated, i.e., by 24% and 23% since 1987, respectively. While lower alpine grassland shifted upward, the upper alpine grassland lost 10% of its originally occupied surface showing no elevational shift. Moreover, an increase of suitable sites for the expansion of the subnival vegetation belt has been observed, due to the increasing availability of new ice-free areas. The consistent findings suggest a general expansion of forest and scrubland to the detriment of alpine grasslands, which in turn are shifting upwards or declining in area. In conclusion, alpine grasslands need urgent and appropriate monitoring processes ranging from the species to the landscape level that integrates remotely-sensed and field data.

TI  - On Finding Optimal Speckle Filtering for Extraction of Vegetation Biophysical Information Using Sentinel-1 SAR Imagery
T2  - SEVENTH GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM 2021
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 7th Geoinformation Science Symposium
CL  - Yogyakarta, INDONESIA
AB  - The SAR imagery such as Sentinel-1 in general has a major problem with the speckle effects. There are many speckle filtering methods have been developed to reduce the speckle effect. This research aims to test the ability of a number of speckle filtering methods to extract vegetation biophysical information from Sentinel-1. The ground truth of vegetation biophysical information in this research were simulated using Sentinel-2 MSI imagery. That is, Leaf Area Index (LAI), Canopy Water Content (CWC), Canopy Chlorophyll Content (CCC), Fraction of Vegetation Cover (FVC), and Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR). The Sentinel-1 imagery was speckle filtered using various methods, namely Lee, Lee Sigma, Refined Lee, IDAN, Boxcar, Frost, Gamma Map, and Median. Some speckle filtering parameters were modified, i.e., the processing windows. The Dual Polarization SAR Vegetation Index (DPSVI) were then extracted from the speckle-filtered Sentinel-1. DPSVI were then tested for correlation with vegetation biophysical information using the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r). The test results show that Boxcar produces the highest r values for all types of vegetation biophysical information, with values ranging from 0.6s to 0.7s. Followed by Lee, Gamma Map, Median, and Frost. Each with a processing window size of 21x21. Since there are no r values was found which reached 0.8 for processing window sizes up to 21x21, the simulation was then run using the regression method. The simulation results show that to achieve r values of 0.8, it is predicted that window sizes range from 35x35 to 93x93.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy for papillary thyroid cancer: the effect of dose, tracer and application of massage.
T2  - Asia Oceania journal of nuclear medicine & biology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVES: In patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), sentinel lymph node (SLN) radio-guided biopsy is not routinely used for detection of involved neck lymph nodes (NLN); 99mTc- antimony sulfide colloid (99mTc- ASC) has been used for this purpose. In this study, besides 99mTc-ASC another radiotracer, 99mTc-phytate (99mTc-P) with different doses and injection methods were evaluated.METHODS: Twenty-two patients, scheduled to undergo thyroidectomy for PTC, were injected for radio-guided SLN biopsy in the morning of operation in 3 groups: intra tumoral injection of about 1 mCi 99mTc-P (group A; n=5); peritumoral injection of less than 3 mCi 99mTc-ASC (group B; n=6); and peritumoral injection of 3 to 5 mCi 99mTc-ASC with application of massage (group C; n=9). A patient refused to complete the study. A patient with follicular thyroid cancer was also excluded. No NLN was detected in the pre-operative ultra-sonographic examinations of all patients. Central neck dissection was done for all the participants. The presence of radio guided detected NLN and results of pathology were assessed.RESULTS: In group A and B, no SLN was detected. NLNs were resected in 4 patients in group A and B; 2 of them involved by the tumor. In group C, 6 out of 9 patients (66.7%) had between 1 to 6 SLNs; the procedure failed to detect NLN in a patient in group C with surgically resected reactive NLN (failure rate 1 out of 7).CONCLUSION: The results underscored the significance of SLN radio guided biopsy in patients with PTC; the radiotracer, dose and method of injection may affect the detection rate.

TI  - Analysis of the Vegetation Index Dynamics on the Base of Fuzzy Time Series Model
T2  - INTELLIGENT COMPUTING, VOL 2
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Computing Conference
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Based on the fuzzy analysis of satellite monitoring data, the annual dynamics of the vegetation index for the selected crop area is investigated by means of MODIS images (LPDAAC - the Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center). To reconstruct and predict the weakly structured vegetation index time series, the fuzzy models are proposed, compiled taking into account the analysis of internal connections of the first and second orders, which are presented in the form of fuzzy relations. The proposed models were investigated for adequacy and suitability from the point of view of the analysis of the peculiarities of the intra-annual mean annual dynamics of the index, typical for the cultivated area. On the basis of the proposed approach, the results of the study of long-term dynamics of vegetation indices can be used for a complex analysis of the dynamics of vegetation cover, including modeling and forecasting the efficiency and productivity of agricultural crops.

TI  - Monitoring Mangrove Forest Degradation and Regeneration: Landsat Time Series Analysis of Moisture and Vegetation Indices at Rabigh Lagoon, Red Sea
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rabigh Lagoon, located on the eastern coast of the Red Sea, is an ecologically rich zone in Saudi Arabia, providing habitat to Avicennia marina mangrove trees. The environmental quality of the lagoon has been decaying since the 1990s mainly from sedimentation, road construction, and camel grazing. However, because of remedial measures, the mangrove communities have shown some degree of restoration. This study aims to monitor mangrove health of Rabigh Lagoon during the time it was under stress from road construction and after the road was demolished. For this purpose, time series of EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index), MSAVI (Modified, Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index), NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), and NDMI (Normalized Difference Moisture Index) have been used as a proxy to plant biomass and indicator of forest disturbance and recovery. Long-term trend patterns, through linear, least square regression, were estimated using 30 m annual Landsat surface-reflectance-derived indices from 1986 to 2019. The outcome of this study showed (1) a positive trend over most of the study region during the evaluation period; (2) most trend slopes were gradual and weakly positive, implying subtle changes as opposed to abrupt changes; (3) all four indices divided the times series into three phases: degraded mangroves, slow recovery, and regenerated mangroves; (4) MSAVI performed best in capturing various trend patterns related to the greenness of vegetation; and (5) NDMI better identified forest disturbance and recovery in terms of water stress. Validating observed patterns using only the regression slope proved to be a challenge. Therefore, water quality parameters such as salinity, pH/dissolved oxygen should also be investigated to explain the calculated trends.

TI  - Monthly 10-m evapotranspiration rates retrieved by SEBALI with Sentinel-2 and MODIS LST data
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Actual and potential evapotranspiration (ET) are important variables for regional and global environmental modelling. These elements provide better understanding and management of the hydrological cycle, particularly in relation to several environmental stresses affecting ecosystems. With the advancement of airborne techniques, remote sensing approaches have enabled an accurate estimation of crop actual ET with limited field visits. In this study, an enhanced version (i.e. m-SEBALI) of the improved surface energy balance model for land, surnamed SEBALI, will be presented. Main improvements concern the retrieval of 10-m ET values using Sentinel-2 images and MODIS Terra LST 1-km datasets. The other enhancement considers the usage of monthly-only climatic datasets, instead of the required hourly, daily and monthly data in SEBALI. Calibrations and validations were made in China, Belgium, Germany, Lebanon and Italy between 2013 and 2017, yielding adequate RSME (i.e. 20.06 mm/month) and AME (i.e. 15.69 mm/month) values. These countries represent four different climatic regions (i.e. continental semi-arid, Monsoon-influenced warm-summer humid continental, Mediterranean hot summer and Oceanic climates). Thus, Landast-8 thermal bands will be unnecessary to implement SEBALI. Also, the conversion between hourly and daily climatic data and monthly climatic datasets in SEBALI showed a Pearson value of 93.3 %. Thus, seven of the required inputs in SEBALI were eliminated in m-SEBALI, saving on time and resources. Furthermore, the wheat seasonal trend is produced in the Bekaa valley, Lebanon, between November 2018 and July 2019, showing an average ET value of 620 mm in a region with 510 mm of precipitations during the same period. Two peaks were visible in January and May signaling the different wheat phenological stages. The importance of m-SEBALI lies in providing an automated retrieval of 10-m ET, biomass production and water productivity (WP), among other variables, in diverse climatic regions. Such improvements shall improve the assessment of ET and WP towards better management of water resources, particularly in regions lacking some required inputs.

TI  - Evaluation of Multiorbital SAR and Multisensor Optical Data for Empirical Estimation of Rapeseed Biophysical Parameters
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article aims to evaluate the potential of multitemporal and multiorbital remote sensing data acquired both in the microwave and optical domain to derive rapeseed biophysical parameters (crop height, dry mass, fresh mass, and plant water content). Dense temporal series of 98 Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 images were used to derive normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), green fraction cover (fCover), and green area index (GAI), while backscattering coefficients and radar vegetation index (RVI) were obtained from 231 mages acquired by synthetic aperture radar (SAR) onboard Sentinel-1 platform. Temporal signatures of these remote sensing indicators (RSI) were physically interpreted, compared with each other to ground measurements of biophysical parameters acquired over 14 winter rapeseed fields throughout the 2017-2018 crop season. We introduced new indicators based on the cumulative sum of each RSI that showed a significant improvement in their predictive power. Results particularly reveal the complementarity of SAR and optical data for rapeseed crop monitoring throughout its phenological cycle. They highlight the potential of the newly introduced indicator based on the VH polarized backscatter coefficient to estimate height (R-2 = 0.87), plant water content (R-2 = 0.77, from flowering to harvest), and fresh mass (R-2 = 0.73) and RVI to estimate dry mass (R-2 = 0.82). Results also demonstrate that multiorbital SAR data can be merged without significantly degrading the performance of SAR-based relationships while strongly increasing the temporal sampling of the monitoring. These results are promising in view of assimilating optical and SAR data into crop models for finer rapeseed monitoring.

AB  - Prosopis juliflora is one of the 'world's most invasive trees that negatively affects native species and their ecosystems. The main obstacle for controlling Prosopis juliflora pervasion is to accurately map location as well as the distribution pattern. Locating Prosopis juliflora is a strategic priority of countries to preserve the invaded local environment. Recent advances in remote sensing, geographic information system (GIS), and Machine Learning (ML) techniques provide valuable tools for producing tree distribution maps. In this research, a supervised classification method with Support Vector Machine (SVM) supported by GIS statistical analysis was developed to map Prosopis juliflora and their pattern analysis in Sharjah, one of the major cities in the United Arab. More than 5000-pixel labels taken from Landsat-7 and Landsat-8 imagery were used to train object-based Support Vector Machine to map Prosopis juliflora. The suggested algorithm resulted in 75% accuracy compared to ground truth samples. Furthermore, multi-temporal detection showed 'that's spatial clustering pattern of the trees is changing and increasing over time. The approach adopted in this study can be applied to any other location globally.

AB  - In all the films about Moses, Solomon, and Christ the action never takes place inside the temple. The rare occasions of presenting the interior of a Jewish temple, the colours of the clothing of the high priest are either misuse or wrong. One of the pinnacles of Jewish misrepresentation is in Mel Gibson's The Passions of Christ, Synedrion members and the hight priest are dressed in a mixture of dark grey and brown, which is the colour of sackcloth, expressing remorse and sorrow among Jews. The idea is to present the Bible data on the path of the four colours of the priestly code at the Tabernacle, First Temple, and Second Temple. In Hebrew on Hebrew worldview and culture. The culturalization and changes in the colour tetrad remains insignificant to Christianity, or to film productions that treat biblical events.

AB  - (1) Background: Toxoplasma gondii is an important zoonosis and one of the major causes of abortion in sheep worldwide. (2) Methods: We performed a 2-year longitudinal serological anti-T. gondii IgG screening on a cohort of a spatially confined population of a Portuguese autochthonous sheep breed in central Portugal. (3) Results: From the screening of the 2015 and 2016 sera, an increase of seroprevalence was observed (57.7% (95% CI: 49.9-65.3%) versus 69.1% (95% CI: 61.5-75.9), from 2015 and 2016, respectively) (p = 0.031). (4) Conclusions The present study is the first to provide prospective data on the anti-T. gondii serological status of a sheep cohort in Portugal, showing an increase in the occurrence of T. gondii. There is a need to provide a clearer understanding of T. gondii epidemiology in Portugal, ideally by implementing monitoring programs on sentinel herds, not only due to the high impact of T. gondii on animal health but also for it being a zoonosis.

Critically articulated the reasonings about the guidelines for preserving, accommodating, and repatterning actions for the care of people.RESULTS: The nurse must know cross-cultural care in order to consider individual and/or collective treatment and respect the existing differences in beliefs and values. This premise corroborates the adherence to Covid-19 prevention and treatment recommendations. The lack of knowledge about the transmissibility and invisibility of the virus and the risk factors, combined with the cultural diversity of the population, can make it difficult to adhere to health recommendations.FINAL CONSIDERATIONS: Cross-cultural care favors the practice of health education and can provide conditions for greater adherence of the population to nursing actions.

CL  - Valencia, SPAIN
AB  - The dynamic of the Southern Caribbean Sea is highly influenced by the occurrence of strong and persistent westward trade winds. These are driven by the location in the latitude of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) inducing the Caribbean Low Level Jet (CLLJ). There are two upwelling episodes in the Peninsula de la Guajira (Colombian Caribbean). One of them is very strong and extends from October-November to March-April. When the ITCZ travels northward and holds a stationary latitude, the other event is much weaker and shorter, from May to July. The upwelling events can be easily monitored by Sea Surface Temperature (SST) imagery. We briefly resume some studies on the upwelling events in the Peninsula de la Guajira by relating the area of colder waters computed from MODIS-SST imagery, wind records extracted from QuickSCAT imagery products, and the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI). The results of the analysis are translated into the conditions for the outflow of Lake Maracaibo, which is a very large quasi-closed water body with serious problems of pollution because it does not interchange enough water with the Gulf of Venezuela to keep good environmental quality. A conceptual model and a diagnosis numerical finite element model are presented to explain why Lake Maracaibo flushes only once a year for 2 months and how the upwelling of La Guajira determines when it happens.

TI  - Joint PAZ & TanDEM-X Mission Interferometric Experiments: Interoperability and Products
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article analyzes the potential synergies between the two German satellites of the TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X (TSX/TDX) mission and the Spanish PAZ satellite. Since both platforms are almost identical and they were launched in the same orbital plane, comparable images of the same area under the same geometry may be regularly acquired by both systems. This allows the simultaneous exploitation of both missions for building larger time series and improving the revisit time of 11 days for each mission up to 4 or 7 days while combining both. The geometric accuracy and the interferometric performance when combining both sensors are investigated, considering different acquisition parameters and land cover types. For this article several images are acquired over German and Spanish calibration test sites. The results obtained when combining acquisitions from satellites of the TSX/TDX and PAZ missions show no loss of performance with respect to image pairs of the same satellite, indicating that both missions might be exploited synergistically in order to improve current monitoring applications or maybe to allow newer application with tighter requirements in terms of revisit time or temporal coverage. In order to explore all these possibilities, a call for scientific proposals will be jointly opened by the coordinators of the scientific activities of both missions in order to explore the simultaneous exploitation of TSX/TDX and PAZ data.

TI  - THE CONCEPT OF GENDER AND ITS ACCEPTABILITY AS A CATEGORY OF ANALYSIS IN ECONOMICS: AN ISLAMIC PERSPECTIVE
T2  - AFKAR-JURNAL AKIDAH & PEMIKIRAN ISLAM-JOURNAL OF AQIDAH & ISLAMIC THOUGHT
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in the understanding of gender are making it complicated to use gender as a category of analysis. Previously, it was generally accepted that gender is a binary category, comprising of male and female, based on clear biological distinction. Then came the idea that gender is a sociocultural construct. More recently, gender is said to be based on each person's personal conception of himself or herself. These novel ideas have detached the meaning of gender from its biological foundation and have consequently made the concept of gender ambiguous and subjective, with theoretically infinite possible interpretations that can formulate an indeterminate number of genders. Such arbitrariness is unsuitable for scientific analysis. Accordingly, mainstream economists, in their aspiration to be scientific, have largely ignored these semantic developments and have continued to use the biologically defined binary categorisation of gender, presumably because of its practicality when used in economic analysis. From an Islamic perspective, economists are right to use such definition of gender, not because it is practical to do so, but because it conforms to reality and truth (haqq) as revealed by religion. This article discusses these ideas as well as their history and interactions to show that from an Islamic perspective the number of genders is not indeterminate, nor is gender only practically binary, but it is really and truly binary in line with the worldview of Islam.

AB  - Seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies was 10% among the subset of decedents undergoing forensic postmortem examination in June in Maryland. Decedents of motor vehicle crashes had similar seroprevalence compared with those with a natural death (including decedents with SARS-CoV-2 infection). Decedents of motor vehicle crashes may be a sentinel surveillance population.

TI  - Uncertainty Reduction of Unlabeled Features in Landslide Inventory Using Machine Learning t-SNE Clustering and Data Mining Apriori Association Rule Algorithms
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - A landslide inventory, after an intense rainfall event in 1998, Southwestern Korea, was collected by digitizing aerial photographs. This left high uncertainty in the inventoried features to be verified by ground truths. To reduce the uncertainty, the photographs were reexamined, supported by the time slider in Google Earth. We observed 77 deformed slopes, which were similar in shape and texture, to the inventoried landslides. We then sought to label the observed formations based on their spatial relationship with surrounding conditions. A three-phase methodology was developed. First, an inventory of landslide, no landslide, vulnerable slopes, and unlabeled features was analyzed based on spatial cluster patterns, and then the dimension was reduced using the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE). Second, the Apriori algorithm, based on association rule mining, was used to identify common relations in the inventory using landslide antecedent factors (derived from topographic and landcover maps) that are linked to areas of unlabeled features. Third, the findings were validated using Landsat TM (Thematic mapper) and ETM+(Enhanced thematic mapper) images acquired before and after the original inventory. Current research offers practical and economical solutions (reduced reliance on paid remote sensing sensors and field survey) to labeling and classification of missing or outdated spatial attributed information.

TI  - Lactic acidosis incidence with metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease: A retrospective nested case-control study
T2  - ENDOCRINOLOGY DIABETES & METABOLISM
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Compare rates of lactic acidosis (LA) among metformin-exposed and unexposed patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and varying degrees of chronic kidney disease (CKD).Research Design and Methods: Retrospective, nested case-control study using data from national VA Corporate Data Warehouse. All adult patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD newly dispensed any antihyperglycaemic medication during FY 2003-13 were included. The outcome was LA hospitalization or serum lactate >5 mEq/L. Exposure to metformin was evaluated in the three months prior to event. Estimates were adjusted for 31 covariates, including demographics, comorbidities and medications.Results: Overall, 320 882 patients were included, contributing a total of 1 331 784 person-years of follow-up. LA occurred in 2 665 patients, generating an overall incidence rate of 2.00 (95% CI 1.93-2.08) per 1000 person-years. Metformin exposure in the prior 3 months was associated with an elevated adjusted hazard of LA (HR 1.97, 95% CI 1.69-2.29). No association was evident in patients with CKD stage 1 or 2 (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.71-1.57), but associations were present and progressively greater in patients with CKD stage 3a through 5: HR 3.09, 95% CI 2.19-4.35 in CKD 3a, HR 3.34, 95% CI 1.95-5.72 in CKD 3b, HR 7.87, 95% CI 3.51-17.61 in CKD stage 4&5.Conclusion: Metformin was not associated with an elevated risk of LA in persons with stage 1-2 CKD, but was associated with a progressively higher risk at more advanced stages of CKD.

AB  - A significant number of indigenous communities in Africa are struggling to maintain traditions amongst themselves and others, in a system that is dominated by a western worldview. Like the rest of Africa, Namibians are also finding it hard to preserve and use their indigenous languages in their day-to-day communication. With the decrease in use of native languages, the future generations might not have sufficient knowledge of the language and they will be unable to relate to their heritage. Hence, there is a possibility of the language becoming extinct. Dictionaries are known to improve communications for both native and non-native users of any language, and a digital mobile dictionary application is even more convenient. In this study, an Oshikwanyama-English dictionary app is developed in android studio using the Java language, and using the Incremental Iterative Delivery Programming methodology. A post-questionnaire was carried out after using the dictionary. The study found that the dictionary is easy to use, effective and can improve communication. However, a bigger dataset will have to be incorporated, before the app goes into the market.

TI  - Observed Impacts of Climate Variability on LULC in the Mesopotamia Region
T2  - CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing analysis techniques have been investigated extensively, represented by a critical vision, and are used to advance our understanding of the impacts of climate change and variability on the environment. This study aims to find a means of analysis that relies on remote sensing techniques to demonstrate the effects of observed climate variability on Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) of the Mesopotamia region, defined as a historical region located in the Middle East. This study employed the combined analysis of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Land Surface Temperature (LST), and two statistical analysis methods (Pearson Correlation Analysis, r; Coefficient of Determination, R-2), which were applied using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data and observed surface meteorological data from 2000 to 2018. The resulting NDVI images show five LULC classes with NDVI values varying between -0.3 and 0.9. Furthermore, changes in the classified LULC area were compared statistically to those in NDVI values, where a positive relationship was found. Also, when the LST values and temperature are more extreme, the NDVI values were found to be smaller, suggesting a decrease in the density of vegetation cover. A negative correlation was found through Pearson correlation analysis (r = similar to-0.64), indicating a direct effect of increased temperatures on LULC. Indeed, this negative relationship between NDVI and LST was proven using R-2 values, where a two-dimensional scatter plot analysis showed that R-2 ranges from 0.54 to 0.9. Ultimately, the results obtained from this study reveal changes that may have many prominent effects in the field of LULC classification, accelerating the implications of climate change and variability factors.

TI  - Tracking Long-term Phenological Shift in Response to Climatic Parameters in Chitwan National Park, Nepal
T2  - SENSORS AND MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - To understand the terrestrial ecosystem and track whether it is influenced by any external factors, an accurate assessment of vegetation phenology at the regional to global scale is needed. Because it has become crucial to monitor changes in green cover due to the impacts of climate change, phenology research is a crucial part of documenting life cycle patterns and the effects of climate change on ecosystems. However, ground observations can be a tedious, if not impossible, way of studying such broad-scale trends. Vegetation indices derived from satellite images provide the efficacy to study such trends over a large area and time span. Cloud computing platforms such as Google Earth Engine (GEE) facilitate the storage, manipulation, and accessibility of such large datasets. The satellite-remote- sensing-based normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) was used to study the phenological shift in Chitwan National Park of Nepal, which is home to unique biological resources, in response to two major climatic drivers: temperature and precipitation. The four transition stages of greenness onset, maturity onset, senescence onset, and growing period were determined by fitting spatially averaged NDVI values using the phenofit package of R. It was found that the greenness and maturity onsets have been delayed over the years while the growing period has seen fluctuations due to variations in senescence onset. Precipitation was correlated positively with NDVI while temperature was negatively correlated with NDVI. Moreover, the rainfall one month earlier better explained the NDVI variability than the amount of rainfall in the same month because of the stronger correlation. Overall, this study indicates that climate variability is affecting the phenology of vegetation, and the results can help in performing suitable checks and assessments of the ecosystem in Nepal.

TI  - Evaluation of the Landsat-Based Canadian Wetland Inventory Map Using Multiple Sources: Challenges of Large-Scale Wetland Classification Using Remote Sensing
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The first Canadian wetland inventory (CWI) map, which was based on Landsat data, was produced in 2019 using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) big data processing platform. The proposed GEE-based method to create the preliminary CWI map proved to be a cost, time, and computationally efficient approach. Although the initial effort to produce the CWI map was valuable with a 71% overall accuracy (OA), there were several inevitable limitations (e.g., low-quality samples for the training and validation of the map). Therefore, it was important to comprehensively investigate those limitations and develop effective solutions to improve the accuracy of the Landsat-based CWI (L-CWI) map. Over the past year, the L-CWI map was shared with several governmental, academic, environmental nonprofit, and industrial organizations. Subsequently, valuable feedback was received on the accuracy of this product by comparing it with various in situ data, photo-interpreted reference samples, land cover/land use maps, and high-resolution aerial images. It was generally observed that the accuracy of the L-CWI map was lower relative to the other available products. For example, the average OA in four Canadian provinces using in situ data was 60%. Moreover, including reliable in situ data, using an object-based classification method, and adding more optical and synthetic aperture radar datasets were identified as the main practical solutions to improve the CWI map in the future. Finally, limitations and solutions discussed in this study are applicable to any large-scale wetland mapping using remote sensing methods, especially to CWI generation using optical satellite data in GEE.

TI  - Wetland Change Analysis in Alberta, Canada Using Four Decades of Landsat Imagery
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, wetland trends in Alberta were investigated in the past four decades using Landsat satellite imagery to produce updated information about wetland changes and to prevent further degradation of these valuable natural resources. All the processing steps and analyses were conducted in Google earth engine (GEE) to produce 16 wetland maps from 1984 to 2020. A comprehensive change analysis showed 1) approximately 18% of the province was subjected to change; 2) in terms of wetland classes, there was a decreasing trend for the Shallow Water and Swamp classes and an increasing trend for the Fen and Marsh classes; 3) in terms of nonwetland classes, there was a considerable decreasing trend for the Forest class and increasing trend for the Grassland/Shrubland class; 4) wetland loss was approximately 22 000 km(2), which was mainly due to the conversion of wetlands to Forest and Grassland/Shrubland; 5) wetland gain was approximately 24 000 km(2), which was mainly due to the conversion from the Forest class to wetlands, especially the Swamp and Fen classes; 6) the highest class transition was from Cropland to Grassland/Shrubland and vice versa (29 000 km(2)), from Forest to different wetland classes (18 000 km(2)), and from Fen to Forest (6000 km(2)). In summary, the results of this study provided the first comprehensive information on wetland trends in Alberta over the past 37 years and will assist policymakers to adjust the required/established policies to mitigate the potential wetland changes due to anthropogenic activities and climate-related events.

TI  - ASSESSMENT OF SOIL SUSCEPTIBILITY TO EROSION ON THE CLIFFS OF THE EASTERN COASTS OF THE STATE OF RIO GRANDE DO NORTE
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE GEOMORFOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - On the eastern coast of the Rio Grande do Norte State, the study area is located at the boundaries of the Barreira do Inferno Launching Center, which has preserved natural characteristics and where thematic units and classes of physical database were evaluated, pointedly to the acquiring of the soil erosion susceptibility map, among them: geology, geomorphology, pedology, vegetation cover, slope, land use and cover. The evaluation of the soil erosion susceptibility level was obtained through digital processing techniques of LANDSAT 8-OLI multispectral and panchromatic images that formed the basis for the obtention of thematic maps, georeferenced and integrated in Geographic Information System. This integration allowed the qualitative analysis of thematic units and classes by multicriteria model in map algebra, weighted by the assignment of specific notes and weights, according to the degree of relevance of these factors in erosive processes in coastal areas with low anthropic intervention. The results of the assessment of the erosive potential of the thematic units and classes, confirmed in field visits, attributed to 64% of the total area the low and medium susceptibility, for lands with slopes from 0 degrees to 10 degrees, under the shrubby and herbaceous vegetation domain. The very high erosive susceptibility class represented 9% of the total area granted to the dune fields, connected to the beach stretch, and to the active cliffs. The soil erosion susceptibility map, based on information from the physical database is fundamental in the development of land use management practices in coastal zones composed of active cliffs and dune-beaches system, assisting to ecosystem preservation and planning of more effective coastal protecting infrastructures against soil loss.

M3  - Article
AB  - For the synoptic assessment of corn plants content of Ca, and K accurate monitoring of land surface dynamics using remote sensing is needed. We looked at a full resolution dataset from the Medium Resolution satellite Imaging (Sentinel-2) as an open source as an alternative to the costly high resolution the more widely used high-resolution satellite Imaging (Worldview2) data for vegetation monitoring. We compared Sentinel-2 image and Worldview 2 data acquired in 2018 with in situ measured hyperspectral data and metal concentrations in plant samples collected from fields in the study area for this purpose. The current research was conducted on the experimental site during the 2018 corn cropping season (Zea Mayz). Results indicated that: The Difference Vegetation Index (DVI), the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), the Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI), and the Leaf Area Index (LAI) were the more sensitive indicators to Ca and K above ground corn plants content. These VIs had R-2 values more than 0.5 with the in-situ measurements for the both images. DVI, EVI, and GNDVI performed well in estimating plant dry matter Ca and K content with R-2 > 0.5, with a high significant level P-value < 0.001and LAI had a statistically significant impact with a P-value < 0.5 for WV2 image. The Sentinel-2 VIs performed well in estimating plant dry matter Ca and K content with R-2 values > 0.5, with a high significant level P-value 0.001. LAI had a statistically significant impact with a P-value < 0.5 with Ca concentration and P-value < 0.01 with K concentration. This study suggests that the moderate resolution satellite images can be used for corn plants Ca and K content.

TI  - Efficiency of sympagic-benthic coupling revealed by analyses of n-3 fatty acids, IP<sub>25</sub> and other highly branched isoprenoids in two filter-feeding Arctic benthic molluscs: <i>Mya truncata</i> and <i>Serripes groenlandicus</i>
T2  - ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this work was to determine the impact of sympagic (ice-associated) algal primary production on the quality of Arctic filter-feeding bivalves. For this purpose, we investigated the sea ice production of lipids (including omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) and highly branched isoprenoids (HBI)), as well as their subsequent incorporation into the truncate softshell clam (Mya truncata) and the Greenland cockle (Serripes groenlandicus), during the melting periods of two consecutive years in Baffin Bay. Lipid and primary production exhibited seasonal variability and overall contrasts between the two years, as a result of distinct physical forcings and the ensuing biological responses. Whilst less productive in terms of total lipids or chlorophyll a, spring 2016 was more productive than spring 2015 for n-3 PUFA, which are essential for benthic fauna. The sea ice diatom HBI biomarker IP25 was quantified in sea ice from both years. Interestingly, such production was preceded by a production of the hitherto 'pelagic' biomarker, HBI III, in sea ice. In bivalves, HBI contents and correlations confirmed the tightness of the Arctic sympagic-benthic coupling and highlighted that S. groenlandicus can be used as a sentinel species for assessing the degree of this coupling. The confirmation that bivalves incorporate sea-ice derived HBI III and not only IP25, may introduce uncertainties into the use of some HBI-based indices. Monitoring of the fatty acid contents of bivalves allowed identification of their spawning periods and suggests that M. truncata did not store enough n-3 PUFA to sustain its reproductive effort.

AB  - Ocean surface monitoring, especially oil slick detection, has become mandatory due to its importance for oil exploration and risk prevention on ecosystems. For years, the detection task has been performed manually by photo-interpreters using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images with the help of contextual data such as wind. This tedious manual work cannot handle the increasing amount of data collected by the available sensors and thus requires automation. Literature reports conventional and semi-automated detection methods that generally focus either on oil slicks originating from anthropogenic (spills) or natural (seeps) sources on limited data collections.As an extension, this paper presents the automation of offshore oil slicks on an extensive database with both kinds of slicks. It builds upon the slick annotations of specialized photo-interpreters on Sentinel-1 SAR data for 6 years over 3 exploration and monitoring areas worldwide. All the considered SAR images and related annotation relate to real oil slick monitoring scenarios. Further, wind estimation is systematically computed to enrich the data collection. Paper contributions are the following : (i) a performance comparison of two deep learning approaches: semantic segmentation using FC-DenseNet and instance segmentation using Mask-RCNN. (ii) the introduction of meteorological information (wind speed) is deemed valuable for oil slick detection in the performance evaluation.The main results of this study show the effectiveness of slick detection by deep learning approaches, in particular FC-DenseNet, which captures more than 92% of oil instances in our test set. Furthermore, a strong correlation between model performances and contextual information such as slick size and wind speed is demonstrated in the performance evaluation. This work opens perspectives to design models that can fuse SAR and wind information to reduce the false alarm rate.

TI  - Stationary Marine Target Detection With Time-Series SAR Imagery
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Stationary marine targets, such as oil rigs and offshore wind turbines, usually show up like bright spots without or with trivial position shifts in multitemporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. They will trigger considerable false alarms in target detection applications tasked with ship detection, if they are not identified. An algorithm for stationary marine target detection, developed based on the assumption that the apparent positions of a stationary target in multitemporal imagery are also stationary or nearly so, is proposed in this article. This algorithm requires a strict time-series of SAR images in temporal sequence as input. For each input SAR image, all targets on sea surface are initially detected with an iterative cell-averaging constant false-alarm rate detection algorithm, and their longitude and latitude positions are then used to identify whether they are stationary targets. Under this algorithm, a stationariness index with five levels ("unknown target," "suspected new stationary target," "stationary target," "suspected removed stationary target," and "removed target") is defined for each target and must be iteratively updated with the latest level of identification. The proposed algorithm is promising for monitoring the status of stationary marine targets over a large sea area, because the processing of all input SAR images follows the same procedure and meanwhile the stationariness index is generated and kept updated. Two examples with GF-3 and RADARSAT-2 images are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in detecting both offshore wind turbines and oil rigs.

TI  - Interoperability of ECOSTRESS and Landsat for mapping evapotranspiration time series at sub-field scales
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-surface temperature retrieved from thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing has proven to be a valuable constraint in surface energy balance models for estimating evapotranspiration (ET). For optimal utility in agricultural water management applications, frequent thermal imaging (<4-day revisit) at sub-field (100 m or less) spatial resolution is desired. While, the current suite of Landsat satellites (7 and 8) provides the required spatial resolution, the 8-day combined revisit can be inadequate to capture rapid changes in surface moisture status or crop phenology, particularly in areas of persistent cloud cover. The new ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) mission, with an average 4-day revisit interval and nominal 70-m resolution, provides a valuable research platform for augmenting Landsat TIR sampling and for investigating TIR-based ET mapping mission requirements more broadly. This study investigates the interoperability of Landsat and ECOSTRESS imaging for developing ET image timeseries with high spatial (30-m) and temporal (daily) resolution. A data fusion algorithm is used to fuse Landsat and ECOSTRESS ET retrievals at 30 m with daily 500-m retrievals using TIR data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) over target agricultural sites spanning the United States.The added value of the combined multi-source dataset is quantified in comparison with daily flux tower observations collected within these target domains. In addition, we investigate ET model performance as a function of ECOSTRESS view angle, overpass time, and time separation between TIR and Landsat visible to shortwave infrared (VSWIR) data acquisitions used to generate land surface temperature, leaf area index, and albedo inputs to the surface energy balance model. The results demonstrate the value of the higher temporal sampling provided by ECOSTRESS, especially in areas that are frequently impacted by cloud cover. Limiting usage to ECOSTRESS scenes collected between 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p. m. and nadir viewing angles <20 degrees yielded daily (24-h) ET retrievals of comparable quality to the well-tested Landsat baseline. We also discuss challenges in using land-surface temperature from a thermal free-flyer system for ET retrieval, which may have ramifications for future TIR water-use mapping missions.

TI  - Avoidable mortality by implementing more restrictive fine particles standards in Brazil: An estimation using satellite surface data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - A growing number of epidemiological studies have been affirming the linking between fine particles (PM2.5) and deaths due to diverse causes as a result of long-term exposure. This work demonstrates the benefits of improving air quality policies by evaluating the impact of PM2.5 in terms of avoidable mortality due to all causes, cardiopulmonary causes, and lung cancer, between 2014 and 2018, for 5570 Brazilian cities. Satellite annual surface PM2.5 concentrations were compared with available monitoring measurements and used as the baseline scenario. Each phase of the Brazilian air quality legislation (CONAMA 491/2018) was used as a control scenario. The satellite PM2.5 annual surface levels were slightly lower than the monitoring concentrations, with an average mean bias of -2.7 mu g/m(3). No annual mean PM2.5 concentration above 20 mu g/m(3) was observed in any city in 2014 and 2018. In 2016, 23% of cities exceeded the annual mean concentration of 10 mu g/m(3). A weak positive correlation was found between city-level PM2.5 and population, vehicle fleet, number of fire outbreaks, urban area size, Growth Domestic Product per capita, Human Development Index, and life expectancy. During the five years, a total of 48,700 +/- 7570 deaths due to all causes, 24,100 +/- 3260 due to cardiopulmonary causes, and 1780 +/- 435 due to lung cancer could be avoided if the maximum PM2.5 annual concentration of 10 mu g/m(3) was not exceeded. Less restrictive standards lead to much lower avoidable deaths. For example, considering the maximum annual concentration of 20 mu g/m(3), 1335 +/- 175 deaths due to all causes could be avoided between 2015 and 2017. Our results indicate the importance of adopting more restrictive air quality standards in Brazil. If the current levels do not protect life as they should be, an effort regarding control emissions, monitoring, and modeling is essential to construct an effective air quality management for the country, aiming to comprehend the current PM2.5 concentration and to achieve lower standards.

TI  - <i>NOTES FROM THE UNDERGROUND</i>: MAJOR TRENDS IN SWEDISH RECEPTION
T2  - STUDIA LITTERARUM
M3  - Article
AB  - Notes from the Underground has become a relevant text in Sweden only since the second half of the 20th century, primarily due to the emergence of translations and criticism, but also in connection with the construction of "the people's home" ("folkhemmet"), which is what a Swedish person thinks about when reading about Crystal Palace. However, not only social ideas attract Swedish readers in Notes from the Underground; the problems of human isolation, desire, and inability to love another person more than oneself, as well as the worldview of a "paradoxalist" are also relevant to them. The multi-layered text of Notes from the Underground has not remained unnoticed either. The article examines several instances of the Notes from the Underground reception in Swedish literature, namely social and philosophical (Sven Delblank, Lars Ahlin), socio-religious (Birgitta Trotzig), existentialist (Lars Gyllensten), and aesthetic (Lars Ahlin). It is worth mentioning that even when referring to Dostoevsky's work in social debates, Swedish authors almost never ignore its philosophical context or reduce the universal human issues raised by the novel to the purely social issues projecting them on Swedish reality.

M3  - Article
AB  - The historical resistance of a sociocultural and identity nature that indigenous peoples have carried out in their territories reflects the condition of fighting for other scenarios where a harmonious balance between life, land and territory coexists. Part of this narrative was organized as an emerging epistemic space, which is committed to giving weight to the forms of re-colonization sponsored by the hegemonic groups from the private and commercial interests of those above on the modern media, networks and institutions. colonial. In this way, the purpose of this reflection is to make an approximation about the conception of a decolonial intercultural indigenous citizenship, taking into account the processes of liberation and decoloniality gestated in Our America, since they are referents of the expressions of struggles / resistance emanating from indigenous peoples, which are aimed at promoting a worldview on defense in ancestral territories. The methodological logic, used for the construction of the text, is a critical and horizontal analysis from the subject, based on the importance of deliberating on decolonizing experiences that give weight to the dynamics of modernity-coloniality submerged in the world system - capitalist.

M3  - Article
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has severely hampered the functioning of any health system, absorbing a considerable amount of resources and with the threat of widespread infection in the health services. The present survey has been carried out in Italy to evaluate if and how COVID-19 also affected skin melanoma management. We enrolled 13 Italian centres highly qualified in the diagnosis and care of skin melanoma. We compared a set of information evaluating the amount of activity for melanoma performed during February-April 2020 with the same quarter in 2019. The number of new melanoma diagnosis, biopsies, wide local excisions, overall pathology reports decreased. However, the most severe cases seem promptly managed with sentinel lymph node biopsies, new systemic treatments (north) and the total number of (advanced) treated patients (centre-south). The COVID-19 experience has underlined the need to exploit the help which may come from telemedicine.

AB  - The waters of Ciletuh Bay are one of the waters located in southern Java that interact directly with the Indian Ocean, which is utilized for fishing and tourism activities. Opportunities for utilization of Ciletuh bay waters in the field of fisheries need to be maximized by monitoring the quality of the bay area's waters. Remote sensing methods can identify and analyse the results of the spectral recording of water with observations of TSS and Chlorophyll-a spreads obtained using the Budhiman algorithm et al. (2004), and the concentration of TSS results from the algorithm Wibowo et al., (1994). Observations were conducted using Citra Landsat-8 in 2019 - 2020. The results of the algorithm's application obtained the results of TSS concentrations in the waters of Ciletuh Bay have a maximum value of >125 mg/l - 225 mg/l, and a minimum value of 6 mg/l - 15 mg/l. Chlorophyll-a concentration reaches a maximum value of 6 mg/l - 10 mg/l, and a minimum value of 3 mg/l - 5 mg/l. The same distribution pattern is indicated by both parameters: high concentrations in coastal areas and river estuaries and lower in the high seas.

TI  - Magical Realism: The Spoken Word as a Superperson in Niyi Osundare's <i>The Word Is an Egg</i>
T2  - SCRUTINY2-ISSUES IN ENGLISH STUDIES IN SOUTHERN AFRICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Yoruba are one of the major ethnic groups in West Africa, with Nigeria being the homeland for the majority. The Yoruba poet Niyi Osundare's work is influenced by the Yoruba animist worldview, which venerates the spoken word. Such influence is evident in his depiction of the spoken word as an extraordinary sort of person, a superperson. One central artistic feature of his poetry is the adaptation of devices of Yoruba oral literature. Therefore, most studies of his poetry privilege its link to Yoruba oral poetry. However, the use of devices found in Yoruba folktales in his verse has not been subjected to detailed study. One implication of this is that, despite magical realism being a major artistic feature of Osundare's poetry, critics have largely overlooked the fact that he is a magical realist poet. In his collection The Word Is an Egg (Ibadan: Kraft, 2000), Osundare relies substantially on the folktale as a model to frame his message on the personhood of the spoken word. In this article, I use the lens of magical realism to explore how he uses an adapted Yoruba folktale to depict the message that the spoken word is a superperson who deserves to be treated with respect.

AB  - This study assessed the impact produced by a wildfire and an infectious outbreak led by an oomycete pseudofungi, both occurred in 2015, on the state of Araucaria-Lenga forests of the China Muerta Reserve, placed in the southern Andes of Chile. To do this, a greenness vegetation spectral index was calculated over a multitemporal set of Landsat-8 images, acquired biannually on nearanniversary dates, which was subject to subtractions between ex-ante (2013) and ex-post dates (2015, 2017, 2019). Results show the magnitude and temporal progression of both disturbances, highlighting the celerity and aggressiveness of the wildfire. Although the affected vegetation land covers currently show values close to the recovery of the primal biomass, the inclusion of field-based data to deepen the possible composition and structure variations of these forests is needed.

TI  - TESS Observations of the Luhman 16 AB Brown Dwarf System: Rotational Periods, Lightcurve Evolution, and Zonal Circulation*
T2  - ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Brown dwarfs were recently found to display rotational modulations, commonly attributed to cloud cover of varying thickness, possibly modulated by planetary-scale waves. However, the long-term, continuous, high-precision monitoring data to test this hypothesis for more objects is lacking. By applying our novel photometric approach to Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite data, we extract a high-precision lightcurve of the closest brown dwarfs, which form the binary system Luhman 16 AB. Our observations, which cover about 100 rotations of Luhman 16 B, display continuous lightcurve evolution. The periodogram analysis shows that the rotational period of the component that dominates the lightcurve is 5.28 hr. We also find evidence for periods of 2.5, 6.94, and 90.8 hr. We show that the 2.5 and 5.28 hr periods emerge from Luhman 16 B and that they consist of multiple, slightly shifted peaks, revealing the presence of high-speed jets and zonal circulation in this object. We find that the lightcurve evolution is well fit by the planetary-scale waves model, further supporting this interpretation. We argue that the 6.94 hr peak is likely the rotation period of Luhman 16 A. By comparing the rotational periods to observed v sin(i) measurements, we show that the two brown dwarfs are viewed at angles close to their equatorial planes. We also describe a long-period (P similar to 91 hr) evolution in the lightcurve, which we propose emerges from the vortex-dominated polar regions. Our study paves the way toward direct comparisons of the predictions of global circulation models to observations via periodogram analysis.

AB  - To ensure that the great opportunities of Copernicus satellite data offered, in open and free mode, are fully grasped, a major awareness of them must be widespread among European citizens, companies, and public administrations. To this end, initiatives such as the EO-UPTAKE Ligurian regional project aim at studying application scenarios centered on the use of Copernicus data and the dissemination of their outcomes to citizens and local authorities. As an example of this activity, the paper focuses on an application scenario for monitoring the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect, considered among the most impacting effects on urban ecosystems, analyzed in the metropolitan area of Genoa. We discuss some strengths and weaknesses in the use of Copernicus satellite data and services, intending to provide a preliminary set of guidelines, useful not only for analyzing the UHI phenomenon in other urban contexts but also as a concrete example of exploitation of the Copernicus ecosystem.

TI  - Machine learning for identification of frailty in Canadian primary care practices
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POPULATION DATA SCIENCE (IJPDS)
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionFrailty is a medical syndrome, commonly affecting people aged 65 years and over and is characterized by a greater risk of adverse outcomes following illness or injury. Electronic medical records contain a large amount of longitudinal data that can be used for primary care research. Machine learning can fully utilize this wide breadth of data for the detection of diseases and syndromes. The creation of a frailty case definition using machine learning may facilitate early intervention, inform advanced screening tests, and allow for surveillance.ObjectivesThe objective of this study was to develop a validated case definition of frailty for the primary care context, using machine learning.MethodsPhysicians participating in the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network across Canada were asked to retrospectively identify the level of frailty present in a sample of their own patients (total n = 5,466), collected from 2015-2019. Frailty levels were dichotomized using a cut-off of 5. Extracted features included previously prescribed medications, billing codes, and other routinely collected primary care data. We used eight supervised machine learning algorithms, with performance assessed using a hold-out test set. A balanced training dataset was also created by oversampling. Sensitivity analyses considered two alternative dichotomization cut-offs. Model performance was evaluated using area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve, F1, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value and positive predictive value.ResultsThe prevalence of frailty within our sample was 18.4%. Of the eight models developed to identify frail patients, an XGBoost model achieved the highest sensitivity (78.14%) and specificity (74.41%). The balanced training dataset did not improve classification performance. Sensitivity analyses did not show improved performance for cut-offs other than 5.ConclusionSupervised machine learning was able to create well performing classification models for frailty. Future research is needed to assess frailty inter-rater reliability, and link multiple data sources for frailty identification.

TI  - A review and meta-analysis of remote sensing data, GIS methods, materials and indices used for monitoring the coastline evolution over the last twenty years
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - The current review study focuses on a statistical analysis (Meta-analysis) of the most common methods, materials, software, and indices used by researchers over the last twenty years to evaluate and quantify the shoreline evolution. Furthermore, this review targets to highlight some critical points through studied literature such as a) the low rate of high-resolution satellite images usage in a subject where the accuracy is prerequisite, b) the effort to derive information from Landsat images in order to take advantage of the 50-years archive and the freely availability c) the impulse of the UAV during the last 5 years as an alternative low cost but high accurate source of data d) the fact that only 50% of the coastal erosion studies are funded. One hundred thirty-eight papers and articles have been analyzed in detail by the authors and all the key points (methods, materials, software, and indices) were sorted for further statistical analysis. This study is not intended to criticize neither the methods nor the results being mentioned in the previous studies but to give the opportunity to the researchers (especially the new ones) to have an overall view of the subject for the last 20 years with just a glimpse.

AB  - Coastal environments are under successive physical and morphodynamical pressure. Nowadays, it is crucial to have a reliable and simple tool in order to measure the changes occurred diachronically. Among the research community there have been developed and applied many relative statistical models which are quite reliable. In this study we try to compare in statistical terms the results of the most famous free extension, suited for commercial software for shoreline monitoring: The Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) and the Analyzing Moving Boundaries Using R (AMBUR). Both software are free open-source tools for shoreline analysis in Geographic Information System environment. The test site is located in the northwestern Peloponnese, Greece, between two littoral villages named Rogitika and Kaminia situated in the Gulf of Patras. The shoreline length is more than 6 kilometers. High-resolution images (air-photos mosaic and very high-resolution satellite data) for the years 1987, 1996, 2008, and 2018 were used. The images have been orthorectified and georeferenced to Hellenic Geodetic Reference System of 1987 (Greek Grid) using Leica Photogrammetry Suite (LPS). The data spatial resolution ranges from 0.25 m to 1.00 m. Transects every 50 meters were created and used for the measurements. We digitized the relative shorelines and we computed and compared the End Point Rate (EPR) rates calculated from both tools for three periods such as 1987-2018, 1996-2018, and 2008-2018 respectively. EPR calculates the annual rate of erosion or accretion computed in a specific transect. The rates between -0.10 and + 0.10 m were considered that correspond to a "stable" area. The tide height rates were considered negligible (0.00 m +/- 10.00 cm) and so did not affect the computations. Moreover, a Linear Regression statistical process applied for correlation of EPR calculated rates from AMBUR and DSAS seaward and landward models. Finally, the results are presented and discussed in the current paper.

TI  - Modelling seasonal pasture growth and botanical composition at the paddock scale with satellite imagery
T2  - IN SILICO PLANTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal pasture monitoring can increase the efficiency of pasture utilization in livestock grazing enterprises. However, manual monitoring of pasture over large areas is often infeasible due to time and financial constraints. Here, we monitor changes in botanical composition in Tasmania, Australia, through application of supervised learning using satellite imagery (Sentinel-2). In the field, we measured ground cover and botanical composition over a 12-month period to develop a supervised classification approach used to identify pasture classes. Across seasons and paddocks, the approach predicted pasture classes with 75-81 % accuracy. Botanical composition varied seasonally in response to biophysical factors (primarily climate) and grazing behaviour, with seasonal highs in spring and troughs in autumn. Overall, we demonstrated that 10-m multispectral imagery can be reliably used to distinguish between pasture species as well as seasonal changes in botanical composition. Our results suggest that farmers and land managers should aim to quantify within-paddock variability rather than paddock average cover, because the extent and duration of very low ground cover puts the paddock/field at risk of adverse grazing outcomes, such as soil erosion and loss of pasture biomass, soil carbon and biodiversity. Our results indicate that satellite imagery can be used to support grazing management decisions for the benefit of pasture production and the improvement of environmental sustainability.

TI  - Modelling nighttime air temperature from remote sensing imagery and GIS data
T2  - SPACE, SATELLITES, AND SUSTAINABILITY II
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Space, Satellites, and Sustainability II
CL  - Glasgow, SCOTLAND
AB  - The estimation of the Earth's surface temperature (LST) from the infrared thermal radiation (TIR) emitted by the Earth detected by means of remote sensing has allowed a giant leap in climate analysis. The specialized literature has highlighted the singular importance of the LST in the generation of the Urban Heat Island (UHI), especially at night. It is during the night that the effects of UHI become more apparent, due to the low cooling capacity of urban construction materials and is during nighttime that temperatures can cause higher health risks, leading to the aggravation of negative impacts on people's health and comfort in extreme events such as heat waves becoming more and more frequent and lasting longer. However, the study of nocturnal UHIs is still poorly developed, due to the structural problems. On the one hand, the scarcity of meteorological stations that allow obtaining the air temperature (Ta) with an adequate degree of spatial resolution. And, on the other, due to the limited temporal availability of medium / high resolution nocturnal satellite images that make it possible to know the LST at night.Traditional methods for obtaining nocturnal UHI have been directed either to extrapolation of data from weather stations, or obtaining Ta through urban transects. In the first case, the lack of weather stations in urban landscapes makes it extremely difficult to obtain data to extrapolate and propose models at a detailed resolution scale. In the second case, there is a manifest difficulty in obtaining data simultaneously and significantly representative of urban and rural zones. Remote sensing images are another methodology used to measure nighttime UHI, but the greatest limitation of this method is the scarcity of high-resolution images that allow rigorous nighttime LST to be obtained. Only MODIS, or Sentinel 3, offer free mid-resolution nighttime thermal imaging for LST and UHI analysis. Furthermore, the integration of LST (obtained from remote sensing imagery) with Ta (obtained from weather stations) continues to be a pending challenge. The right estimation of the temperature of the air at approximate to 2-m height above ground (Ta) from LST is possible but complex. The vertical lapse rate to be applied is function of the surface energy balance, which varies in function of the nature of the surface and of the instant of the day.The objective of this paper is to integrate the information derived from the thermal band of satellite images (LST) with the "in situ" measurements of the Ta obtained at meteorological stations. The methodology used consists, first, in developing a model by means of multi-regression analysis of the night air temperatures, using as explanatory variables, in addition to the physical characteristics of the territory (longitude, latitude, altitude, distance to the sea, slope, orientation), the characteristics derived from vegetation (NDVI), urbanization (NDBI) as well as the LST obtained by means of MODIS. And, secondly, downscaling the previous model, using the information obtained from Landsat 8. In this way, a set of models is obtained at different resolutions that allow estimating the nighttime temperature at a detailed level.The case study is the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona (636 km(2), 3.3 million inhabitants).

AB  - AERONET-OC collects data from worldwide distributed autonomous CE-318 sun-photometers adapted to provide measurements of the radiance emerging from the sea (i. e., water-leaving radiance). The network supports satellite ocean color validation activities through standardized measurements performed at different sites with a single measuring system and protocol. In January 2020 the Bahia Blanca site was established at the mouth of the main navigation channel of the Bahia Blanca Estuary, a complex system where widespread erosion and strong tidal currents are responsible for the typically high suspended loads in the channel. In this work we present a validation of three different algorithms for the atmospheric correction of Landsat-OLI scenes over the area, based on AERONET-OC data and in situ measurements obtained with a hand-held spectroradiometer. Surface remote sensing reflectance was used to retrieve satellite turbidity and the algorithm performance was tested using turbidity measurements obtained from water samples collected simultaneously with satellite overpasses. According to our results, the best fit was obtained with the atmospheric correction algorithm based on the black-pixel assumption, with the aerosol type estimated using the two OLI-SWIR bands and allowed to vary spatially (per pixel variable epsilon). The aerosol type changed along the estuary, with an epsilon parameter that commonly decreased from the inner section through the mouth. The regression line of in situ measurements with satellite turbidity showed a good performance (R2 = 0.97, n=20), with a high accuracy (RMSE = 4.03, NMAE= 0.16) and no tendency to over or underestimation (BIAS = 0.63). The application of properly validated algorithms to satellite data from high spatial resolution images allowed for the identification of detailed turbidity features in the estuary, resulting from re-suspension phenomena over banks and turbulent currents.

TI  - Natural Pans as an Important Surface Water Resource in the Cuvelai Basin-Metrics for Storage Volume Calculations and Identification of Potential Augmentation Sites
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous ephemeral rivers and thousands of natural pans characterize the transboundary Iishana-System of the Cuvelai Basin between Namibia and Angola. After the rainy season, surface water stored in pans is often the only affordable water source for many people in rural areas. High inter- and intra-annual rainfall variations in this semiarid environment provoke years of extreme flood events and long periods of droughts. Thus, the issue of water availability is playing an increasingly important role in one of the most densely populated and fastest growing regions in southwestern Africa. Currently, there is no transnational approach to quantifying the potential storage and supply functions of the Iishana-System. To bridge these knowledge gaps and to increase the resilience of the local people's livelihood, suitable pans for expansion as intermediate storage were identified and their metrics determined. Therefore, a modified Blue Spot Analysis was performed, based on the high-resolution TanDEM-X digital elevation model. Further, surface area-volume ratio calculations were accomplished for finding suitable augmentation sites in a first step. The potential water storage volume of more than 190,000 pans was calculated at 1.9 km(3). Over 2200 pans were identified for potential expansion to facilitate increased water supply and flood protection in the future.

TI  - Agricultural Drought Identification Based On Soil Moisture Index (SMI) During 2019 Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) In Bekasi Regency
T2  - SEVENTH GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM 2021

CP  - 7th Geoinformation Science Symposium
CL  - Yogyakarta, INDONESIA
AB  - The 2019 Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) event has impacted Indonesia in many ways. The extreme weather events due to the changes in rainfall patterns and increased average temperature were causing severe agricultural drought in some areas, including Bekasi Regency. Monitoring agricultural drought is challenging due to the nature and extent of the damage caused by the event. This study aims to identify some of the agricultural drought events in Bekasi based on soil moisture features (SMI). The approximate agricultural drought model was generated from Normalized Difference Drought Index (NDDI), while soil moisture information was derived from the Soil Moisture Index (SMI). Landsat 8 OLI-TIRS was utilized for generating both indexes. The analysis was carried out in the dry months of 2019, including July, August, September, and October, where the lowest rainfalls were found. The study founds that more than 50% of the area was damaged by severe drought every month. Most of the severe drought occurred in September, damaging 50,919.32 hectares (91%) of rice fields. Statistical-based Pearson's correlation shows a significant relationship between NDDI and SMI, with R coefficient ranges from -0.37 to -0.74, especially from July to October. Conclusively, both indexes were successfully applied to picture agricultural drought phenomena in Bekasi Regency.

T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The HIV sentinel surveillance (HSS) serves to estimate the levels and trend of HIV prevalence among high-risk, bridge, and general population and monitors HIV management at national, state, and district levels. Data from HSS are valuable in understanding the risk factors associated with HIV transmission with particular demographic characteristics. Objectives: The objective was to analyze the sociodemographic profile of the pregnant mothers attending the antenatal care (ANC) clinics in Karnataka, in order to understand the dynamics of HIV within the general population in Karnataka. Materials and Methods: Study design: this was a cross-sectional study conducted using consecutive sampling method. Study setting: the surveillance was conducted at select antenatal clinics, in Karnataka, India, between January and March, in the years 2013, 2015, and 2017. Methodology: in total, 74,278 eligible pregnant women aged between 15 and 49 years, attending the sentinel sites for the first time during the surveillance period, were included in the study. Information on their sociodemographic characteristics and blood samples was collected. Results: HIV prevalence among the ANC clinic attendees has significantly declined, reaching a recent stabilization. The risk factors significantly associated with HIV among pregnant women were age, education, occupation, and marital status. HIV is highly concentrated in the northern and southern districts of Karnataka. Conclusion: Despite the declining trends of HIV prevalence in Karnataka, the epidemic is heterogeneous and concentrated within the state, calling for decentralized region-specific interventions.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Image and Signal Processing for Remote Sensing XXVII
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - In this work, we investigate on how the performance of pansharpening methods depends of their input data format, either floating-point, e.g. spectral radiance, or digital numbers (DN) in a packed fixed-point representation. It is theoretically proven and experimentally demonstrated that methods based on multiresolution analysis are unaffected by the data format, which instead is crucial for methods based on component-substitution (CS), unless the intensity component is calculated by means of a multivariate linear regression between the upsampled bands and the lowpass-filtered Pan, as it occurs for the most advanced CS methods. In an experimental setup, WorldView-2 data are either fused in their original 11-bits DN format, or converted to spectral radiance before fusion, by applying the gains and offsets provided in the file header. In the former case, fusion results are converted to spectral radiance before quality is measured. Nine fusion methods have been considered: results exactly match the theoretical investigations. For the majority of CS fusion methods, which do not feature a regression-based intensity calculation, results are better whenever they are obtained from floating-point calibrated data.

CL  - Univ Gadjah Mada, ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Dual-polarized (VV and VH) Sentinel-1 Synthetic-Aperture Radar (SAR) Ground Range Detected (GRD) data are available in 9-m spatial resolution and 12-day repeat orbit. A constellation of two satellites, Sentinel 1A and Sentinel 1B, capture these data with ascending and descending orbits, thus increasing the revisit time at the equator to every six days. Those specifications allow creating dense cross-orbit time-series data with a relatively high spatial resolution, beneficial for identifying land-covers and land-uses with unique temporal dynamics, such as paddies. This study was intended to assess the accuracy of time-series dual-polarized cross-orbit Sentinel 1A and 1B GRD data for mapping paddy extents. The monthly median value of these data was processed in Google Earth Engine and used as inputs in the paddy identification in Magelang District using bagging random forests (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) algorithms. Variables were ranked based on importance and selected using recursive feature elimination (RFE) and RF model to reduce the data dimensionality and understand the variable importance corresponding to a different month of the year. The resulting variable importance demonstrates better contributions of VV polarization and ascending orbit to the mapping model, and the producer's and user's accuracies achieved by RF classifier were 75% and 93.9%. For these reasons, an ascending (ASC) dataset provides better accuracy than its descending (DSC) counterpart and the combination of both (ASC+DSC). The user's accuracy of the paddy identified using the RF model with ascending Sentinel 1-data is 4% and 6% higher than the XGB models built using ASC and cross-orbit (ASC+DSC) datasets, respectively.

TI  - Degradation of agricultural land: Evidence from non-farm livelihood sites in Ogun state, Southwest Nigeria
T2  - COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In Nigeria, non-farm livelihood activities are becoming rampant in agrarian communities, thereby reducing land capacity to support agriculture. This study examines effect of non-farm livelihoods on agricultural land. A multi-sampling technique was used to sample 160 rural households. Soil samples, Geographic Information System (GIS) coordinates and Landsat images were obtained. Data were subjected to statistical, GIS, chemical analyses. Findings revealed that sand mining (88%), rock mining (63.1%) and tree felling (76.9%) were the main non-farm livelihoods on agricultural land for about two decades. Soil analyses revealed that soil nutrients were lower at livelihood site; with nitrogen (0.050-0.150%), sodium (0.1-0.3cmolkg-1), and calcium (2-5cmolkg1). Result showed that matured forest reduces to 9.39% in 2016 but was 15.12% in 2000. It is recommended that degraded land should be improved, people should be educated on the detrimental effect of degradation, and their activities should be monitored to avert further degradation of agricultural land.

AB  - Remote sensing methods allow obtaining important information from the Earth's surface to effectively evaluate agricultural processes. This research work proposes to carry out the comparative analysis of evapotranspiration using the methodologies of the SEBAL model and the evaporimeter pan in the Huancane basin, Peru. The specific objectives were to estimate the evapotranspiration through the SEBAL model from Landsat 8 images, to estimate the real evapotranspiration through the evaporimeter pan method from meteorological data from the Huancane and Mufiani stations, for the comparison and validation of the evapotranspiration results obtained. with the SEBAL model. The methodological stages considered are: the collection of meteorological data from the National Meteorology and Hydrology Service (SENAMHI) of Peru and Landsat 8 satellite images, the application of the SEBAL algorithm and the evaporimeter pan method, to obtain evapotranspiration. For the SEBAL model, the lowest evapotranspiration values correspond to areas with soils without crops or with low vegetation cover (NDVI < 0.21) and for areas covered with vegetation or grasslands (NDVI > 0.41) obtaining values between 1.50 to 4.20 mm/day. The evaporimeter pan method allowed to determine the real evapotranspiration (ETR), for the points of location of the weather stations, values that vary between 1.76 to 2.44 mm/day. The comparison and validation of the evapotranspiration values observed (ETR evaporimeter pan) and estimated (ETR SEBAL), for the analysis areas near the Huancane station present a mean square error of 0.26 and 0.25, coefficient of determination of 0.97 and a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.81 and 0.83. Likewise, for the areas near the Mufiani station where they show a mean square error of 0.13 and 0.14, coefficient of determination of 0.97 and 0.93; and a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.81 and 0.82. The results obtained with the SEBAL model are satisfactory, which shows that its use is feasible.

T2  - BALKANISTIC FORUM
M3  - Article
AB  - The need to comprehend contemporary global problems the mankind is facing poses demands to modern science to expand the range of functions and strengthen interaction between areas of society. The modern anthropocentric scientific paradigm makes a focus on the interdisciplinary research of the civilizational processes of social development, which created the need for a comprehensive study of sociocultural and linguistic processes in their functional interaction during the historical development of society.The process of human socialization is, first of all, the mastery of the symbolic cultural code and cultural memory of society, which in modern society is losing its usual monoculturism and is increasingly acquiring a bi- and multicultural character, which poses a pressing multifaceted problem for society - linguistic policy, linguistic consciousness, persona lingua.The language policy of any particular country or region is dictated by the prevailing socio-political situation in the country and contributes to shaping the fate of this country for it regulates the status of the state language, the language of the press, education, and science.In each society, certain language priorities are formed, as well as language prohibitions that regulate the life of society, and the formation of the worldview of the participants in society depends on the languages being assimilated. Not surprisingly, the problems of language (with the light hand of the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein) have long exceeded philological problems of philological problems.The language policy of small countries largely depends on foreign policy factors; it is interesting to follow the example of Georgia to trace the change in language priorities in different historical eras (from Arabic, Persian, Greek, Latin, Turkish to Russian, and now to English). The Second World War became an important milestone for Soviet Georgia in language policy: the spiritual unity of all the peoples of the USSR was so intense that the formation of a single supra-ethnic community "Soviet nation" was successfully supported by language policy: having Russian as the second native language. The education system and the press were fully focused on the Russian language. The schools taught foreign languages (French, German, English) by choice, but the minimization of hours, the grammatical approach and the lack of language practice allowed only units to learn European languages at the level of free communication.The 1990s became a period of forced breaking of habitual linguistic priorities for Georgia, free of imperial influence. English has become compulsory subject matter at all stages of the Georgian educational system, Russian is studied only by choice as a second foreign language with a minimum number of hours. The previously banned Turkish language is strengthening its position, especially in Adjara, neighboring Turkey.

AB  - The article is devoted to the mythologization of time in Internet memes during the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors consider modern social mythology in the context of the digital humanities. Digitalization of human existence leads to the emergence of digital mythology, which allows us to comprehend the new electronic social reality and influences the formation of worldview. The myths of the digital age are embedded in the tools of social communication, one of which is the Internet meme. The authors define the Internet meme as a part of digital culture and a communication phenomenon that can transmit emotionally colored information and influence its perception. Internet memes contain myth elements that allow communicants to perceive the transmitted information with a high degree of efficiency. Memes make it possible for Internet users to describe the realities of a rapidly changing world, while at the same time comprehending it at a high speed, thanks to the recognition of the myth. Myths about the time have become particularly relevant during the pandemic, as they were associated with the need to adapt to new conditions of existence and accelerate digitalization. Internet memes about the year 2020 demonstrate the features of the mythologization of time in the pandemic period.

TI  - Deep Learning for RFI Artifact Recognition in Sentinel-1 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Beyond the variety of unwanted disruptions that appear quite frequently in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) measurements, radio-frequency interference (RFI) is one of the most challenging issues due to its various forms and sources. Unfortunately, over the years, this problem has grown worse. RFI artifacts not only hinder processing of SAR data, but also play a significant role when it comes to the quality, reliability, and accuracy of the final outcomes. To address this issue, a robust, effective, and-importantly-easy-to-implement method for identifying RFI-affected images was developed. The main aim of the proposed solution is the support of the automatic permanent scatters in SAR (PSInSAR) processing workflow through the exclusion of contaminated SAR data that could lead to misinterpretation of the calculation results. The approach presented in this paper for the purpose of recognition of these specific artifacts is based on deep learning. Considering different levels of image damage, we used three variants of a LeNet-type convolutional neural network. The results show the high efficiency of our model used directly on sample data.

TI  - Diminutives in the animistic language use of the eastern Finnic peoples
T2  - EMAKEELE SELTSI AASTARAAMAT-THE YEARBOOK OF THE ESTONIAN MOTHER TONGUE SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Diminutives are significantly more used in the languages of the eastern Finnic peoples (Veps, Karelians, Ludians) than others (especially Estonians or Finns). This could be explained by the long-term influence of the Russian language, which is extremely rich in diminutives. However, there are not as many diminutives in Votian or Ingrian, which are no less influenced by Russian. In the analysis of the use of diminutives of both Russian and other languages an anthropocentric perspective dominates. In the linguistic studies, evaluative use of language, courtesy behaviour and expression of emotions have been viewed almost exclusively in terms of human-centred (interpersonal) communication. Our long-term fieldwork has shown that the worldview of the eastern Finnic peoples is still heavily influenced by animistic cognition of nature and corresponding beliefs and linked to related behavioural practices and speech acts. The peoples of northern Eurasia, whose worldview is dominated by animistic ontology, are characterized by relatively restrained, non-emotional self-expression, which has to do with caution about the world of spirits. People do not talk about their feelings and plans; they also avoid giving assessments, making compliments, and praising others. Diminutives, as a phenomenon generally related to assessments and emotions, must have another function here. Based on our experience, we assume that this is related to an animistic worldview, leaning toward caution rather than an overflow of emotion. Diminutives express respect and attentiveness, which are addressed to the non-human world and are not in the service of anthropocentric self-centeredness. They are linked to a survival strategy, but from a different perspective.

TI  - An Analysis of Levels and Trends in HIV Prevalence Among Pregnant Women Attending Antenatal Clinics in Karnataka, South India, 2003-2019.
T2  - International journal of MCH and AIDS
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Periodic tracking of the trends and the levels of HIV prevalence at regional and district levels helps to strengthen a state's HIV/AIDS response. HIV prevalence among pregnant women is crucial for the HIV prevalence estimation of the general population. Karnataka is one of the high HIV prevalence states in India. Probing regional and district levels and trends of HIV prevalence provides critical insights into district-level epidemic patterns. This paper analyzes the region- and district-wise levels and trends of HIV prevalence among pregnant women attending the antenatal clinics (ANC) from 2003 to 2019 in Karnataka, South India.METHODS: HIV prevalence data collected from pregnant women in Karnataka during HIV Sentinel Surveillance (HSS) between 2003 and 2019 was used for trend analysis. The consistent sites were grouped into four zones (Bangalore, Belgaum, Gulbarga and Mysore regions), totaling 60 sites, including 30 urban and 30 rural sites. Regional and district-level HIV prevalence was calculated; trend analysis using Chi-square trend test and spatial analysis using QGIS software was done. For the last three HSS rounds, HIV prevalence based on sociodemographic variables was calculated to understand the factors contributing to HIV positivity in each region.RESULTS: In total, 254,563 pregnant women were recruited. HIV prevalence in Karnataka was 0.22 (OR: 0.15 95% CI: 0.16 - 0.28) in 2019. The prevalence was 0.24, 0.32, 0.17 and 0.14 in Bangalore, Belgaum, Gulbarga, and Mysore regions, respectively. HIV prevalence had significantly (P< 0.05) declined in 26 districts.CONCLUSION AND GLOBAL HEALTH IMPLICATIONS: HIV prevalence among pregnant women was comparatively higher in Bangalore and Belgaum regions. Analysis of contextual factors associated with the transmission risk and evidence-based targeted interventions will strengthen HIV management in Karnataka. Regionalized, disaggregated, sub-national analyses will help identify emerging pockets of infections, concentrated epidemic zones and contextual factors driving the disease transmission.

T2  - EZHEGODNIK FINNO-UGORSKIKH ISSLEDOVANII-YEARBOOK OF FINNO-UGRIC STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The article comprehensively examines the poetry of the classic of Mansi literature Andrei Tarkhanov. The place of the national literature in the system of the vast interliterary community of the peoples of the circumpolar zone is determined, the genetic connection of the Mansi artistic tradition with mythological ideas and folklore is emphasized. The most common, creatively significant themes and problems are identified: a great author's interest in the themes of time, history, cultural and civilizational identity of Russia is shown, the individual author's artistic panorama of the post-Soviet era is analyzed, the socio-psychological contexts of the experience of the author / lyrical subject of modernity are considered. The plots of Tarkhanov's appeal to Russian literature are studied, attention is paid to the study of the personological aspect. The focus of the reading falls on the poet's numerous attempts to comprehend Christian narratives in poetry, to delve into the axiology and ritual practices of Orthodoxy. When we interpret the text corpus of the Mansi poet, we take into account his linguistic choice, which significantly reduces the associative and meaningful contexts with "his" Mansi literature. In general, the realities and paradoxes of A. Tarkhanov's artistic worldview are identified, which are manifested at the figurative-symbolic level and in the author's choice of themes, situations of poetic actualization and aesthetic guidelines.Andrei Tarkhanov was less a Mansi poet in his inner nature than the legendary Yuvan Shestalov. It seems that he wanted to break out of the Mansi "vicious circle" and at the same time understood that a creative break with his roots, ethnocultural origins would significantly affect the quality and originality of his texts.He constantly had to balance between the Russian and Mansi worlds, artistic mentality.

AB  - This paper discusses an early investigation of the impact of the Covid-19 on the socio-economic activities by using the electricity consumption and the satellite nighttime light approach. This method was implemented in the island of Bali, a well-known tourism destination. The electricity consumption trend was investigated during a period of 2019-2020 and the result then was confirmed with the satellite image of nighttime light. The analysis results have shown that the declined electricity energy usage correlates with the reduced brightness level of the night time light. It was also found that the night time light image (NTL) from remote sensing data has successfully determined the areas with a significantly decreased socio-economic activities. In contrast, the image has also uncovered some areas with an increased in night time light brightness, which indicates an increased in socio-economic activities.

T2  - AD ALTA-JOURNAL OF INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In Japanese culture, the beauty ideal is holistically expressed in three images, three historical and cultural symbols: the charm of things (mono no aware), intimate beauty (yugen), and the beauty of lonely sadness (wabi-sabi). These concepts are the core of Japanese aesthetics, poetics, worldview, and outlook. This article reveals the characteristics of these aesthetic categories in the literature and analyzes the interpretation of the traditional aesthetic mono no aware, yugen, and wabi-sabi. The system of images, on the basis of which the authors create their understanding of the category of beauty, is made up of household items and interior decoration, writing materials, and other utensils. In such an unusual way, the author's embodiment of the traditional idea of the relationship between art and everyday life, when aesthetic principles determine the way of life, is obtained. According to the aesthetic concept of Japanese culture, the essence of beauty consists not so much in the result of pleasure from its contemplation but in the process of comprehending it, familiarizing with it. Emotional enrichment and spiritual elevation are the true essences of the mono no aware, yugen, and wabi-sabi symbols.

TI  - Improving Chlorophyll-A Estimation From Sentinel-2 (MSI) in the Barents Sea Using Machine Learning
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article addresses methodologies for remote sensing of ocean Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), with emphasis on the Barents Sea. We aim at improving the monitoring capacity by integrating in situ Chl-a observations and optical remote sensing to locally train machine learning (ML) models. For this purpose, in situ measurements of Chl-a ranging from 0.014-10.81 mg/m(3), collected for the years 2016-2018, were used to train and validate models. To accurately estimate Chl-a, we propose to use additional information on pigment content within the productive column by matching the depth-integrated Chl-a concentrations with the satellite data. Using the optical images captured by the multispectral imager instrument on Sentinel-2 and the in situ measurements, a new spatial window-based match-up dataset creation method is proposed to increase the number of match-ups and hence improve the training of the ML models. The match-ups are then filtered to eliminate erroneous samples based on the spectral distribution of the remotely sensed reflectance. In addition, we design and implement a neural network model dubbed as the ocean color net (OCN), that has performed better than existing ML-based techniques, including the Gaussian process Regression (GPR), regionally tuned empirical techniques, including the ocean color (OC3) algorithm and the spectral band ratios, as well as the globally trained Case-2 regional/coast colour (C2RCC) processing chain model C2RCC-networks. The proposed OCN model achieved reduced mean absolute error compared to the GPR by 5.2%, C2RCC by 51.7%, OC3 by 22.6%, and spectral band ratios by 29%. Moreover, the proposed spatial window and depth-integrated match-up creation techniques improved the performance of the proposed OCN by 57%, GPR by 41.9%, OC3 by 5.3%, and spectral band ratio method by 24% in terms of RMSE compared to the conventional match-up selection approach.

AB  - Remote sensing data are commonly utilized for agricultural applications pertaining to the assessment and monitoring of crop health. However, capabilities to detect and monitor livestock and associated operations, such as dairies and ranches, are comparatively limited. We acquired and characterized spectral reflectance signatures for materials expected to be common in unobscured areas of livestock agricultural facilities, i.e., livestock and waste material. Representative samples were measured in field surveys and the laboratory using an ASD FieldSpec 4 spectroradiometer spanning the 0.4-2.5 mu m reflective spectrum. We then applied the new signatures with conventional target detection algorithms to data collected by NASA/JPL's AVIRIS-NG imaging spectrometer to determine the feasibility of producing compositional distribution maps. Resulting match planes successfully delineated groups of livestock and waste materials, generally bounded by fenced pen areas, and inspection of high scoring pixel spectra suggested good agreement with ground truth measurements. This research is an initial demonstration of high spectral and spatial resolution AVIRIS-NG data to identify materials such as hair, which exhibit both broadband VIS-NIR pigmentation and narrow, structural protein-attributed SWIR vibrational absorption features. Further study may contribute toward enhancing land use/land cover map products and complementing investigations of biogenic methane sources.

Adada is also a compendium of Igbo cultural history and a storehouse of Igbo knowledge and worldview. Despite its socio-cultural significance in the life of Nsukka Igbo people, Adada masquerade has not received deserved attention of scholars and researchers. Building on Victor Turner's theory of cultural liminality which identifies a betwixt and between state in the middle phase of rites of passage, the study examines how the cultural ingredients of Adada masquerade anchor, ritualize and project the cultural identity of Nsukka Igbo people within the changing fields of society. Art historical approach was used in analyzing data collected through fieldwork carried out in three communities in Nsukka Igbo area. This involved participant observation in Adada masquerade performance in Ovoko community in 2014, photographic documentation of the masquerade and oral interviews with 17 relevant stakeholders comprising masquerade initiates and elders in the three communities. The iconography and aesthetics of Adada contain irresistible cultural ingredients that reveal how Nsukka Igbo people contained the liminal conditions of cross-cultural encounters. However, Adada's absence from the public space in recent times shows how acculturative agents like Christian evangelism, urbanism and modernism have adversely affected the willingness to animate the masquerade whose outing and performance is both entertaining and didactic.

T2  - PHYSIO-GEO
M3  - Article
AB  - This study of land cover changes in the Lobo watershed (12767 km2) is based on multispectral TM (1986), ETM+ (2008) and OLI (2015) images from Landsat satellites and on field surveys as a control. The processing applied to the images fed a database managed in a GIS. The mapping of land use in 1986, 2008 and 2015 made it possible to assess the changes between the different dates. The "crop fallow" and "crop" classes have always been largely dominant, but with strong variations for each of them, both varying in opposite directions. As early as 1986, the forest class represented only 4.6 % of the study area (584 km2). Its share fell to 0.96 % (123 km2) in 2008, before rising to 2.3 % (299 km2) in 2015, partly in connection with the development of shrub crops. Over the study period, the forest declined considerably in the areas where it should have been protected, the classified forest of HautSassandra and the Marahoue National Park.

TI  - Prognostic factors in triple-negative breast cancer: a retrospective cohort
T2  - REVISTA DA ASSOCIACAO MEDICA BRASILEIRA
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by lack of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression and accounts for 15-20% of all breast cancers. This study aims to analyze prognostic factors related to a reduction in overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and risk of mortality and recurrence in TNBC.METHODS: This is a retrospective observational cohort study. Medical records of 532 patients with breast cancer diagnosed from 2007 to 2020 were analyzed. Of these patients, 93 (17%) were women with TNBC. Ten medical records were excluded, and the final sample was composed of 83 women with TNBC. OS and DFS were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier model. Univariate analysis (log-rank test) and multivariate analysis (Cox regression) were used to examine prognostic factors related to a statistically significant reduction (p<0.05) in OS and DFS and increased risk of mortality and tumor recurrence.RESULTS: Smoking, advanced clinical stage, larger tumor size, angiolymphatic invasion, positive sentinel lymph node, axillary node involvement, higher cancer burden, surgical treatment with mastectomy, and recurrence were related to a significant decrease in OS and/or DFS and increased risk of mortality and/or recurrence in TNBC. The 10-year OS and DFS was around 61 and 65%, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Advanced clinical stage, positive sentinel lymph node, axillary node involvement, surgical treatment with mastectomy, and higher residual cancer burden were related to a significant reduction in OS and DFS and increased risk of mortality and recurrence in TNBC.

T2  - BIOTECHNOLOGY & BIOTECHNOLOGICAL EQUIPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the present investigation was to develop a basic methodological scheme for distinguishing organic, biodynamic and conventional areas of winter wheat cultivation, based on the satellite images from Sentinel-2. The target areas are located in the experimental field of the Institute of Agriculture in Karnobat, Bulgaria. The plant condition was determined on a three-point rating scale according to the average plant height, percentage of projective cover of the aboveground plant parts and intensity of the green color of leaves during the end of tillering to complete ripeness. To determine the homogeneity of the target polygons, we used a small drone DJI Phantom 4, with 1/2.3 CMOS camera and Dronedeploy to compile flight plans for shooting and photogrammetric processing of the images. ArcGIS was used in GIS procedures and analyses. Microsoft Excel, with Solver ADD-IN was used to clusterize the target polygons in order to distinguish the polygons of organic, biodynamic and conventional farming by the multispectral indices (CRI 1, MSAVI, NDVI, NDWI, PSSRa, PSSRc, WDRVI). All selected indices were calculated in GIS environment. Ground observations showed that there were differences in the condition of plants in different cultivation systems during the selected observation phases. The obtained results reveal that the differences in dynamics and development during the growth and development stages of the wheat in the organic, biodynamic and conventional fields can be traced by spectral characteristics from satellite images and they can be used to distinguish them.

AB  - Landslides are geological phenomena that are spread on Bulgarian territory mainly along the northern Black Sea coast and on the right banks of the Danube in the western part of the country. Mitigation of the negative effects of these destructive geological phenomena is the compilation of inventory maps of their distribution and registers with the main characteristics of the individual landslides. Conventional methods for making such maps are time-consuming and resource-intensive. Modern satellite, air and ground-based remote sensing technologies facilitate the production of landslide maps, reducing the time and resources required to compile and systematically update them. In this paper, we demonstrate the applicability of Differential Sentinel-1A satellite SAR interferometry (DInSAR) to assess the movement activity and use the information for further updating the national landslide inventories in Bulgaria. We perform several analyses based on multi-temporal InSAR techniques of Sentinel-1A data over selected areas prone to landslides. The use of new opportunities for free access to satellite images, which can be applied in conjunction with other methods, greatly facilitates the processes of inventory, mapping and study of landslides.

AB  - Landslide occurrences are result of natural or human activities, but regardless of the origin they change the landscape, destroy infrastructure and in some cases even leads to loss of human lives. In order to assess the hazard of this phenomenon remotely sensed data from aerial and satellite instruments are widely used to monitor the ground motions at regular intervals. Those methods are less expensive and less time consuming than terrain inspections and measurements and the other hand the size of the studied areas is larger. This was the rationale to initiate a study on the surface deformations in the area of "Fish-Fish" landslide located on the north part of the Black Sea coast of Bulgaria. Two sources of data were used to create a map of recent surface displacements in the said area - photogrammetric surveys with UAV and remotely sensed images from synthetic aperture radar from satellite instruments. The area of the landslide was investigated by photogrammetry in years 2019 and 2020 and as result created were two digital elevation models. The accuracy allowed registration of the surface motions at centimeter scale using ground control points located inside and outside the perimeter of the landslide. The satellite SAR data are provided at no cost by ESA originating from the twin constellation of Sentinel-1 mission. The authors downloaded SAR data for the same periods when the UAV surveys were made. Due to peculiarities of the local terrain it was possible only SAR images from descending orbit to be used. The processing of those data was done by verified interferometric processing method implemented in the SNAP software. Finally the results from control points for both sources were compared and good correlation between them was established. A map of the landslide area depicting the registered ground displacements was produced.

AB  - In the last decades data from satellites are being used more frequently to study the ground movements. This fact is evidenced by the increased number of research papers and projects using freely provided data by space agencies such ESA (European Space Agency) and JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) and increased revisiting time of the new instruments on-board satellites. Other reason for this increase are the latest developments in processing methods such as PSI (Persistent Scatterer Interferometry) and even increasing number of cloud processing options provided by universities and research centres. Nevertheless the information obtained by this manner has some drawbacks for example moderate spatial resolution. This is why in-situ data from precise GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) measurements are essential. In this study the authors used both kinds of data to study one of the regions of Bulgaria which is recognized to be highly prone to seismic and geological hazards namely the Southwest region. For this research two sources of data have been used - SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) data from Sentinel-1 mission of ESA and in-situ acquired contemporary and older GPS (Global Positioning System) data. As a result of SAR data processing produced were interferometric images from ascending and descending orbits to decrease the effect of the mountainous topography, while the results from the GNSS measurements were used for verification.

TI  - Wetland loss in Turkey over a hundred years: implications for conservation and management
T2  - ECOSYSTEM HEALTH AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The aims of this study were to provide a complete inventory of wetlands in Turkey including their past status (1910-1930) in comparison to the present time (2014). The types of wetlands and their area sizes were determined by using cartographical maps of 1/200,000 in scale made between 1910s and 1920s vs. 2006 CORINE Land Cover data, which were updated with Landsat 8 satellite images in 2014. The effect of possible climate change on wetlands sizes various local, national and regional rainfall datasets were analysed by correlation and regression analysis. A hundred years ago, the total number of natural wetlands was 1299 with a total surface area of 1,376,505 hectares. In 2014, the total number of natural wetlands had decreased to 900, with a total surface area of 1,085,936 hectares, so that 21.2% of the original wetlands were lost (291,339 hectares). The observed changes in the number of wetlands and their relative sizes cannot be attributed directly to changes in climate. Wetland drainage was largely responsible for observed wetland losses, but local changes in precipitation regimes partially contributed to this loss. Urgent conservation and restoration of wetlands are recommended to avoid further loss of wetlands in Turkey.

TI  - Impacts of Urbanization on the Muthurajawela Marsh and Negombo Lagoon, Sri Lanka: Implications for Landscape Planning towards a Sustainable Urban Wetland Ecosystem
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban wetland ecosystems (UWEs) play important social and ecological roles but are often adversely affected by urban landscape transformations. Spatio-temporal analyses to gain insights into the trajectories of landscape changes in these ecosystems are needed for better landscape planning towards sustainable UWEs. In this study, we examined the impacts of urbanization on the Muthurajawela Marsh and Negombo Lagoon (MMNL), an important UWE in Sri Lanka that provides valuable ecosystem services. We used remote sensing data to detect changes in the land use/cover (LUC) of the MMNL over a two-decade period (1997-2017) and spatial metrics to characterize changes in landscape composition and configuration. The results revealed that the spatial and socio-economic elements of rapid urbanization of the MMNL had been the main driver of transformation of its natural environment over the past 20 years. This is indicated by a substantial expansion of settlements (+68%) and a considerable decrease of marshland and mangrove cover (-41% and -21%, respectively). A statistical analysis revealed a significant relationship between the change in population density and the loss of wetland due to settlement expansion at the Grama Niladhari division level (n = 99) (where wetland includes marshland, mangrove, and water) (1997-2007: R-2 = 0.435, p = 0.000; 2007-2017: R-2 = 0.343, p = 0.000). The findings also revealed that most of the observed LUC changes occurred in areas close to roads and growth nodes (viz. Negombo, Ja-Ela, Wattala, and Katana), which resulted in both landscape fragmentation and infill urban expansion. We conclude that, in order to ensure the sustainability of the MMNL, there is an urgent need for forward-looking landscape and urban planning to promote environmentally conscious urban development in the area which is a highly valuable UWE.

T2  - International Journal of Mosquito Research
M3  - Article
AB  - Mosquito-borne diseases (MBDs) are a serious public health problem worldwide. The study was carried out from March 2015 to February 2016 to determine the fauna and distribution of mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) in ten sentinel sites in the River Nile State, Sudan. Mosquitoes were collected as adults from resting places and larvae from aquatic habitats. The location of mosquito collection was marked using a global positioning system (GPS). A total of 4,803 specimens were collected in the area. These comprised 9 mosquito species with Anopheles arabiensis (30.7%), and Culex univittatus (30.8%) formed the bulk of the collection. Variation was detected in the numbers of mosquitoes collected in different sentinel sites where the higher proportion was recorded in the Albawga site. The spatial distribution and the occurrence of the different species might indicate a high risk of transmission of several parasitic and viral MBDs in this state in the future. Serious planning, management, and decision-making towards vector control are urgently needed.

T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Land snails are often used to monitor soil pollution. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of Weatfert R complex mineral nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (N: P: K) fertilizer with high phosphorous content (NPK: 8/36/15 + SO3:13) on Eobania (syn. Helix) vermiculata used as a bioindicator species. Moreover, the histological and biochemical changes in the digestive gland were examined and biomarkers of environmental stress (glutathione peroxidase and lactate dehydrogenase activity) measured. Results showed that the fertilizer tested has a negative impact on the growth rate of juvenile snails. They also revealed alterations in the structure of the digestive gland and changes in biomarker response values in the field, accompanied by significant correlations with bioconcentration. Meanwhile, the biochemical parameters showed varying results representing an increase in the protein rate and a decrease in lipid and carbohydrate rates after treatment with weatfertin. Overall, our study showed that the fertilizer tested could have potential hazards on E. vermiculata and this snail was a suitable sentinel organism and the selected biomarkers are efficient for soil assessment.

TI  - Multisensor Data Fusion for Improved Segmentation of Individual Tree Crowns in Dense Tropical Forests
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Automatic tree crown segmentation from remote sensing data is especially challenging in dense, diverse, and multilayered tropical forest canopies, and tracking mortality by this approach is even more difficult. Here, we examine the potential for combining airborne laser scanning (ALS) with multispectral and hyperspectral data to improve the accuracy of tree crown segmentation at a study site in French Guiana. We combined an ALS point cloud clustering method with a spectral deep learning model to achieve 83% accuracy at recognizing manually segmented reference crowns (with congruence >0.5). This method outperformed a two-step process that involved clustering the ALS point cloud and then using the logistic regression of hyperspectral distances to correct oversegmentation. We used this approach to map tree mortality from repeat surveys and show that the number of crowns identified in the first that intersected with height loss clusters was a good estimator of the number of dead trees in these areas. Our results demonstrate that multisensor data fusion improves the automatic segmentation of individual tree crowns and presents a promising avenue to study forest demography with repeated remote sensing acquisitions.

T2  - QUAESTIO ROSSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - During the Civil War, the Communist Party and its activists had to constantly adapt to ever-changing situations. This paper aims to study their reaction in Ukraine in 1919 after Denikin took control of the country. It will focus on the 800 activists sent behind enemy lines from July to November 1919. Using the paperwork of special bodies created by the Central Committee (CC) of the Communist Party (Bolshevik) of Ukraine (CP(b)U) to tackle this task (Zafrontbyuro - rearguard bureau; Voenotdel - military department; Otdel Svjazi - communications department), the article will first question the way underground activists were selected. Second, it will highlight how missions behind enemy lines were designed and organized. Third, it will consider the missions themselves and the hardships endured once activists reached Denikin-controlled territory. Fourth, one has to wonder what activists tried to do, questioning what they thought about their dangerous job and what their missions effectively brought to the Bolsheviks. This will help us understand how the Civil War was indeed a "formative experience" (in Sheila Fitzpatrick's words) for the communists, shaping their worldview and behavior.

TI  - Content Analysis of Rock Poetry Texts when Describing the Semantics of the WAY and ROAD Symbols
T2  - NAUCHNYI DIALOG
M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with the question of methods for describing lexical semantics. Special attention is paid to symbols - linguistic signs expressing the worldview of culture. The relevance of the study is due to the need to develop an objective description methodology that meets both modem concepts of the semantics of a word and the nature of a symbol. A review of modem concepts of the word meaning is carried out. The question is raised about the possibility of describing the semantics of a symbol based on the analysis of the contextual environment of a linguistic sign. Attention is paid to cases of direct, figurative, symbolic and regular arbitrary use of the word. The author's development of a methodology for qualitative and quantitative content analysis of a representative sample of texts in describing the semantics of a symbol is presented. The classification of the levels of analysis of the composition of words that form the context of the use of the symbol is proposed. The author dwells on the stages and procedures for extracting the semantics of a symbol from the context in which it is used. The results of a comparative analysis of the semantics of the WAY and ROAD symbols in the language of Russian rock poetry are presented. It is proved that the presented methodology allows describing the semantics of a symbol, relying not on the abstract logic of the relationship of concepts, but on the semantic relations fixed in the text. The novelty of the research is seen in the fact that this technique allows us to consider a symbol not as an occasional, but as a linguistic unit, regularly reproduced by the carriers of the corresponding representations.

AB  - The present research introduces a satellite-based plant senescence reflectance index (PSRI2) involving in its calculation two red edge bands (0.705 mu m and 0.783 mu m) and the green peak band (0.560 mu m) of Sentinel-2 sensors. The index takes the advantages of the effectiveness of the red edge and green peak bands in monitoring alterations of cellular structures and anthocyanins content induced by drought stress. Environmental stresses are associated with accelerated cellular leaf senescence and browning of plant tissues. As browning progresses, the spectral reflectance in the whole range of the spectrum decreases. The decrease in reflectance is most pronounced in the green peak and in the range between 0.750 and 0.800 mu m, and is much smaller in the red and the blue regions, which are employed in the calculation of the original PSRI. Ranging PSRI2 values, representative for various land cover classes and ecosystems, developing under various environmental and climatic conditions were calculated. The studied land cover classes include broad-leaved, coniferous and mixed forest, transitional woodlands/shrubs, and natural grassland and pastures. Satellite images, acquired in different growing seasons, distinguished with different environmental conditions were used. A comparative analysis between the newly presented index and widely recognized indices for assessment of water content and moisture stress was made. The obtained results could be used in various studies related to monitoring of drought impact and climate change on ecosystems, assessment of ecosystem degradation processes, natural resource management, sustainability and planning.

AB  - Due to depletion of natural resources, climate change and their impact on the land-production systems, farmers are facing more and more challenges related to the practical application of the sustainable development paradigm. These problems result in rapid development of precision agriculture as a management strategy, taking advantage of state-of-the-art technologies. In precision agriculture, Variable Rate Application (VRA) technology is focused on the automated application of materials (such as fertilizers, herbicides, and irrigation water) to a given crop field. It involves different approaches, including sensor-based systems for monitoring and assessment of crop status and field environmental conditions. For operational success of VRA reliable data is needed to indicate the variety of processes taking place in the farm field. In the present research, we present spectral signature data for the status of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) development in different growth stages. Spectral signatures vary depending on environmental conditions and related effects for the agroecosystems such as drought stress, crop diseases, and crop nutrient deficiencies. The generated spectral signature profiles are based on the Sentinel-2 satellite data, acquired in three consecutive growing seasons, distinguished with different ecological conditions. Spectral vegetation indices, indirectly representing the manifestation of biophysical processes and drought stress are calculated for each profile. Field climatic data is used for differentiation of the ecological conditions and validation of the results. The present research supports the creation of spectral library and can be used to create machine learning algorithms for monitoring of winter wheat status and application of variable rate technology.

AB  - The territory of the Baikal Natural Territory (BNT) is quite large and inaccessible in some places. Therefore, remote sensing is the only source of regular data for research of the spatial-temporal land cover dynamics of the BNT. Regular processing and classification of land cover is required to monitor BNT. Satellite image classification is a common method of information extraction related to the structure and changes in land cover. In this work we used Sentinel-2 multispectral images for classifying land cover of the BNT. There are many methods to analyze and classify remote sensing data. The article discusses algorithms for the land cover classification: the vegetation index NDVI, machine learning based on Random Forest algorithm and the convolutional neural network xResNet50. The results of all methods are tested for compliance with the verification dataset for BNT.

TI  - Impact of COVID-19 Lockdown on the Fisheries Sector: A Case Study from Three Harbors in Western India
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The COVID-19 related lockdowns have brought the planet to a standstill. It has severely shrunk the global economy in the year 2020, including India. The blue economy and especially the small-scale fisheries sector in India have dwindled due to disruptions in the fish catch, market, and supply chain. This research presents the applicability of satellite data to monitor the impact of COVID-19 related lockdown on the Indian fisheries sector. Three harbors namely Mangrol, Veraval, and Vankbara situated on the north-western coast of India were selected in this study based on characteristics like harbor's age, administrative control, and availability of cloud-free satellite images. To analyze the impact of COVID in the fisheries sector, we utilized high-resolution PlanetScope data for monitoring and comparison of "area under fishing boats" during the pre-lockdown, lockdown, and post-lockdown phases. A support vector machine (SVM) classification algorithm was used to identify the area under the boats. The classification results were complemented with socio-economic data and ground-level information for understanding the impact of the pandemic on the three sites. During the peak of the lockdown, it was found that the "area under fishing boats" near the docks and those parked on the land area increased by 483%, 189%, and 826% at Mangrol, Veraval, and Vanakbara harbor, respectively. After phase-I of lockdown, the number of parked vessels decreased, yet those already moved out to the land area were not returned until the south-west monsoon was over. A quarter of the annual production is estimated to be lost at the three harbors due to lockdown. Our last observation (September 2020) result shows that regular fishing activity has already been re-established in all three locations. PlanetScope data with daily revisit time has a higher potential to be used in the future and can help policymakers in making informed decisions vis-a-vis the fishing industry during an emergency situation like COVID-19.

TI  - Unravelling the layers of Indian culture and worldview: an exploratory study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDIAN CULTURE AND BUSINESS MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this exploratory study is to explore worldview of budding Indian management professionals. Taking an interpretivist epistemological position, this paper attempt to address the ontological perspective of Indians. Respondents were asked to write their views on 'What is reality according to people around you?' Followed by one 90-minute focus group discussion (FGD) and two in-depth interviews were conducted. Four types of analyses were conducted to minimise researcher bias and touch deeper layer of meaning. Based on Schein's layers of culture, the paper ends by proposing multiple layers in Indian culture namely, basic assumptions, values and artefacts. Paper conjecture 'go with the flow' or samarpan (devotion) as the deep-rooted philosophy or basic assumption that influences Indian values and practices. Typical Indian values: faith in God, paradoxical mindset, family orientation, contextual sensitivity, and tolerance. The physical artefacts: jugaad, adaptability, visit to temples, prayers, fasting, yoga, meditation and tolerance for ambiguity.

AB  - In the present study, we evaluate the potential of multi-incidence L-band and C-band data to retrieve soil moisture. In -situ measurements were acquired during satellite acquisitions over cereal fields in the Kairouan plain in central Tunisia (semi-arid area). Analysing radar data, L-band Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 multi-incidence data (28 degrees, 32.5 degrees and 36 degrees) in HE (L-HH) and HV (L-HV) polarizations and C-band like-polarization Sentinel-1 data, with an incidence angle of approximately 39 degrees, (C-VV) are strongly impacted by soil roughness. In addition, results highlight the sensitivity of L-band data to soil moisture in dense cover class where Normalized Vegetation Difference Index (NDVI) values arc higher than 0.6. Two options of Water Cloud Model (WCM) were used (with and without the integration of soil-vegetation interaction component) to simulate radar signal over cereal fields. Each option of WCM was coupled to the best performance bare soil backscattering models. By inverting WCM, results underline the important contribution of soil-vegetation interaction component to estimate soil moisture with L-HV data compared to a neglected impact on C-band data inversion accuracy and stable accuracy in L-HH.

T2  - TURKISH JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND COMPUTER SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Several remote sensing applications require high-spatial-high-spectral resolution multispectral (MS) images. However, most MS sensors provide low-spatial-high-spectral resolution MS images together with high-spatial-low-spectral resolution panchromatic (PAN) bands. In order to increase the spatial resolution of MS bands to the resolution of PAN images and to obtain high-spatial/spectral resolution MS bands, either MS and PAN images are fused (i.e., pansharpening) or super resolution (SR) is performed using MS bands only. Nevertheless, existing methods do not utilize the available temporal and spatial information together. In this paper, we propose a multiframe SR algorithm using high-spatial/spectral resolution MS images (i.e., pansharpened), taking advantage of both spatial and temporal data, in order to exceed the spatial resolution of the available PAN bands. We first employ a wavelet-based pansharpening method on a set of MS and PAN images captured at different times. Then, we utilize these pansharpened MS bands in a wavelet-based multiframe SR scheme. The proposed method reveals the inter-wavelet-subband relationship of multitemporal images for SR. We demonstrate our results with comparisons on a Landsat 7 ETM+ dataset.

TI  - Mortality in children aged &lt;5 years with severe acute respiratory illness in a high HIV-prevalence urban and rural areas of South Africa, 2009-2013
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) is an important cause of mortality in young children, especially in children living with HIV infection. Disparities in SARI death in children aged Objective To compare the factors associated with in-hospital death among children aged Methods Data were collected from hospitalized children with SARI in one urban and two rural sentinel surveillance hospitals. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were tested for ten respiratory viruses and blood for pneumococcal DNA using polymerase chain reaction. We used multivariable logistic regression to identify patient and clinical characteristics associated with in-hospital death. Results From 2009 through 2013, 5,297 children aged <5 years with SARI-associated hospital admission were enrolled; 3,811 (72%) in the urban and 1,486 (28%) in the rural hospitals. In-hospital case-fatality proportion (CFP) was higher in the rural hospitals (6.9%) than the urban hospital (1.3%, p<0.001), and among HIV-infected than the HIV-uninfected children (9.6% vs. 1.6%, p<0.001). In the urban hospital, HIV infection (odds ratio (OR):11.4, 95% confidence interval (CI):5.4-24.1) and presence of any other underlying illness (OR: 3.0, 95% CI: 1.0-9.2) were the only factors independently associated with death. In the rural hospitals, HIV infection (OR: 4.1, 95% CI: 2.3-7.1) and age <1 year (OR: 3.7, 95% CI: 1.9-7.2) were independently associated with death, whereas duration of hospitalization >= 5 days (OR: 0.5, 95% CI: 0.3-0.8) and any respiratory virus detection (OR: 0.4, 95% CI: 0.3-0.8) were negatively associated with death. Conclusion We found that the case-fatality proportion was substantially higher among children admitted to rural hospitals and HIV infected children with SARI in South Africa. While efforts to prevent and treat HIV infections in children may reduce SARI deaths, further efforts to address health care inequality in rural populations are needed.

TI  - LAND USE/LAND COVER CHANGES ANALYSIS IN SUDANO GUINEAN REGION OF BENIN
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation processes driven by anthropogenic activities lead to the loss of biodiversity and the alteration of ecological systems. In this paper, we examined the land use / land cover change trends from 2000 to 2020 in the Sudano-Guinean region of Benin, and analysed the driving factors of those changes. The adopted method is based on the diachronic analysis of the land cover through the use of remote sensing data specifically, Landsat satellite images of 2000 and 2020. The results showed that natural forest vegetation and Savannah strongly decreased, whereas farmland and the built-up area increased. Indeed, forest land lost 3.22%, 2.01%, and 1.57%, in Bante, Glazou?, and Ou?ss?, respectively. The intensification of human activities was identified as the proximate driver while population growth, a growing demand for agricultural and forest products coupled with improved infrastructure were identified as the underlying drivers of deforestation. To achieve sustainable management goal for forest resources in Benin, the introduction of alternative sources of energy, sustainable farming practices, diversification of income sources, the promotion of community participation, should be implemented.

AB  - Contrastive learning methods have significantly narrowed the gap between supervised and unsupervised learning on computer vision tasks. In this paper, we explore their application to geo-located datasets, e.g. remote sensing, where unlabeled data is often abundant but labeled data is scarce. We first show that due to their different characteristics, a non-trivial gap persists between contrastive and supervised learning on standard benchmarks. To close the gap, we propose novel training methods that exploit the spatio-temporal structure of remote sensing data. We leverage spatially aligned images over time to construct temporal positive pairs in contrastive learning and geo-location to design pre-text tasks. Our experiments show that our proposed method closes the gap between contrastive and supervised learning on image classification, object detection and semantic segmentation for remote sensing. Moreover, we demonstrate that the proposed method can also be applied to geo-tagged ImageNet images, improving downstream performance on various tasks.

TI  - Microglial Turnover in Ageing-Related Neurodegeneration: Therapeutic Avenue to Intervene in Disease Progression
T2  - CELLS
M3  - Review
AB  - Microglia are brain-dwelling macrophages and major parts of the neuroimmune system that broadly contribute to brain development, homeostasis, ageing and injury repair in the central nervous system (CNS). Apart from other brain macrophages, they have the ability to constantly sense changes in the brain's microenvironment, functioning as housekeepers for neuronal well-being and providing neuroprotection in normal physiology. Microglia use a set of genes for these functions that involve proinflammatory cytokines. In response to specific stimuli, they release these proinflammatory cytokines, which can damage and kill neurons via neuroinflammation. However, alterations in microglial functioning are a common pathophysiology in age-related neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's and prion diseases, as well as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. When their sentinel or housekeeping functions are severely disrupted, they aggravate neuropathological conditions by overstimulating their defensive function and through neuroinflammation. Several pathways are involved in microglial functioning, including the Trem2, Cx3cr1 and progranulin pathways, which keep the microglial inflammatory response under control and promote clearance of injurious stimuli. Over time, an imbalance in this system leads to protective microglia becoming detrimental, initiating or exacerbating neurodegeneration. Correcting such imbalances might be a potential mode of therapeutic intervention in neurodegenerative diseases.

TI  - Integrated Geophysical and Geological Methods to Identify Structure Existence as a Permeable Zone in a Geothermal Field
T2  - 9TH NATIONAL PHYSICS SEMINAR 2020
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 9th National Physics Seminar
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - At the development stage of a geothermal field, a comprehensive survey is needed to obtain an accurate picture of the geothermal system to identify the subsurface condition on the prospect field. The geological structure is one of the important aspects of geothermal exploration. It creates permeability, which allows geothermal fluids to flow to the surface. Locating geological structures in the prospect area will be a powerful tool to determine the drilling target for exploration or production wells. One of the methods to identify geological structure on the surface is using satellite imagery. It is based on visual interpretation of the morpho-structural aspect combined with the lithological aspect and then confirmed with field data. The remote sensing data is built from DEMNAS data and a regional geological map. DEMNAS has spatial resolution 0,27-arcsecond, vertical datum EGM2008. While the subsurface geological structure can be identified by using the Gravity Second Vertical Derivative (SVD) and First Horizontal Derivative (FHD) method. Gravity method identifies structure by slicing the SVD grid, which has suspected structure and then confirmed with FHD slicing in the same suspected area. The geological structure will be confirmed if the value of FHD maximum and SVD value 0. The results of the data processing above are then integrated to obtain the distribution of geological structures as a permeable zone in the geothermal field which then can be used as a guide in determining the location of exploration and production wells.

AB  - Through the Internet of Things (IoT) increasingly growing, questions concerning the security of IoT gadgets have become evident. A couple of sellers build IP-associated gadgets for residence and little office arrangements that frequently experience the ill effects of inadequate security plans and executions. They additionally tend to need instruments for firmware informs or fixes that be able to help security of dispose the vulnerabilities. Making sure about systems where the proximity of these helpless gadgets is known requires a brown field advance: applying fundamental security measures inside the system with the intention of potentially powerlessness. Gadgets should live together in the same device without jeopardizing the protection of the various gadgets. Now, IOT SENTINEL is a platform able of separating the category of gadgets associated with an IoT. To allow laws to force the correspondence of helpless gadgets in order to minimize the harm caused by their off trade. It is appear that IOT SENTINEL is feasible in recognize gadget forms and has marginal transparency execution.

TI  - Impacts of agrarian reform on land use in the biomes of the Midwest region of Brazil between 2004 and 2014
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil's Midwest is composed of four biomes: the Cerrado, predominant in the region; the Pantanal, the largest wetland in the world; the Amazon, which occupies part of Mato Grosso; and the Atlantic Forest. The objective of this study was to identify the evolution of occupation and use of land in the rural settlements of the Brazilian Midwest depending on the biome of location. A total of 54 settlements distributed in the four biomes of the region were analyzed using direct observation and Landsat images from the years 2004 and 2014. Using the software QGIS 2.8 Wien, the vegetation indices NDVI and NDWI were used to classify agricultural, pasture and forest areas by biome. Native vegetation is declining in most of the analyzed settlements and pastures, for milk production, occupied the largest area. Between 2004 and 2014, pasture areas expanded to the detriment of forests. Although they have the highest percentage of environmental preservation areas, the settlements we analyzed in the Amazon biome do not comply with legislation. Part of the forest in these settlements was transformed into areas of bushy cerrado. However, there was an increase in forests in the settlements of the Atlantic Forest biome.

TI  - Mapping Landform and Landslide Susceptibility Using Remote Sensing, GIS and Field Observation in the Southern Cross Road, Malang Regency, East Java, Indonesia
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - There has been an increasing trend of land area being brought under human's use over time. This situation has led the community to carry out land-use development activities in landslide hazard-prone areas. The use of land can have a positive impact by increasing economic conditions, but it can have negative impacts on the environment. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the landslide hazard, focusing on the development of a landform map to reduce the risk of landslide disaster in JLS, Malang Regency. The integration of remote sensing and geographic information systems, as well as field observation, were used to create a landform map and a landslide susceptibility map. Using the geomorphological approach as a basic concept in landform mapping, the morphology, morphogenesis, and morphoarrangement conditions were obtained from the remote sensing data, GIS, and field observation, while morphochronological information was obtained from a geological map. The landslide susceptibility map was prepared using 11 landslide conditioning factors by employing the index of entropy method. Thirty-nine landform units were successfully mapped into four landslide susceptibility classes. The results showed that the study area is dominated by a high level of landslide susceptibility with a majority of moderate to strongly eroded hill morphology. It also reaffirms that landform mapping is a reliable method by which to investigate landslide susceptibility in JLS, Malang Regency.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node (SLN) isolated tumor cells (ITCs) in otherwise stage I/II endometrioid endometrial cancer: To treat or not to treat?
T2  - Gynecologic oncology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess associations between treatment and recurrence-free survival (RFS) among patients with isolated tumor cells (ITCs) in sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) and otherwise stage I/II endometrioid endometrial cancer (EC).METHODS: A multi-institutional retrospective study of patients with SLN ITCs (<200 cells and<0.2mm) was performed. Only patients with otherwise stage I/II EC, endometrioid histology, and no evidence of micro-or macrometastases were included. Univariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate associations between treatment, tumor characteristics, and RFS.RESULTS: 175 patients were included. Median follow up time was 31months. 39% stage IB and 12% stage II disease. 76 (43%) received no adjuvant therapy or vaginal brachytherapy only (NAT/VBT), 21 (12%) had external beam radiation (EBRT), and 78 (45%) received chemotherapy +/- radiation. Patients who received chemotherapy more often had tumors with deep myoinvasion, lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI), and higher grade. Nine (5.1%) patients recurred; 5 distant, 3 retroperitoneal, and 1 vaginal. Extra-vaginal recurrences were similar in patients with or without chemotherapy (5.2% vs 3.8%, p=0.68). After controlling for stage, LVSI and grade, chemotherapy and EBRT were not associated with RFS (HR=0.63, 95%CI 0.11-3.52, and HR=0.90, 95%CI 0.22-3.61, respectively). Type of lymph node dissection and ITC detection method were not associated with RFS.CONCLUSIONS: Risk of retroperitoneal and/or distant recurrence is low (4.6%) for patients with stage I/II endometrioid EC and ITCs in SLNs regardless of treatment. Our preliminary data suggests that adjuvant therapy may not be significantly associated with RFS. However, longer follow-up time and a larger sample size are needed before definitive recommendations regarding adjuvant therapy for patients with EC and only ITCs in SLN can be made.

AB  - In video highlight detection, the goal is to identify the interesting moments within an unedited video. Although the audio component of the video provides important cues for highlight detection, the majority of existing efforts focus almost exclusively on the visual component. In this paper, we argue that both audio and visual components of a video should be modeled jointly to retrieve its best moments. To this end, we propose an audio-visual network for video highlight detection. At the core of our approach lies a bimodal attention mechanism, which captures the interaction between the audio and visual components of a video, and produces fused representations to facilitate highlight detection. Furthermore, we introduce a noise sentinel technique to adaptively discount a noisy visual or audio modality. Empirical evaluations on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our approach over the state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - Understanding dust sources through remote sensing: Making a case for CubeSats
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Dust sources have been revealed through remote sensing, first regionally by similar to 1 degrees resolution sensors (TOMS), then at sub-basin scale by moderate-resolution sensors (MODIS). Sensors with higher spatial resolution until recently were poorly temporally-resolved, precluding their use for systematic investigations of sources. Now, "CubeSat" constellations with high-temporal-and-spatial-resolution sensors such as PlanetScope offer similar to 3 m resolution and daily (to sub-daily) temporal resolution. We illustrate the spatio-temporal dust plume observation capabilities of CubeSat data through a dust event case study, Bolson de los Muertos playa, Chihuahuan Desert, Mexico. For the event, PlanetScope showed numerous discrete point sources, revealing variability of surface erodibility and emission over similar to 8% of a focus area at time of capture. The unprecedented detail of PlanetScope imagery revealed plume development where outer-playa sands and fluvial-deltaic inputs contact lacustrine silts/clays, consistent with field-studies. PlanetScope's high fidelity improves spatial quantification and temporal constraint of source activity, and we assess the spatio-temporal capabilities of CubeSat in context with other dust observation remote sensing systems. Compared to previous satellite technologies, CubeSats bring better potential to link remote sensing to field observations of emission. This leap forward in the remote sensing of dust sources calls for the systematic analysis of CubeSat imagery in source areas.

AB  - Rock glaciers (RG) are one of the most important geomorphological features in the Peruvian Andes. However, the local characteristics of RG have barely been studied or remain unknown. The aim of this research was to characterize past and present conditions of the RG located in Cordillera Volcanica in the southern of Peru. For this purpose, an inventory of RG was carried out and modern and past regional mean air annual temperatures (MAATs) were calculated. We estimate the water equivalent of RG to assess their importance as possible storage of frozen water for past and present conditions using an empirical rule. In addition, the local surface velocity of RG was obtained from Landsat 8 imagery. Within the study area, 187 RG were identified (surface area of 8.3 km(2)). Of these, 63 were classified as inactive, 39 as active and 85 as relict forms. The altitudinal distribution of RG ranges between 4616 to 5551 m a.s.l. (meter above sea level) where modern MAAT is 0.9 degrees C. In the current conditions, relict RG are located in positive MAAT levels around 1.4 degrees C, however, for the past conditions, relict RG were located in negative MAAT levels around -5 degrees C. The amount of water stored in intact RG range between 28 and 64 million m3. Meanwhile, for past conditions (paleo-WVE), we estimated that volume stored within rock relict RG was between 16 and 35 million m3 (we assume an ice-rich layer of RG permafrost has between 20-45%). On the other hand, the average surface velocities of the active RG have been estimated between 1 to 10 cm/month. The finding of this research contributes to increasing knowledge about RG in the Peruvian Andes, however, further research is needed to understand the importance of RG as stores of frozen water during the past and present conditions.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study addresses, on the basis of ethnographic, folkloric, linguistic, and field data, the role of cattle in Buryat myths and rites, with reference to their economic significance. Buryat words relating to the exteriors of animals, sex differences, etc. are listed The bull image features in traditional Buryat systems of time calculation and in the tradition olgiving protective names homonymical to words denoting the bull are described Mythological beliefs concerning the cattle are analyzed. The Bulagats, a major Buryat subgroup, practiced the tribal cult ofBukha-noyon, to whom the bull alluded. This practice was connected with the idea of shape-shilling, whereby the bull symbolized the male principle. In terms of cosmogony, the bull was part of habitation spheres such as sky, earth, and water, and their elements such as celestial bodies and mountains, and fire. The positive attitude to the bull and the cow was mirrored by views regarding supernatural properties ofbull hair and urine, cow's milk and placenta, and devices used for managing draft bulls (the yoke and the hair rope zele). At the same time, the cattle were associated with the Lower World and its inhabitants; they functioned as mediators and could symbolize death. A detailed description of the bull image in traditional Buryat ritualism is provided.

M3  - Article
AB  - In modern times, the spiritual heritage of the peoples of Russia, including their traditional picture of the world, is an object of public and scientific interest. In this context, it is important to reconstruct popular views about the animal world. The purpose of the work is to identify the meaning of the wolf in the mythological judgments of the Buryats and the inclusion of this wild animal in their rituals. Various ethnographic, folklore, and linguistic materials were used as sources for the research. The paper uses the structural-semiotic method as the main one.The analysis shows that the Buryats have formed an ambiguous image of the wolf, characterized by ambivalent connotations. The special role of color symbolism is revealed in the ideas about this animal. The wolf had a heavenly (white wolf) and male symbolism. A positive connotation was also expressed in the recognition of the apotropaic function of his skin. The sacredness of his image is indicated by the custom observed by hunters of removing the skin from the killed predator with the head and some internal organs.The negative characteristic of the wolf was associated with the fact that this beast was perceived as a mediator between worlds. He was identified with trouble. It was believed that it has a demonic nature, serves as a transport for evil spirits. The chthonic origin of the predator was indicated by its relationship with the raven.The wolf also carried the symbolism of aggression and was associated with a military cult. In this context, we should consider its association with weapons and the idea of werewolves.It was found out that in the shamanic rites of the Buryats, the wolf had a sacred status, which was manifested in the poetry and attributes of the shaman (in ritual clothing, in the use of a wolf fetish).It is determined that the Buryat folk beliefs about the wolf find parallels in the traditional worldview of other peoples, which indicates universal and typological phenomena in the Buryat mythological fauna.

TI  - The Spiritual Essence of Man and the World in the Philosophy of Vladimir Hoppe
T2  - FILOSOFICKY CASOPIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Hoppe identifies his era as a period of profound spiritual crisis that stems from Comte's positivism, materialism and technical worldview. Man thus understands himself purely as an object, fully renouncing any spiritual dimension. Hoppe argues that science offers nothing but an illusion of knowledge, since true knowledge is of metaphysical nature - to know truly means first of all to know one's spiritual essence. Hoppe's philosophical ideas fuse with his religious concepts and, towards the end of his philosophical endeavours, he turns more and more towards Soren Kierkegaard. Hoppe attempts to overcome the unbridgeable abyss between religion and science, object and subject, the knowable and unknowable using Kierkegaard's leap of faith. Hoppe's thematisation of man's abilities and fate results in a turn to Christianity, much inspired by Kierkegaard, with a specific formulation of the utmost goal - god-manhood.

TI  - Effects of 6,8-Diprenylgenistein on VEGF-A-Induced Lymphangiogenesis and Lymph Node Metastasis in an Oral Cancer Sentinel Lymph Node Animal Model
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The major determining factor of prognosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma is cervical lymph node metastasis. 6,8-Diprenylgenistein (6,8-DG), an isoflavonoid isolated from Cudrania tricuspidata has been reported to have anti-microbial and anti-obesity activities. However, its effects on lymphangiogenesis and lymph node metastasis in oral cancer have not yet been reported. Methods: To investigate the in vitro inhibitory effects of 6,8-DG on VEGF-A-induced lymphangiogenesis, we performed the proliferation, tube formation, and migration assay using human lymphatic microvascular endothelial cells (HLMECs). RT-PCR, Western blot, immunoprecipitation, ELISA and co-immunoprecipitation assays were used to investigate the expression levels of proteins, and mechanism of 6,8-DG. The in vivo inhibitory effects of 6,8-DG were investigated using an oral cancer sentinel lymph node (OCSLN) animal model. Results: 6,8-DG inhibited the proliferation, migration and tube formation of rhVEGF-A treated HLMECs. In addition, the in vivo lymphatic vessel formation stimulated by rhVEGF-A was significantly reduced by 6,8-DG. 6,8-DG inhibited the expression of VEGF-A rather than other lymphangiogenic factors in CoCl2-treated SCCVII cells. 6,8-DG inhibited the expression and activation of VEGFR-2 stimulated by rhVEGF-A in HLMECs. Also, 6,8-DG inhibited the activation of the lymphangiogenesis-related downstream signaling factors such as FAK, PI3K, AKT, p38, and ERK in rhVEGF-A-treated HLMECs. Additionally, 6,8-DG inhibited the expression of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1 alpha), which is involved in the expression of VEGF-A in CoCl2-treated SCCVII cells, and 6,8-DG inhibited VEGF-A signaling via interruption of the binding of VEGF-A and VEGFR-2 in HLMECs. In the VEGF-A-induced OCSLN animal model, we confirmed that 6,8-DG suppressed tumor-induced lymphangiogenesis and SLN metastasis. Conclusion: These data suggest that 6,8-DG inhibits VEGF-A-induced lymphangiogenesis and lymph node metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of 6,8-DG are probably mediated by inhibition of VEGF-A expression in cancer cells and suppression of the VEGF-A/VEGFR-2 signaling pathway in HLMEC. Thus, 6,8-DG could be novel and valuable therapeutic agents for metastasis prevention and treatment of oral cancer.

T2  - PROBLEMY ISTORICHESKOI POETIKI
M3  - Article
AB  - The article attempts to analyze the semantic structure of the "God's fool" concept in the essay Pepiniere by I. A. Goncharov. As a term, this concept is interpreted from the point of view of culturology. The essay reveals the basic structural components of the "God's fool" concept, as well as its core and additional semantic features. The author of the article believes that the religious component is embodied in the structure of the concept one way or another, but is not reflected directly in the word usage. The "God's fool" lexeme mainly comprises various secular meanings that are expressed via metaphors, repetitions and comparisons. The specific nature of the "God's fool" concept in I. A. Goncharov's Pepiniere is revealed in its periphery, which is formed by certain artistic techniques and categories (intertextual exchanges, comic elements). For instance, the function of the quote of Friday's nomination from Daniel Defoe's The Life and Strange Surprising Adventures of Robinson Crusoe; Written by Himself, as well as the comparative quote from Boris Godunov by A. S. Pushkin are considered in this article. Furthermore, quoting is an artistic technique that creates the game motive, to which I. A. Goncharov resorts indirectly. The gaming component not only creates and emphasizes the comical element, but also serves as one of the writer's artistic principles that contributes to the creation of the harmonious, negentropic worldview. The study of I. A. Goncharov's sphere of concepts allows to identify not so much the variability of the writer's worldview as its invariability.

T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatially explicit estimates of aboveground biomass over large area are necessary for natural resources managers. This study examined aboveground biomass and carbon stock of the wild pistachio (Pistacia atlantica) based on individual tree crown detection and allometric development in the arid woodlands using high-resolution satellite images of GeoEye-1 in a reserved forest area of Wild Pistachio trees in the South Khorasan Province, East of Iran. Biomass of sampled trees was determined using field sampling and experimental tests. In addition, the biomass of stems was determined using volume and density. The allometric biomass and carbon stock equations of Wild Pistachio trees were developed based on crown area, diameter at breast height (1.3 m), and height of trees. The trees crowns were detected and delineated on the GeoEye-1 images, using local maxima filters, and region growing segmentation algorithms, respectively. In addition, a morphological watershed transformation method was applied to split the connected and overlapped tree crowns. Performing algorithms was assessed using the measured field crown of sample trees by precision, recall, and overall accuracy indices. The biomass and carbon stock of trees of the study area were estimated using delineated crown area and the developed allometric equations. The results showed that the equation that used crown area could explain more than 80% of the remarked variation in biomass and carbon stock. In addition, the crown detection method results showed that overall detection rate and the quality of crown boundaries were acceptable. In conclusion, the study confirmed that combining the allometric equations with crown information from high-resolution images could contribute to the explicit mapping of biomass and carbon stock of wild pistachio trees in the arid woodlands.

AB  - The infrared focal plane assemblies (FPA) are usually integrated in ambient temperature, and operate in 80K similar to 40K. Mechanical cryocoolers are typically used to provide the cryogenic temperature. The mechanical designs of FPA have to take a variety of constraints into consideration, such as thermal stresses, temperature uniformity of detectors, vibration from cold fingers, stray light of dewar (optical stops), flatness of the detector arrays, thermal insulation, severe vibrations during launch and optical alignment stability. For large format focal plane assemblies, the stress and deformation caused by thermal mismatch of HgCdTe detector chip, silicon readout integrated circuit (ROIC) and mounting structures become worse. This paper presents an innovative thermo-mechanical designed for Visual and Infrared Multispectral Imager (VIMI) onboard GaoFen-5 satellite. It proposed a symmetrical sandwich configuration to ensure the flatness of detector arrays, and a flexure adaptor plate module made of molybdenum-copper to mitigate thermal stress of detectors and Low Temperature Co-fired Ceramic (LTCC). Finally, a series of mechanical and thermal tests were conducted to verify the reliability of the thermo-mechanical design of FPA.

AB  - As an emerging detection technology, the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Radio Occultation (RO) technique can provide ionospheric observable profiles. China launched the FengYun 3C satellite (FY-3C) in 2013, which carried the GNSS Occultation Sounder (GNOS), the first RO sounder capable of simultaneously receiving the Global Positioning System (GPS) and the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) signals globally. In the evaluation of the GNOS ionospheric products, the correlation coefficient and standard deviation of F2-layer maximum electron density (NmF2) between GNOS and COSMIC are 0.95 and 17.48%, respectively. The bias of maximum ionospheric scintillation index (S4max) between FY3C-GNOS and Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) is 0.004. In addition, the ionospheric products of GNOS have also been taken into preliminary scientific applications in space weather monitoring, IRI model validation, climatology research, and study of ionospheric sporadic E layer. With the successive network observations of subsequent satellites in the FY3 series, it is bound to bring the massive RO data into more significant scientific values.

TI  - Global Comparison of F2-Layer Peak Parameters Estimated by IRI-2016 With Ionospheric Radio Occultation Data During Solar Minimum
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The F2-layer peak parameters of the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI) model are critical to its subsequent applications because of the vital role of the peak parameters in determining other IRI model outputs. Therefore, we analyzed the statistical deviation and ionospheric climatology of NmF2/hmF2 between the most current version of the IRI model, namely IRI-2016, and ionospheric radio occultation (IRO) data, including Constellation Observing System for Meteorology Ionosphere and Climate (COSMIC) and FengYun-3C (FY3C), during the recent solar minimum in 2017-2019. The International Union of Radio Science (URSI) model for F2-layer peak electron density (NmF2) and the Bilitza-Sheikh-Eyfrig (BSE), Altadill-Magdaleno-Torta-Blanch (AMTB), and SHUbin (SHU) models for maximum ionization height (hmF2) in IRI-2016 are compared with the IRO dataset. A statistical analysis shows a systematic offset of less than 10% in NmF2 between IRI-2016 URSI and IRO data, and the SHU option for hmF2 shows a better fit to IRO data than BSE and AMTB. A climatology comparison shows that NmF2 estimated by IRI-2016 URSI is consistent with that of the IRO dataset in terms of the general trend in the typical ionospheric characteristics; except for some discrepancies in the marine area, the IRO data may provide a feasible reference for IRI estimation in marine regions. The hmF2 options of BSE/AMTB/SHU show hemispheric asymmetry like the IRO dataset. Moreover, hmF2 of BSE/AMTB and IRO/SHU show some discrepancies in fine structures, such as the day-night reversal phenomenon.

TI  - Effectiveness of upscaling the vegetation temperature condition index retrieved from Landsat data using an algorithm combining the trend surface analysis and the spatial variation weight method
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Taking the Guanzhong Plain of China as the research area, a method combining the trend surface analysis (TSA) method and the spatial variation weight method (SVWM) was used to upscale the vegetation temperature condition index (VTCI) retrieved from Landsat 8 from a finer spatial resolution to a coarser. The upscaled results were compared with VTCIs retrieved from Aqua MODIS to provide technical support for the comprehensive application of drought monitoring results on two spatial scales. Meanwhile, the upscaled methods were systematically evaluated in a case study according to various indicators, including the spatial distribution characteristics for drought, the statistical characteristics, the semivariogram function (SVF), the structural similarity (SSIM), the correlation coefficient (r), and the root mean square error (RMSE). The results show that the dominant class variability weighted (DCVW) method performed better than did the arithmetic average variability weighted (AAVW) and median pixel variability weighted (MPVW) methods in terms of the statistical characteristics, SSIM, correlation and RMSE, and the upscaling model based on the union of TSA and DCVW had the highest accuracy. The DCVW is a promising tool for upscaling Landsat-VTCI images of the Guanzhong Plain from finer to coarser spatial resolutions because of its efficiency and flexibility.

TI  - Using a Discrete Scattering Model to Constrain Water Cloud Model for Simulating Ground-Based Scatterometer Measurements and Retrieving Soil Moisture
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Potential of constraining semiempirical model with physically based scatter model simulations has long been recognized. This study contributes to this topic through the assessment of backscattering coefficient (sigma(o)) simulations and soil moisture retrieval using the water cloud model (WCM) constrained by a discrete scattering model (i.e., Tor Vergata) under both frozen and thawed soil conditions. The WCM is coupled with Oh (hereafter "WCM+Oh") and Dubois (WCM+Dubois) surface scattering models, respectively. The soil permittivity is obtained using the four-phase dielectric mixing model. One year of C-band copolarized sigma(o) observations are collected by a ground-based scatterometer deployed in the seasonally frozen Tibetan meadow ecosystem. It is found that: the calibrated Tor Vergata (hereafter "TVG") model simulates well the seasonal dynamics and magnitudes of scatterometer measurements, and the simulated scattering components and vegetation transmissivity agree well with the seasonal vegetation dynamics; the total scattering simulated by the TVG constrained WCMs shows a good consistency with the scatterometer measurements, and the simulated soil and vegetation scattering components are in line with the TVG simulations; and the retrieved soil moisture based on the constrained WCMs captures well the seasonal variability noted in the in situ measurements. An additional experiment is performed to calibrate the WCMs directly, and the results show that the calibrated WCMs achieve comparable results with the calibrated TVG model and the constrained WCMs in terms of the total sigma(o) and soil moisture retrieved. However, the direct calibration of the WCMs leads to unrealistic characterization of individual soil and vegetation scattering contributions, of which an underestimation of the vegetation contribution at VV polarization is most notable. These findings demonstrate that usage of a physically based scatter model to constrain semiempirical models leads to results that provide a more robust representation of reality, which is needed for developing worldwide soil moisture monitoring from active microwave remote sensing.

AB  - Large observational surveys of space telescopes in the infra-red and submillimeter ranges revealed intriguing structure of the interstellar medium which implied a boost in the development of filament detection algorithms. Thousands of filaments can be detected in astronomical data sets and detailed studies turn to be challenging. We propose a method that aims at building individual maps fully containing at least one coherent filament, out of larger maps. The method is based on the image processing techniques such as the Rolling Hough Transform, the image component labeling, and the center of mass technique. We apply our method to the Planck satellite data and show that known nearby molecular clouds are well identified with our method.

TI  - Comparing Evapotranspiration Products of Different Temporal and Spatial Scales in Native and Managed Prairie Pastures
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Grasslands in the Southern Great Plains of the United States have major ecological and economic importance, with strong climate and water cycle connections. The historic native prairie grassland has been managed differently for enhancing productivity, while consequently altering water vapor fluxes. However, little is known about the impacts of different management activities on evapotranspiration (ET) at different spatio-temporal scales. In this study, we quantified and compared ET between co-located introduced managed pasture (MP) and native prairie (NP) pasture. Additionally, we compared the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived ET at four different spatial scales: 30 m (ETMOD30), 200 m (ETMOD200), 500 m (ETMOD500), and 1000 m (ETMOD1000) with eddy covariance-measured ET (ETEC). Large differences in ETEC were observed between two pastures from half-hourly to seasonal scales, with variations mainly controlled by the amount of rainfall and management activities. The results demonstrated differential responses of MP and NP in a pluvial year. The ETMOD30 showed a better agreement with ETEC than did the ETMOD200, ETMOD500, and ETMOD1000. The ETMOD200, ETMOD500, and ETMOD1000 largely underestimated ETEC, most likely due to their inability to capture the spatial heterogeneity of vegetation growth impacted by various management activities. Our results facilitate understanding of the difference in ET of MP and NP due to differences in vegetation resulting from different management activities and their differential responses to precipitation.

M3  - research-article
AB  - 2020 Space Wonder Kiddy appeared in a period during which TV animation production was beginning to be elevated in earnest, in the late 1980s. The Korean animation industry in the 1980s, while growing based on subcontracted animation productions rather than self productions, had failed to produce good works, contrastingly to its remarkable technological level. Although the government actively encouraged effective subcontracting businesses for foreign exchange earnings, it subsequently enforced self productions rather than subcontracts when the time came to host the 1988 Olympics, a massive national event. Commencing in such a manner, the production of TV animation often dealt with sports animations by considering the 1988 Olympics or animations based on popular original cartoon series. 2020 Space Wonder Kiddy was produced during this time, however, its characteristics differed from other animations. As opposed to a work based on an original cartoon, 2020 Space Wonder Kiddy was newly created from the scenario stage. It was the first sci-fi animation produced, breaking away from a repetitive episodic composition. Furthermore, the work featured cyborgs as both posthumans and villains in a background based on a dystopian worldview and thus, attempted to define human beings. While it certainly failed to reach a sufficient level of philosophical contemplation due to the limitations of the era and the depth of the work, it is, nevertheless, significant in that it was a new attempt in Korean animation which broke away from a simple conflict between good and evil. Although machines and human beings are defined differently depending on the presence of an apparent “conscience,” they are distinguished through an attitude of affirming or rejecting familism by means of family relationships according to a deeper level of meaning. Setting characters through a dichotomy of humans that affirm and try to recover their roots and machines that reject and try to destroy those roots engenders a conflict between good and evil, thus confirming a means of understanding humans in an animation by a Korean society based on patriarchal family centrism. 2020 Space Wonder Kiddy is a unique work in Korean TV animation, but the fact that it consists of a simple structure involving the already-completed protagonist achieving his goal by rescuing his father inevitably reveals its limitations as a TV series. Although the narrative of the animation progresses, the characters in the work do not grow.It would be difficult for viewers to empathize with a boy who has already perfected his abilities, as opposed to an incomplete being who grows by overcoming his limitations. Thus, viewers also have difficulty taking interest in the story that follows. Unlike other works, 2020 Space Wonder Kiddy failed to produce a new series after achieving success, not only due to the absence of an original serial or the failure to consider future works at the planning stage, but also as a result of its narrative limitations.

TI  - Social Aspects of Diagnosis and Treatment of Non-palpable Breast Lesions. Important Factor affecting Quality of Life in Cancer Patients undergoing Surgery
T2  - CLINICAL SOCIAL WORK AND HEALTH INTERVENTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The social aspect of breast cancer presents a serious problem all the time. Quality of women's life after surgery must be compared to life before it. Breast cancer treatments today are likely to cause less physical deformity from surgery than two decades ago but are more complex and extend over a longer period of time. Non-palpable breast lesions are findings with non-biologically specified importance, which can be responsible for development of cancer. The authors present the diagnosis and the results of the treatment of patients with non-palpable breast lesions. They were hospitalized at the Department of Surgery in Nitra from January 2014 until July 2017 and we used the SNOLL method or wire guided excision under ultrasound control or digital stereotaxic.Results: From January 2014 until July 2017 there were 122 patients diagnosed with non-palpable breast lesions at the Department of Surgery at our hospital. 76 (62.3%) of these patients were diagnosed with carcinoma. Wire Guided Localization was performed in 99 (81.1%) patients; sentinel node was found in 41 (33.6%) patients using the SNOLL method. From all the patients a reoperation was conducted in 4 cases (3.3%) for close or positive margin status and in 3 cases (2.5%) for false negative perioperative sentinel biopsy.Conclusion: The technique combining 99mTc-MAA (albuminmacro aggregate marked by 99Technecium) and nanocoloid is a reliable localization method for non-palpable lesions and sentinel nodes. SNOLL is a practical and oncological safe technique of excision of a subclinical lesion in combination with sentinel biopsy. This technique brings new visions for the future, especially for quality of life after surgery, changes in body image and sexuality.

TI  - Towards a better understanding of people's underlying ecological worldviews in New Zealand
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - As a way of mitigating adverse environmental effects, sustainable construction practices require the cooperation of all stakeholders. Assessing people's underlying ecological worldviews could be a first step in changing behaviours towards more sustainable approaches. Affecting behavioural change requires a better understanding of people's beliefs and values as drivers in decision-making processes. The New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) scale is a method for measuring people's ecological worldviews, and those who demonstrate a pro-ecological score on it will also tend to support environmental actions. This can, in turn, lead to increased uptake of environmentally conscious building construction practices. This paper reports on the findings of research aimed at understanding the levels of support New Zealanders hold for the environment. The study consulted 662 residents in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch, most of whom were building industry stakeholders, using an international 6-item NEP rating scale. Each of these three cities faces distinct environmental challenges in the near future, yet the results suggest that their residents have relatively consistent pro-ecological attitudes. The results also revealed that these respondents have more positive outlooks when compared with other similar studies. However, when comparing the sample according to demographic characteristics such as education level, occupation and whether or not they owned a home, significant differences emerged.

AB  - Remote Sensing plays a critical role in forest tree species identification. Regarding the current debate on earth observation and monitoring, many see this valuable technology useful for a wide range of purposes, including forest conservation and management. This paper focuses on a workflow for mapping forest tree species from satellite images, by statistic algorithms and machine learning. Among the world satellite platforms, the Sentinel-2 program was selected to investigate the mixed forest area of Monte Sant'Angelo in Central Italy. A list of monthly images from 2018 to 2020 have been processed using the Google Earth Engine geospatial processing service. The process includes the computation of vegetation indexes like the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Transformed Difference Vegetation Index (TDVI), the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and the Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI). A forest class time series was generated for each index. The Artificial Intelligence algorithm models (Machine Learning) were trained identifying accurate ground truths. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed to reduce variables redundancy in Random Forest classifications. Four forest categories have been identified: holm oak woodlands, conifer reforestation, Ostryo Carpinion alliance and mixed hardwood forest. Due to the phenological differences among species, the classification global accuracy ranges from 70% to 80%.

TI  - SAR data for tropical forest disturbance alerts in French Guiana: Benefit over optical imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - French Guiana forests cover 8 million hectares. With 98% of emerged land covered by forests, French Guiana is the area with the highest proportion of forest cover in the world. These forests are home to an exceptionally rich and diverse wealth of biodiversity that is both vulnerable and under threat due to high levels of pressure from human activity. As part of the French territory, French Guiana benefits from determined and continuous national efforts in the preservation of biodiversity and the environmental functionalities of ecosystems. The loss and fragmentation of forest cover caused by gold mining (legal and illegal), smallholder agriculture and forest exploitation, are considered as small-scale disturbances, although representing strong effects to vulnerable natural habitats, landscapes, and local populations. To monitor forest management programs and combat illegal deforestation and forest opening near-real time alerts system based on remote sensing data are required. For this large territory under frequent cloud cover, Synthetic-Aperture Radar (SAR) data appear to be the best adapted. In this paper, a method for forest alerts in a near-real time context based on Sentinel-1 data over the whole of French Guiana (83,534 km2) was developed and evaluated. The assessment was conducted for 2 years between 2016 and 2018 and includes comparisons with reference data provided by French Guiana forest organizations and comparisons with the existing University of Maryland Global Land Analysis and Discovery Forest Alerts datasets based on Landsat data. The reference datasets include 1,867 plots covering 2,124.5 ha of gold mining, smallholder agriculture and forest exploitation. The validation results showed high user accuracies (96.2%) and producer accuracies (81.5%) for forest loss detection, with the latter much higher than for optical forest alerts (36.4%). The forest alerts maps were also compared in terms of detection timing, showing systematic temporal delays of up to one year in the optical method compared to the SAR method. These results highlight the benefits of SAR over optical imagery for forest alerts detection in French Guiana. Finally, the potential of the SAR method applied to tropical forests is discussed. The SAR-based map of this study is available on http://cesbiomass.net/.

TI  - Methodology for estimating economic losses of corn crops damaged by floods using remote sensing
T2  - REVISTA DE GEOGRAFIA NORTE GRANDE
M3  - Article
AB  - The flooded areas of corn cultivation were determined by means of satellite images in order to know the economic losses due to floods. As a case study, a flood that occurred in 2016 that affected 4 municipalities in the State of Tabasco, Mexico, was analyzed. The methodology included the use of Landsat satellite images (L8), calculation of spectral indices (water, vegetation and humidity), identification of corn growing areas through supervised classification and the estimation of economic losses. The results show that the spectral indices that best managed to identify the flooded areas were: MNDWI and NDWI. To report damages, values in USD (US dollars) were standardized in 2016 prices using exchange rates adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP). For the case study, the results of damages per hectare were established between 728.57 USD / ha in PPP and 317.25 USD / ha in PPP, which agree with the estimates made in other countries for corn crops.

AB  - Introduction: Indigenous mothers have deep-rooted cultural practices to care for the newborn, therefore it is necessary for the staff to know them to promote interculturality in health. Objective: understand the rituals to care for the newborn according to the worldview of a Nahua community. Method: Qualitative ethnographic research. Fourteen mothers from the Nahua communities of the south of the Huasteca Potosina participated. Sample determined by the saturation and redundancy technique and convenience sampling. To collect the data, participant observation and the ethnographic interview prepared by the researchers and validated by expert judgment were used. Results: Rites and beliefs when the newborn's umbilical cord falls; customs to heal the newborn from pushing; "good vibes" ritual to cleanse and protect the newborn and her mother from evil. Conclusions: In the Nahua culture, when the newborn umbilical stump falls, they bury it under a banana plant. For the "push", a pregnant woman makes a cross with her own saliva on the baby's forehead. After 7 days of the birth, they bury a chicken heart in their home as an offering to protect the newborn, the midwife does the "cleaning" for the family and they eat a "patlache" (special tamale), rituals transmitted by grandmothers and midwives.

TI  - Identification and characterization the sources of aerosols over Jharkhand state and surrounding areas, India using AHP model
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - The Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) has measured using remote sensing and GIS methods, with MODIS data collected in Jharkhand from 2011 to 2017. The state's eastern and northern borders have greater aerosol loadings (AOD: >0.5) while the southern and western parts have lower aerosol loadings (AOD: <0.3). Primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary aerosol sources have been identified and categorized using the Analytic Hierarchical Process (AHP). Only 1.29% of the study area, which still emits the most aerosols, is covered by primary sources. Industrial zones, mining regions, thermal power plants, cement industries, high road density, and stone crushers are found in many locations throughout the country. Secondary sources of aerosols account for 5.23% of the study and are located near the main sources. The quaternary (54.08%) and tertiary (39.4%) aerosol sources mainly covered the Southern, Western, and North-Western portions of the state, which is enveloped by a heavily vegetated region. AOD, sources of aerosols, wind direction, and velocity were examined here. There were non-separable connections in this area and also AOD distribution is connected to aerosol sources, wind direction, and wind velocity. Finally, it employs the AOD values to identify different aerosol kinds and source heterogeneity to elucidate their influence.

TI  - Secretory carcinoma of the breast, commonly exhibits the features of low grade, triple negative breast carcinoma- A Case report with updated review of literature.
T2  - Autopsy & case reports
M3  - Case Reports
AB  - Secretory carcinoma of the breast (SBC) is a rare breast neoplasm. Most of the patients present at an early stage with a relatively indolent clinical course. Lymph node and distant metastasis are also very infrequent. The histomorphological features of the secretory breast carcinoma are quite characteristic. Predominantly three histological patterns, solid, microcystic, and tubular, have been noted with copious amounts of intra and extracellular secretory material. Most commonly, no positivity for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and ERBB2(HER2/neu) is observed in SBCs. As SBC can occasionally be hormone receptor-positive, they should not be categorized in the triple-negative breast carcinoma (TNBC) group in general. A very characteristic genetic translocation t (12;15) has been noted in this rare tumor, resulting in a fusion between ETV6 and NTRK3 proteins. We present a case of a 60-year-old lady who presented with right breast lump of 1-month duration and was managed by lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node dissection. Axillary dissection was not performed because the sentinel lymph node biopsy was negative. Postoperative radiotherapy was given to the right breast with a boost to the tumor bed. No adjuvant chemotherapy was given No recurrence has been noted even after a year of the completion of treatment.

TI  - Novel method for reconstruction of hyperspectral resolution images from multispectral data for complex coastal and inland waters
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral resolution image products of a synthetic sensor featuring the high spatial resolution of the space-borne sensor can offer cost-effective means for enhancing our current capabilities in terms of providing an array of images in lieu of designing an expensive system for image acquisition, which can serve the expanding needs of the scientific and user communities for various critical water color applications. Despite several studies on enhancing the capability of land remote sensing sensors, full spectrum reconstruction of water color images with varying spectral bands is hampered by the lack of methods and accurate atmospheric correction procedures. In the present work, a novel method is developed for reconstruction of hyperspectral resolution images from high spatial-resolution Sentinel 2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) data representative of many complex waters in coastal and inland zones. This method uses a deep neural network (DNN) with multiple blocks of deconvolution and dense layers. The spectral reconstruction of hyperspectral resolution images from multispectral data was based on rigorous training data from the atmospherically-corrected and validated HICO normalized water-leaving radiance products (with spectral resolution 438-868 nm sampled at 5.7 nm) of diverse water types. The generalizability and versatility of the DNN method was tested and evaluated systematically by means of various qualitative and quantitative analyses using concurrent space-borne (MSI and HICO) and in-situ measurements from different regional waters. Reconstructed hyperspectral resolution radiances obtained from the MSI images closely matched with independent HICO and MSI measurements within the desired accuracy. Successful reconstruction and validation of the hyperspectral radiances indicate that the proposed state-of-the-art method provides possible future directions for enhancing our current capabilities of space-borne sensors for various research purposes and societal applications at local, regional and global scales.

TI  - Flood Extent Mapping in the Caprivi Floodplain Using Sentinel-1 Time Series
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deployment of Sentinel-1 (S1) satellite constellation carrying a C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) enables regular and timely monitoring of floods from their onset until returning to nonflooded (NF) conditions. The major constraint on using SAR for near-real-time (NRT) flood mapping has been the inability to rapidly process the obtained imagery into reliable flood maps. This study evaluates the efficacy of S1 time series for quantifying and characterizing inundation extents in vegetated environments. A novel algorithm based on statistical time-series modeling of flooded (F) and NF pixels is proposed for NRT flood monitoring. For each new available S1 image, the probability of temporarily F conditions is tested against that of NF conditions by means of likelihood ratio tests. The likelihoods for the two conditions are derived from early acquisitions in the time series. The algorithm calibration consists of adjusting two likelihood ratio thresholds to match the reference F area extent during a single flood season. The proposed algorithm is applied to the Caprivi region, the resulting maps were compared to cloud-free Landsat-8 (LS8) derived maps captured during two flood events. A good spatial agreement (85-87%) between LS8 and S1 flood maps was observed during the flood peak in both 2017 and 2018 seasons. Significant discrepancies were noted during the flood expansion and recession phases, mainly due to different sensitivities of the data sources to the emerging vegetation. Overall, the analysis shows that S1 can stand as an effective standalone or gap-filling alternative to optical imagery during a flood event.

AB  - Road constructions, especially in mountainous topographical features, have been noted responsible for the significant increase of landslide occurrences. In the Gamt - Tasikmalaya Road, numerous landslides have been recorded causing enormous losses. This road has a very important role as the main transportation connector between two regencies in West Java; those are Garut and Tasikmalaya Regency. To deal and control such problems, spatial distributions of landslide vulnerability need to be analyzed. The aim of this study was to assess the widespread landslide vulnerability zones along the Garut - Tasikmalaya Road. The landslide triggering factors, i.e. topographic slope, land use, lithology, distance to geological structure and distance to stream, were spatially evaluated and integrated using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and simple numerical rating method to determine the landslide vulnerability zones. The data of landslide triggering factors were derived from remote sensing data and processed using GIS technology. The data integration produced landslide vulnerability map along the Garut - Tasikmalaya Road, which delineates the research area into three zones of landslide vulnerability (high, moderate, and low). The landslide vulnerability map was validated using landslide inventory. The high vulnerability zones of landslide, that will affect the Garut - Tasikmalaya Road, are mainly located in the Salawu District.

TI  - Boosting Ship Detection in SAR Images With Complementary Pretraining Techniques
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep learning methods have made significant progress in ship detection in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. The pretraining technique is usually adopted to support deep neural networks-based SAR ship detectors due to the scarce labeled SAR images. However, directly leveraging ImageNet pretraining is hard to obtain a good ship detector because of different imaging perspectives and geometry. In this article, to resolve the problem of inconsistent imaging perspectives between ImageNet and earth observations, we propose an optical ship detector (OSD) pretraining technique to transfer the characteristics of ships in earth observations to SAR images from a large-scale aerial image dataset. On the other hand, to handle the problem of different imaging geometry between optical and SAR images, we propose an optical-SAR matching (OSM) pretraining technique, which transfers plentiful texture features from optical images to SAR images by common representation learning on the OSM task. Finally, observing that the OSD pretraining-based SSD has a better recall on sea area while the OSM pretraining-based SSD can reduce false alarms on land area, we combine the predictions of the two detectors through weighted boxes fusion to further improve detection results. Extensive experiments on four SAR ship detection datasets and three representative convolutional neural network-based detection benchmarks are conducted to show the effectiveness and complementarity of the two proposed detectors, and the state-of-the-art performance of the combination of the two detectors. The proposed method won the sixth place of ship detection in SAR images in the 2020 Gaofen challenge.

AB  - The descriptor "medieval" is often used disparagingly to suggest a lack of scientific awareness or curiosity. However, the poetry of the Exeter Book reflects a specific Old English ecotheology, which anticipates by nearly a millennium the modern environmental movement. Indeed, there are lessons to be learned from these Old English ecotheologians. The poetry of the Exeter Book suggests modern earth consciousness and activism can be facilitated by acknowledging the interconnectedness of human and other-than-human beings on Earth; rejecting binaries which see humanity as distinct from (and superior to) nature in favor of a worldview which sees humanity as a part of nature; and finally, recognizing that, environmental crises are an opportunity to grow our relationships with the Earth community.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the proportion of eligible individuals, within one health region in Ontario, who were referred for publicly funded medical and surgical weight-loss interventions (MSWLI).Design A retrospective cohort study that used primary care data from the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN) and referral data from the Ontario Bariatric Network (OBN).Setting Primary care practices within southeastern Ontario that contribute data to CPCSSN.Participants Patients with class II (body mass index [BMI] 35.0 to 39.9 kg/m(2)) or III (BMI >= 40 kg/m(2)) obesity who were eligible for referral to the OBN for MSWLI.Main outcome measures Primary care data about patients within the CPCSSN database were linked to referral records within the OBN database using 3 indirect identifiers to determine the proportion of patients with class II and III obesity who were referred to the OBN for MSWLI. An adjusted multivariate logistic regression model was used to determine the most significant predictors of referral.Results Of the 87276 patients within one health region in Ontario, 15526 (17.8%) patients had class II or III obesity and were eligible for referral for MSWLI. Only 966 out of those 15526 (6.2%) patients were actually referred for MSWLI. In the multivariate regression analysis, BMI had the strongest association with referral in terms of adjusted odds ratio (AOR), varying from 2.50 (95% CI 2.04 to 3.06) for a BMI of 40.0 to 44.9 kg/m(2), to 5.15 (95% CI 4.21 to 6.30) for a BMI of 50.0 kg/m(2) or greater. Referral was more likely for female than male patients (AOR=2.18; 95% C11.86 to 2.57), those living rurally than for urban dwellers (AOR=1.39; 95% CI 1.20 to 1.60), and those aged 30 to 39 (AOR =1.61; 95% CI 1.24 to 2.09) and 40 to 49 (AOR =1.53; 95% CI 1.18 to 1.98) compared with other age groups.Conclusion Within one health region in Ontario, the referral rate of patients with class II and III obesity for MSWLI was low. Our findings highlight the need for further research to understand and address the barriers to referral of patients with class II and III obesity for MSWLI.

T2  - EQA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, scientific research is involved to identifying methods for measuring and mapping soil properties allowing the cost reduction for sampling and laboratory analyses. In precision agriculture, it is of interest to obtain accurate spatial distribution maps of soil organic carbon to drive fertilization and variable rate seeding. The aim of this work is to test the Nix (TM) Pro spectrophotometer using both dry and wet topsoil color for the estimation of the total organic carbon (TOC) in a geographically limited area with relatively low soil variability. The relationships obtained using multiple linear regression were not very accurate (R-2 0.54, p-value < 0.001) due to a high variance between the measured and predicted vaues. However, starting from a soil geo-resistivity survey and free remote sensing images, this method has proved effective in increasing the number of measured points thus making an important contribution to the creation of an interpolated precision maps of soil organic carbon, calibrated for the study area.

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - This work proposes a Resilience Index of Ecosystem Services (RIES) that is based on remote sensing to assess the ecological quality of highly anthropized territories. The study area is characterized as an urbanized area of Florence and Prato in central Tuscany (Italy). The proposed method was derived from the Pressure-State-Response (PSR) framework, which focuses on the notion of causality and involves the selection and measurements of three categories indicators: environmental state, anthropogenic pressure and climatic response.The first of which consists of the Ecosystem Services Provision Index (ESPI), which is derived from the Cascade theory and is evaluated using two statistics of the seasonal dynamics of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), that are calculated from Sentinel 2 images: the annual mean (mean NDVI) and the intra-annual Coefficient of Variation of the NDVI (CV NDVI). The calculation is as follows: ESPI = average NDVI * (1-NDVI CV).The second category is characterized by the Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) and is derived from the Sentinel 2 images. The third is composed of the climate resilience index, which is calculated by combining the Land Surface Temperatures (LST) with the Tasseled Cap - wetness index both from Landsat 8 images.The third is composed of the climate resilience index, which is calculated by combining the Land Surface Temperatures (LST) with the Tasseled Cap - wetness index both from Landsat 8 images.These three macro indices are aggregated through a Dempster-Shafer rule of combination with weights derived using a Principal Components Analysis (PCA). The aggregation of these macro indices allows us to obtain the RIES index.

The study was conducted upstream the municipality of Manhuacu, where the morphometric characterization was carried out in 23 sub-basins; land use classification through LandSat 8 OLI scenes; reference flow of 16 sub-basins was evaluated over 14 months, between May 2018 to July 2019; precipitation was measured by using four local rain gauges. The basin has cover predominance of coffee, 31.06%. Among evaluated sub-basins, those with the greatest temporal variation of flow were the Corrego Fundo, Corrego Palmital, Corrego Manhuacuzinho, and Corrego Sao Sebastiao. The Manhuacu River basin has a large temporal variation flow, with a marked reduction during the winter and a high elevation during the period of intense rains, requiring soil and water conservation techniques to promote the regulation of watercourses, thus reducing floods in Manhuacu.

AB  - Allergic diseases and, in particular, allergic rhinitis are among the most common chronic diseases, inducing disturbances in daily activities. They are caused primarily by the pollens of allergenic plants and symptoms can deteriorate due to various ambient conditions which work as irritants, such as humidity. In this paper, we present the development of an eHealth/mHealth holistic platform that utilizes the technologies of Internet of Things (IoT), Mobile Crowdsensing (MCS), Social Networking Services, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Machine Learning (ML), in order to work as a sentinel and disease prevention tool for patients with allergic rhinitis symptoms. By efficiently combining human with machine intelligence, we provide a complementary sensing method for the comprehensive and large-scale monitoring of the disease in broad regions, and in real-time. Moreover, the users of our platform are encouraged to engage in the sensing process through a personalized health monitoring system in order to keep a constant awareness of their symptoms and, thus, deliver a successful adherence to their treatment. As an important use case, we adapted our platform to the USA region, but it can be easily extended to any other area with minor modifications. The design and complete implementation of our platform has been performed and validated in close cooperation with well-recognized academic medical doctors based in Greece who specialize in the control of allergic diseases (and rhinitis in particular) and provided valuable insights and detailed requirements analysis about the functionality and usability of the platform. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that examines allergic rhinitis monitoring in a complementary manner and on large scale, with the utilization of hybrid data sources.

AB  - The paper deals with the quality assessment and the analysis of possible corrections of the empirical model of the shape and position of the high-latitude boundary of the Earth's outer radiation belt [2] using the full dataset on the electron fluxes with energy above 100 keV measured in the recent 5 years at the orbit of the Meteor-M No. 2 satellite. The high-latitude boundary of the Earth's outer radiation belt at the altitude of 800 km is approximated with an elliptic curve in the geomagnetic coordination system with the parameters depending on the universal time (UT effect) and geomagnetic activity (Dst index). The full dataset of intersections of the high-latitude boundary of the Earth's outer radiation belt by the Meteor-M No. 2 satellite in 2014-2019 was constructed to test the model. The database was utilized to determine errors of the model for various geomagnetic conditions in the magnetosphere and at different magnetic longitudes and to propose ways for its modernization.

TI  - Identification of Structural Geology at the Tangkuban Parahu Geothermal Area, West Java Based on Remote Sensing and Gravity Data

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 9th National Physics Seminar

AB  - Tangkuban Parahu is located in the north of Bandung, the capital province of West Java. Several hydrothermal manifestations, such as hot and warm springs with a temperature of 29 degrees C-80 degrees C, indicate that the Tangkuban Parahu has potential as a geothermal prospect. In such a case, understanding the surface and subsurface geological structures in the prospect area is needed as the first step in geothermal exploration. This study identifies geological structures based on remote sensing and gravity datasets. Structural lineaments were extracted manually using GIS software to produce fault, and fracture density (FFD) maps from the DEMNAS dataset along with IFSAR and ALOS PALSAR images. Lineament extraction was performed at eight different sun azimuth angles (hillshade) to reduce non-meaningful lines that may appear. The FFD maps show that most of the surface manifestation correlates with the high FFD zones. Gravity method is one of the first steps in geothermal exploration to provide an overview of the distribution of rocks and subsurface geological structures. Gravity data were analyzed using the parasnis method to reflect the average of rock density. The derivative technique for gravity method is common to be applied in order to delineate subsurface geological structures [1]. In this research, we used First Horizontal Derivative (FHD) and Second Vertical Derivative (SVD) to determine the presence and the type of major fault. The results of this research indicate that most of the high FFD zones are located in the peak maximum of FHD, which has SVD=0. Nevertheless, there are 3 locations of the high FFD zone that have no peak maximum FFD. Integration of this analysis mostly shows that the existence of geological structures is related to surface hydrothermal manifestations.

M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and the adherence to measures of social distancing in children and adolescents studied in three national surveys conducted in Brazil between May-June 2020.METHODS: Three national serological surveys were conducted in 133 sentinel cities located in all 27 Federative Units. Multistage probability sampling was used to select 250 individuals per city. The total sample size in age ranges 0-9 and 10-19 years old are of 4,263 and 8,024 individuals, respectively. Information on children or adolescents was gathered with a data collection app, and a rapid point-of-case test for SARS-CoV-2 was conducted on a finger prick blood sample.RESULTS: The adjusted prevalence of antibodies was 2.9% (2.2-3.6) among children 0-9 years, 2.2% (1.8-2.6) among adolescents 10-19 years, and 3.0% (2.7-3.3) among adults 20+years. Prevalence of antibodies was higher among poor children and adolescents compared to those of rich families. Adherence to social distancing measures was seen in 72.4% (71.9-73.8) of families with children, 60.8% (59.6-61.9) for adolescents, and 57.4% (56.9-57.8) for adults. For not leaving the house except for essential matters the proportions were 81.7% (80.5-82.9), 70.6% (69.6-61.9), and 65.1% (64.7-65.5), respectively. Among children and adolescents, social distancing was strongly associated with socioeconomic status, being much higher in the better-off families.CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 showed comparable levels among children, adolescents, and adults. Adherence to social distancing measures was more prevalent in children, followed by adolescents. There were important socioeconomic differences in the adherence to social distancing among children and adolescents.

T2  - VOPROSY FILOSOFII
M3  - Article
AB  - The article analyzes the life path and tragic death of the philosopher Grigory Borisovich Itelson (1852-1926) emigrated from Russia. According to the assumption put forward in the article, he became the prototype of Albert Lichtenberg, the hero in the story of Andrey Platonov Garbage Wind (1933), which describes the fate of a lonely German scientist, "the physicist of outer space", who was killed by the Nazis for protesting against fascism. The article analyzes a number of coincidences between the fate of G.B. Itelson and the philosopher Lichtenberg described in the story Garbage Wind, in particular, the way of life and the circumstances of death. The author of the article finds in the text of Platonov's story some allusions to G.B. Itelson - features of the worldview, publication by the hero of the story of the book The Universe as a desolate space, burned in the square by the fascists, which is seen as a hint of the book by Felix Eberti Stars and World History. Thoughts about space, published by G.B. Itelson in 1923. The author analyzes the reason for Platonov's appeal to the personality of Itelson, who was a personal friend of A. Einstein and the main translator of his books into Russian. Through these publications in the 1920s, A. Platonov got acquainted with the General and Special Theory of Relativity, which had a strong influence on the writer's worldview and largely shaped the poetics of his works. The article argues for the possibility of Platonov's acquaintance with the obituary of G.B. Itelson, written by A.A. Goldenweiser and published in the Berlin Russian newspaper Ruhl, which describes in detail the life and tragic death of the philosopher at the hands of the Nazis.

T2  - TEKSTY DRUGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - Barski proposes that black metal music can be inscribed in a long current of thought that begins with Romanticism. Assuming an ahistorical, phenomenological definition of this cultural formation, Barski considers the problem from several perspectives: direct intertextual references, worldview and social philosophy and an aesthetics based on transgression (among others). Examples demonstrate - for the first time with reference to Polish culture - the Romantic character of black metal music, which draws on Romanticism as well as later trends which are also rooted in its tenets. All this proves the unabated presence of the Romantic paradigm in contemporary pop culture.

TI  - A Man of Vision and Faithful Sentinel of Catholic Theology: Fr. Francisco Marin-Sola, O.P
T2  - PHILIPPINIANA SACRA
M3  - Article
AB  - On the occasion of the 500th year of the commemoration of Christianity's coming to the Philippines, the Filipino people profoundly remember how God bestowed abundant graces to them. Proofs to this remembrance are the external and internal manifestation of gratefulness among the Filipino people. The milestones reached by the Church in the Philippines are not an invitation to blow the horns of triumphalism but a call to profound introspection and humility. Thus, remembering how God has sustained us for half a millennium leads us back to people whom God used as conduits of His overflowing mercy. In this paper, I focus on Fr. Francisco Marin-Sola, O.P., who has contributed significantly to Catholic theology. Fr. Marin, as he is fondly called, had ties with the University of Santo Tomas in Manila. It was in this institution that he was able to hone his virtues and skills as a student, teacher, and writer. This Dominican's natural talent blended well with St. Thomas Aquinas' framework that led to the production of works reflecting the latter's genius. Fr. Marin's most notable work is titled, The Homogeneous Evolution of the Catholic Dogma, a compilation of articles published in La Ciencia Tomista during the early 1900s. In this work, he used the term "evolution" to investigate the Catholic doctrine's homogeneous growth, which at that time, many viewed as provocative and a deviation from tradition. Criticized at first, his docility and vigilance earned him respect from his contemporaries. This paper also explored Fr. Marin's significant contribution to Catholic theology counting him as one of the greatest Dominicans who graced UST with his meaningful presence.

TI  - Spatial Variations of Vegetation Index from Remote Sensing Linked to Soil Colloidal Status
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent decades have seen a progressive degradation of soils owing to an intensification of farming practices (weeding and high trafficking), increasing use of pesticides and fertilizers, mainly nitrogen, resulting in a steady decline in soil organic matter, a key component to maintain soil fertility. The work has coupled the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of wheat cultivation in Central Italy to soil properties where the wheat was grown to identify the properties linked to within-field variability in productivity. NDVI was assessed through Copernicus Sentinel-2 (S-2) data during the wheat anthesis phase. The main outcome showed a significant correlation of NDVI variability to soil colloidal status and to the relative quantity in the exchange complex of the Ca2+ ions. No relationship emerged between NDVI and soil macronutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) concentration. The work suggested that such elements (nitrogen, especially) should not be provided solely considering the vegetation index spatial variations. Rational and sustainable management of soil fertility requires the integration of the NDVI data with the whole complex of soil physical/chemical status. In this way, the identification of the real key factors of fertility will avoid the negative impact of overfertilization. As an example, a fertilization plan was simulated for the sunflower-wheat sequence. The results showed that in the study area additional supplies of N and K would be unnecessary.

AB  - This study aimed to explain and to analyze the local wisdom of the North Buton people in flood disaster mitigation, namely worldview, traditional knowledge, norms, custom, and other traditions conducted by the people of North Buton in natural phenomena observation as the signs of floods, as well as efforts to reduce the risk of flooding by utilizing human resources and natural resources in the vicinity. The results showed that the people of North Buton have a set of local wisdom in flood mitigation which was inherited from their ancestors' legacy. It has been tested through empirical experience and also obtained the traditional legitimacy at North Buton people. That local wisdom included: (1) studying on the animal behavior namely the flock of Joremba (Dragonfly) which get into the residential area and the spooky sounds of Gara (Owl) birds at night, (2) construction of the houses on stilts or semi-permanent house behind the main house, (3) enacting the mamali (taboo) tradition in cutting down of the forests as a control mechanism in ecological balance creation to prevent erosion, (4) exploration of a new spring, (5) observation of the changes of the river volume and the discovery of the presence of the spring that appears suddenly in the rainy season.

T2  - Cancer treatment and research communications
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)-negative, node negative (NN) breast cancer may be offered a gene expression profiling (GEP) test to determine recurrence risk and benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy. We developed a clinical-pathologic (CP) model to predict genomic recurrence risk and examined its performance characteristics.METHODS: Patients diagnosed with HR-positive, HER2-negative, NN breast cancer with a tumour size < 30mm and who underwent a GEP test [OncotypeDX or Prosigna] in Alberta from October 2017 through March 2019 were identified. Patients were classified as low or high genomic risk. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the associations of CP factors with genomic risk. A CP model was developed using coefficients of regression and sensitivity analyses were performed.RESULTS: A total of 366 patients were eligible (135 were tested using OncotypeDX and 231 with Prosigna). Of these, 64 (17.5%) patients were classified as high genomic risk. On multivariable logistic regression, tumour size > 20mm (odds ratio [OR], 3.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.84-6.98; P<0.001), low expression of progesterone receptor (OR, 3.46; 95% CI, 1.76-6.82; P<0.001), and histological grade III (OR, 7.24; 95% CI, 3.82-13.70; P<0.001) predicted high genomic risk. A CP model using these variables was developed to provide a score of 0-4. A CP cut-point of 0, identified 56% of genomic low risk patients with a specificity of 98.4%.CONCLUSIONS: A CP model could be used to narrow the population of breast cancer patients undergoing GEP testing.

(2021) Behavioral strategies and the spatial pattern formation of nesting. The American Naturalist". The study investigates the relative importance of environmental and behavioral mechanisms in nest aggregations of the ground-nesting digger wasp Bembix rostrata. A field study was combined with an individual-based model that simulated the possible behaviors of spatial organisation of nesting. In the first analysis, a microhabitat model was build based on the location of the nests from a capture-mark-recapture study (CMR) and environmental variables NDVI (vegetation) and insolation (sun irradiance), derived from detailed remote sensing data from a drone flight. In the second analysis, an IBM was build that combined three possible mechanisms of nest choice to simulate the emerging spatial and network patterns found in the field. This was done by combining an environmental cue (based on the microhabitat model) and two relevant behavioral mechanisms related to local site fidelity and conspecific attraction. Strengths and combinations of the mechanisms could vary. Simulations were compared to the field data to find which combinations and strengths of mechanisms can best explain the emerging spatial and network patterns. Main results are that 1) the observed pattern in nature is best predicted by the simultaneous effect of a weak environmental cue and strong behavioral mechanisms. 2) individuals differ in their combination of mechanisms used and will either use local site fidelity (personal information) or conspecific attraction (inadvertent social information), but not both simultaneously. 3) We demonstrate that the nest pattern formation of a central place foraging insect cannot be considered as the sum of environmental and behavioral mechanisms.

AB  - COSMO-SkyMed (Constellation of Small satellites for Mediterranean basin Observation) is an Italian Earth Observation (EO) and Dual-Use (Civilian and Defense) Space System conceived with the aim to establish a worldwide service providing Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, products and services compliant with well-established international standards and relevant to a wide range of applications, such as emergency and risk management, scientific and commercial applications and defense Applications. Starting from 2007, the Italian Space Agency (ASI) has promoted the COSMO-SkyMed SAR data exploitation through several initiatives such as "Announcement of Opportunity", "Open Call for Science" and "Open Call for National Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs)". This paper is focused on the trends and results observed in the context of the "Open Call for Science", an initiative completely addressed to the national and international scientific community since 2015. In particular, in this framework, the observed trend and advances in science and applications of SAR imagery and Interferometric SAR (InSAR) are summarized and assessed, also in light of the scientific evidence published in the recent literature by scientific users of ASI's "Open Call for Science".

AB  - In the last decades the scientific community has increasingly used satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data to improve the understanding of geophysics phenomena in many fields (e.g. geology, hydrology, glaciology, climatology, volcanology) as well as in civilian and environmental engineering. In this context, an additional step forward was provided by the new generation of X-Band very high-resolution SAR sensors, such as those hosted onboard the Italian COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) satellites, able to provide an exceptional capability of collecting dense interferometric data stacks in a short time interval (i.e. few months) with a resolution allowing to monitor single facilities in detail. In many case studies, the available CSK historical series of displacements highlighted the presence of localized deformation points, for example affecting cultural heritage buildings or of potential concern for the stability of bridges and railway networks. This highlights the maturity achieved by this technology widely used also by municipalities and public bodies for monitoring structures and infrastructures.Since 2008, ASI has strongly supported the exploitation of this kind of satellite data and in 2015, following the previous successful experiences, decided to encourage the international scientific community and the national Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) through two dedicated "COSMO-SkyMed Open Call" initiatives. In this framework, this paper presents some selected case studies for structure and infrastructure monitoring and the related results, focusing the discussion on the recent developments and observed trends for both scientific and commercial communities, at both national and international levels.

T2  - VESTNIK OF SAINT PETERSBURG UNIVERSITY EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the second half of the twentieth century, cities and regions worldwide have experienced depopulation due to the global economic and social transformation. Aging and natural population decline have become characteristic for Russia already in the late-Soviet period. In addition, the transition from state socialism to neoliberal capitalism with a change in rationality of economic development and governance has led to an intensification of internal migration flows. Against this background, the aim of the current lies in a comparative analysis of the main trends in the transformation of the regional settlement system and the response to these transformations proposed by the regional and municipal planning and policy in Russia. The research is carried out based on the example of Ivanovskaya oblast. By analyzing statistical and remote sensing data, the study highlights the general negative demographic trends in the region, intra-regional differences in these trends, as well as the results of their impact on the transformation of the settlement pattern. Content analysis of normative documents allows revealing features of official policymaking and planning agenda at regional and municipal levels, which determine territorial development in the context of depopulation. Based on the results of the content analysis, the following conclusions are drawn. First, there seem to be an incomplete or simplified understanding of dynamics, causes, and consequences of depopulation both at the regional and municipal levels. Second, coordination between different levels of governance in managing depopulation appears to be insufficient. Third, regional authorities do not seem to "accept" the current demographic situation as the basic condition for forming long-term scenario of the region's development.

CP  - 7th Geoinformation Science Symposium
CL  - Yogyakarta, INDONESIA
AB  - Topographic Correction (TC) is one of the essential pre-processing methods to reduce the topographic effect in remote sensing data. It is one of the main factors affecting the reflectance value of objects in remote sensing imagery in the rugged topographic area and contributes to quantitative analysis. High-resolution satellite imagery also requires high spatial resolution of the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) as an important requirement in applying TC methods. This study evaluated the performance of five different TC algorithms (i.e., Statistical-Empirical (SE), C-Correction, Minnaert, Gamma, and Sun Canopy Sensor+C (SCS+C) over four hilly to the undulating area with different land-cover characteristics on SPOT-6/7 Multispectral imagery in Sulawesi Island and used the nation-wide DEMNAS as DEM. Visual and statistical evaluations were used to examine the surface reflectance value before and after correction by calculating linear regression and Pearson Correlation (R) between illumination (IL) and reflectance value, and the difference between mean reflectance value of lit and shadowed for vegetated slope. The results showed that the Minnaert, SCS+C, and C-Correction, perform better than other methods. However, Minnaert and SCS+C statistically and visually performed better in all topographic conditions, and C-Correction showed moderate performance. The Gamma method tends to be under-correction but is visually suitable for favorable topographic conditions and poorly illuminated areas in shaded slopes area. In contrast, SE tends to overcorrect all SPOT-6/7.

M3  - Article
AB  - Regional land use monitoring at high spatial, temporal, and thematic resolution is an important expectation of Walloon stakeholders. Over the last decade, increased data-processing capacities and the annual acquisition of remotely sensed data have resulted in the production of a large amount of relevant geodata. The INSPIRE directive and its obligations for 2020 serve as a path for the development of a new user-driven and open-source hierarchical land use classification system mapping scheme, as presented in this paper. The process includes intensive user consultation, the development of an entire automatic processing chain, and efforts to address challenges such as big data handling, the variability of input data properties, and reproducibility. The thematically detailed land use map, with its 69 classes, is already widely used by Walloon stakeholders, and new demands for updating have already emerged. Based on a European classification system that is compulsory for all member states, INSPIRE-compliant land use maps will make it possible to carry out cross-border studies and compare spatial planning strategies between states.

AB  - The possibility of identifying and quantifying agricultural areas objectively and quickly is a relevant aspect in the Brazilian agricultural context, given the territorial extent of the country and the cultivated areas. The objective of this research was to create a methodology to apply an automatic land use and land cover classification on the Sao Francisco Verdadeiro River hydrographic basin, western region of Parana state, with Landsat-8 images in the Google Earth Engine geospatial processing platform. This approach has compared commonly performed classifications with classification by statistical features (median and standard deviation). Results indicate as the best dataset was the bands B2 to B7, of each image and NDVI available in the studied period, which obtained Overall Accuracy (OA) of 99.0% and Kappa index (K) of 0.9867. The dataset of statistical features obtained OA of 97.3% and K of 0.9644, being also a reliable and representative way for LULC mapping.

TI  - The Diagnosis, Treatment, and Aftercare of Cervical Carcinoma.
T2  - Deutsches Arzteblatt international
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Systematic Review
AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately 4380 cases of cervical carcinoma were diagnosed in Germany in 2016. In women who had not participated in early detection programs, cervical carcinoma was usually already in an advanced stage at the time of diagnosis. Certified structures for care in conformity with the existing guidelines are available.METHODS: The new German clinical practice guideline was revised with the participation of 50 medical societies under the expert guidance of the Guideline Program in Oncology, which includes the German Association of the Scientific Medical Societies (Arbeitsgemeinschaft der Wissenschaftlichen Medizinischen Fachgesellschaften, AWMF). A systematic literature review was conducted. Systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were considered.RESULTS: The histologic tumor stage and lymph-node stage are essential determinants of the treatment strategy. The main innovation regarding surgical treatment is the revival of open hysterectomy (overall survival [minimally invasive vs open hysterectomy]: 94.04% vs 99.4%; hazard ratio [HR]: 6.00; 95% confidence interval [1.77; 20.30]). In addition, for tumors measuring 2 cm or less, sentinel node biopsy is recommended rather than radical pelvic lymphadenectomy. MRI-guided brachytherapy is an oblig atory component of radiochemotherapy (overall survival [radiochemotherapy with vs without brachytherapy]: 58.2% vs 46.2%, p<0.001). The standard palliative treatment consists of bevacizumab combined with a platinum-containing agent (overall survival: HR: 0.77 [0.62; 0.95]; p = 0.007).CONCLUSION: Despite the introduction of new treatments, the outcome of patients with advanced cervical carcinoma has not much improved. In the surgical treatment of cervical carcinoma, the open approach is now favored. The sentinel node biopsy technique has become well established for the surgical staging of small tumors. Controlled trials are needed so that the outcome of women with cervical carcinoma, particularly in its advanced and metastatic stages, can be improved.

T2  - ILHA DO DESTERRO-A JOURNAL OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE LITERATURES IN ENGLISH AND CULTURAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article intends to investigate in what ways Isak Dinesen (Karen Blixen's pseudonym and living character) employs certain features to invoke the memory of the European pagan traditions. Among them is animism, in which nature, specially the sea, has agency and intention, interfering with and manipulating the plot - reminding us of the animist ontological system that characterizes the pagan worldview. There is also storytelling, which is used to pass on knowledge among different generations in these populations, and the constant presence of the witch figure. By employing these elements in her writing, Dinesen creates a peculiar type of modernism that subverts the laws of classical literary composition through the revival of another kind of tradition that has been questioning and resisting the status quo for centuries.

TI  - Using satellite data for assessing spatiotemporal variability and complementarity of solar resources - a case study from Germany
T2  - METEOROLOGISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT
M3  - Article
AB  - The integration of solar energy into Germany's energy mix has multiplied over the last two decades. Therefore, it becomes increasingly important to quantify the spatiotemporal variations of solar energy to efficientl promote photovoltaic systems' spatial spreading and strengthen the stability of power grids. Only comprehensive information on surface incoming solar radiation's long-term small-scale variability can provide the desired decision support. Clouds, and to some extent aerosols, are essentially responsible for the observed changes in solar energy penetrating the atmosphere. Germany was used as an example in this work, where solar energy currently accounts for around 8 % of annual electricity generation. The daily values of a 25 year dataset (1991-2015) available from satellite measurements were analyzed, depicting the long-term, large-scale evolution of the surface incoming solar radiation and cloud dynamics on a small spatial scale (0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees). The most signif cant long-term increase in solar radiation was observed in spring, mainly inf uenced by the seasonal changes in cloud cover. The pronounced annual cycle of solar input reinforces the need for storage systems to transfer the harvested solar energy to periods with minor solar input. Moreover, there is hardly any solar-solar complementarity in different regions because their inter-regime dynamics are similar and do not show any signif cant differences. The proposed methods for assessing complementarity show explicitly the areas where the solar potential is not yet fully exploited, and additional PV capacities should be built. From these results, it can be concluded that there is further potential for the complementary use of solar energy in Germany on the national level.

TI  - Narcissism and Risk-Taking: The Roles of Dangerous and Competitive Social Worldviews
T2  - PSIHOLOGIJSKE TEME
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous research has shown that narcissism is associated with risk-taking. However, little is known about the factors that may contribute to narcissistic individuals being more likely to engage in risk-taking behaviour. The present research examined whether social worldviews would mediate the associations that specific narcissistic personality features had with risk-taking across life domains in a sample of Iranian community members (N = 489). Our results revealed that the extraverted, antagonistic, and neurotic aspects of narcissism had positive indirect associations with risk-taking in certain life domains through the competitive social worldview. These results suggest that the tendency to view the social environment as intensely competitive may play an important role in the associations that narcissistic personality features have with risk-taking in certain life domains.

TI  - SOIL AND WATER SALINIZATION OF AN OASIS ECOSYSTEM IN THE ZIBAN REGION (TOLGA), ALGERIA
T2  - PLANET CARE FROM SPACE

M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - In the Ziban arid and semi-arid region of Algeria, oasis agro-ecosystems are developing at a fast pace, implying a higher demand for water supply. This has led to the secondary salinization of soil, waterlogging problem and even alkalinisation of soil. The aim of this study is to assess soil salinization and water salinity in three different oases in the Tolga region. These oases differ in terms of age, morphology, and surface state of soil. Remote sensing, analytical and statistical analyses were employed to assess the functional drainage network and degradation state of the three oases. The hydro-pedological characterisation of water and soil samples (pH, EC, calcium carbonate content) was performed through laboratory analysis. Remote sensing data and techniques were employed for the extraction of saline surfaces and land cover features. The results show that the oasis no. 3, which is located in a depression, is the most affected by salinization. Coupled with ancillary data, this outcome can be linked to morphology and the lack of an efficient drainage system. Concerning the oases 1 and 2, there is a low to no risk of salinization and waterlogging, possibly due to an efficient drainage and a favourable geomorphological setting. The two latter oases have satisfactory conditions for an efficient drainage and salt leaching. Despite the strong constraints of this Saharan context, our preliminary results suggest that the sustainable management of oasis ecosystems is achievable, providing valuable reference of the impact of climate change and human activities.

TI  - Quantifying regional trends in large live tree and snag availability in support of forest management
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Pacific Northwest of the United States, 20th century timber harvesting resulted in major declines in area of forests supporting large live and dead trees (i.e., snags), that are not only key habitat elements for many wildlife species but also critical components of ecosystem function. Regional forest management guidance, such as the Northwest Forest Plan (1994) and Eastside Screens (1995), may aim to conserve and foster the development of late-successional old-growth forests, characterized by large live and dead trees. Satellite remote sensing supports regional monitoring efforts of these habitat characteristics, but managers may require additional guidance in order to leverage these data for large landscape or regional assessments. In this study, our objectives were to assess long-term (historical vs. contemporary) and short-term (1993-2017) changes in lands supporting large live trees and snags across 10 wildlife habitat types (WHTs) - disparate vegetation conditions that support significantly different wildlife communities - in Oregon and Washington, USA. We generated 30-m, annual maps of large live trees (> 50 cm,> 75 cm, and> 100 cm diameter) and snags (> 25 cm and > 50 cm diameter) based on the gradient nearest neighbor (GNN) imputation method. GNN integrates Landsat satellite imagery, geospatial climatic and topographic data, and USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis data to predict forest attributes for all forested lands in the study area. GNN classification accuracy was poor to good for large live trees (Cohen's kappa = 0.2 - 0.6) and poor to fair for snags (Cohen's kappa = 0.1 - 0.3) in most WHTs, though performance was substantially lower in drier WHTs where large live trees and snags were rare. Our results highlighted long-term reductions in forest supporting large live trees and snags from historical to contemporary times, especially in wetter, more productive WHTs. In contrast, we observed short-term (1993-2017) increases in areas supporting large live trees and snags. Federal forests were both more similar to reference conditions and exhibited greater recent increases in areas supporting large live trees compared to nonfederal lands. Thus, Oregon and Washington have lost a substantial proportion of forests containing large live trees and snags and recent recruitment of these trees at regional scales is a slow process primarily occurring on federal lands. However, detecting such changes through current Landsat satellite mapping technologies remains challenging, highlighting the need for new mapping methods to aid in future management.

TI  - Major geomorphic events and natural hazards during monsoonal precipitation 2018 in the Kali Gandaki Valley, Nepal Himalaya
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Highest geomorphic activity in the central Nepal Himalayas is mainly driven by monsoonal precipitation. In con-trast, the northern flanks of the Nepal Himalaya lay in the relative dry rain shadow of the mountain range.During the monsoon 2018, major floods and geomorphic events occurred in the Kali Gandaki (KG) valley impacting both the monsoon-affected and the dry parts of the catchments. We analyze the events and its triggers based on field observations, multiple satellite image interpretation, climatological analysis using Global Precipitation Measurement and MODIS snow cover data, hydrological analysis and media analysis.The hydro-meteorological triggers are complex. Exceptional precipitation in April and May 2018 occurred in the entire study area, followed by a rather dry period. Precipitation in August was exceptional in the northern part whereas below average in the South. We argue that dynamics of snow accumulation and delayed melting con-tributed significantly to flooding and increased geomorphic activity in the southern part in August whereas flooding in the northern part was mainly triggered by rainfalls. We thus define 2018 as an abnormal (pre -)monsoon year with less rainfall than average but being more catastrophic.Sediment dynamics in the study area are still controlled by the Dhampu rock avalanche dam and the braided river floodplain north of this knickpoint, where sediment pulses delivered from tributaries are rarely connected from the main river. During the monsoon floods 2018 sediment connectivity was given for most tributaries due to the steepness of the catchments.The study area is subject to major human impact. Mostly in the south, numerous hillslopes have been undercut by road construction, leading to higher geomorphic sensitivity. Severe landslides might thus be triggered in future even by less intense rainfall events.Magnitude and frequency of such abnormal (pre-)monsoon precipitation are highly relevant for sediment flux and natural hazards studies.

AB  - In the context of smart city, there is the need of cheap approaches to get environmental and contextual data. IoT (Internet of Things) devices and sensors may be located in specific points of interest, while their costs is high for the installation, usage/licensing and maintenance. The satellite data can be a viable solution to have more data at the cheaper costs, some of them are open data, while in other cases the satellite data have a cost. In this paper, the exploitation of satellite data in the context of Smart City is analyzed and some examples are provided. The satellite data of the European Union's Earth observation program Copernicus can be used to calibrate the values of large sensors network data, and for new applications in which similar data cannot be recovered from the field. A demonstrative Dashboard has been provided to allow the users to perform a comparison of data coming from satellite with respect to those obtained from IOT Devices. This research has been developed in the context of PC4City project (Civil Protection for the City) of the Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Firenze.

TI  - Analysis of the Scroll "Ba Bridge in the Snow": The Results of the Creative Journey of Shen Zhou (1427-1509)
T2  - VESTNIK SANKT-PETERBURGSKOGO UNIVERSITETA-ISKUSSTVOVEDENIE
M3  - Article
AB  - Shen Zhou is the founder of the Wumen-Pai movement, which was prominent in southern China in the XV-XVI centuries. Shen Zhou became famous as a poet, painter, and calligrapher. In the article, the late stage of his creative work is investigated by the example of the vertical scroll "Ba bridge in the snow". The technique of monochrome writing and the composition of the winter landscape are analyzed. The article examines the influence of biographical and social factors, Confucian teachings and Taoist practices on Shen Zhou's painting. A comprehensive study of the scroll makes it possible to reveal the master's worldview. The scroll, without any topographical accuracy, depicts an imaginary view of the bridge on the Bashui River. The study of the poetic inscription demonstrates the discrepancy between the poetic rhyme and the rhythm of calligraphic forms. The gradations of ink tone in calligraphy combine it with the color of painting. Shen Zhou transfers the calligraphic technique of working with the wrist and holding the brush to painting. The scroll uses the composition type "one river three banks", in which the elements mirror each other upside down. The artist creates a dynamic balance of empty and filled spaces. The most valuable quality of Shen Zhou painting is considered by Chinese experts to be its "desalination" (tribute), which implies a balanced mental attitude, sublime clarity of thoughts and heartfelt sincerity of their expression. Behind the simplicity and naturalness of Shen Zhou's painting are effective energetic practices and a high mastery of hidden stylistic quotations from masterpieces of previous eras. By the end of his life, Shen Zhou realized the utopian ideal of unlimited longevity and, as the analysis of the scroll shows, found humility before the inevitability of death. Shen Zhou's art has made his name famous for centuries.

CL  - ARGENTINA
AB  - Monitoring the spatial and temporal changes of seasonal snow cover helps to predict and mitigate floods, avalanches, frost damage, among other hazards. It can also help estimating the supply for human consumption of fresh water, irrigation and hydropower stations, and may contribute to the improvement of weather forecasts and the understanding of the climate system. However, global warming and the effect of Light Absorbing Impurities (LAIs) are affecting the spatial and temporal variability of snowpacks and its complex processes and environmental interactions. This study is a first approach for assessing the impact of LAIs in the Argentinean snowpacks albedo through radiative transfer models. The results suggest that determining the state of the snowpack before estimating the presence, concentration and type of impurity is essential due to the fact that the albedo simulations vary significantly according to the snow grain size. Additionally, change percentage from unpolluted fresh and aged snow was calculated for snowpacks with high concentrations of black carbon, dust and ash considering the impurity values found in South America. Finally, the albedo results obtained with the SNICAR model were compared with the Landsat-8 relative spectral response in order to assess the capabilities of the sensor to estimate the presence of LAIs, which showed similar results than the ones obtained with SNICAR.

TI  - Offshore Wind Energy Resource in the Kingdom of Morocco: Assessment of the Seasonal Potential Variability Based on Satellite Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study provides a first estimate of the offshore wind power potential along the Moroccan Atlantic shelf based on remotely sensed data. An in-depth knowledge of wind potential characteristics allows assessment of the offshore wind energy project. Based on consistent daily satellite data retrieved from the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) spanning the period from 2008 to 2017, the seasonal wind characteristics were statistically analyzed using the climatological Weibull distribution functions and an assessment of the Moroccan potential coastal wind energy resources was qualitatively analyzed across a range of sites likely to be suitable for possible exploitation. Also, an atlas of wind power density (WPD) at a height of 80 m was provided for the whole Moroccan coast. An examination of the bathymetrical conditions of the study area was carried out since bathymetry is among the primary factors that need to be examined with the wind potential during offshore wind project planning. The results were presented based on the average wind intensity and the prevailing direction, and also the wind power density was shown at monthly, seasonal and interannual time scale. The analysis indicated that the coastal wind regime of the southern area of Morocco has the greatest energy potential, with an average power density which can reach in some places a value around 450 W/m(2) at heights of 10 m and 80 m above sea level (a.s.l) (wind turbine hub height) more particularly in the south of the country.

AB  - Experiments were carried out to investigate the use of Land Use and Coverage Area frame Survey (LUCAS) dataset and Sentinel-2 imagery to produce a land cover map in Portugal through automated supervised classification. LUCAS is a free land cover land use (LCLU) dataset based in Europe, while Sentinel-2 satellites provide also free images with short revisit frequency. The goal was to evaluate if LUCAS dataset from 2018 can be used as a single reference dataset for land cover classification at national level. The Random Forest (RF) algorithm was used. Some processing steps were undertaken to use LUCAS as reference dataset. The original LUCAS LCLU nomenclature was modified into a new nomenclature composed of 12 and 6 level-2 and level-1 map classes, respectively. Filtering was performed on LUCAS metadata, reducing the initial number of LUCAS points over Portugal from 7168 to 4910. Monthly composites of Sentinel-2 images acquired between October 2017 and September 2018 were used. To reduce the imbalance in LUCAS training points, an oversampling technique based on Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE) was used. An independent validation dataset was produced with 600 points. RF shows an overall accuracy (OA) of 57% for level-2 and 72% for level-1 nomenclatures. When using the oversampling technique, the OA accuracy increases by 3% for level-2 and 2% for level-1. The preliminary results of this experiment show that LUCAS dataset used in supervised machine learning classification has potential to produce a reliable land cover map at national scale.

TI  - Improving Land Cover Segmentation Across Satellites Using Domain Adaptation
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover mapping is essential to various fields of study, such as forestry, agriculture, and urban management. Generally, earth observation satellites facilitate and accelerate the mapping process. Subsequently, deep learning methods have been proven to be excellent in automating the mapping via semantic image segmentation. However, because deep neural networks require large amounts of labeled data, it is not easy to exploit the full potential of satellite imagery. Additionally, land cover tends to differ in appearance from one region to another; therefore, having labeled data from one location does not necessarily help map others. Furthermore, satellite images come in various multispectral bands, which range from RGB to over 12 bands. In this study, our aim is to use domain adaptation (DA) to solve the aforementioned problems. We applied a well-performing DA approach on the DeepGlobe land cover dataset as well as datasets that we built using RGB images from Sentinel-2, WorldView-2, and Pleiades-1B satellites with CORINE Land Cover as ground truth (GT) labels. The experiments revealed significant improvements over the results obtained without using DA. In some cases, an improvement of over 20% mean intersection over union was obtained. Sometimes, our model manages to correct errors in the GT labels.

TI  - Exploratory analysis of cooling effect of urban wetlands on Kolkata metropolitan city region, eastern India
T2  - CURRENT RESEARCH IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study mainly accentuates the effects of urban wetlands on micro climate in the hinterland region and the cooling effects of the wetlands largely control over the intensity of urban heat island (UHI). The magnitude of conurbation or urban agglomeration (with high-rise multi-storeyed buildings) of Kolkata city is growing very fast and this process accelerates the progress of urban heat island. The seven significant urban wetlands have been selected and Landsat satellite data (for the years 2018, 2019 and 2000) and descriptive statistical techniques have also been used. The temperature difference and temperature gradient (from the lake shoreline to the city's periphery) has been analysed to examine the cooling effects of wetlands. Consequently, around 30mts wide buffers have been generated from the shoreline of the wetlands and the temperature variance of each buffer is systematically examined. The result showed that the variance of temperature between first and last buffer is 3.41 degrees c and the temperature gradient is 1.14 degrees c/100mts towards the outer margin of the city. Here, heat holding capacity of different objects revealed that the average temperature of build upland is higher (32.59 degrees c) than the other classes. The average temperature of build upland within 300 mts buffer is 0.745 degrees c lower than the overall Kolkata metropolitan city region. Except the provisional service of the wetland, it modifies the urban micro climate. This applied research focuses further about the significant role of wetlands for reduction of excessive urban heat stress. This study definitely brings a new shape to frame for sustainable urban environmental management.

AB  - Advances in Remote Sensing (Digital Elevation Models) products and GIS techniques have made the calculation and analysis of morphometric indices much more accurate, effective, and less time- consuming. Dissection index (Di) is a morphometric parameter that indicates the degree of dissection or vertical erosion and the stage of landform development. Calculating morphometric parameters by manual methods is inconvenient because it takes a long time, is subject to mistakes that can be made by humans when extracting these parameters and, consequently leads to wrong conclusions. There Is currently no fully automated method to calculate this parameter.The purpose of this paper is to define the procedures for extracting this parameter within a GIS environment using data from high resolution (HR) ALOS-PALSAR (Advanced Land Observing Satellite-Phased Array-Type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar) Radiometrically Terrain Corrected (RTC) DEM with a spatial resolution of 12.5 m with the help of ArcGIS software. To calculate this parameter, a grid with 1x1 km cells with interpolation points in each cell was constructed. IDW was chosen as the most suitable method for the interpolation of points. Based on the obtained results, the extreme values of Di for the Drenica River basin ranged from 0 - 0.46.90.54% of the surface belongs to the low and very low values of Di, 9.11% belongs to the average values while only 0.35% belongs to the high values of Di. The high participation of small values of this index for the Drenica River basin indicates that river erosion is very low and the total area is increasing towards the creation of flat surfaces. The relief dissection index can be used for various purposes, such as contributing to a better understanding of the spatial distribution of morphogenetic processes, relief segmentation, and landscape units that serve as the basis for geomorphological mapping work, study the balance between pedogenesis and morphogenesis, and the assessment of environmental vulnerability.

TI  - MEASURING SURFACE URBAN HEAT ISLAND IN RESPONSE TO POPULATION DENSITY BASED ON REMOTE SENSING DATA AND GIS TECHNIQUES: APPLICATION TO PRISHTINA, KOSOVO
T2  - FOLIA GEOGRAPHICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban areas, compared to rural areas, have much more visible characteristics of their climate, such as higher surface and air temperatures, and large spatial variation - within the city - of meteorological parameters. The study aimed at investigating the phenomenon of the Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) over the Municipality of Prishtina, Kosovo. The SUHI was investigated based on the relationship between Land Surface Temperature (LST) estimated from Landsat 8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) band with population density using Geographic Information System (GIS). To understand the relationship between population density and Land Surface Temperature (LST), we performed a correlation analysis. This analysis showed a strong positive relationship with a value of r = 0.768005, emphasizing the strong role that the population has in creating areas that generate the SUHI effect. Also, the results of the study clearly showed that builtup areas and bare surfaces are responsible for generating the SUHI effect, while vegetation and water bodies minimize this effect by creating freshness. The study showed that Land Surface Temperature increases with the increase of impervious surfaces, which is related to the increase of population density. Maps in which the identification of the SUHI effect is presented can be a very useful tool for urban administration as well as for urban planning policies for the latter to be directed exactly in those areas where this phenomenon is present and causes a range of concerns for citizens.

M3  - Article
AB  - Formulation of the problem. According long- term data analyses under the slides zone in Ukrainian part of the Azov sea sustainable processes had been marked. Landslides are most active in autumn and spring. The activation of landslides occurs under the influence of man-made and natural factors. The most significant factor is coastal abrasion.Review of previous publications. It was established that the air temperature and precipitation, the temperature and salinity of sea waters and the hydrometeorological regime of the coastal zone and the water balance of the Black and Azov seas as well depends on climatic changes. The rising of the sea level has intensified over the past decades. These changes found a response in the coastal zone that reacted to them and acquired corresponding trends.Purpose is to determine the reasons for the formation of dynamically unstable sectors and the possibility of protecting the shores on the Ukrainian coast in the Azov Sea, the subject is landslide processes, as the result of the abrasion of the shores, the object is the variability of the natural and anthropogenic conditions of the Ukrainian coast of the Azov Sea in the area of interaction between the sea and land.Methods. Analyses of images space and temporal dynamic of Earth remote sensing satellites by DigitalGlobe, USGS LandLook and Sentinel were used and also retrospective long term of hydrometeorological data and standard statistical methods.Results. The places (areas) with pronounced coastal dynamic processes on the Ukrainian coast of the Azov Sea were identified, that require special attention: two in the Kherson region, five in the Zaporozhye region and four in Donetsk. In the coastal zone of the Azov Sea the rate of abrasion from 1 to 4 m per year (in exceptional cases up to 15 m per year) was marked. In a period of significant level rises, the flooding of ports, berths, the destruction of hydraulic engineering structures, storage facilities, and residential buildings is possible. Also, during the period of the significant decreasing of the sea level, the already limited depth of the approach channels decreases again, that disrupts the operation of the fleet. Conclusions. Investigations of the current state of the Ukrainian coastal zone of the Azov Sea, that is significant importance for the sustainable the economy development, the recreational region's potential and the social level of the population.It has been established that in the eastern regions of the Azov coast of Ukraine there are a deficit of sediments and a high degree of variability of the abrasion form of the coastal-sea relief is noted, and an excess of sediments are formed in the western and northwestern regions.

TI  - Water Catchment Critical Level Identification for Revitalization Planning of the Luk Ulo Watershed, Central Java, Indonesia
T2  - SEVENTH GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM 2021
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 7th Geoinformation Science Symposium
CL  - Yogyakarta, INDONESIA
AB  - The Luk Ulo River watershed, the largest river in Kebumen Regency, owns some environmental issues, including its declining quality due to land degradation, land conversion, rapid urbanization, and mining of sand and rock for building material. Rapid population growth also triggers the change of the land functions from forest to built-up area. This massive land-use changing lead to the watershed decreasing potential to absorb a large amount of water optimally, since most of the rainwater will flow to the surface due to reduced forest as a barrier to the rate of surface water. Therefore, watershed potential and actual identification in term of water resources availability is urgently needed. The development of remote sensing technology and geographic information systems has a possibility to study the spatial pattern of water catchment areas in a wide range. This study aims to determine the potential and actual of water catchment areas in the Luk Ulo watershed. The potential of water catchment obtained from the result of overlay from rainfall, soil type (Secondary data) and slope data which derived from DEM SRTM 30 meters. The result of the potential water catchment area is overlaid with land use information extracted from Sentinel-2A imagery through visual interpretation and resulting the actual potential of water catchment. The results show that the condition of the potential natural water catchment area in the Luk Ulo watershed is dominated by moderate infiltration potential with an area of 42,462.87 Ha (65.170%). Furthermore, for actual potential of water catchment areas dominated by good and quite critical conditions with an area of 24,979.85 Ha (38.23%) and 22,896.96 Ha (35.80%) 24,758.53 Ha (38.14%). This research contributes to the potential assessment of watershed revitalization planning, especially to provide the estimation extent area followed by its spatial distribution. Data validation using field observation and secondary data will be ideal for future study to measure the model accuracy followed by giving us local knowledge of the study area.

TI  - Portability and Acceleration of Deep Learning Inferences to Detect Rapid Earthquake Damage From VHR Remote Sensing Images Using Intel OpenVINO Toolkit
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and effective rapid detection in remote sensing images plays an extremely important role in natural disasters, landslides, flooding problems, and military defense. Specially in earthquake damage detection, time critical tasks, such as performing the damage assessment or providing immediate delivery of relief assistance, require responses for swift decisions. To minimize response time, this article proposes the portability and acceleration of the inferences process on a deep convolution neural network model to detect rapid earthquake damage on very high resolution (VHR) remote sensing data using the Intel OpenVINO toolkit. This model, based on a previous work, has been optimized for high performance computing techniques to minimize processing times. Along with the immediate responses, the correctness of the result is also very crucial parameter for such type of applications. For analysis and performance, we use the GeoEye-1 VHR disaster images of the Haiti earthquake occurred in year 2010. Experimental results show that the optimized model provides good accuracy for damage detection with significant execution speed on CPU+GPU using mixed precision technique compared to other previous work. Moreover, OpenVINO toolkit presents satisfactory performance in the inference stage compared to other toolkits, such as TensorFlow serving, using asynchronous inference mode executed on an Intel Xeon processor and Intel Movidius NCS as coprocessor.

TI  - Validation and Trend Analysis of Stratospheric Ozone Data from Ground-Based Observations at Lauder, New Zealand
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in stratospheric ozone have to be assessed continuously to evaluate the effectiveness of the Montreal Protocol. In the southern hemisphere, few ground-based observational datasets exist, making measurements at the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC) station at Lauder, New Zealand invaluable. Investigating these datasets in detail is essential to derive realistic ozone trends. We compared lidar data and microwave radiometer data with collocated Aura Microwave Limb sounder (MLS) satellite data and ERA5 reanalysis data. The detailed comparison makes it possible to assess inhomogeneities in the data. We find good agreement between the datasets but also some possible biases, especially in the ERA5 data. The data uncertainties and the inhomogeneities were then considered when deriving trends. Using two regression models from the Long-term Ozone Trends and Uncertainties in the Stratosphere (LOTUS) project and from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), we estimated resulting ozone trends. Further, we assessed how trends are affected by data uncertainties and inhomogeneities. We find positive ozone trends throughout the stratosphere between 0% and 5% per decade and show that considering data uncertainties and inhomogeneities in the regression affects the resulting trends.

TI  - Interpretation of spatiotemporal gravity changes accompanying the earthquake of 21 August 2017 on Ischia (Italy)
T2  - CONTRIBUTIONS TO GEOPHYSICS AND GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyse spatiotemporal gravity changes observed on the Ischia island (Italy) accompanying the destructive earthquake of 21 August 2017. The 29 May 2016 to 22 September 2017 time-lapse gravity changes observed at 18 benchmarks of the Ischia gravimetric network are first corrected for the gravitational effect of the surface deformation using the deformation-induced topographic effect (DITE) correction. The co-seismic DITE is computed by Newtonian volumetric integration using the Toposk software, a high-resolution LiDAR DEM and the co-seismic vertical displacement field derived from Sentinel-1 InSAR data. We compare numerically the DITE field with its commonly used Bouguer approximation over the island of Ischia with the outcome that the Bouguer approximation of DITE is adequate and accurate in this case. The residual gravity changes are then computed at gravity benchmarks by correcting the observed gravity changes for the planar Bouguer effect of the elevation changes at benchmarks over the same period. The residual gravity changes are then inverted using an inversion approach based on model exploration and growing source bodies, making use of the Growth-dg inversion tool. The found inversion model, given as subsurface time-lapse density changes, is then interpreted as mainly due to a co-seismic or post-seismic disturbance of the hydrothermal system of the island. Pros and weak points of such interpretation are discussed.

AB  - Background. Influenza is a relevant public health problem, also due to the risk of complications. The most effective measure to prevent influenza is vaccination; therefore, at present, there is consensus among European countries, regarding the need for routine seasonal influenza vaccination of elderly and individuals at increased risk of severe influenza. At the same time, influenza surveillance is necessary to understand the viruses circulating and effectiveness of vaccination strategies. The present study reports the results of two seasons influenza surveillance (2017/2018 and 2018/2019) conduced in an University Hospital in Rome among hospitalized patients aged >= 65 years.Study design. A prospective cohort study.Methods. The study consisted of systematic daily screening of all admissions among patients aged >= 65 years meeting a syndromic SARI case definition during two consecutive influenza seasons: 2017/2018 and 2018/2019. Characteristics of patients and their risk factors were collected by a standardized questionnaire and nose-pharyngeal swabs were performed to each patient. Influenza vaccine effectiveness (IVE), rates of vaccinated subjects and case fatality rate were also evaluated.Results. Influenza was laboratory confirmed in 11 (9.9%) of the 111 and 11 (9.6%) of the 115 enrolled patients in seasons 2017/18 and 2018/19, respectively. Adjusted IVE against all influenza type, calculated for each season, was 88.5% (95% CI: 38.9 to 97.8) and 61.7% (95% CI: -59.9 to 90.9) for 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 seasons, respectively. Our analysis shows a Case Fatality Rate of 2.7% and 4.3% for the 2017/18 and 2018/19 seasons, respectively.Conclusions. The surveillance of SARI conduced in one hospital in Rome confirmed that influenza is an important cause of hospital admissions. Routine monitoring of infectious diseases and related aetiology associated with SARI, also at the local-level, is useful for targeting the right preventive measures.

TI  - The R package enerscape: A general energy landscape framework for terrestrial movement ecology
T2  - Zenodo
M3  - Software
AB  - Ecological processes and biodiversity patterns are strongly affected by how animals move through the landscape. However, it remains challenging to predict animal movement and space use. Here we present our new R package enerscape to quantify and predict animal movement in real landscapes based on energy expenditure. Enerscape integrates a general locomotory model for terrestrial animals with GIS tools in order to map energy costs of movement in a given environment, resulting in energy landscapes that reflect how energy expenditures may shape habitat use. Enerscape only requires topographic data (elevation) and the body mass of the studied animal. To illustrate the potential of enerscape, we analyze the energy landscape for the Marsican bear (Ursus arctos marsicanus) in a protected area in central Italy in order to identify least-cost paths and high-connectivity areas with low energy costs of travel. Enerscape allowed us to identify travel routes for the bear that minimize energy costs of movement and regions that have high landscape connectivity based on movement efficiency, highlighting potential corridors. It also identifies areas where high energy costs may prevent movement and dispersal, potentially exacerbating human-wildlife conflicts in the park. A major strength of enerscape is that it requires only widely available topographic and body size data. As such, enerscape permits a first cost-effective way to estimate landscape use and movement corridors even when telemetry data is not readily available, such as for the example with the bear. Enerscape is built in a modular way and other movement modes and ecosystem types can be implemented when appropriate locomotory models are available. In summary, enerscape is a new general tool that quantifies, using minimal and widely available data, the energy costs of moving through a landscape. This can clarify how and why animals move in real landscapes and inform practical conservation and restoration decisions.

TI  - Flood Mapping Proposal in Small Watersheds: A Case Study of the Rebollos and Miranda Ephemeral Streams (Cartagena, Spain)
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic landscape changes cause significant disturbances to fluvial system dynamics and such is the case of the watersheds studied near the Spanish Mediterranean coast (Cartagena). Economic growth resulted in the addition of external water resources from the Tajo River (1979) as part of the National Water Plan (1933). Irrigation water has caused the water table to rise since 1979. Furthermore, water resources have boosted urban touristic expansion, industrial estates, and road infrastructures. This study presents a diagnosis of the official flood hazard maps by applying remote sensing techniques that enable the identification of (i) areas flooded during recent events; and (ii) the possible effects of anthropogenic actions on fluvial processes affecting flooding (land use and land cover change-LULCC). The flooded areas were identified from a multispectral satellite image taken by a sensor on Sentinel-2. A multi-temporal analysis of aerial photographs (1929, 1956, 1981, 2009, and 2017) showing the fluvial and anthropic environment at a detailed scale (1:25,000) was used to define the fluvial geomorphology and the main anthropic alterations on the Rebollos ephemeral stream. Official inputs from geographical information repositories about land use were also gathered (LULC). The result was compared to the official flood hazard maps (SNCZI) and this revealed floodable areas that had not been previously mapped because official maps rely only on the hydraulic method. Finally, all the recent changes that will have increased the disastrous consequences of flooding have been detected, analyzed, and mapped for the study area.

M3  - Review
AB  - This paper examines our understanding of climate change, as well as the reluctance of industrial societies to deal with the drivers, especially the burning of the fossil fuels, before the future consequences become catastrophic. We describe how the energy balance of the Earth, oceans, land and Arctic sea ice are maintained, and how climate is warming and changing with increases in the three most important greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels, water vapor from evaporation off a warmer ocean, and methane from several sources. We discuss the Earth's water cycle and the role of evaporation, latent heat and condensation in driving storms, transporting energy poleward and giving increasing precipitation extremes, floods, droughts and fires. We review the increasing challenge of meeting human demand for water as water tables are falling globally from increased pumping, and winter snowpack storage is shrinking. We discuss rising sea level, the challenges of long-term carbon storage and the lessons from the past four ice age cycles. The text is written for scientific and public audiences, both global and in the US, so metric and US units are given. The social, moral and ethical choices are mapped by contrasting the Earth-centered indigenous worldview needed for our survival with the industrial mindset that is willing to destroy a stable climate to keep the profits of the current economy growing. We review the long history of the misuse of human power, the rise of science and technology without a guiding moral framework, and how neoliberal capitalism by default makes choices that are driving rapid climate change. We outline how deceit by the matrix of corporations and fossil fuel interests that we call the Fossil Empire has prevented government regulation for decades and accelerated the climate crisis.

TI  - Is ground cover a useful indicator of grazing land condition?
T2  - RANGELAND JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed ground cover data play an important role in Australian rangelands research development and extension, reflecting broader global trends in the use of remotely sensed data. We tested the relationship between remotely sensed ground cover data and field-based assessments of grazing land condition in the largest quantitative analysis of its type to date. We collated land condition data from 2282 sites evaluated between 2004 and 2018 in the Burdekin and Fitzroy regions of Queensland. Condition was defined using the Grazing Land Management land condition framework that ranks grazing land condition on a four point ordinal scale based on dimensions of vegetation composition, ground cover level and erosion severity. Nine separate ground cover derived indices were then calculated for each site. We found that all indices significantly correlated with grazing land condition on corresponding sites. Highest correlations occurred with indices that benchmarked ground cover at the site against regional ground cover assessed over several years. These findings provide some validation for the general use of ground cover data as an indicator of rangeland health/productivity. We also constructed univariate land condition models with a subset of these indices. Our models predicted land condition significantly better than random assignment though only moderately well; no model correctly predicted land condition class on >40% of sites. While the best models predicted condition correctly at >60% of A and D condition sites, condition at sites in B and C condition sites was poorly predicted. Several factors limit how well ground cover levels predict land condition. The main challenge is modelling a multidimensional value (grazing land condition) with a unidimensional ground cover measurement. We suggest that better land condition models require a range of predictors to address this multidimensionality but cover indices can make a substantial contribution in this context.

TI  - CHARACTERISING OF PLANT COVER EVOLUTION IN THE AURES REGION (EASTERN ALGERIA): USING LANDSAT IMAGERY
T2  - GEOADRIA
M3  - Article
AB  - A better understanding of the evolution of vegetation cover is a major concern for countries where mountain ecosystems are undergoing severe degradation. Mediterranean woodland ecosystems in general and those of Algeria in particular, are suffering from numerous types of degradation, be they climatic or anthropogenic. For this reason, and to have a better understanding of this issue and how to deal with it, we decided to carry out a study in the Aures Mountains (eastern Algeria), where the phenomenon of degradation has a direct impact on natural resources. The evolution of the vegetation cover in the region was analysed, using remote sensing data (Landsat-type satellite images) over a 33-year period (1984-2017). A notably pronounced regressive evolution of the plant cover was attributed both to the phenomena of climate change and dieback (which particularly affected the cedar groves) and to the anthropogenic pressure exerted on the vegetation as a whole. Data sets from Landsat imagery show an decrease of dense and open forest area, -9,272.52 ha, and -12,953.30 ha respectively. It will therefore become more than necessary to take measures to protect and preserve the region's rich ecological heritage.

AB  - The Agri-Tech Industry in India is still in its nascent stage and is primed for huge growth. A lot of the current problems faced in the Agriculture Industry in India can be tackled with the help of technology and making use of the available data. One such problem is the abundance of certain crops and the scarcity of others, often caused because the farmers do not have enough experience with trying out a variety of crops that might give better yield as compared to their existing choices that they have been planting on their lands for generations. We aim to help farmers in choosing the right crops to grow, by providing them with prospective results that they can look to achieve if they do invest in those crops on their farmland. We intend to achieve this by using a predictive model which learns trends for yield and therefore crop viability, using a factor called the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index or NDVI, which has proven to be a successful parameter in making crop related predictions in other regions across the world, for certain crops.

TI  - Geospatial analysis of September, 2019 floods in the lower gangetic plains of Bihar using multi-temporal satellites and river gauge data
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - During late September, 2019 Bihar was struggling with severe flooding problem, which otherwise is marked as a period of flood recession due to withdrawal of south-east monsoons. The present study assess the flood situation using Sentinel-1 SAR images and complements the understanding about the flood event using long term (2000-18) multi-temporal space based flood sensitive proxy indicators like precipitation (GPM), soil moisture (AMSR-2), vegetation condition (MODIS) together with ground based river gauge (CWC) data. The study reveals that in 2019 during the 39(th) week of the year (late September) the central and eastern parts of Bihar witnessed heavy precipitation (176 percent higher than average), leading to enhanced soil moisture build up (19 percent higher than average) and consequently triggering severe flooding. River Ganga was observed to be flowing above danger level for almost two weeks. Due to the prolonged submergence by floodwaters a significant drop was observed in the NDVI and EVI values of about 13.7 and 11.1 percent respectively from the normal. About 8.36 lakh ha area was observed to be inundated, impacting about 9.26 million population. Patna followed by Bhagalpur were the two worst affected districts with almost 30% and 36% of districts geographical area being flooded.

AB  - This manuscript presents the first-ever dataset made for supervised learning on reconstructing missing data in remotely sensed data. The types of noises present in this dataset are 1) Salt and pepper noise, caused by an error in transmission, analog-digital converter error, 2) The Landsat ETM + Scan Line Corrector (SLC)-of a problem, caused because of the poor performance of satellite sensors, cross-talk between sensors, etc. 3) Presence of thick clouds in its view due to poor atmospheric conditions. Usually, the remotely sensed data suffer an information loss because of satellite sensors' internal malfunction or poor atmospheric conditions such as thick clouds. Losing any pixel due to any external/internal error leads to a huge information loss in the images due to high spatial resolution and further tasks like detection, classification, segmentation, and many more to be applied to it. Therefore, it becomes an important task to regain the lost data before applying any other algorithm. This dataset contains a total of 21,080 images with a spatial resolution of 0.3m and 1.5m.

T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Geospatial methods play an important role in the identification, monitoring, assessment, and conservation of groundwater resources. An integrated approach combining the geospatial techniques and multi-influencing factors (MIF) was adapted for the determination of potential groundwater zone in the Purulia District of West Bengal, Eastern India. The present groundwater is underexploited for agricultural and other activities. This study would also benefit in identifying the artificial recharge zone for further research and developmental activity in the region. The important parameters including slope, landuse/cover, lineament, drainage, geology, and soil affecting potential groundwater occurrence were generated from Topo Maps, Landsat remote sensing imagery, and various ancillary data. Various thematic layers were allocated a fixed score as weightage using MIF technique. Thereafter, the weighted layers were statistically computed in the overlay analysis to generate the groundwater prospect map. The groundwater potential map demonstrated five zones, viz. very good (13.8%), good (34.9%), moderate (48.3%), poor (2.8%), and very poor (0.2%). The findings of the research study would enable to carry out future research and propose effective planning and management of groundwater development.

T2  - 2021 7TH ASIA-PACIFIC CONFERENCE ON SYNTHETIC APERTURE RADAR (APSAR)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 7th Asia-Pacific Conference on Synthetic Aperture Radar (APSAR)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has immense potential in estimating soil moisture with high-resolution imaging capability and cloud independent acquisition ability. Nevertheless, estimation of soil moisture under vegetation cover is a challenging task. Notably, existing literature used ancillary data sources, such as optical data, to segregate the vegetation contribution in the backscatter. In this study, we propose a new Ground Range Detected (GRD) radar vegetation index for dual-pol data, DpRVIc that overcomes the typical shortcomings (such as cloud cover, asynchronous observations and saturation effect for denser canopies) associated with different optical data derived indices. This proposed descriptor jointly utilizes the copol purity of the wave and normalized co-pol intensity parameter. We then use this index in the Water Cloud Model to estimate soil moisture over croplands. Furthermore, the performance of DpRVIc is compared with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) by utilizing the simulated NISAR L-band dual-pol data (VV-VH, HH-HV) over a Canadian test site. The proposed method has proven to be a potential alternative to synergetic approaches with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) ranging from 5.6% to 6.0% with DpRVIc as a vegetation descriptor. Thus, the proposed vegetation descriptor provides new insights to quantify the vegetation using dual-pol GRD SAR data. Further, the adapted soil moisture technique has opened up a new avenue for soil moisture estimation using dual-pol GRD SAR data in the presence of vegetation.

T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization poses a significant challenge for achieving sustainable utilization of land resources, especially in coastal, arid, and semi-arid areas. Timely monitoring of soil salt content and its spatial distribution is conducive to secure efficient agricultural development in these regions. In this study, to address the persistent problem of soil salinization in the Yellow River Delta in China, the feature space method was used to construct multiple feature spaces of surface albedo (Albedo)-modified soil-adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI), salinity index (SI)-Albedo, and SI-normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and an optimal inversion model of soil salinity was developed. Based on Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) image data and simultaneous field-measured sampling data, an optimal model from 2015 to 2019 was used to obtain the soil salt content in the region at a 30 m resolution. The results show that the proportion of soil salinization in 2015 and 2019 was approximately 76% and 70%, respectively, and overall soil salinization showed a downward trend. The salinization-mitigated areas are primarily distributed in the southwest of the Yellow River Delta, and the aggravated areas are distributed in the northeast and southeast. In general, the spatial variation characteristics show an increasing trend from the southwest to the eastern coastal areas, corresponding to the formation mechanism of salt accumulation in the region. Further, corresponding sustainable development countermeasures and suggestions were proposed for different salinity levels. Meanwhile, this study revealed that the SI-Albedo feature space model is the most suitable for inversion of salinization in coastal areas.

T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge about frequency and location of snow avalanche activity is essential for forecasting and mapping of snow avalanche hazard. Traditional field monitoring of avalanche activity has limitations, especially when surveying large and remote areas. In recent years, avalanche detection in Sentinel-1 radar satellite imagery has been developed to improve monitoring. However, the current state-of-the-art detection algorithms, based on radar signal processing techniques, are still much less accurate than human experts. To reduce this gap, we propose a deep learning architecture for detecting avalanches in Sentinel-1 radar images. We trained a neural network on 6345 manually labeled avalanches from 117 Sentinel-1 images, each one consisting of six channels that include backscatter and topographical information. Then, we tested our trained model on a new synthetic aperture radar image. Comparing to the manual labeling (the gold standard), we achieved an F1 score above 66%, whereas the state-of-the-art detection algorithm sits at an F1 score of only 38%. A visual inspection of the results generated by our deep learning model shows that only small avalanches are undetected, whereas some avalanches that were originally not labeled by the human expert are discovered.

TI  - Assessment of land use and land cover changes in association with hydrometeorological parameters in the Upper Indus Basin
T2  - JOURNAL OF HIMALAYAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Upper Indus river basin (UIB) is not only significant because of its freshwater supply for agriculture and hydropower electricity generation but also for its contribution to maintaining ecosystem services. Land cover and land-use changes (LULC) are linked to socio-economic, and local climatic and hydrological conditions. Annual LULC changes in the UIB between 2001 and 2016 are studied using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land cover product. The LULC data from MODIS is correlated to ground-based runoff (1984-2016), precipitation and temperature data (1960-2016). Mann Kendall and Pearson's correlation tests are used for data analysis. The overall accuracy of the MODIS land product is 87% with the kappa coefficient value of 0.82. The mainland cover types in terms of area coverage are barren land 53%, grassland 31% and permanent snow and ice 15%. Vegetation like forestland, grassland, cropland and savanna increased significantly during the period of observation. Most of the barren land is replaced by permanent snow and ice and a reduction was observed from 55.29% in 2001 to 52.78% in 2016. On the other hand, annual total precipitation and annual river flow exhibit significant increasing trends while the annual mean temperature was observed to be slightly increasing. A strong correlation exists between snow and icecovered area, vegetation and annual total precipitation. These results might be helpful to the concerned departments dealing with land planning, climate change, water resources and power generation.

T2  - WISDOM
M3  - Article
AB  - For understanding Y. Pluzhnyk's poetry in the context of modern discourse, it is valuable to study the content of his lyrics in light of intertextual connections, which are presented in the article at the formal and semantic levels. It was determined that different intertextual forms reveal a functional dependence on the purpose underlying their introduction into the text by Y. Pluzhnyk (the illustrative charge, contrast, thought reinforcement, delimiting observation, accumulation, etc.). The active use of various folkloric, mythological, artistic, and philosophical reminiscences transmits a distinctive repulsion from a known pattern for the sake of a new creative result.

AB  - Wildfires burn millions of hectares of land every year globally. Most of them are caused by humans, while only 10-15% occur naturally due to the climate change. The hotter weather dries out forests and plants, making them more prone to fire. The "frontline wildfire defense" has fully utilized satellite imagery to monitor, map, and control the fire spread and damage. However, there are three major challenges of using traditional satellite data: (1) the spatial resolution, (2) the temporal resolution, and (3) the downlink and analyzing data on the ground. In recent technology, the satellites are developed into small-size CubeSats that supporting the resolution issues. By exploiting the deep learning (DL) technique, the CubeSat can become sufficiently "intelligent" to detect wildfire events. This paper discusses a potential approach for implementing a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) onboard a CubeSat to sense wildfire. The DL model has been tested on the Camera Controller Board (CCB) embedded with Raspberry Pi Compute Module (RPi CM3+), that interfacing with the imaging mission of a 6U CubeSat named KITSUNE. In addition, the space environment test of radiation Total Ionizing Dose (TID) with functional tests of the board has been discussed. The results have shown no anomaly observed on the RPi while the DL model achieved a 94% overall accuracy with 16 minutes of learning time and 32 seconds of classification time. Hence, the state-of-art processing images onboard CubeSat will improve the valuable downlink data as the limited time window passes through the ground station.

M3  - research-article
AB  - Organic view is the original form of human thinking that sought to pursue higher humanity based on the recognition of the relationship with nature. In organic theory, nature is a process of constant creation, and humans are perceived as equal creations participating in this process. Nature and humans become two and one, and the whole life is accepted as harmonizing and negotiating with each other. In literature, organic theory is a perspective that sees literary works as an independent entity like an organism, and it can be said to be a frame to explain the process, form, value, and history of literature. The organic view that ‘New-Criticism’ constitutes a completed life in the process of integrating the part as an element into the whole is inherited and developed.Kim Jong-Gil is an English-American literary scholar who has grown up in the Confucian tradition and has an academic basis for ‘New-Criticism’, so it is difficult to clarify where his organic view is based. However, since the time to accept the critical premise and standard of ‘New-Criticism’ and the time to establish a new poem while criticizing its difficulties appears as the difference between the first and the second poetic collection, it is inductively more dominant organic theory. In this article, I reviewed the aspect of Kim Jong-gilmaterializing his organic theory into poetics and the process of building his own worldview.

AB  - This paper sets a viewpoint of Necro-politics in order to re-read her later work A Very Old Joke. It can be said that her novels use death to deal with the aspect of the physical synchronization with life and death and the political dynamics that continuously reconstructs the two states.Park's novels and writings resulted from an endless impulse to interpret the slaughter she experienced as a non-national during the Korean War and the shameful death of her close relatives. Passing through the Cold War order that constantly produced ‘dishonorable death’ and the industrial era with the twined order, Park's novels cultivate a worldview that describes the body, in which death is embodied, as a gender differentiated spatial experience.This paper aims to examine such aspects in the context of her ‘novel history,’ and by doing so, argue that her novels tear down the strictly partitioned boundary between life and death and show a form of subjectivity that is reconstructed into an affective system of death.

TI  - Characterizing the Urban Decadal Expansion and Its Morphology Using Integrated Spatial Approaches in Semi-Arid Mountainous Environment, Saudi Arabia
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban sprawl and increasing population pose a significant problem for sustainable development of cities. The present research focuses on analyzing urban growth and spatial patterns in Abha and its surrounding cities of Asir region of Saudi Arabia during the period 1990-2018. Landsat satellite data used to prepare LULC maps for the years 1990, 2000 and 2018 using maximum likelihood supervised classification. The study uses a combined approach of several spatial, urban metrics and landscape expansion index to quantify the growth patterns, expansion approaches and spatial extent of urban areas. A massive increase of +389% in built-up area is observed over temporal scale under investigation. The conversion of the natural landscape to built-up is observed as the leading cause of urbanization. It is found that the outlying method of urban expansion is the most dominant, followed by edge-expansion and infill. Spatial metrics show dispersion at the outlying and accumulation in the centre. It was observed that rate and intensity of urban expansion and sprawl is recorded to be higher during 2000-2018 in comparison to 1990-2000. Assessing land-use changes and urbanization growth trends using integrated spatial approaches are helpful in planning and resource management in the region for the present and future.

TI  - Exploring the Suitability of UAS-Based Multispectral Images for Estimating Soil Organic Carbon: Comparison with Proximal Soil Sensing and Spaceborne Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a variable of vital environmental significance in terms of soil quality and function, global food security, and climate change mitigation. Estimation of its content and prediction accuracy on a broader scale remain crucial. Although, spectroscopy under proximal sensing remains one of the best approaches to accurately predict SOC, however, spectroscopy limitation to estimate SOC on a larger spatial scale remains a concern. Therefore, for an efficient quantification of SOC content, faster and less costly techniques are needed, recent studies have suggested the use of remote sensing approaches. The primary aim of this research was to evaluate and compare the capabilities of small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) for monitoring and estimation of SOC with those obtained from spaceborne (Sentinel-2) and proximal soil sensing (field spectroscopy measurements) on an agricultural field low in SOC content. Nine calculated spectral indices were added to the remote sensing approaches (UAS and Sentinel-2) to enhance their predictive accuracy. Modeling was carried out using various bands/wavelength (UAS (6), Sentinel-2 (9)) and the calculated spectral indices were used as independent variables to generate soil prediction models using five-fold cross-validation built using random forest (RF) and support vector machine regression (SVMR). The correlation regarding SOC and the selected indices and bands/wavelengths was determined prior to the prediction. Our results revealed that the selected spectral indices slightly influenced the output of UAS compared to Sentinel-2 dataset as the latter had only one index correlated with SOC. For prediction, the models built on UAS data had a better accuracy with RF than the two other data used. However, using SVMR, the field spectral prediction models achieved a better overall result for the entire study (log(1/R), RPD = 1.40; R-CV(2) = 0.48; RPIQ = 1.65; RMSEPCV = 0.24), followed by UAS and then Sentinel-2, respectively. This study has shown that UAS imagery can be exploited efficiently using spectral indices.

TI  - Exploring the Relationship between River Discharge and Coastal Erosion: An Integrated Approach Applied to the Pisa Coastal Plain (Italy)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal erosion coupled with human-induced pressure has severely affected the coastal areas of the Mediterranean region in the past and continues to do so with increasing intensity today. In this context, the Pisa coastal plain shows a long history of erosion, which started at the beginning of the nineteenth century. In this work, shoreline positions derived from historical maps as well as airborne and DGPS (Differential Global Positioning System) surveys were analyzed in a GIS (Geographic Information System) environment to identify the main changes that have occurred in the last 142 years. These analyses were compared with 100 years of discharge data measured at the S. Giovanni alla Vena gauge to identify a possible correlation between the two sets of information. Finally, Sentinel-2 and Landsat images were studied to identify the dispersion of sediments transported by the Arno River. In particular, we found a minimum of fluvial discharge in the years 1954, 1978, and 2012 corresponding to a peak of erosion, while the reduced erosion rate and the fluvial discharge increased in the years 1928-1944, 1954-1975, and after 2012. The qualitative anticorrelation between discharge and erosion is particularly true if we take into account flood events with a value of discharge greater than 700 m(3)/s, which are those able to transport suspended sand. The remote sensing analyses of Sentinel-2 images acquired during the floods of 6 February 2019 and 3 December 2019, under the most typical wind and sea state conditions for this area (wind coming from SW and storms coming from W/SW and SW) show that during these events a consistent amount of sediment was transported by the river. However, the majority of these sediments are not deposited along the coastline but are dispersed offshore. Grain-size analyses on the transported sediment show that plumes are formed by coarse-to-medium sand, suitable for coastal nourishment, but the reconstructed sediment dispersion lines show that some sectors of the coastline are constantly in the shade. These areas are the most affected by erosion.

T2  - ANNALS OF GIS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes a spatial search and a three-level model-based approach for automatic extraction of surface water layers from Sentinel-1 C-band SAR images at 10 m spatial resolution. The technique incorporates a connected component spatial search for segmenting low backscatter regions and uses the segmented image object for characterizing the segments. The water body is described here as a collection of different spatially connected segments. A three-level model is used to describe the connected segments of a water body in SAR data. Noise tolerance is achieved in this method by incorporating a speckle noise level into the model. The segmentation process further calculates contextual information which includes shadow estimated from DEM, polarization angle of the segment, and a boundary co-occurrence in both polarization to qualify the detected segments as a water body. The proposed method is found to have an accuracy of 94% in terms of f1 score. The algorithm, estimation of different parameters, and the results obtained in selected regions are explained in this paper.

TI  - Predicting the Presence of Leptospires in Rodents from Environmental Indicators Opens Up Opportunities for Environmental Monitoring of Human Leptospirosis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leptospirosis, an environmental infectious disease of bacterial origin, is the infectious disease with the highest associated mortality in Seychelles. In small island territories, the occurrence of the disease is spatially heterogeneous and a better understanding of the environmental factors that contribute to the presence of the bacteria would help implement targeted control. The present study aimed at identifying the main environmental parameters correlated with animal reservoirs distribution and Leptospira infection in order to delineate habitats with highest prevalence. We used a previously published dataset produced from a large collection of rodents trapped during the dry and wet seasons in most habitats of Mahe, the main island of Seychelles. A land use/land cover analysis was realized in order to describe the various environments using SPOT-5 images by remote sensing (object-based image analysis). At each sampling site, landscape indices were calculated and combined with other geographical parameters together with rainfall records to be used in a multivariate statistical analysis. Several environmental factors were found to be associated with the carriage of leptospires in Rattus rattus and Rattus norvegicus, namely low elevations, fragmented landscapes, the proximity of urbanized areas, an increased distance from forests and, above all, increased precipitation in the three months preceding trapping. The analysis indicated that Leptospira renal carriage could be predicted using the species identification and a description of landscape fragmentation and rainfall, with infection prevalence being positively correlated with these two environmental variables. This model may help decision makers in implementing policies affecting urban landscapes and/or in balancing conservation efforts when designing pest control strategies that should also aim at reducing human contact with Leptospira-laden rats while limiting their impact on the autochthonous fauna.

T2  - Uttar Pradesh Journal of Zoology
M3  - Article
AB  - Birds including house sparrows and house crows have always been considered as ecosystem indicators reflecting the health of the environment. Complete absence of a species (that was previously abundant) is not desirable from the ecologist's point of view. Anthropogenic activities like urbanization and deforestation have peaked in recent years resulting in the loss of biodiversity. This is not solely linked to the number of species but also the interactions among them that shapes up the ecosystem. The current study focuses on the sudden disappearance of house sparrows and house crows. The study area chosen was Chinsurah, West Bengal, India, as the place has undergone rapid urban growth in the last two decades with simultaneous erosion of the sparrow and crow populations. The urban sprawl of Chinsurah in the past few years was studied using satellite imagery data (from Google earth) and Landsat data (from GLCF) captured on a temporal scale. The study area was surveyed for documenting the preferable habitats of birds where they were found roosting. A comparative study of the architecture of the old and new/renovated buildings shows that buildings with modern designs lack suitable nesting sites. In addition, the loss of tree cover deprives the birds of their foraging grounds. Bird species like common myna, greater coucal, Indian treepie, black drongo and black kite have been observed living close to human settlements in the study area. They are known to exert predatory and/or competition pressures on house sparrows and house crows. Other factors affecting the sparrow and crow populations were also investigated. The declining bird species seems to affect the urban ecosystem by causing shifts in ecological balance. This can, however, be minimized by considering the ecological factors while planning urban expansion. Therefore, future studies should not be aimed solely to conserve the biodiversity but also to preserve the ecosystem balance and prevent the loss of another species through sustainable urban growth.

AB  - The rise of neural networks has opened the door for automatic analysis of remote sensing data. A challenge to using this machinery for computational sustainability is the necessity of massive labeled data sets, which can be cost-prohibitive for many non-profit organizations. The primary motivation for this work is one such problem; the efficient management of invasive species - invading flora and fauna that are estimated to cause damages in the billions of dollars annually. As an ongoing collaboration with the New York Natural Heritage Program, we consider the use of unsupervised deep learning techniques for dimensionality reduction of remote sensing images, which can reduce sample complexity for downstream tasks and decreases the need for large labeled data sets. We consider spatially augmenting contrastive learning by training neural networks to correctly classify two nearby patches of a landscape as such. We demonstrate that this approach improves upon previous methods and naive classification for a large-scale data set of remote sensing images derived from invasive species observations obtained over 30 years. Additionally, we simulate deployment in the field via active learning and evaluate this method on another important challenge in computational sustainability - landcover classification - and again find that it outperforms previous baselines.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POPULATION DATA SCIENCE (IJPDS)
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionThe ability to estimate risk of multimorbidity will provide valuable information to patients and primary care practitioners in their preventative efforts. Current methods for prognostic prediction modelling are insufficient for the estimation of risk for multiple outcomes, as they do not properly capture the dependence that exists between outcomes.ObjectivesWe developed a multivariate prognostic prediction model for the 5-year risk of diabetes, hypertension, and osteoarthritis that quantifies and accounts for the dependence between each disease using a copula-based model.MethodsWe used data from the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN) from 2009 onwards, a collection of electronic medical records submitted by participating primary care practitioners across Canada. We identified patients 18 years and older without all three outcome diseases and observed any incident diabetes, osteoarthritis, or hypertension within 5-years, resulting in a large retrospective cohort for model development and internal validation (n=425,228). First, we quantified the dependence between outcomes using unadjusted and adjusted phi coefficients. We then estimated a copula-based model to quantify the non-linear dependence between outcomes that can be used to derive risk estimates for each outcome, accounting for the observed dependence. Copula-based models are defined by univariate models for each outcome and a dependence function, specified by the parameter theta. Logistic regression was used for the univariate models and the Frank copula was selected as the dependence function.ResultsAll outcome pairs demonstrated statistically significant dependence that was reduced after adjusting for covariates. The copula-based model yielded statistically significant theta parameters in agreement with the adjusted and unadjusted theta coefficients. Our copula-based model can effectively be used to estimate trivariate probabilities.DiscussionQuantitative estimates of multimorbidity risk inform discussions between patients and their primary care practitioners around prevention in an effort to reduce the incidence of multimorbidity.

CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing for Agriculture, Ecosystems, and Hydrology XXIII

AB  - Cover crop in olive orchards is an increasingly applied soil and water conservation strategy, supported by European policies due to its multiple environmental benefits. To quantify these benefits, supervise and encourage the adoption of this practice, robust and affordable monitoring indicators of the cover crop dynamic and its biomass are required. This work represents the first attempt to estimate the biomass produced by olive grove cover crops based on remotely sensed data and an adaptation of the Monteith efficiencies approach. Ten olive tree fields were selected, distributed in three zones of Southern Spain. They comprised a high environmental variability and differed in the herbaceous layer management: cover crop in strips; non-tillage without strips (full coverage); and conventional tillage. An adaptation of the LUE (Light Use Efficiency)-model was applied to estimate Net Primary Production (NPP) using meteorological and Sentinel-2 data and subtracting the contribution of the wooded vegetation from the ground spectral response. The results showed an uneven adjustment in different fields. RMSD was equal to 650 kg ha-1, with an MBD of -17 kg ha-1, indicating a moderately high error (around 39%) but not too much bias. This error suggests that the model requires further refining, including the adjustment of model parameters to better represent this agrosystem. However, the evolution of biomass accumulation throughout the cover crop growing season and the behaviour of the daily biomass production provided interesting keys about the cover crops' phenology and management, supporting the discrimination between management practices.

TI  - Exploring Multiple Perspectives in Citizenship Education with a Serious Game
T2  - INTERACTIVE STORYTELLING, ICIDS 2021

CP  - 14th International Conference on Interactive Digital Storytelling (ICIDS)
CL  - Tallinn Univ, Tallinn, ESTONIA
AB  - Within citizenship education, a new focus is being laid upon what is expected of citizens within a diverse and lightning-fast society: more emphasis is placed on teaching students how to understand and respect other people's opinions, regardless of how they may contrast with one's own. However, learning to be tolerant with others' viewpoints comes with hurdles, as currently it is quite easy to become stuck within one's own worldview. We developed Diermocratie, an in-classroom game aimed at encouraging a more open conversation, which breaks through these hurdles and addresses key competencies such as empathy and argumentation. By role-playing metaphors that parallel real-world events, students explore their own predispositions, are made aware of the perspectives of others, and are enabled to discuss issues objectively. From a preliminary evaluation, most students could identify the parallelism between the in-game metaphor and real-world situations. They also indicated that the game motivates them to further talk to each other, approaching sensitive topics among them.

TI  - H9c2 Cardiomyocytes under Hypoxic Stress: Biological Effects Mediated by Sentinel Downstream Targets.
T2  - Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The association between diabetes and cardiovascular diseases is well known. Related diabetes macro- and microangiopathies frequently induce hypoxia and consequently energy failure to satisfy the jeopardized myocardium basal needs. Additionally, it is widely accepted that diabetes impairs endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity, resulting in diminished nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and consequent endothelial cell dysfunction. In this study, we analyzed the embryonic heart-derived H9c2 cell response to hypoxic stress after administration of a high glucose concentration to reproduce a condition often observed in diabetes. We observed that 24h hypoxia exposure of H9c2 cells reduced cell viability compared to cells grown in normoxic conditions. Cytotoxicity and early apoptosis were increased after exposure to high glucose administration. In addition, hypoxia induced a RhoA upregulation and a Bcl-2 downregulation and lowered the ERK activation observed in normoxia at both glucose concentrations. Furthermore, a significant cell proliferation rate increases after the 1400W iNOS inhibitor administration was observed. Again, hypoxia increased the expression level of myogenin, a marker of skeletal muscle cell differentiation. The cardiomyocyte gene expression profiles and morphology changes observed in response to pathological stimuli, as hypoxia, could lead to improper ventricular remodeling responsible for heart failure. Therefore, understanding cell signaling events that regulate cardiac response to hypoxia could be useful for the discovery of novel therapeutic approaches able to prevent heart diseases.

TI  - MYSTICISM AND FREEDOM Alois Dempf's Critique of Alfred Rosenberg's Interpretation of Mysticism
T2  - STUDIES IN SPIRITUALITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the first half of the twentieth century, a broad intellectual debate about the meaning of mysticism emerged. This debate also has major political consequences. For the national socialist Alfred Rosenberg in particular, mysticism represents a holistic alternative to a Christian interpretation of reality and thus underpins the naturalistic worldview of national socialism. The German Catholic philosopher Alois Dempf, through his studies of mysticism, aims to show precisely that this worldview cannot be legitimized by reference to mysticism at all. Dempf is a somewhat forgotten thinker with an impressive body of work. In the 1930s he was at the center of the debate about a Christian philosophy. In the discussion about mysticism he sees the battlefield on which the new ideologies of the time can be fought. This contribution describes this debate and also brings out its current relevance for the discussion of holism and naturalism.

TI  - A Trainable Spectral-Spatial Sparse Coding Model for Hyperspectral Image Restoration
T2  - ADVANCES IN NEURAL INFORMATION PROCESSING SYSTEMS 34 (NEURIPS 2021)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 35th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Hyperspectral imaging offers new perspectives for diverse applications, ranging from the monitoring of the environment using airborne or satellite remote sensing, precision farming, food safety, planetary exploration, or astrophysics. Unfortunately, the spectral diversity of information comes at the expense of various sources of degradation, and the lack of accurate ground-truth "clean" hyperspectral signals acquired on the spot makes restoration tasks challenging. In particular, training deep neural networks for restoration is difficult, in contrast to traditional RGB imaging problems where deep models tend to shine. In this paper, we advocate instead for a hybrid approach based on sparse coding principles that retains the interpretability of classical techniques encoding domain knowledge with handcrafted image priors, while allowing to train model parameters end-to-end without massive amounts of data. We show on various denoising benchmarks that our method is computationally efficient and significantly outperforms the state of the art. (1)

TI  - DIFFERENCES IN THE PSYCHOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF HIGHER AND SECONDARY PHARMACY EDUCATION STUDENTS
T2  - Farmatsiya (Moscow)
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction. For a long time, the boundary between higher and secondary pharmacy education specialists has been increasingly blurred. The requirements for the positions and functions of higher and secondary education pharmacists are largely similar. However, there are differences in the level of education, acquired competencies, social and cultural environment, motivation, worldview, etc., the study of which can be the basis for optimizing personnel policy in both the training of pharmacy personnel and for managing the latter in pharmaceutical organizationsObjective: to study differences in the psychological characteristics of students going into higher and secondary professional pharmacy education.Material and methods. The data from four questionnaires, such as Motivation questionnaire, the Shmishek-Leonhard characterological questionnaire, the Cattell questionnaire, and dynamic properties questionnaire (proposed by Rusalov) were taken to study 42 students in specialty 33.05.01 Pharmacy (higher education pharmacists) and 107 students in specialty 33.02.01 Pharmacy (secondary education pharmacists). The results of statistical data processing of questionnaire scores were studied using the Mann-Whitney U test in the IBM SPSS Statistics program.Results. The similarities and statistically significant differences were identified by 11 criteria for the psychological characteristics of higher and secondary pharmacy education students.Conclusion. The higher pharmacy education students are more oriented to theory, a systematic logical description of the world, more self-restrained, rational, and psychologically rigid, and also with their high intellectual activity, they have an average physical activity level. The secondary pharmacy education students are more oriented to relationships between people, are more emotionally and psychologically mobile, they are oriented to the norms of behavior of the group of people around them, to the activities according to the plan, they are pedantic in work, are more eager for physical activity, and have a high speed in manual labor.

TI  - EDUCATIONAL ASPECTS OF RUSSIAN-CHINESE DIALOGUE IN THE CONTEXT OF INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION
T2  - REVISTA ON LINE DE POLITICA E GESTAO EDUCACIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The article reveals the appearance and development of the educational aspects of the Russian-Chinese dialogue in the context of relations between Russia and China in recent years. The analysis is based on bilateral analytical documents from "Russia-China Dialogue: Model 2015" to "Russia-China Dialogue: Model 2020", which cover the educational aspects of cooperation. The analysis has shown that possessing the equal opportunities of the established Russian-Chinese humanitarian areas, Chinese and Russian experts note not only the positive aspects of the implementation of the program but also the problems that arise at the worldview level, at a time having justified the results of cooperation and its prospects. This is facilitated by the principle of determinism, historical and integrative approaches, and phenomenological and comparatives analyses.

AB  - Monitoring of land cover and land use is crucial in natural resources management. Automatic visual mapping can carry enormous economic value for agriculture, forestry, or public administration. Satellite or aerial images combined with computer vision and deep learning enable precise assessment and can significantly speed up change detection. Aerial imagery usually provides images with much higher pixel resolution than satellite data allowing more detailed mapping. However, there is still a lack of aerial datasets made for the segmentation, covering rural areas with a resolution of tens centimeters per pixel, manual fine labels, and highly publicly important environmental instances like buildings, woods, water, or roads.Here we introduce LandCover.ai (Land Cover from Aerial Imagery) dataset for semantic segmentation. We collected images of 216.27 km(2) rural areas across Poland, a country in Central Europe, 39.51 km(2) with resolution 50 cm per pixel and 176.76 km(2) with resolution 25 cm per pixel and manually fine annotated four following classes of objects: buildings, woodlands, water, and roads. Additionally, we report simple benchmark results, achieving 85.56% of mean intersection over union on the test set. It proves that the automatic mapping of land cover is possible with a relatively small, cost-efficient, RGB-only dataset. The dataset is publicly available at https://landcover.ai/

TI  - Earth observation method for an operational assessment of crop phenology metric "start of the season"
T2  - ITALIAN JOURNAL OF AGROMETEOROLOGY-RIVISTA ITALIANA DI AGROMETEOROLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation phenology is one of the key indicators for assessing inter annual changes of ecosystems while crop phenology has crucial and practical importance for precise timing of farming practices of today's smart agriculture. The aim of this study is to develop and implement a procedure for filtering and processing daily satellite signals from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellites for the operational derivation of vegetation indices and land surface phenology (LSP) metrics. Second, this work investigates and selects precisely adjusted parameters for the calculation of a specific LSP metric - the SOS (start of the season). The SOS obtained from the satellite data was compared with available in situ ground measurements at 80 sites with records from 2000-2012 across the Czech Republic. The coefficients of determination, R2, for the land surface phenology based on Earth observation and traditional ground phenology indicated differences between the two methods. However, the average R2 at all sites for agricultural land was 0.31 for winter wheat onset of leaf sheath elongation; the R2 exceeded 0.5 at 21 sites and was approximately 0.7 at some sites. The developed procedure proved suitable for operational monitoring of actual crop conditions and other influence factors that are important for drought monitoring.

TI  - TanDEM-X Long-Term System Performance After 10 Years of Operation
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The TanDEM-X mission, formed by the TanDEM-X satellite in cooperation with its almost identical twin TerraSAR-X (TSX), has mainly been designed to acquire bistatic synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images of the Earth. Initiated in 2010, the primary mission objectives were to generate a global digital elevation model (DEM) to perform scientific measurements and to explore novel SAR techniques. Up to the present day, all these objectives have been completed with outstanding results. In addition, the satellites maintained a stable image quality from the start throughout their entire lifetime. The ground segment, which was tailored to the capabilities of the space segment, as well as an excellent design and manufacturing of the satellites were the key elements to achieve such a performance. In addition, the elaborate calibration concept and a careful treatment of the on-board resources enabled full operability up to the present day and allowed additional mission objectives such as the generation of a Change-DEM layer as an update to the global DEM. The stable bus and SAR payload performance as revealed by long-term system monitoring provide the basis for further extension of the TanDEM-X mission for several more years. In the following paper, these long-term system monitoring results are presented to provide an overview of the evolution of the radar system. The results and experience gained with more than a decade of TanDEM-X mission operation are a great value for both the scientific and commercial community and serve as a forerunner for the development of future SAR missions.

M3  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't
M3  - Review
AB  - The treatment of Melanoma, one of the most aggressive human malignancies, has been revolutionised by the advent of novel targeted and immuno-therapies. However, methods utilised to detect early presentations, and to stratify risk for patients diagnosed with invasive melanoma in the clinical setting are lagging. The primary prognostic indicator is restricted to Breslow Thickness, or depth the tumour invades into the dermis. Gene Expression Profiling (GEP), the analysis of molecular gene signatures of an individual tumour, has been implemented with great success in other malignancies, such as breast and prostate cancer. In the setting of melanoma, commercial GEP panels are becoming available, offering patients a personalised approach, though yet to enter widespread clinical use. This short perspective seeks to describe how GEP is currently employed in practice, and its current clinical impact. We also suggest the potential roles for GEP in meeting the key clinical challenges faced by clinicians in melanoma treatment, such as decisions around adjuvant therapy, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and surgical resection , thus highlighting areas for future potential research.

TI  - O.Apanovych: Evolution of the Views of the Ukrainian Soviet Historian in the Light of Her Intellectual Biography
T2  - UKRAINSKYI ISTORYCHNYI ZHURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This article reflects upon the formation of the Soviet/Postsoviet Ukrainian historian, Ukrainian cossaks researcher. There is a scientific challenge of an assessment of the soviet scientists contribution determination and thus the value of their scientific heritage. Despite Soviet ideological framework, the scientist managed to make a significant contribution towards the modern history and heritage protection activities. As O.Apanovych had been living during the rise and fall of the Soviet regime, her biography has a great value for analysis of the Soviet and Postsoviet times and their influence on gains and losses for the Ukrainian science. The objective of this article is the analyse the intellectual biography of O.Apanovych in its development as well as research on historians' daily routines in Soviet and Postsoviet regimes. During the research the methods of intellectual bibliography, which has allowed to demonstrate the change in views of the scientist through internal (psychological and views on values) and external (social, cultural, professional), were used. Conclusions. The evolution of O.Apanovych views has taken the place not only under the influence of 1920-2000s events but also were determined by her activity and family (including her brother Mykhailo), closest allies, colleagues-scientists. Prosopographical analysis shows that the most significant influence on O.Apanovych formation as a professional had K.Huslystui, F.Shevchenko, colleagues from the academic Institute of History Academy of Sciences of UkrSSR. Significant impact has been made by the 60th movement and dissidents. At the same time, due to the intellectual activities, critical assessment of the social-political life, she was herself an influencer. O.Apanovych became a non-conformist representative of the Ukrainian Soviet historians. During the independence times, due to active social and scientific activity was well regarded in the society.

TI  - Risk factors for positive sentinel lymph nodes in head and neck melanoma - a survival analysis
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction: Sentinel lymph node biopsy is the gold standard procedure for head and neck cutaneous melanoma staging.Objective: To evaluate the technical aspects, positivity and prognostic effect of the cervicofacial sentinel lymph node biopsy.Methods: Retrospective, unicentric study. From 2009 to 2014, 49 patients with cutaneous melanoma of the head and neck underwent surgery at Instituto do Cancer do Estado de Sao Paulo (ICESP).Results: Of the 49 patients, 5 had cervical metastasis at the moment of admission. Clark, Breslow and mitotic index were predictors of death. Among the 31 patients undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy, 3 had positive sentinel lymph nodes (9.7%). Deaths were recorded in two of the cases with positive sentinel lymph nodes (66.6%), and in 5 (17.8%) of the patients with negative lymph nodes. The mean Breslow index was 11.3 mm for primary melanomas with positive sentinel lymph nodes and 4.3 mm for those with negative sentinel lymph nodes. Positivity was associated with Clark and Breslow levels. Malar location showed a protective effect on prognosis. The mean survival for patients with a mitotic index <3.5 was 181 months and 63.4 months for those with a mitotic index >3.5.Conclusion: The frequency of positive sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with malignant melanoma of the head and neck was lower than in other studies, although the sample consisted of individuals with advanced melanomas. The mitotic index was important for prognosis prediction. (C) 2020 Associacao Brasileira de Otorrinolaringologia e Cirurgia Cervico-Facial. Published by Elsevier Editora Ltda.

TI  - LANGUAGE PERSONALITY OF VASYL STUS IN THE DISCOURSE DIMENSION
T2  - AD ALTA-JOURNAL OF INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the linguistic personality of the outstanding Ukrainian poet of the twentieth century, V. Stus, considering his verbal and artistic individuality, revealed both at the main and at intermediate levels of poetic speech in connection with contexts of various types. The textual-centered, ethnocentric, axiocentric, and discourse-centered concepts of the linguistic personality are analyzed - the modern scientific understanding of the linguistic personality and the creative factor's role in the formation. A complex method of discourse analysis has been introduced, which includes the component, distributive, contextological, contextual-interpretive, syntaxemic, and quantitative methods, as well as the semasiological procedure of field modeling. It has been established that the cultural and creative personality of V. Stus is shown at the phonosemantic, word-formation, lexical-semantic, and semantic-syntactic level of his poetic texts. It is explained that the originality of the poetic self-expression of the writer is in systemic connections with his scientific works. It was revealed that the phonosemantic level of the poet's motive is formed by paronymic attraction, leitmotif sound writing, and reprise of vowels and consonants, which create a perceptual background for the perception emotive. The poet's linguistic individuality is characterized by the word-formation level, reflecting the expansion of several names, the core of which are emosemes and seven times. The semantic group's keywords' repertoire is presented; they experience connotative enrichment in the verbal and non-verbal contexts. It is argued that the poet's linguistic creativity is supported by the philosophical, worldview, socio-cultural, historical, and psychological contexts.

AB  - Yeonjae(淵齋) Song Byeong-seon(宋秉璿, 1836-1905) was the ninth-generation descendant of Uam (尤庵) Song Si-yeol (宋時烈). During his lifetime, he gained the trust of Yu-rim(儒林) and was called to the court several times. However, he eventually refused an official] post and spent his life cultivating his studies in the wild. When the Eulsa Treaty(乙巳條約) was signed on November 17, Yeonjae pleaded with King Gojong about the abolition of the treaty. And on the morning of December 30, Yeon-jae committed suicide at his old house in Hoedeok(懷德). At this time, Yeon-jae sent the final appeal to the king, leaving a message to the king, the people, and Yu-rim about the restoration of national sovereignty, fulfilling his duties as a leader of Sarim(士林). After that, in 1962, Yeonjae was awarded the Order of Independence Medal of National Founding. Song Byeong-seon's excursions took place throughout his life. 22 long and short travelogues are existed today. The excursions were mainly done by land, so most of them rode horses or mules. He sometimes used floats or kilns. But he sometimes knew how to use the waterways effectively. This is because in some travel reports, routes using inland waterways and sea routes appear. The journey of the series continues all the way to finding the relics of his ancestors. In this process, it is clear that he reaffirmed its mission of succession to the family and promised to be a part of the brilliant feat of the ancestors. In addition, the reading of the scriptures and Neo-Confucian discussion were added to the excursions. His excursions continued as a means of publicizing and expanding the Neo-Confucian worldview. Thus, Yeonjae inherited the spirit of John Wangyangi(尊王攘夷) left by his ancestors, and finally raised the banner of Wijeongcheoksa(衛正斥邪) high. And he resolutely set out on the road to death for the country.

AB  - This paper analyzes China's worldview with the background of the theoretical differentiation that is taking place within the realist camp over the interpretation of rationality. Although realism shares the hypothesis of state, survival, and self-help, various realisms coexist due to differences in interpretation of rational behavior. Reasoning for rational behavior can be observed from the instrumental and value perspectives, or from the moral, traditional, and communicative perspectives. Although the interpretation of rationality is made in various aspects like this, realism generally assumes instrumental rationality as a hypothesis. Also, the instrumental interpretation of rationality leads to different conclusions when the results of actions are projected differently. It is typical that offensive realism and  structural  realism  offer  different  perspectives  on  the  outcome  of  the competition for hegemony.There have a strong tendency to rely on values or moral rationality rather than instruments in China. This tendency stems from the influence of Confucianism, which emphasized the moral order of the community. It can be inferred that China's realism, which tries to understand rationality morally, will be different from the existing realism that interprets rationality instrumentally. To prove this reasoning, this article analyzes the foreign policies established by China's political leaders and the rationality contained in these foreign policies. And based on this analysis, this paper explores the characteristics of Chinese realism.

TI  - Dynamics of mangrove ecosystem in the 'Bouche du Roy', a community of biodiversity in a conservation area of southwest Benin.
T2  - Geo-Eco-Trop
M3  - Article
AB  - Almost everywhere in the world, mangrove forest ecosystems are subject to anthropogenic degradation of all kinds and of various magnitudes. The spatio-temporal dynamics of mangrove ecosystems was analyzed from 2001 to 2019 on the classification of Landsat images by the maximum likelihood algorithm. The images were overlaid to obtain the transition matrix. Also, the field control was done for the verification of the results. It appears from this classification that the percentage of mangroves is 27.8% with an area of 2162.34 ha in 2019, while in 2001 the area was 2946.87 ha or 37.89%. This mangrove area has suffered a regression of nearly 10% or about 839.07 ha with an annual degradation rate of 44.16 ha / year with a conversion rate of -45.82% and the area of anthropized areas have on the other hand increased with an annual growth rate of 2.81%. It should be noted, however, that the regression of the mangrove is probably related to climate change but also to the cutting of mangroves following the search for firewood, which results in the occupation of this space by water whose area has increased significantly in 2019. Mangrove ecosystems provide several ecosystem services to the community. But the mitigation of ground temperatures of the mangrove ecosystem depends on the units of occupations adjacent to the plant formations.

AB  - This article will read the mode of sound shaping of Kim Yoo-jung’s novel “A Mountain Vagabond”(1933) and examine the author’s narrative strategy.As has been noted in prior research, “Sound” in Kim Yoo-jung’s novel is a device related to various aspects such as pansori, traditions such as Arirang, mediating devices for wound healing, style and locality, and aesthetic characteristics. Attention to the achievements of these prior studies, this article aims to find out that Kim Yoo-jung is using the effects of sound to maximize aesthetic effects at the narrative level, beyond just material dimensions.Among Kim Yu-jeong’s novels containing various sounds, “AMountain Vagabond” was chosen as the target text. This novel is his debut novel, and it is believed that the novel techniques and the direction of the writer’s worldview are clearly revealed.Reading the shape of the sound repeatedly appearing in the novel, it is assumed that the sound effect that drives this process of shaping was designed by the novel’s core investigative strategy.To this end, this article aims to begin discussions on the premise that the process of listening to sounds through literary imagination can be part of the novel’s structure.Author Kim Yoo-jung, ultimately, wants to find out how the characters are formed as “hearing communities” to give the community a role in conveying the effect of sound to the reader.

TI  - "CHRONICLE OF PRIEST DUKLYANIN" AS A LITERARY MONUMENT OF THE SOUTH SLAVIC LANDS
T2  - LINGUA MONTENEGRINA
M3  - Article
AB  - This article is devoted to the study of the work of an anonymous priest from Dukli of the XII century "Chronicle of priest Duklyanin", namely his Latin list, better known as "Gesta Regum Sclavorum". This article also analyzes the conceptual research of scientists who studied the Chronicle from the point of view of historical reliability, establishing the chronology of events, determining the sequence of the princely pedigree and the process of formation of the South Slavic states of the early Middle Ages. Of particular interest to linguistics and Literary Studies is its Latin translation, carried out in accordance with the canons of the medieval tradition. A comprehensive analysis of the Latin version allowed us to determine the features of the author's style and worldview ideas that reflect the philosophy of the then concepts and ideas. In particular, at the lexical level, the use of toponyms was recorded, which create an additional effect of historical truth and strengthen the poetic time space. The use of anthroponyms distinguishes legendary figures and reconstructs the princely lineage. Christian tokens for the designation of God and church attributes (hierarchy of ministers, holidays, names of monasteries and sacred books, etc.) play a significant role in the creation of religious space. Medieval theocentrism is most fully embodied by the author in the descriptions of Christian traditions and rites, the reproduction of verbal formulas and prayers, the desire to explain events from the perspective of God's Providence and Craft, in contrast to paganism to Christianity. An experienced author thoroughly knows the chronology of events, the history of the church, legends and myths of the region, which is reflected in the text of the Chronicle. The lack of vivid expressive means is provided for by the genre of the work, but the presence of existing ones indicates the skill of the chronicler and his innovations in medieval traditions.

T2  - PLANET CARE FROM SPACE
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Forest ecosystems have a crucial role for biodiversity conservation, providing a large set of ecosystem services. Understanding and assessing forest disturbance regimes on a large spatial and temporal scale is a prerequisite setting up sustainable forest management solutions. In this context, Remote Sensing is an efficient tool frequently used in land-use change detection. The present work is aimed at spatially estimating forest disturbing events occurred in Italy in the period 1985-2019. Using Landsat time series and the 3I3D forest disturbance detection algorithm, we analyzed "extreme" forest disturbance patterns and their evolution in the last 35 years. We found a total of 472 events, with the highest incidence (96) in the period 1990 - 1994. The accuracy of the 3I3D algorithm was estimated using a photo-interpreted dataset of nine random-sampled squared cells of 225 km2 each, distributed in the Italian region. Omission error for the 3I3D map ranged from a minimum of 37.43% to a maximum of 64.62% (mean value of 47.07%) while the commission error between 36.80% and 83.92%, with an average of 49.60%. Results suggest that occurrence of severe disturbance events do not seem to increase over time in the study period.

T2  - PLANET CARE FROM SPACE
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The Copernicus program has made publicly available data from several constellations of Earth Observation satellites. Among them, data from the Sentinel 2 (S2) constellation, available since autumn 2015, represent a useful information asset for medium-scale surveys (1:50000-1:25000 map scale). S2 technical features (geometric, spectral and temporal resolutions) make it a valuable support for several environmental applications involving land analysis/monitoring. In this framework, the Agriculture and Forestry Offices of the Piemonte Region (NW-Italy) administration, have supported a specific project named "Remote Sensing Piemonte" that was implemented by the CSI-Piemonte company with the scientific supervision of the Agro-Forestry Geomatics Research Group (GEO4Agri) of the University of Torino. The project was aimed at supporting technological transfer of Copernicus Sentinel 2 data and, in particular, at making not-skilled users closer to this type of technology. The final output was a freely accessible and usable web based service providing ready-to-use composite products with a regional coverage; namely: true and false colour RGB composites and monthly composite maps of spectral indices (NDVI, NDWI, EVI, NBR). These outputs can be accessed, navigated and queried by standard geo-services (WMS) or by a dedicated webGIS application, included the extraction of spectral indices temporal profiles. In this work, some case studies concerning possible exploitations of this type of service are exemplified with special concerns about operative issues that agro-forestry users (i.e. regional technicians, environmental agency, farmers, agricultural consortia, agricultural insurances companies and agronomist/foresters) can be interested in.

TI  - Mythopoetic Worldview of Bunin: Linguistic and Literary and Cultural Analysis Aspects
T2  - NAUCHNYI DIALOG
M3  - Article
AB  - The results of the analysis of semantic groups of mythonyms of the poetic heritage of I. A. Bunin as means of explication of various historical-informational and cultural-symbolic worldview meanings are presented in the article. The relevance of the work is due to the interest of literary onomastics in identifying units of the onomastic code of artistic and aesthetic systems of various domestic and foreign writers. The novelty of the work is associated with the inclusion of lexical units with different ratios of the nominated image and denotation into the Bunin mythonymicon. with the synthesis of linguistic and literary-cultural approaches in characterizing each of the selected lexical units. The twelve described semantic groups of mythological names are organized in the four of a field with a core and peripheral parts. For each group. the features of contextual use are noted. The authors come to the conclusion that in the Bunin picture of the world, mythonyms of various semantics perform text-forming and meaning-forming functions. They not only represent archetypal images (Fire. Bottom. Feminine, Garden. etc.), axiological oppositions (light - darkness, good - evil, etc.), key ideas. themes and motives (the idea of being still, themes of love. death, motives of temptation. resurrection. dreams, etc.), historiosophical concepts (moral choice and fortitude). but also participate in the creation of an individual author's myth.

T2  - FILOSOFIYA-PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. Considers the possibility of establishing the Hospitality Philosophy as an independent field of philosophical knowledge. Theoretical basis. Theoretical basis for this issue is the numerous philosophical researches on the topic of hospitality (anthropological, phenomenological, ethical, social-philosophical etc.) and the analysis of its essence and paradigmatic antinomy in the historical-philosophical way. Scientific novelty. The article attempts to revitalise the notion of philotechnics (phi iota lambda omicron tau epsilon chi nu iota alpha) as 'the art of taking care of the guest's welfare' as a possible basic concept of contemporary philosophy of hospitality, which is able to reflect its nature most concisely, including its utilitarian and extra-utilitarian functions - not only a high service level, but also a "humane" attitude towards the guest. Findings. It has been summarized that modern hospitality as a specific human activity needs its own philosophy, which would comprehensively analyze the concept, study the facets and forms of its manifestations, define the worldview paradigm, form a methodology and be able to lead to an understanding of the goals of hospitality, to orient modern hospitality models to achieve certain and clear quality indicators while respecting historically verified value constants.

TI  - THE POLISH-UKRAINIAN ALLIANCE OF 1920 IN THE POLISH PUBLIC DISCOURSE DURING THE INTERWAR PERIOD
T2  - SKHIDNOIEVROPEISKYI ISTORYCHNYI VISNYK-EAST EUROPEAN HISTORICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the research is to highlight the interaction of political thought and professional historiography, and its impact on the Polish-Ukrainian Alliance interpretation in the context of events of the historical process dynamics. We consider an integral part of our study to describe the discussions on Eastern policy in the Polish society before the conclusion of the alliance. The antagonism between the so-called federalist and incorporationist models, which was observed during the period beginning with the independent Polish Republic formation and ending in the Peace of Riga signing, determined the attitude to the Polish-Ukrainian Alliance of 1920 during the interwar period. The methodology of the research is based on one of the main methods - content analysis, hermeneutic and epistemological approaches, since a significant part of the sources comprises the press and political journalism. Analyzing the work with texts, the principles developed by Q. Skinner and J. Pocock are considered to be the key ones. Q. Skinner and J. Pocock noted the importance of the context and intellectual atmosphere understanding of the time of writing the text, as well as taking into account the author's planned recipient of the text. According to the method of the narrative analysis, elaborated by Jerzy Topolski, we single out three components in the texts analytically: logical and grammatical, persuasive, theoretical and ideological layers. We share the principle of relativity of the historical source concerning the knowledge and worldview of a historian. The scientific novelty consists in the following issue: in Ukrainian historiography a comprehensive analysis has been done on the material of the Polish public discourse of the interwar period concerning the attitude to the alliance with the Ukrainian People's Republic (UPR), which was concluded on the eve of Kyiv Offensive of 1920. The Conclusions. In the article it is stated that during the interwar period the Polish-Ukrainian Alliance of 1920 did not arouse significant interest both in the Polish public and among historians. Sometimes the alliance was mentioned in the politicians' memoirs, sometimes it was discussed by the publicists as one of the minor episodes of the Polish-Soviet War. It was written about the Polish-Ukrainian Alliance in general works on the history of Poland or researches on the borders formation after 1918 mainly. Taking into consideration the nature of these works, the Polish-Ukrainian Alliance was described superficially, focusing on the political aspects mainly, for example, Poland's recognition of Ukraine and border decisions. The genesis issue and various practical realizations of the Polish-Ukrainian cooperation were ignored. The interpretation of the alliance with the UPR depended on the author's political sympathies. J. Pilsudski's concepts supporters wrote about the alliance positively, and it was strongly criticized by supporters of the national democracy.

TI  - Learning Multi-Granularity Neural Network Encoding Image Classification Using DCNNs for Easter Africa Community Countries
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing scene classification is a fundamental responsibility of earth observation, aiming at identifying information granular for land cover classification. The multi-granular land use for multi-source remotely sensed image categories is now a principal task in remote sensing data augmentation and data selection. Understanding image representations are meaningful for the scene classification task. Training deep learning model-based approaches has to do with scene classification and brings about fantastic achievement. At the same time, these high-level approaches are computationally expensive and time-consuming. This paper introduces multi-granularity Neural Network Encoding architecture base on InceptionV3, InceptionReseNetV2, VGG16, and DenseNet201 architecture into remote sensing scene classification. To improve performance and to solve intra-class variation for multi-class scene issues remote sensing dataset. By using pre-trained CNN, activation function and ensemble learning have been adopting. InceptionV3 and VGG16 are used to extract features. InceptionResNetV2 use for fine-tuning, which consists of unfreezing the entre model and retraining the new data with a lower learning rate. The proposed fine-tune whole pre-trained model produces better results of test set up to 97.84 % than features extracted by InceptionResNetV2. Also, we use DCNNs ensemble average and weighted average to achieve better outcomes for 97.36% and 99.10%. In our experiments, we attempted to fine-tune the deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) training method for remote sensing scene classification on two public datasets UCM, SIRI-WHU, and one dataset I collected through the google earth engine from East Africa Community Countries (EACC) within nine classes within total 2112 labeled images. The results indicate that our proposed fine-tuning of the pre-trained model with few epochs and less computational time increases accuracy.

T2  - SOIL AND WATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in land use and land cover (LULC) are generally associated with environment pollution and the degradation of natural resources. Detecting LULC changes is essential to assess the impact on ecosystem services. The current research studies the impact of the LULC change on the soil loss and sediment export in a period of 43 years from 1972 to 2015. Landsat imageries were classified into five classes using a supervised classification method and the maximum likelihood Algorithm. Then, the sediment retention service for avoiding reservoir sedimentation was assessed using the InVEST SDR (integrated valuation of ecosystem services and trade-offs sediment delivery ratio) model. The results showed that the changes are very important in this study period (1972-2015). Forests were reduced by 18.72% and croplands were increased by approximately 54%. The InVEST SDR model simulation results reveal an increase in the sediment export and soil loss, respectively, from 1.68 to 5.57 t/ha/year and from 15.22 to 43.61 t/ha/year from the year 1972 to 2015. These results highlight the need for targeted policies on integrated land and water resource management. Then, it is important to improve the common understanding of land use and land cover dynamics to the different stakeholders. All these can help in projecting future changes in the LULC and to investigate more appropriate policy interventions for achieving better land and water management.

AB  - Time-Series Matrix (TSMx): A visualization tool for plotting multiscale temporal trends TSMx is an R script that was developed to facilitate multi-temporal-scale visualizations of time-series data. The script requires only a two-column CSV of years and values to plot the slope of the linear regression line for all possible year combinations from the supplied temporal range. The outputs include a time-series matrix showing slope direction based on the linear regression, slope values plotted with colors indicating magnitude, and results of a Mann-Kendall test. The start year is indicated on the y-axis and the end year is indicated on the x-axis. In the example below, the cell in the top-right corner is the direction of the slope for the temporal range 2001-2019. The red line corresponds with the temporal range 2010-2019 and an arrow is drawn from the cell that represents that range. One cell is highlighted with a black border to demonstrate how to read the chartthat cell represents the slope for the temporal range 2004-2014. This publication entry also includes an excel template that produces the same visualizations without a need to interact with any code, though minor modifications will need to be made to accommodate year ranges other than what is provided. TSMx for R was developed by Georgios Boumis; TSMx was originally conceptualized and created by Brad G. Peter in Microsoft Excel. This tool accompanies a publication in preparation by Peter et al. (forthcoming): Peter, B. G., Messina, J. P., Breeze, V., Fung, C., Kapoor, A., and Fan, P.

TI  - SPATIO-TEMPO L VARIATION IN BIOMARKER RESPONSES AND BIOCHEMICAL COMPOSITION IN THE FISH <i>Liza aurata</i> FROM THE GULF OF ANNABA (ALGERIA) RELATION WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the present study was to test two biomarkers ofof environmental stress glutathionc (GSH) and catalase (CAT), and to determine the main biochemical components (proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates) in the flesh of an edible fish, Liza au rata, associated with environmental pollution in the Gulf of Annaba (northeast Algeria). Samples were collected monthly (December 2011 to November 2012) from two different sites, Sidi Salem a polluted site and Hnaya as a control site. Obtained results revealed an increase in CAT activity and a decrease in GSH rate in fish from the polluted site (Sidi Salem) compared to the control site (Hnaya). The biochemical analysis revealed a significant decrease in protein, lipid and carbohydrate amounts in Sidi Salem comparatively to El Hnaya. In addition, the higher levels in biochemical components (protein, lipid and carbohydrate) are recorded in summer and the lower rates in winter at El Hnaya site, this is related to respectively the beginning and the end of the reproduction period. Thus, the difference noted between the two sites may be due to their pollution level. The level of pollution in Sidi Salem induced an oxidative stress associated with a mobilization of energetic metabolism for detoxification or for physiological processes such as 'owth or reproduction, Overall, obtained data indicate that L. aurata constitutes a useful tool as sentinel organisms for biomonitoring of aquatic pollution.

TI  - New Zealand indigenous Myrtaceae in foreign botanic gardens: testing the sentinel plant concept for biosecurity risk assessment
T2  - New Zealand Plant Protection
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of sentinel or expatriate plants is a growing concept for risk assessment in plant biosecurity. This approach involves ascertaining the presence and impact of pests and pathogens on plants foreign to a given location but planted in international botanic gardens or arboreta. The data obtained provide information on the potential pest status of these pests and pathogens, as invasive alien species (IAS), to plant species in their native or indigenous range. Assessment of the biosecurity threat from IAS for indigenous plants not found within the geographic distribution of these pests and pathogens is challenging, however, as they may be relatively taxonomically distinct from plants found in the distribution of the IAS and can be in different climates and environments. We examine the sentinel/expatriate concept in relation to risk assessment for myrtle rust (Austropuccinia psidii) on New Zealand Myrtaceae on these plants found in botanic gardens and arboreta outside New Zealand. Between September 2017 and September 2018, we identified and then contacted 65 botanic gardens or arboreta that putatively had New Zealand Myrtaceae and were within the known distribution of myrtle rust. We asked for information on the presence of New Zealand Myrtaceae species in their collections and whether these plants were infected by myrtle rust. Sixteen gardens/arboreta responded; most were in Australia or the United States. Only one of these gardens provided information that was useful for biosecurity risk assessment for myrtle rust on New Zealand Myrtaceae. The results are discussed in the context of plant biosecurity risk assessment and the broader sentinel/expatriate plant concept.

M3  - Article
AB  - The areas that do not constitute forest stands known also as forest gaps are one of the most frequently updated geometric elements on the Digital Forest Map. Field inventory of forest gaps is not an easy task taking into account their irregular shape, size, and random location within the forest compartments. In this research four types of multi-source and multi-resolution remote sensing data were evaluated as a geometry source in the process of forest gaps inventory. The analyses were conducted on 23 forest gaps which were vectorized by 28 independent testers. The 2567 polygons were collected in total what was the base to calculate the area errors taking into account the area classes based and the type of remote sensing data used in the research. It was found that data with a ground sample distance above 5 meters are suitable only for large forest gaps with an area of more than 45 a. The UAV true orthophoto mosaic are a good alternative to time-consuming field measurements and can be used for small forest gaps also. However the usage of UAV is associated with a significant load of computer resources and requires technical knowledge within field data capture and processing. The obtained results can be valuable guidance for digital forest map operators who are looking for new methods of determining the boundaries of forest gaps. Specific solutions were also proposed that can be implemented in the future in the matter of forest gaps inventory involving the remote sensing technology.

T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration is an indicator of algal biomass. The Sentinel 2 platform offers greatly improved spatial resolution over other satellite platforms designed for water based chl-a retrievals and includes a "red-edge" band at 704 nm not present on the Landsat 8 operational land imager. This study provides validation of an improved version of a well known semi-analytical chl-a retrieval algorithm. The algorithm is provided with several free image processing utilities and the improved approach can be implemented with minimal technology skills. The improved performance is the result of replacing a fixed chl-a specific absorption coefficient (a*) with a variable model. This method was applied to three Sentinel 2 images taken over the Lake Erie western basin correlating with an in-situ dataset of 24 samples where chl-a ranged from 1.89 mg m(-3) to 70.20 mg m(-3). The variable a* model produced chl-a retrievals with normalised root mean squared error of prediction (NRMSEP) = 7.5%, bias =-0.47 mg m(-3), coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.91 and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) = 0.90). This represented a 23% reduction in NRMSEP, an 85% reduction in bias and an increase in NSE of 7% over the default algorithm using a fixed a* value. Creation of chl-a retrieval algorithms that consider the variability in a* should result in algorithms that perform better against a wide range of chl-a concentrations and are less likely to require local recalibration. Obtaining accurate chl-a retrievals from a satellite platform with the spatial resolution of Sentinel 2 will allow satellite monitoring of many more inland waters than previously possible.

T2  - Open research Europe
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The necessity of sustainable development for landscapes has emerged as an important theme in recent decades. Current methods take a holistic approach to landscape heritage and promote an interdisciplinary dialogue to facilitate complementary landscape management strategies. With the socio-economic values of the "natural" and "cultural" landscape heritage increasingly recognised worldwide, remote sensing tools are being used more and more to facilitate the recording and management of landscape heritage. The advent of freeware cloud computing services has enabled significant improvements in landscape research allowing the rapid exploration and processing of satellite imagery such as the Landsat and Copernicus Sentinel datasets. This research represents one of the first applications of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) Python application programming interface (API) in studies of historic landscapes. The complete free and open-source software (FOSS) cloud protocol proposed here consists of a Python code script developed in Google Colab, which could be adapted and replicated in different areas of the world. A multi-temporal approach has been adopted to investigate the potential of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery to detect buried hydrological and anthropogenic features along with spectral index and spectral decomposition analysis. The protocol's effectiveness in identifying palaeo-riverscape features has been tested in the Po Plain (N Italy).

Current approaches take a holistic approach to landscape heritage and promote an interdisciplinary dialogue to facilitate complementary landscape management strategies. With the socio-economic values of the 'natural&rdquo; and 'cultural&rdquo; landscape heritage increasingly recognised worldwide, remote sensing tools are being used more and more to facilitate the recording and management of landscape heritage. Satellite remote sensing technologies have enabled significant improvements in landscape research. The advent of the cloud-based platform of Google Earth Engine has allowed the rapid exploration and processing of satellite imagery such as the Landsat and Copernicus Sentinel datasets. In this paper, the use of Sentinel-2 satellite data in the identification of palaeo-riverscape features has been assessed in the Po Plain, selected because it is characterized by human exploitation since the Mid-Holocene. A multi-temporal approach has been adopted to investigate the potential of satellite imagery to detect buried hydrological features along with Spectral Index and Spectral Decomposition analysis. This research represents one of the first applications of the GEE Python API in landscape studies.

Finally, the python code developed enables the analysis of the S2 filtered image collection through Spectral Index (SI) andSpectral Decomposition (SD) techniques.

AB  - This article offers an overview of Soren Kierkegaard's use in his early journals of a fictional figure called the Master-Thief [Mestertyven], a modern reinterpretation of the late medieval legend of Robin Hood. I would like to argue that this early treatment of medieval folklore in the Dane's Nachlass can be used as a point of departure or foundation upon which we might get a better appreciation of the crucial role played by myth in Kierkegaard's philosophy. An analysis of the figure of the Master-Thief will also reveal the way in which a myth from the Middle Ages was reinterpreted and integrated into a modern worldview.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Based upon two large randomized international clinical trials (German Dermatologic Cooperative Oncology Group (DeCOG-SLT) and Multicenter Selective Lymphadenectomy Trial II (MSLT-II)) published in 2016 and 2017, respectively, active surveillance has been demonstrated to have equivalent survival outcomes to completion lymphadenectomy (CLND) for a subset of patients who have microscopic lymph node disease. In this study, the changes in national practice patterns were examined regarding the utilization of CLND after positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB).METHODS: Using the National Cancer Database, CLND utilization was examined in SLN-positive patients diagnosed with melanoma between 2012 and 2016. A hierarchal logistical regression model with hospital-level random intercepts was constructed to examine the factors associated with SLNB followed by observation vs. SLNB with CLND.RESULTS: Of the 148,982 patients identified, 43% (n = 63,358) underwent SLNB and 10.3% (n = 6,551) had a SLNB with microscopic disease. CLND was performed for 57% (n = 2,817) of these patients. Patients were more likely to undergo CLND if they were ≤ 55 years of age (OR, 1.454; p ≤ 0.0001), ages 56 - 65 (OR, 1.127; p = 0.026), Charlson Deyo Score = 0 (OR, 2.088; p = 0.043), or were diagnosed with melanoma in 2012 (OR, 2.259, p ≤ 0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: The utilization of CLND among patients with microscopic nodal melanoma was significantly lower in 2016 compared to 2012. Younger age, lack of comorbidities, and primary tumor location on the trunk or head/neck were associated with higher utilization of CLND.

AB  - In preparation of the German spaceborne imaging spectroscopy mission EnMAP (The Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program) and its upcoming launch in early 2022, the data product validation activities have been intensified. As part of the science preparation and mission support project led by the German Research Center (GFZ) Potsdam, the overall quality of the official EnMAP products has to be accessed and evaluated independently from the data quality control activities performed by the Ground Segment at DLR EOC. Therefore, the radiometric, spectral, reflective, geometric and general quality of the three official EnMAP products (L1B, L1C and L2A) has to be validated during the commissioning and nominal phase.This paper presents an update of the data product validation activities, an in-depth insight into the overall approach and into specifically designed methods described in the EnMAP Product Validation Plan.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to quantify and characterize the impact of dry and wet events that occurred in the Sauce Grande River basin (Pampas, Argentina) on the morphometry of its main reservoirs, Paso de Las Piedras dam and Sauce Grande shallow lake, during the period 1987-2017. That's why, the annual series of the Standardized Precipitation and Evapotranspiration Index were analyzed, and seven morphometric indices were calculated from the processing of Landsat satellite images. The area of influence of the Paso de Las Piedras dam and the Sauce Grande shallow lake had alternation of dry and wet events of different duration, intensity, and frequency. The rainfall variability produced changes in the morphometry of the area of these two water bodies. Dry events caused a more significant impact on the dam, whereas wet ones on the shallow lake. The results are an essential database for the designation of policies oriented to the management of the water resources of the Sauce Grande River basin.

T2  - HISTORICAL SOCIAL RESEARCH-HISTORISCHE SOZIALFORSCHUNG
M3  - Article
AB  - How did my social-scientific worldview and my preferred methodological approach on selected research topics get to the point where they are "in the end"? I am talking about the development of my positioning as a researcher in the field of tension between personal-familial, professional-disciplinary, university-institutional, political, and societal relationships. Here, the concept of scientific work/activity as performed by researchers in context plays a central role. I connect this to the postulate and the practice of an accompanying selfreflexive consideration as a component of my personal research style. In my eyes, the norms of scientific knowledge production do not result from an abstract "logic of justification" (Popper 1992) but are rather guided by the idea of an integrative inclusion of the social-scientific object of knowledge, the role of the personalized research subject, and the procedures of theory generation based on data, interactively produced within the framework of grounded theory (Glaser and Strauss 1967).

AB  - Data-efficient image classification using deep neural networks in settings, where only small amounts of labeled data are available, has been an active research area in the recent past. However; an objective comparison between published methods is difficult, since existing works use different datasets for evaluation and often compare against untuned baselines with default hyper-parameters. We design a benchmark for data-efficient image classification consisting of six diverse datasets spanning various domains (e.g., natural images, medical imagery, satellite data) and data types (RGB, grayscale, multispectral). Using this benchmark, we re-evaluate the standard cross-entropy baseline and eight methods for data-efficient deep learning published between 2017 and 2021 at renowned venues. For a fair and realistic comparison, we carefully tune the hyper parameters of all methods on each dataset. Surprisingly, we find that tuning learning rate, weight decay, and batch size on a separate validation split results in a highly competitive baseline, which outperforms all but one specialized method and performs competitively to the remaining one.

AB  - Around the concept of colonial pedagogical gesture - how complex sociability networks are created and how their power and authority relationships work - we investigate how the architecture of the mountain matrix and its lay brotherhoods reveal the mountain baroque way of being, that is, how the mountain ontological constitution is shown in its religious architecture in the colonial period. We reviewed some studies and dates established since the 20th century on the matrix of Senhora da Conceicao. We focus our analysis on bibliographic and documentary research methodology. The result is an expanded narrative about colonial mountain society and its devotions, festivals and temples, based on a worldview centered on the notion of soul salvation through the intermediation of the Catholic Church in the process of reform and post-Tridentine counter-reform.

TI  - Hindcast and Near Real-Time Monitoring of Green Macroalgae Blooms in Shallow Coral Reef Lagoons Using Sentinel-2: A New-Caledonia Case Study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the necessary trade-offs between spatial and temporal resolution, remote sensing is an effective approach to monitor macroalgae blooms, understand their origins and anticipate their developments. Monitoring of small tropical lagoons is challenging because they require high resolutions. Since 2017, the Sentinel-2 satellites has provided new perspectives, and the feasibility of monitoring green algae blooms was investigated in this study. In the Poe-Gouaro-Deva lagoon, New Caledonia, recent Ulva blooms are the cause of significant nuisances when beaching. Spectral indices using the blue and green spectral bands were confronted with field observations of algal abundances using images concurrent with fieldwork. Depending on seabed compositions and types of correction applied to reflectance data, the spectral indices explained between 1 and 64.9% of variance. The models providing the best statistical fit were used to revisit the algal dynamics using Sentinel-2 data from January 2017 to December 2019, through two image segmentation approaches: unsupervised and supervised. The latter accurately reproduced the two algal blooms that occurred in the area in 2018. This paper demonstrates that Sentinel-2 data can be an effective source to hindcast and monitor the dynamics of green algae in shallow lagoons.

CP  - Conference on Thermosense - Thermal Infrared Applications XLIII
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Since its inception, the objective of the Infrared Laboratory-LIR has been the design and development of simple and low-cost IR systems for the resolution of specific problems in real time. This methodology can be used in a multitude of technological applications: energy, environmental, medical, etc. In this work, we focus on the characterization of clouds using a simple bispectral system in the thermal IR region. The study of clouds in the IR region is a problem studied since the use of the first on-board measurement systems. The imaging systems have become more sophisticated, giving rise to multispectral instruments capable of providing a huge amount of information on clouds with great accuracy. These systems are generally large in size, weight and cost. However, there are many situations where the goal is not to obtain comprehensive information about the clouds, but only ancillary information. In these situations, the low-cost approach of LIR is ideal for designing simple cloud characterization systems. In this work, a methodology is presented to determine the emissivity and temperature of the clouds based on the brightness temperature measured from space by a bi-spectral camera in the 10 and 12 microns bands. In addition, we provide quantitative information on the capabilities of the methodology according to the type of clouds based on real data provided by MODIS instrument.

TI  - California subalpine forest post-fire diversity and productivity
T2  - Zenodo
M3  - Software
AB  - High severity fire may promote or reduce plant understory diversity in forests. However, few empirical studies test long-standing theoretical predictions that productivity may help to explain observed variation in post-fire plant diversity. Support for the influence of productivity on disturbance-diversity relationships is found predominantly in experimental grasslands, while tests over large areas with natural disturbance and productivity gradients are few and have yielded inconsistent results. Here, we measured the response of post-fire understory plant diversity to natural gradients of fire severity and productivity in a large-scale observational study in California's subalpine forests. We found that plant species richness increased with increasing fire severity and that this trend was stronger at high productivity. We used plant traits to investigate whether release from competition might contribute to increasing diversity and found that short-lived and far-dispersing species benefited more from high severity fire than their long-lived and near-dispersing counterparts. For far-dispersing species only, the benefit from high severity fire was stronger in high productivity plots where unburned species richness was lowest. Our results support theoretical connections between fire severity, productivity and plant communities that are key to predicting the consequences of increasing fire severity and frequency on diversity in the coming decades. See README file. Funding provided by: National Science Foundation Graduate Research Award*Crossref Funder Registry ID: Award Number: 1650042Funding provided by: USDA Forest Service Region Five*Crossref Funder Registry ID: Award Number: Fire and plot selection Over the course of three summers (July - September, 2017 - 2019), we sampled 248 plots across 13 fires in subalpine forest (see Appendix S1: Table S1 for fire information). We identified fires that contained each of six fire severity classes (unburned, low, low-moderate, moderate, high-moderate, and high) corresponding to fire-caused basal area mortality (0%, 0-25%, 25-50%, 50-75%, 75-90%, and 90-100% respectively) using the remotely sensed relativized differenced normalized burn ratio (RdNBR; Miller and Thode 2007). Relativized fire severity measures such as RdNBR report relative change such that areas of both sparser and denser vegetation can experience the full fire severity spectrum. This helps to decouple the correlation between fire severity and productivity that can arise with absolute measures of biomass change or mortality (Pausas and Bradstock 2007). We sampled all 10 subalpine fires in the study region that contained six fire severity classes and were within two days hike of a trailhead as well as 3 smaller fires with fewer severity classes. Time since fire at the time of sampling ranged relatively evenly from 2-17 years. We used a stratified random sampling design, placing 405 square meter circular plots at the crosshairs of a 200x200 meter grid in upland areas with no recorded history of previous fire or logging. We stratified plots across preliminary fire severity classes (from RdNBR) as well as aspect (see Appendix S1: Supplemental Methods and Figure S1) and estimated final plot-level fire severity based on fire-caused basal area mortality as described above as well as relative fuel consumption (see Appendix S1: Table S2 for fire severity class descriptions). We subsequently censused all vascular plant species in the plot by systematically searching the plot area. Species richness was low in our study area (median 10), making it easy to locate all species. Remotely sensed environmental variables We used NDVI, a remotely sensed measure of photosynthetic activity, to represent plot-level productivity. NDVI has strong theoretical and empirical links to Gross Primary Productivity (GPP; Glenn et al. 2008), and robust correlations have been found between NDVI and tree radial growth measurements in other energy-limited systems like boreal forest (Beck et al. 2011). NDVI derived from 30x30m Landsat imagery is commonly used to represent productivity in montane forest (Burkle et al. 2015) and a recent study in Sierra Nevada subalpine forest found that it declined with mortality in whitebark pine stands and that inter-annual variability in NDVI tracked snow accumulation throughout a 30 year study period (Potter and Dolanc 2016). Using Google Earth Engine, we removed snow and cloud pixels from Landsat V imagery and calculated the average of maximum annual NDVI for the years 1995 through 2000 (Pettorelli et al. 2005, Gorelick et al. 2017). This six-year time period predates sampled fires, represents both wet and dry years in the study region, and its average correlates well with total aboveground tree biomass calculated for 37 unburned plots (Appendix S1: Fig. S1). We calculated Heat Load Index, a single metric accounting for slope, aspect, and some elements of slope position and shadow (essentially total plot-level solar radiation), using the R package spatialEco (McCune and Keon, 2002). Plant trait data We compiled available information on plant life history and dispersal syndrome for species in our dataset using the University of California Jepson Herbarium (http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu), the USDA Forest Service Fire Effects Information System (feis-crs.org), JSTOR Global Plants (https://plants.jstor.org/), and our own familiarity with the species. We characterized species life history as either annual/biennial, short-lived perennial (non-woody perennial without rhizomes, stolons, bulbs or root storage organs) or long-lived perennial (woody perennials and/or perennials with rhizomes, stolons, bulbs, or other storage organs), and species dispersal syndrome as either far-dispersing (vertebrate or wind dispersal syndrome) or near-dispersing (unassisted dispersal syndrome) (Supplement S1: Table S3). Species dispersal syndrome was classified as vertebrate-dispersing if the reproductive structures were fleshy or adhesive, wind-dispersing if the reproductive structure included a pappus, and unassisted if the reproductive structure had none of the previously described characteristics.

AB  - Purpose The COVID-19 pandemic has created a crisis for healthcare systems worldwide. There have been significant challenges to managing public and private health care and related services systems' capacity to cope with testing, treatment and containment of the virus. Drawing on the foundational research by Frow et al. (2019), the paper explores how adopting a service ecosystem perspective provides insight into the complexity of healthcare systems during times of extreme stress and uncertainty. Design/methodology/approach A healthcare framework based on a review of the service ecosystem literature is developed, and the COVID-19 crisis in Australia provides an illustrative case. Findings The study demonstrates how the service ecosystem perspective provides new insight into the dynamics and multilayered nature of a healthcare system during a pandemic. Three propositions are developed that offer directions for future research and managerial applications. Practical implications The research provides an understanding of the relevance of managerial flexibility, innovation, learning and knowledge sharing, which offers opportunities leading to greater resilience in the healthcare system. In particular, the research addresses how service providers in the service ecosystem learn from this pandemic to inform future practices. Originality/value The service ecosystem perspective for health care offers fresh thinking and an understanding of how a shared worldview, institutional practices and supportive and disruptive factors influence the systems' overall well-being during a crisis such as COVID-19.

TI  - Theodor Fontane in the Age of Appearance: Critical Aestheticism in <i>Die Poggenpuhls</i>
T2  - COLLOQUIA GERMANICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Fontane's penultimate novel I)ie Poggenpuhls shows striking parallels with current discourses on the politics of aesthetics. The author's most distinct stylistic device is the art of dialogue and its obfuscating potential. At the same time, the reader can observe the shift from a text-based to an image-based culture in Fontane's writing. Nobility has become a hollow performance due to the decline of its political influence. but the author exposes its true core as its theatrical element as well as the act of fictionalizing and aesthetically elevating one's life. Regarding the relevance of Fontane's works today, I compare his visual writing strategy with contemporary German artists who dedicated their poetic strategies to the image, both in the literal as well as the philosophical sense of the age-old Platonic differentiation between Schein and Sein. Andy Kassier and Rafael Horzon's Nietzschean affirmation of modernity's concomitant cultural frustrations connects these contemporary German artists to Fontane's figures. In the midst of the digital revolution we have again reached a period of momentous change. Schein as a new aesthetic mode of being challenges the notion of Sein; realizable by anyone, this aesthetic worldview resists the capitalist narrative, for it operates within the discursive system of art. We can either interpret social media networks like Instagram as the Auseinandertreten von Schein and Sein or see them as a democratic opportunity to create our own aesthetic existence.

TI  - Deriving Leaf Area Index Reference Maps Using Temporally Continuous <i>In Situ</i> Data: A Comparison of Upscaling Approaches
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To further progress the validation of global leaf area index (LAI) products, temporally continuous reference data are a key requirement, as periodic field campaigns fail to adequately characterize temporal dynamics. Progress in cost-effective automated measurement techniques has been made in recent years, but appropriate upscaling methodologies are less mature. Recently, the use of multitemporal transfer functions has been proposed as a potential solution. Using data collected during an independent field campaign, we evaluated the performance of both vegetation index-based multitemporal transfer functions and a radiative transfer model (RTM)-based upscaling approach. Whether assessed using cross validation or data from the independent field campaign, the RTM-based approach provided the best performance (r(2) >= 0.88, RMSE <= 0.41, NRMSE < 13%). For upscaling temporally continuous in situ data, the ability of RTM-based approaches to account for seasonal changes in sun-sensor geometry is a key advantage over vegetation index-based multitemporal transfer functions.

TI  - Changes of Norway Spruce Health in the Bialowieza Forest (CE Europe) in 2013-2019 during a Bark Beetle Infestation, Studied with Landsat Imagery
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Among the largest disturbances affecting the health of spruce forests is the large-scale appearance of bark beetles. Knowledge on the spatial distribution of infected-spruce areas is vital for effective and sustainable forest management. Medium-spatial-resolution (20-30 m) satellite images are well-suited for spruce forest disturbance monitoring at a landscape and regional scale following bark beetle outbreaks. The aim of this study was to evaluate the health of a Norway spruce stand after a bark beetle outbreak based on Landsat 8 images and thematic and vector data, supplemented with selected climate variables. This research was conducted for a spruce stand in the Bialowie(z) over dota Forest District in 2013, 2015, 2017, and 2019. We hypothesised that the changes in spruce health would significantly influence the NDVI distributions during the studied years. Our research revealed that the weather conditions in the period of May-September were beneficial for beetle development and detrimental for the spruce stand, particularly in 2015, 2018, and 2019. SWIR-NIR-G and NDVI images showed a gradual deterioration in spruce health. The quantitative NDVI distributions varied; the minimum, mean, and median decreased; and the distribution shape of the index values changed over the studied years. An analysis of the spatial NDVI distributions revealed that the threshold NDVI value separating spruce stand areas in good and poor health was ca. 0.6. This study confirmed the applicability of NDVI for monitoring alterations in spruce stands, and indicated that spatial NDVI distributions can provide valuable support in forest monitoring at a landscape scale, since medium-resolution, ready-to-use NDVI images are easily available from the Landsat archives, facilitating the routine assessment of stand health.

AB  - The economic status of each country varies; some countries are well developed while some are underdeveloped. A lower economic status in any place in the world can lead to hunger, malnutrition, and low life expectancy, especially for children and the older generation. For instance, in Africa, most people live below the international poverty line of 1.25 US dollars per day, according to the World Bank Group. One way of solving this problem is through collecting data and building intelligent models to automatically detect the low economic regions so the organizations, like The United Nations Development Program (UNDP), can allocate vital support systems to save the people there from the severity and help them lead a better life. Unfortunately, obtaining such data through manual surveys takes too long and requires a lot of resources. Thus, this work aims to provide an efficient solution to this problem. It analyzes the socioeconomic status of the underdeveloped regions, primarily a few selected African countries, by using remote sensing (RS), multimodal data exploitation, machine learning, transfer learning, and computer vision technologies. The proposed framework can make accurate prediction on a particular geographic region's standard of living (wealth index) based on the distribution of nightlight intensity that is observed via satellite remote sensing. Exhaustive experiments are carried out using data from the National Oceanic And Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), and Google Static Maps. The experimental results verify that the proposed framework can be used as an effective alternative to the conventional approaches for socioeconomic analysis.

TI  - Cancer field surgery in endometrial cancer: peritoneal mesometrial resection and targeted compartmental lymphadenectomy for locoregional control
T2  - JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Peritoneal mesometrial resection (PMMR) plus targeted compartmental lymphadenectomy (TCL) aims at removal of the locoregional cancer field in endometrial cancer (EC). Optimal locoregional control without adjuvant radiotherapy and acceptable surgical morbidity should be achieved concomitantly sparing systematic lymphadenectomy (LNE) for most of the patients.Methods: We evaluated data from 132 patients treated for EC. Out of these, between January 2017 and June 2020 we performed robotic PMMR and TCL on 51 women. We present the first data of feasibility and safety of the procedure as well as preliminary oncological results.Results: The 51 patients treated with robotic PMMR and TCL showed comparable morbidity to classic laparoscopic hysterectomy or PMMR without LNE. One intraoperative complication occurred. Postoperative complications grade 3 and higher occurred in 2 cases (3.9%). One of these (85 years old) experienced grade 5 following pulmonary embolism with lysis therapy. Fifteen patients (29.4%) could be spared complete LNE. The rate of adjuvant radiotherapy was 3.9% in our collective (n=2), compared to 39.2% of patients (n=20) eligible for irradiation according to international guidelines. In a mean follow-up time of 15 months (0-41), no locoregional recurrences were observed, although three patients showed distant relapse.Conclusions: Our data suggest that robotic PMMR and pelvic TCL can be performed regardless of BMI and comorbidities without a relevant increase in surgical morbidity. Moreover, despite a relevant reduction of adjuvant radiotherapy, first follow-up data hint at a favorable locoregional recurrence rate in the reported cohort.

AB  - Land use change is one of the problems that need to be considered in city development. As buffer cities for Jakarta, the Bekasi, Bogor, Depok, and Tangerang areas need to observe the land use change by its subdistrict as a result of residential and industrial development for the city of Jakarta. The goverments need to watch the land use change to impervious area by subdistrict governments need to watch for land-use change to impervious land by sub-district to maintain the minimum standard of non-impervious land. In machine learning, regression could be used to classify land into impervious or non-impervious land. One of the examples of regression is Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO). This study aims to rank a land use change by subdistrict area in Jakarta's buffer cities using Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 imageries. As a result, the highest land use change from 2017 to 2020 occurred in Bogor City (27.03% of its area) while the highest land use change to impervious in subdistrict happened in Tajur Halang subdistrict (50.69% of its area)

AB  - Oil palm is one of the plantation commodities that has an important role in the economy of Indonesia. The high demand for palm oil in the future must be supported by high productivity. Fertilization is one of the intensification methods to increase oil palm productivity. The main nutrient content in oil palm that helps the growth and development of oil palm is nitrogen. Soil samples and location coordinates were taken from oil palm plantations then adjusted to Sentinel-1 satellite images. The Sentinel-1 image obtained is then processed first to reduce the factors that aggravate the process afterward. The digital number value obtained from the reflection of the Sentinel-1 image was then used as an independent variable and the soil nitrogen results from the laboratory become the dependent variable. Data were trained and a model was built using Random Forest Regressor (RFR) and Multi Linear Regression (MLR). All models built were evaluated by the quality of the model using MAPE and the best model was determined by selecting the lowest MAPE. RFR model has 19.53% of MAPE and MLR has 22.41% of MAPE. The RFR is chosen to be the best model based on the lowest MAPE and based on interpretation, the RFR model has good accuracy for determining soil nitrogen nutrient content better than MLR model.

TI  - Land Use/Land Cover Change and Its Driving Forces in Shenkolla Watershed, South Central Ethiopia.
T2  - TheScientificWorldJournal
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Land use change is one of the challenges that aggravate environmental problems. Understanding the scope of land use change, driving forces, and consequences is very crucial for proper management of land resources. We investigated land use/land cover changes using remote sensing data (for the years 1973, 1995, and 2017), and field observation, household survey, key informant interview, and focus group discussion were used to determine the drivers and consequences of land use/land cover changes in Shenkolla watershed, south central Ethiopia. Unsupervised and supervised classification techniques were employed to get thematic information from satellite imagery. ArcGIS 10.3 and QGIS v 3.0 softwares were used to accomplish the analysis. The results disclosed that Shenkolla watershed has changed significantly during the past 4decades between 1973 and 2017. This observed change indicates a reduction in forest land and an increase in agricultural land. Forest land was reduced from 29.51% in 1973 to 20.52% in 2017, but agricultural land was expanded from 70.49% in 1973 to 79.48% in 2017. Agricultural expansion, policy change and social unrest, population pressure, shortage of farm land, and biophysical factors were major driving forces of the LU/LC changes. Environmental implications such as climate change, biodiversity loss, scarcity of basic forest products, habitat alteration, decline in quality and availability of water, and crop yield reduction are the consequences of the LU/LC change. The expansion of agricultural land at the expense of forest cover in Shenkolla watershed has negative implications on the natural resources and the livelihood of local people. Hence, appropriate measures need to be employed to reduce the dramatic change in land use and to harmonize environmental conservation with human livelihood.

M3  - Article
AB  - The Buffalo and Brays Bayous are two of the primary drainage channels in the city of Houston. Both the Buffalo and Brays Bayou Watersheds (BBW, BrBW) are impacted by frequent flooding, rapid urbanization and intense land cover changes. The goal of this research is to assess and compare the soil and water quality and land cover changes in the BBW and BrBW. The specific objectives of the study are 1) to monitor and assess the nutrient and metal concentrations in the water and soil samples along the Buffalo and Brays Bayou, 2) to map the long-term land cover changes within these urban watersheds, and 3) to assess the effect of land cover changes on the bayou discharge, water and soil quality of the watersheds. Water and soil samples from several locations along the Brays and Buffalo Bayous were collected during multiple seasons and processed for chemical analysis. Our water sample analysis revealed that the Cu, As and Pb concentrations were higher in the fall compared to the summer and exceeded the critical limit in both the bayous. The soil analysis indicated that the Zn and Pb concentrations were higher in the fall over summer season and exceeded the background concentrations in both BBW and BrBW. The remote sensing analysis revealed that there was a 145% and 140% increase in impervious surface and 34.8% and 34.5% decrease in the vegetative surface in the BBW and BrBW, respectively, due to urbanization during 1984-2019. The contamination of soil and water in BrBW is substantially higher than the BBW. The results of this study provide insights for adoption of best sustainable management practices in urban watersheds.

TI  - Impact of Forest Disturbance on InSAR Surface Displacement Time Series
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data improve in their global coverage and temporal sampling, studies of ground deformation using InSAR are becoming feasible even in heavily vegetated regions such as the American Pacific Northwest (PNW) and Sumatra. However, ongoing forest disturbance due to logging, wildfires, or disease can introduce time-variable signals which could be misinterpreted as ground displacements. This study constrains the error introduced into InSAR time series in the presence of time-variable forest disturbance using synthetic data. For satellite platforms with randomly distributed orbital positions in time (e.g., Sentinel-1), mid-time series forest disturbance results in random error on the order of 0.2 and 10 cm/year for 1-year secular and time-variable velocities, respectively. If the orbital positions are not randomly distributed in time (e.g., ALOS-1), a biased error on the order of 10 cm/year is introduced to the inferred secular velocity. A time series using real ALOS-1 data near Eugene, OR, USA, shows agreement with the bias estimated by synthetic models. Mitigation of time-variable land cover change effects can be achieved if their timing is known, either through independent observations of surface properties (e.g., Landsat/Sentinel-2) or through the use of more computationally expensive, nonlinear inversions with additional terms for the timing of height changes. Inclusion of these additional terms reduces the potential for misinterpretation of InSAR signals associated with land surface change as ground deformation.

TI  - Long term hydrological and environmental monitoring of the Stryi River using remote sensing data and GIS technologies
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY GEOGRAPHY AND GEOECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The proposed research sets the task of conducting monitoring aimed at determining the horizontal displacements of the channel of the Stryi River the largest right-bank tributary of the Dniester River. For this purpose, the river was zoned according to morphometric and hydrological characteristics. Three parts were identified, namely highland, piedmont and lowland ones, which radically vary in the nature of the flow and the amount of the displacement. The main research purpose consists in analyzing the impact of anthropogenic factors on the hydrological regime of the Stryi River, as well as studying the effect of the Ukrainian Carpathian Foredeep (UCF) and the Stryi Deep on the mode of horizontal displacements. The research object is processes occurring within the Stryi River channel. Considering main natural factors affecting the channel's horizontal displacements, special attention is paid to the geological and sedimentological structures located in the region where the Stryi River and its tributaries flow; among the anthropogenic factors, deforestation and the extraction of building materials from the river channel arc highlighted. Topographic, geological, soil maps and satellite images of various periods uploaded into ArcGIS software allowed us to monitor displacements observed for as long as 140 years ago. To monitoring the Stryi River channel displacements, such materials as topographic maps scaled 1: 75000 (Austrian period - 1874), 1: 100000 (Polish period - 1933, Soviet period - 1990); satellite images of Sentinel-2 (2019 and 2020 (after the flood)); a map of Quaternary sediments and a soil map scaled 1: 200000 were used. The Stryi River flows between two structures, i.e. the Skybovi Carpathians and the UCF. The right-bank tributaries (Bystrytsia, Limnitsia, Stryi, etc.), which begin in the Carpathians, cross the outer and inner boundaries of the UCF and are characterized by the stable river channel in its mountainous part, multi-braided in its piedmont part, as well as perennial and significant meandering within the Pre-Carpathian region. Lithological deposits have a significant impact at the mouth of the Stryi River. According to the research study results, displacements of up to 1,350m are measured in this area. The research includes an analysis of the influence of geological and sedimentological structures on the Stryi River displacement and the nature of its flow. It has been established that deforestation in the river basin, as well as unauthorized extraction of gravel materials, creates a significant environmental problem in this region. The results of monitoring of the channel deformation processes should be taken into account when solving problems related to river channel processes, namely the construction of hydraulic structures, the design of power transmission networks crossing rivers, the development of gas pipelines, the identification of hazardous flooding zones, the determination of consequences of destruction after floods, the establishment of boundaries of water protection zones, the management of recreational activities, monitoring of border lands and the establishment of an interstate border along rivers.

M3  - Article
AB  - The issues of creating a picture of the world in the story of the English writer E. F. Benson's "Gayon's Eve". It is concluded that the picture of the world is organized by two external chronotopes: the chronotope of the Scottish village of Gavon, the chronotope of the Pictish fortress and the internal chronotope, concentrated around the consciousness of the narrator. Attention is paid to the functioning of forms of artistic space and time. built on the principle of binary oppositions. It is shown that spatial correlations between external and internal. far and near. western and eastern have an increased semantic significance in the narrative. Particular attention is paid to the role or the spatial categories of up and down, revealing the author's concept of the eternity of infernal evil. It has been proven that the key forms or artistic time are day and night. light and dark, past and present, which are traditional for Gothic subjects. The relevance or the study is due to the growing interest in the genre of gothic prose, which today is associated. in particular. with attempts to resist anti-humanistic, destructive trends in the life of modem society. The novelty of the research is seen in the fact that the issues or artistry of Gothic stories by E. F. Benson is still under-researched.

TI  - RELIGIOUS PUBLICISM OF "TOBOLSK DIOCESAN GAZETTE" IN THE END OF XIX - BEGINNING OF XX CENTURY: PROBLEMS OF SOURCE STUDY
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA ISTORIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this article is to identify and characterize the problems of the source study of religious publicism. The specific sources for this study were the publications of the Informal part of the journal "Tobolsk Diocesan Gazette" of the late 19th - early 20th centuries. The relevance of study is motivated by the absence of clear definition of publicism as metagenre and as kind of sources, as well as by necessity of introduction of text complexes with a wide informative potential into scientific circulation. On the pages of the indicated journal religious journalism is presented in different forms - conversations, teachings, obituaries-epitaphs, speeches, words and others. In spite of all these it is possible to specify such of its features as religious worldview of the author (in most cases - his inclusion into a certain social group); the aim of the publications at preservation and reproduction of society order, system of values and manners, and at maintenance of believers' integration on the basis of representation of concrete models of experience and worldview; at address to the actual questions for a religious person (the understanding of "sin", "virtue", "evil", "good", life, death, love, belief, duty); authoritarian style of appeal to the audience, "edification" in combination with the confession; approaches to fact interpretation and style of writing given by religious tradition (quotations from sacred texts, references to religious authorities, allusions, symbols), special circumstances of origin (under censorship of church representatives, with a focus on Orthodox audience). Identified peculiarities of the study of publicism texts of "Tobolsk Diocesan Gazette" - genre, functional, content-related - in the combination with circumstances of their origin and existence determine the problems of the study of religious publicism. The authors of the article single out among these there is a complexity of interpretation: researcher should soak himself into the space of hidden meanings, "decipher" irrational religious arguments, which are very emotional, metaphoric, symbolic, polysemic, should establish connection between fragments of ancient sacral texts and the problem of the article. The problem of authorship is aligned with interpretation, in particular the separation of author's own individual contribution and that ideological foundation on which the publicist based on. The authors conclude that while characterizing the source under consideration, we should consider that the direction and subject matter of the articles have been defined by the program of the issue of the bulletin, all the materials underwent censorship control and were chosen by editorial office, which practically excluded the appearance of opinions opposed to official ones.

AB  - Modern search engine ranking pipelines are commonly based on large machine-learned ensembles of regression trees. We propose LEAR, a novel - learned - technique aimed to reduce the average number of trees traversed by documents to accumulate the scores, thus reducing the overall query response time. LEAR exploits a classifier that predicts whether a document can early exit the ensemble because it is unlikely to be ranked among the final top-k results. The early exit decision occurs at a sentinel point, i.e., after having evaluated a limited number of trees, and the partial scores are exploited to filter out non-promising documents. We evaluate LEAR by deploying it in a production-like setting, adopting a state-of-the-art algorithm for ensembles traversal. We provide a comprehensive experimental evaluation on two public datasets. The experiments show that LEAR has a significant impact on the efficiency of the query processing without hindering its ranking quality. In detail, on a first dataset, LEAR is able to achieve a speedup of 3x without any loss in NDCG@10, while on a second dataset the speedup is larger than 5x with a negligible NDCG@10 loss (< 0.05%).

TI  - Effects of the COVID-19 Lockdown on Urban Light Emissions: Ground and Satellite Comparison
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - 'Lockdown' periods in response to COVID-19 have provided a unique opportunity to study the impacts of economic activity on environmental pollution (e.g., NO2, aerosols, noise, light). The effects on NO2 and aerosols have been very noticeable and readily demonstrated, but that on light pollution has proven challenging to determine. The main reason for this difficulty is that the primary source of nighttime satellite imagery of the earth is the SNPP-VIIRS/DNB instrument, which acquires data late at night after most human nocturnal activity has already occurred and much associated lighting has been turned off. Here, to analyze the effect of lockdown on urban light emissions, we use ground and satellite data for Granada, Spain, during the COVID-19 induced confinement of the city's population from 14 March until 31 May 2020. We find a clear decrease in light pollution due both to a decrease in light emissions from the city and to a decrease in anthropogenic aerosol content in the atmosphere which resulted in less light being scattered. A clear correlation between the abundance of PM10 particles and sky brightness is observed, such that the more polluted the atmosphere the brighter the urban night sky. An empirical expression is determined that relates PM10 particle abundance and sky brightness at three different wavelength bands.

M3  - Article
AB  - Volume of icebergs calved from the output glaciers located on the Northern Land during 2014-2019 was estimated using the satellite information. High-resolution satellite data were obtained in the visible spectral range from the non-commercial satellites Sentinel-2 (spatial resolution 10 m) and Landsat-8 (spatial resolution 15 m). Data collection was carried out under conditions when the natural illumination in the Arctic was sufficient (March-September) to make pictures in the visible spectral range. About 100 satellite images were analyzed for each year of the above period. The technique used for the iceberg detection is based on statistical criteria for finding the gradient zones in the analysis of two-dimensional fields of satellite images. The generation of the iceberg from a particular glacier was verified by using a form template of the detected iceberg taking into consideration the following parameters of the object: the geometrical shape, dimensions, specific features of "picture" of the ice surface (presence and orientation of cracks, peaks, and lakelets of melt water). The iceberg height was determined by its shadow on the image. The calculated total annual volume of icebergs from the outlet glaciers was estimated 1.52-1.9 km(3). According to satellite data, the annual area reduction of the Northern Land outlet glaciers averaged 13 km(2). The greatest contribution is made by 12 outlet glaciers located on the Komsomolets and the October Revolution islands. Of these, six are from the Academy of Sciences ice dome, four - the glaciers of the Matusevich Fjord, the Vavilov Glacier and the Rusanov dome glacier. 12. Icebergs of maximum height (30-40 m) are produced by glaciers of the North-Eastern slope of the Academy of Sciences ice dome and glacier. 12 of the Rusanov dome. In general, according to satellite data of recent years, generation of icebergs from the outlet glaciers of the Northern Land shows a steady growth trend.

AB  - The American Health Values Survey (AHVS) was conducted by the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) at the University of Chicago in order to develop a typology of Americans based on their health values and beliefs. The survey, of more than 10,000 adults from five individual communities, examined values and beliefs related to health at both the individual as well as societal levels. The community surveys sought to compare differences between the local typologies, but also to investigate any similarities with national typology groups. The survey assessed the importance of health in: In addition, the survey also explored views about how active government should be in health; collective efficacy, the ease of affecting positive community change by working with others; and health-related civic engagement e.g. the support of health charities and organizations working on health issues. There are public-use and restricted-use versions of the data provided for each of the five sentinel communities participating in this study. Although each site differs on the number of respondents as listed below, each data file contains the same 143 variables for each site and version of the data. The only difference between the public-use versus restricted-use versions of the data is the variable The purpose of this study was part of a broader effort by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to explore regional variation in health values and beliefs, and to construct a typology of U.S. adults on those values and beliefs. Their hope is that an increased understanding of American health values and beliefs can inform the development of new efforts to promote population health and equity in the United States. The multimode data collection approach included three data collection modes: 1) an online self-administered survey (computer-assisted web interview, or CAWI); 2) a mailed self-administered paper questionnaire (SAQ); and 3) a computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI). All modes were available in Spanish and English. Throughout the fielding period, respondents could also call a toll-free line and complete the survey via telephone. Respondents were provided prepaid incentives with the initial web invitation letter ($1) and the SAQ ($2). Those who completed the survey during the designated two-week "Early Bird" period also received a $10 contingent (post-paid) incentive. The response options for the majority of questions from the questionnaire ask for a 4- or 5-point rating scale. The topics of the scale cover: The questionnaire additionally asked about the following demographic information: gender, age (raw and categorized), ethnicity, race, education, children, household composition, income, height / weight, and physical health. Other topics asked about include civic engagement and political ideology / involvement.

AB  - La Mettrie's materialism in the 18th century was part of an enlightening project, and challenged long-standing religious and philosophical doxa with the most extreme theory compressed into ‘man-machine’. His theory aroused fierce criticism in his time, and in later generations, it was dismissed as “mechanistic determinism,” but it has not been adequately reexamined. However, it is not considered justifiable that La Mettrie's theory is evaluated in such a one-sided and fixed way. For his thoughts are multifaceted and have rich implications, so they are worth to be paid attention even today, and they show the characteristic that the major ideas of that time intersect very dynamically in them.La Mettrie, critically accepted rationalism and at the same time was based on empiricism and the achievements of natural science. sought to dismantle the long-standing dogma about God, human being, and the world, thereby stopping its evil. La Mettrie's theory was such a transformative and subversive project, and was to present a new perspective on human being and the world, and thereby aimed at establishing a new view of values for humanity. And La Mettrie's materialism and atheism lead us to pursue “happiness” and “peace” by freeing mankind from false beliefs and long-standing violences above all else. Furthermore, it attempted to dismantle even the stupid dogma that viewed all things with the eyes of hierarchy, the false belief of “the great chain of beings”. Through a worldview in which the centrality of ‘God’ and ‘Human’ was dismantled, La Mettrie tried to awaken that all the lives and beings have fundamentally the same right to be and their values are absolutely equal.

AB  - We analyzed the temporal changes of green space network in Seoul from 1984 to 2019 using graph theory to suggest policy implications. For the analysis, we extracted green space patches using Landsat NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) time-series data. Patch- and non-patch-based network analyses were applied using Euclidean distance and least-cost distance at multi-spatial scales. The patch-based network analysis confirmed the notable recovery and improvement of the network connectivity during the study period. We identified the important green spaces that are pivotal in preserving and managing the green space network. In addition, based on the non-patch-based network analysis, we found the recovery trend of main green corridors connecting the area from north to south. The establishment of Yongsan Park contributed greatly to the improve the connectivity, compared to the increased area of the green space. The result also showed that Yongsan Park can strengthen and expand the green corridor.We hope our research provides useful information for policymakers to expand neighborhood green spaces and develop sustainable urban master plans.

TI  - Zoo animals as sentinels for Schmallenberg virus monitoring in Spain
T2  - VETERINARY MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Schmallenberg virus (SBV) is a newly emerged vector-borne pathogen that affects many domestic and wild animal species. A serosurvey was carried out to assess SBV exposure in zoo animals in Spain and to determine the dynamics of seropositivity in longitudinally sampled individuals. Between 2002 and 2019, sera from 278 animals belonging to 73 different species were collected from five zoos (A-E). Thirty-one of these animals were longitudinally sampled at three of these zoo parks during the study period. Seropositivity was detected in 28 (10.1 %) of 278 animals analyzed by blocking ELISA. Specific anti-SBV antibodies were confirmed in 20 (7.2 %; 95 %CI: 4.2-10.3) animals of six different species using virus neutralization test (VNT). The multiple logistic regression model showed that "order" (Artiodactyla) and "zoo provenance" (zoo B; southern Spain) were risk factors potentially associated with SBV exposure. Two (8.7 %) of the 31 longitudinally-sampled individuals showed specific antibodies against SBV at all samplings whereas seroconversion was detected in one mouflon (Ovis aries musimon) and one Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) in 2016 and 2019, respectively. To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first surveillance conducted on SBV in zoos in Spain. The results confirm SBV exposure in zoo animals in this country and indicate circulation of the virus before the first Schmallenberg disease outbreak was reported in Spain. Surveillance in zoological parks could be a complementary approach to monitoring SBV activity. Further studies are warranted to assess the impact of this virus on the health status of susceptible zoo animals.

T2  - ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - By controlling instrumental errors to below 10 cm s(-1), the EXtreme PREcision Spectrograph (EXPRES) allows for a more insightful study of photospheric velocities that can mask weak Keplerian signals. Gaussian processes (GP) have become a standard tool for modeling correlated noise in radial velocity data sets. While GPs are constrained and motivated by physical properties of the star, in some cases they are still flexible enough to absorb unresolved Keplerian signals. We apply GP regression to EXPRES radial velocity measurements of the 3.5 Gyr old chromospherically active Sun-like star, HD 101501. We obtain tight constraints on the stellar rotation period and the evolution of spot distributions using 28 seasons of ground-based photometry, as well as recent Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite data. Light-curve inversion was carried out on both photometry data sets to reveal the spot distribution and spot evolution timescales on the star. We find that the >5 m s(-1) rms radial velocity variations in HD 101501 are well modeled with a GP stellar activity model without planets, yielding a residual rms scatter of 45 cm s(-1). We carry out simulations, injecting and recovering signals with the GP framework, to demonstrate that high-cadence observations are required to use GPs most efficiently to detect low-mass planets around active stars like HD 101501. Sparse sampling prevents GPs from learning the correlated noise structure and can allow it to absorb prospective Keplerian signals. We quantify the moderate to high-cadence monitoring that provides the necessary information to disentangle photospheric features using GPs and to detect planets around active stars.

TI  - The Superlunary World in Baroque Homiletics (in the Sermons of loanikii Galiatovsky, Lazar Baranovich and Symeon Polotsky)
T2  - SLAVIA-CASOPIS PRO SLOVANSKOU FILOLOGII
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper explores the description of the universe and its elements in the superlunary realms in the books of sermons of three Ruthenian authors, i.e. loanikii Galiatovsky, Lazar Baranovich and Symeon Polotsky. The original intentions and the potential target audience differed in the three discussed cases, since Galiatovsky's collection of sermons was intended for a large readership in the Orthodox Ruthenia, while both Baranovich and Polotsky wrote their collections for the Muscovites, with the tzar or the royal family being the first target reader. Of all three authors, Polotsky was the one who knew the specificity of the Muscovite readership from the inside. All the authors included certain elements of natural philosophy in their sermons in order to make them more captivating for the readers. Neither of them presented a detailed description of the universe or dedicated a significant part of the sermon to explaining the celestial phenomena, however, they shared the perception of the world as a well-designed structure. All the authors expressed a belief in the geocentric Aristotelian-Ptolemaic universe and used certain elements of the cosmological imagery as a frame or means of textual organization. The most synthetic constructions which include the natural philosophy, ancient mythology and Christian interpretations are presented in Galiatovsky's sermons. Lazar Baranovich used the zodiacal imagery as a framework for his second collection of sermons, while Symeon Polotsky put emphasis on the solar symbolism. All three authors most frequently used cosmological, celestial, astronomical metaphors and symbolism in connection with Virgin Mary, following the Catholic tradition. The sermons of Galiatovsky, Baranovich and Polotsky serve as a source for understanding the worldview of the authors, as well as the target audience.

AB  - The Cilutung River has an essential role in meeting water needs, especially in Sumedang and Majalengka Districts. The drought that has occurred in the Cilutung watershed in recent years indicates a need to monitor the availability of water in the watershed. This study aimed to determine the annual water availability in the Cilutung watershed in 2009 and 2019 related to the dynamics of land cover change. The land cover maps in 2009 and 2019 were obtained from the Landsat series imagery, classified into 6 (six) land cover classes. The method used to calculate water availability and water demand is the InVEST Water Yield Model, a hydrological method with a water balance approach. The calculation results show that rainfall and vegetation cover positively correlate with water availability, while the increase in built-up land has a positive correlation with water demand. In 2009 Sub DAS 7 had high water yields compared to other sub-watersheds, but in 2019 the highest water yield was produced by Sub DAS 6. Due to the significant increase in built-up land in Sub-watershed 7, water demand also increased. Sub-watersheds with high water yield can select priority areas for water resource conservation to maintain the water supply in the Cilutung watershed.

TI  - A DEM fusion method for ascending and descending orbit StereoSAR DEMs in complicated mountain areas considering SAR echo intensity
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - To extract the high-quality DEM in complicated mountain areas, a DEM fusion method for ascending and descending orbit StereoSAR DEMs considering Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) echo intensity is proposed. After the analysis for the influence of terrain features and SAR side-looking imaging characteristics on radar echo intensity and DEM accuracy, four TerrasAR-X images with the stripmap mode and the 3 m spatial resolution covering a certain area of Maoxian County, Sichuan Province, China, was selected as the experimental area. StereoSAR technology was used to extract the ascending orbit StereoSAR DEM and the descending orbit StereoSAR DEM, respectively, and the corresponding radar echo intensity map was calculated. Then, while comparing the radar echo intensity corresponding to the same point position, DEM fusion was carried out, and the accuracy of DEM before and after the fusion was analyzed with the ground points measured by GNSS-RTK as reference data. Finally, a high-quality DEM with a 3 m spatial resolution in the experimental area was obtained. The DEM accuracy was improved on all slopes, and the mean absolute deviation (MAD) improved to 4.798 m, the standard deviation (SD) improved to 6.087 m and the LE90 improved to 40.48 m. The experimental results indicate that the fusion method of high-resolution ascending and descending orbit StereoSAR DEMs considering SAR echo intensity can effectively extract DEM with high accuracy and reliability, which can provide technical support for obtaining high-quality terrain information in similar areas.

AB  - With over 127 million cases globally, the COVID-19 pandemic marks a sentinel event in global health. However, true case estimations have been elusive due to lack of testing and diagnostic capacity, asymptomatic cases, and individuals who do not get tested or seek care. Concomitantly, new digital surveillance tools to detect, characterize, and report COVID-19 cases are emerging, including using structured and unstructured data from users self-reporting COVID-19-related experiences on the Internet and social media platforms. In this study, we develop and evaluate a hybrid unsupervised and supervised machine learning approach to detect self-reported COVID-19-related symptoms on Twitter during the early stages of the pandemic. Tweets were collected from the public API stream from March 3rd-31st 2020, filtered for COVID-19-related terms. We used the biterm topic model to cluster tweets into theme-associated groups for the first 18 days of tweets, which were then extracted and manually annotated to identify users self-reporting suspected COVID-19 symptoms or status. Using this manually annotated data as a training set, we used an XLNet deep learning model for classifying symptom-related tweets from a larger corpus and also evaluated model performance. From 4,492,954 tweets collected, the unsupervised learning process yielded 3,465 (<1%) symptom tweets used to form our ground-truth COVID-19 symptoms dataset (n = 11,550). The XLNet text classifier achieved the highest accuracy (.91) and f1 (.62) compared to baseline models evaluated for classification. After re-training with adjusted loss function, we boosted the classifier's precision to 0.81 while maintaining a high f1 (0.66), resulting in identification of an additional 2,622 symptom-related tweets when applied to an additional 11 days of tweets collected. Our study used a hybrid machine learning approach to enable high precision identification of Twitter usergenerated COVID-19 symptom discussions. The model is a digital epidemiology tool that can identify social media users who selfreport symptoms during the early periods of an outbreak.

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - This article studies the meanings of the term doctrine in De doctrina christiana, as it is necessary to determine the scope of a word that has been integrated into the worldview of Christianity after a long semantic journey. From a methodological point of view, we integrate two perspectives: on the one hand, a review of the secondary literature on Augustine, based on the turning point that the contributions of H.I. Marrou and P. Brown represented. On the other hand, we apply the philological method, since its historical nature lets us understand the nuances of the transition from classical culture to Christianiy. Our contribution to Augustinian studies rests on the following affirmation: the cultural baggage of the grammarian was put in tension by the interpretation of the Scriptures that express, for Christianity, "the truth that God is," with the darkness and ambiguity of human language. The elementary experience of God involved finding an instrument to express a part of that primordial truth and beauty.

TI  - High-resolution wall-to-wall land-cover mapping and land change assessment for Australia from 1985 to 2015
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Computational and data handling limitations have constrained time-series analyses of land-cover change at high spatial resolution over large (e.g., continental) extents. However, a new set of cloud-computing services offer an opportunity for improving knowledge of land change at finer grain. We constructed a historical set of seven high resolution wall-to-wall land-cover maps at continental scale for Australia and analyzed temporal and spatial changes of land-cover from 1985 to 2015 at 5-year time-steps using Google Earth Engine (GEE). We used 281,962 Landsat scenes for producing median cloud-free composites at each time-step. We established a pseudo ground truth dataset and used a PCA-based outlier detection method to reduce its uncertainty. A random forest model was trained at each time-step for classifying raw data into six land-cover classes: Cropland, Forest, Grassland, Built-up, Water, and Other areas, using 49 predictor datasets and nearly 20,000 training points. We further constructed uncertainty maps at each time-step as a proxy of per-pixel confidence. The average overall accuracy of the seven 30 m-resolution land-cover maps was-93%. Built-up and Water areas displayed the highest user and producer accuracies (>93%), with Grasslands and Other areas slightly lower (similar to 82-88%). Classification uncertainty was lower in more homogeneous landscapes (i.e., large expanses of a single land-cover class). Around 510,975 km(2) (+/- 69,877 km(2)) of land changed over the 30 years at an average of similar to 17,033 km(2) yr(-1) (+/- 2329 km(2) yr(-1)). Cropland and Forests declined by similar to 64,836 km(2) (+/- 16,437 km(2)) and similar to 152,492 km(2) (+/- 24,749 km(2)) over 30 years, mainly converting to Grassland. Built-up areas experienced the highest relative increases, increasing from 12,320 km(2) in 1985 to 15,013 km(2) in 2015 (similar to 19.2%, +/- 3.1%). The sensitivity, i.e., proportion of pixels correctly classified as having changed, was over 96%, whereas the specificity, i.e., the proportion of pixels correctly classified as no-change, was over 68%. Numerous potential applications of these first-of-their-kind, detailed spatiotemporal maps of land use and land-change assessment exist spanning many areas of environmental impact assessment, policy, and management. Similarly, this methodological framework can provide a useful template for assessing continental-scale, high-resolution land dynamics more broadly.

TI  - Snow Albedo Seasonal Decay and Its Relation With Shortwave Radiation, Surface Temperature and Topography Over an Antarctic ICE Cap
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We have characterized the snow albedo decay over Hurd Peninsula, Livingston Island, Antarctica, for the period 2000-2016. The snow albedo was obtained from the MOD10A1 product of the spaceborne MODIS sensor. A low-pass filter is applied to the data in order to eliminate short-term variations and retain the seasonal variation of albedo. The seasonal albedo was fitted to an exponential decay function to obtain the decay rate, the duration and the starting date of the decay. On average, albedo decay starts in late September and lasts for 96 +/- 20 days. Snow melting lags behind snow albedo decay. This lag is due, on the one hand, to the occurrence of dry-snow metamorphism and sublimation in the early stages of the decay, and on the other hand to persisting subsurface melting after the completion of the metamorphic processes at the surface. The albedo decay is mainly driven by the shortwave incident radiation, with air and near-surface temperatures unexpectedly playing a minor role. Near-surface-temperature controls the importance of the local topography in the albedo decay. Topography only determines the albedo decay when the snow cover is not homogeneous over the study area.

TI  - A comprehensive characterization of MODIS daily burned area mapping accuracy across fire sizes in tropical savannas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Daily global burned area mapping of Earth from remotely sensed data is of considerable interest and indicates a clear user need, despite well-known accuracy limitations. Many studies report global and regional indicators of spatial and temporal accuracy to evaluate the quality of burned area products, but tend to rely on relatively sparse validation data. In this paper, an extensive validation data set covering 223 million ha over the Brazilian Cerrado for the 2015 fire season is used to thoroughly evaluate how the accuracy of burned area products relying on distinct spectral channels (SWIR+NIR versus NIR) and spatial resolution (250 m, 500 m, and both) depends on fire size.Toward this end, we consider publicly available burned area products MCD64A1 (v006) at 500 m and FireCCI51 at 250 m and use a recently proposed graph-based patch algorithm, which is flexible enough to combine 250-500 m bands.he trade-off between spatial resolution and spectral channels for the problem at hand reveals that better spatial resolution (NIR at 250 m) is preferable to a broader range of spectral channels (NIR + SWIR at 500 m) for small burns ( 250 ha), but that this relation is not preserved for large burns ( 1000 ha). Also, this study shows that combining both spectral indices into a single classifier leads to the most accurate burned area map. The analysis by land cover type indicates that overall accuracy is highest for grasslands and savannas, with grasslands benefiting the most from the use of SWIR bands. Results also indicate that burned areas can be classified with accuracy measured by the Dice Coefficient close to 80% for fire sizes larger than 500 ha, which corresponds to 60% of the total burned area, but accuracy lower than 36% for fire sizes smaller than 250 ha. In particular, our analysis suggests that the validation of burned area products always should be linked to the description of fire size distribution since it is a fundamental driver of accuracy.Results show that MODIS daily burned area mapping at 250-500 m spatial resolution can exhibit high temporal accuracy, with almost unbiased estimates and standard deviation close to 1.5 days, indicating an accurate characterization of the spread of large fires.

TI  - Evaluation of soil-dependent crop yield outcomes in Nepal using ground and satellite-based approaches
T2  - FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Smallholder farmers face many constraints to achieving food security. Optimal soil management is often limited by a lack of accessible and accurate soil characterization, and an associated lack of soil-specific management practice recommendations. Crop yields depend on both soil quality and soil-mediated fertilizer responses. Existing research on soil-fertilizer interactions is primarily based on farm trials and/or survey data, which are resource intensive and typically restricted to local scales. High-resolution (similar to 10-meter) remote sensing data and digital soil maps provide a low cost, scalable alternative. Here, we deploy methods based on the Sentinel satellite constellation to estimate soil and fertilizer impacts on irrigated wheat grain yields in Nepal and to inform precision soil and nutrient management recommendations. We first combine field data with Sentinel-1 and Sentinel 2 imagery to delineate wheat cropping areas for 2016-2019 with 92 % accuracy. We then estimate wheat yields at 10-meter resolution using Sentinel-2 and weather covariates based on yield models parameterized from two different methods: 1) APSIM crop model simulations and 2) ground cropcuts from 147 fields. Using a large dataset of soil samples collected by the Nepal Agricultural Research Council, we examine the linear and nonlinear effects of soil properties on wheat yields. Finally, the soil maps were combined with a survey of field level crop management data and our yield estimates to test the interaction of soil quality with fertilizer effectiveness. Our ground-calibrated satellite model predicted yields with good accuracy (R-2 = 0.55), while the uncalibrated simulation-based approach had weaker but significant prediction accuracy (R-2 = 0.24). We find statistically significant gains in yield of 0.9-2.4 % are possible by increasing soil organic matter and zinc from highly deficient values to optimal values of 2.2 % organic matter (OM) and 0.67 ppm zinc (Zn). Using digital soil maps of Nepal produced by the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT), we map croplands deficient in zinc (Zn < 0.66 ppm) and organic matter (OM < 2.2 %) and find that 72 % of croplands in the Nepal Terai are experiencing less than optimal levels of these nutrients. We examine the effectiveness of nitrogen and zinc fertilizers, applied in amounts ranging from 0 to 150 kg ha(-1) and 0 to 15 kg ha(-1) respectively, in different soil quality regimes as determined by a soil quality index informed by standard relationships between crop yields and soil properties. Yields were significantly more responsive to zinc fertilizer inputs in soils with a higher than average soil quality but responded similarly to nitrogen inputs across different soils. Effects of soil and fertilizers on the simulation-based yield estimate were generally similar but less significant than effects on ground-calibrated yields. Overall, nitrogen and zinc increased ground-calibrated yields by 0.8 and 10.4 kg ha(-1) per kg of nutrient input, respectively. This research demonstrates the potential of satellite data, crop simulation, and machine learning to examine the influence of soils on yields and guide precision fertilizer use in smallholder regions.

M3  - Article
AB  - In the Atacama Region, Chile, a phenomenon known as the "flowering desert" (or "desert bloom") occurs, which is the result of infrequent precipitation events that regulate the amount of existing biota. In this context, this study graphs the spatial and temporal distribution of vegetation in the Region from 2000 to 2017. Vegetation areas have been determined using the MOD13Qproduct derived from the MODIS sensor. This product uses the NDVI factor, which detects vegetation vigor. For the analysis, the ArcPy library written in Python was used. Later graphs of the NDVI factor were generate, in addition to annual vegetation density maps of the vegetal cover. The results showed that 2017 was a year with 8 % more vegetation compared to 2015, being those years among the ones with larger vegetation cover according to Chilean Corporacion Nacional Forestal (CONAF). The maximum NDVI factor was concentrated in 2017, making this year the one with the highest amount of concentrated vegetation in the last 18 years. This amount of vegetation is increased between May to July mainly due to the presence of flowering related to the Flowering Desert which triples the surface of vegetation. This higher concentration of vegetation would not have been possible without the abundant rainfall that occurred during May of 2017.

M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires are a frequent problem in the protected wild areas of the Guanacaste Conservation Area (ACG from its Spanish initials), in Costa Rica. Low rainfalls, high temperatures, the dominance of deciduous ecosystems and favorable winds during the dry season generate propitious conditions for the spread of fires caused by vandalism or uncontrolled agricultural burning. Currently, remote sensing offers sufficient data, techniques and methodologies for mapping and evaluating the impact of fires on protected ecosystems. Since 2015, the SENTINEL mission offers multispectral images for various applications. This year 2020 fires were registered in the ACG neighborhood. Consequently, this study performed a mapping and evaluation of fires through the application of Normalized Calcination Indices.

In particular, a bi-directional Long Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) network was trained to classify active land uses and abandoned lands. A comparison exercise was undertaken to assess the classification power of the Bi-LSTM as compared to the random forest (RF) algorithm. The Bi-LSTM network outperformed the RF, and provided and overall accuracy of 97.5% when discriminating eleven land uses including abandoned lands. The results suggest the proposed methodology could potentially be implemented in an automated procedure to supervise the CAP requirements to access subsidies. In addition, the classification process also supports the continuous update of the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS), which allows paying agencies to uniquely identify land parcels in space, store records of land uses (and assess its evolution), and ultimately ease the declaration procedure to both farmers and paying agencies.

TI  - Sugarcane Yield Mapping Using High-Resolution Imagery Data and Machine Learning Technique
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Yield maps provide essential information to guide precision agriculture (PA) practices. Yet, on-board yield monitoring for sugarcane can be challenging. At the same time, orbital images have been widely used for indirect crop yield estimation for many crops like wheat, corn, and rice, but not for sugarcane. Due to this, the objective of this study is to explore the potential of multi-temporal imagery data as an alternative for sugarcane yield mapping. The study was based on developing predictive sugarcane yield models integrating time-series orbital imaging and a machine learning technique. A commercial sugarcane site was selected, and Sentinel-2 images were acquired from the beginning of the ratoon sprouting until harvesting of two consecutive cropping seasons. The predictive yield models RF (Random forest) and MLR (Multiple Linear Regression) were developed using orbital images and yield maps generated by a commercial sensor-system on harvesting. Original yield data were filtered and interpolated with the same spatial resolution of the orbital images. The entire dataset was divided into training and testing datasets. Spectral bands, especially the near-infrared at tillering crop stage showed greater contribution to predicting sugarcane yield than the use of derived spectral vegetation indices. The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) obtained for the RF regression based on multiple spectral bands was 4.63 Mg ha(-1) with an R-2 of 0.70 for the testing dataset. Overall, the RF regression had better performance than the MLR to predict sugarcane yield.

TI  - Bathymetric Retrieval Selectively Using Multiangular High-Spatial-Resolution Satellite Imagery
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article introduces multiangular imagery into physics-based bathymetry in order to compensate for the shortage of bathymetric spectral bands caused by the low spectral resolution of current high-spatial-resolution satellite multispectral imagery. The focus is to propose a selective bathymetric retrieval method to eliminate the negative effect of nonoptimal image data on depth retrieval in multiangular imagery-based bathymetry. The elimination of the negative effect is implemented by excluding nonoptimal pixels in every individual image from bathymetric retrieval. An empirical criterion is designed for the determination of nonoptimal pixels. The proposed method can use multiangular image data selectively, avoiding situations where bathymetric retrieval results from the whole multiangular imagery are poorer than that from a part of the individual images. The method was tested in two typical areas within the Xisha (Paracel) Islands of the South China Sea using two-angle WorldView-2 multispectral images. The test showed that the derived depths of the method (i.e., depths derived from the selective image data) provided a better fit to the validation depths than those from the entirety of both images. The underestimation of depths derived from the entirety of both images was also improved to some extent.

TI  - MODIS-based monitoring of spatial distribution of trophic status in 144 key lakes and reservoirs of China in summer of 2018
T2  - Hupo Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of the economy and society, the eutrophication of lakes and reservoirs in China is becoming increasingly serious. Satellite remote sensing has a great potential in the monitoring of water nutrient status, but little research exists on the monitoring and analysis of the water trophic status of lakes and reservoirs on a nationwide scale based on satellite remote sensing. In this study, MODIS data from summer 2018 was used to produce FUI index products, construction of evaluation method of lake and reservoir nutrition state based on FUI water color index and monitored the trophic status of 144 key lakes and reservoirs in China. The results show that the proportion of oligotrophic , mesotrophic , and eutrophic lakes and reservoirs is 16% , 24% , and 60% , respectively. The proportion of eutrophication is very high; the spatial distribution of trophic status is uneven, and the overall eutrophication is higher in the east than the west. Most reservoirs and lakes in the northeast and the east are eutrophic. The water bodies of western lakes are mostly oligotrophic to mesotrophic, an especially high percentage of oligotrophic in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau. Natural factors such as altitude and surface temperature, industrial point source, and agricultural non-point source pollution are important factors influencing the trophic state of lakes and reservoirs.

TI  - Hyperspectral and Infrared Image Collaborative Classification Based on Morphology Feature Extraction
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the development of sensor technology, fusion of multiple remote sensors has aroused wide attention in the earth observation area. In this article, we propose to integrate the complementary information of hyperspectral image (HSI) and infrared image (IFI) based on mathematical morphological methods. HSI contains rich spectral information and spatial information, but the operation methods using only hyperspectral data are still subject to many restrictions. IFI can capture infrared rays radiated in the object, but it has no advantage in dealing with complex terrain classification. HSI and IFI can acquire different information of objects, and the information between these two kinds of data has great complementarity. In order to make full use of the information provided by HSI and IFI, this article proposes an HSI and IFI collaborative classification framework based on a Threshold-based Local Contain Profile (TLCP), where TLCP is our new design for suppressing interferes within spatial extractions. Specifically, the spatial information of HSI and IFI is extracted by TLCP, and then, these features are integrated and fed into the support vector machine for object classification. Experimentally, we compare the proposed method with the existing LCP and EP and evaluate the collaborative framework using GF5 satellite data collected over Hebei Province in China. Final results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI  - Nonlinear Systematic Distortions Compensation in Satellite Images Based on an Equivalent Geometric Sensor Model Recovered From RPCs
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rational polynomial function is widely accepted as the preferred sensor model for high-resolution satellite imagery (HRSI). However, satellite images and their associated rational polynomial coefficients (RPCs) often suffer from nonlinear systematic errors, which were caused by attitude oscillation, sensor deformation, and many other imperfect calibration errors, thus affecting the geo-referencing accuracy. Instead of modeling the biases by polynomials in the image space or refining RPCs directly, this study proposes an approach of going back to the physical model and correcting the local distortions in a self-calibration block adjustment. The algorithm of an equivalent geometric sensor model (EGSM) recovery from RPCs is described in detail. As an equivalent form of the physical sensor models, EGSM reflects the complete viewing geometry of push-broom HRSI. The interior and exterior orientation parameters of EGSM can be stably recovered from RPCs without using any metadata. An approach of RPCs refinement by self-calibration block adjustment based on EGSM is introduced. This approach can effectively compensate for the nonlinear systematic errors caused by platforms and sensors similar to the approach of a rigorous sensor model. The performance of EGSM-based block adjustment is compared with the RFM-based bias compensation method. Experiments using ZY-3 images show the EGSM-based approach can effectively eliminate the nonlinear distortions in satellite images caused by sensor deformation and attitude vibrations. Furthermore, experiments using images from various satellites show that the original RFM can be well fitted with the EGSM and the residuals are smaller than 0.1 pixels for all test images.

TI  - Analyzing Changes in Frozen Soil in the Source Region of the Yellow River Using the MODIS Land Surface Temperature Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The degradation of the frozen soil in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) caused by climate warming has attracted extensive worldwide attention due to its significant effects on the ecosystem and hydrological processes. In this study, we propose an effective approach to estimate the spatial distribution and changes in the frozen soil using the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature products as inputs. A comparison with in-situ observations suggests that this method can accurately estimate the mean daily land surface temperature, the spatial distribution of the permafrost, and the maximum thickness of the seasonally-frozen ground in the source region of the Yellow River, located in the northeastern area of the QTP. The results of The Temperature at the Top of the Permafrost model indicates that the area of permafrost in the source region of the Yellow River decreased by 4.82% in the period from 2003 to 2019, with an increase in the areal mean air temperature of 0.35 degrees C/10 years. A high spatial heterogeneity in the frozen soil changes was revealed. The basin-averaged active layer thickness of the permafrost increased at a rate of 5.46 cm/10 years, and the basin-averaged maximum thickness of the seasonally-frozen ground decreased at a rate of 3.66 cm/10 years. The uncertainties in calculating the mean daily land surface temperature and the soil's thermal conductivity were likely to influence the accuracy of the estimation of the spatial distribution of the permafrost and the maximum thickness of the seasonally-frozen ground, which highlight the importance of the better integration of field observations and multi-source remote sensing data in order to improve the modelling of frozen soil in the future. Overall, the approach proposed in this study may contribute to the improvement of the application of the MODIS land surface temperature data in the study of frozen soil changes in large catchments with limited in-situ observations in the QTP.

TI  - Assessment of Spectra of the Atmospheric Infrared Ultraspectral Sounder on GF-5 and Validation of Water Vapor Retrieval
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric Infrared Ultraspectral Sounder (AIUS) aboard the Chinese GaoFen-5 satellite was launched on 9 May 2018. It is the first hyperspectral occultation spectrometer in China. The spectral quality assessment of AIUS measurements at the full and representative spectral bands was presented by comparing the transmittance spectra of measurements with that of simulations. AIUS measurements agree well with simulations. Statistics show that more than 73% of the transmittance differences are within +/- 0.05 and more than 91% of the transmittance differences are within +/- 0.1. The spectral windows for O-3, H2O, temperature, CO, CH4, and HCl were also analyzed. The comparison experiments indicate that AIUS data can provide reliable data for O-3, H2O, temperature, CO, CH4, and HCl detection and dynamic monitoring. The H2O profiles were then retrieved from AIUS measurements, and the precision, resolution, and accuracy of the H2O profiles are discussed. The estimated precision is less than 1.3 ppmv (21%) below 57 km and about 0.9-2.4 ppmv (20-31%) at 60-90 km. The vertical resolution of H2O profiles is better than 5 km below 32 km and about 5-8 km at 35-85 km. Comparisons with MLS Level 2 products indicate that the mean H2O profiles of AIUS have a good agreement with those of MLS. The relative differences are mostly within +/- 10% at 16-75 km and about 10-15% at 16-20 km in 60 degrees-80 degrees S. For 60 degrees-65 degrees S in December, the relative differences are within +/- 5% between 22 km and 80 km. The H2O profiles retrieved from AIUS measurements are credible for scientific research.

TI  - Land surface phenology as indicator of global terrestrial ecosystem dynamics: A systematic review
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Vegetation phenology is considered an important biological indicator in understanding the behaviour of ecosystems and how it responds to environmental cues. Changes in vegetation dynamics have been strongly linked to the variability of climate patterns and may have an important impact on the ecological processes of ecosystems, such as the land surface-atmosphere exchange of water and carbon, energy flows and interaction between different species. Land surface phenology (LSP) is the study of seasonal patterns in plant phenophases based on time series from vegetation indices (VI) or biophysical variables derived from satellite data, and has played an essential role in monitoring the response of terrestrial ecosystems to environmental changes from local to global scales. The goal of this systematic literature review is to provide a detailed synthesis of the main contributions of the global LSP research to the development of environmental knowledge and remote sensing science and technology, identifying possible gaps that could be addressed in the coming years.This systematic review found that the number of LSP studies has grown exponentially since the 1980s, although the analysis of phenological metrics or phenometrics derived from satellite data (i.e. proxies for the biological phenophases of plants) has focused specifically on ecosystems located in the mid- and high-altitude in the Northern Hemisphere (e.g. boreal forest/taiga, evergreen, deciduous or mixed temperate forest). LSP studies use different satellite dataset and methods to estimate phenometrics. These studies identified an advance in spring and a delay in autumn phenophases as general trends. Although these trends were associated mainly to changes in temperature and precipitation, phenological cycle dynamics might be related to other drivers, such as photoperiod, soil moisture or organic carbon content, among others. Therefore, this interaction between different climatic and non-climatic drivers make phenology modelling a difficult task.Hence, in the coming years, a greater integration of LSP data into ecological process modelling could provide a more complete overview on the terrestrial ecosystems functioning. Furthermore, different technical and methodological aspects (e.g. greater temporal coverage of recent high-spatial-resolution satellites, advances in remote-sensing technology or improved efficiency in the computational processing of geospatial data) may also contribute to improve our understanding of Earth's ecosystem dynamics and their environmental drivers.

TI  - Hate through a Canadian conservative movement worldview. The Christian Heritage Party on the Internet
T2  - POLITICA Y SOCIEDAD
M3  - Article
AB  - This article aims to capture the political imaginary of a Christian Canadian neoconservative party. The socio-anthropological analysis of the content of the Christian Heritage Party website describes the etiological, ontological, and axiological grammars that shapes the worldview of this political party. It shows how they mobilize the symbolic codes of the civil sphere to defile certain institutions (media, justice, parliament) or groups (elites, religious or gender minorities) and thus strengthen the contours of what would be a "good" Canadian society. These movements and actors are often sent outside the civil sphere and reduced to a pathology of the social system. However, these movements do not revolve in an independent orbit. They produce symbols and use communication institutions to disseminate their representations of good and evil through speeches. They justify their contempt for social movements, actors (especially leftist, LGBTQ activists, judges, medias) in the name of freedom, equality, or justice.

M3  - Software
AB  - Patterns in macroecology are related to species occurrence across meaningful spatial and temporal scales. The dataset provided here reports species distribution data (presence-absence) for herbaceous plants across a number of European habitats (ecoregions). Species occurrence is accompanied by the corresponding plant's maximun stem height values. This dataset has been used to unveil patterns of herbaceous plant height clustering in mid-latitude European ecoregions. Presence-absence data for herbaceous plants were drawn from Atlas Florae Europaeae (Jalas and Suominen, 1964-1999). Associated to each species, a dominant habitat (ecoregion) was assigned according to the WWF Biomes of the World classification. Each herbaceous species in an ecoregion was characterized by its maximum stem height. Mean height values were obtained for different sources. In order to correlate clustering patterns with productivity measures, actual evapotranspiration (AET) data is also provided. AET maps were obtained from data estimated through remote sensing (Mu et al., 2011), which are publicly available in the MODIS project website (http://www.ntsg.umt.edu/project/modis/mod17.php). Plant distribution and trait data across Europe unveils a relation between plant height clustering and actual evapotranspiration. This clustering is most evident in mid-latitude ecoregions, where conditions for growth (reflected in actual evapotranspiration rates) are optimal. Away from this optimum, climate severity leads to non-significant height clustering in actual communities.

Each cell was assigned to a dominant habitat type based on the WWF Biomes of the World classification (Olson et al., 2001), which defines different ecoregions. We consider each cell in an ecoregion to represent a species aggregation. TRAIT.Herba.csv: Mean height values were obtained from the LEDA database (Kleyer et al., 2008) for as many species as there were available in the database. Most of the missing values were taken from (Ordonez et al., 2010), and some of them inferred using a MICE (Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations) approach (Buuren and Groothuis-Oudshoorn, 2011). Based on plant growth forms, 2610 herbaceous species (aquatic, herbs, or graminoid) were considered in this dataset. MODIS_AET_mean.bil: Mean (annual) actual evapotranspiration maps were obtained from data estimated through remote sensing (Mu et al., 2011), which are publicly available in the MODIS project website (http://www.ntsg.umt.edu/project/modis/mod17.php). This data was put into a .bil format using QGIS. A map for European ecoregions is included in the file ecoregions.bil. CODE: Python code for replicability of the results is provided. randomize.py: performs randomization tests for each cell, by comparing with random samples taken from species in the corresponding ecoregion. It yields p-value distributions for each ecoregion, from which it is easy to compute height clustering indices. The variation of coexistence probabilities as function of competitive strengths can also be reproduced using the output file from this code. evapo_data.py: calculates ecoregional mean and std for actual evapotranspiration from MODIS data. Similar code can be used to obtain gross primary productivity averages. This code can be used to correlate AET with clustering indices and latitude. Note that this code can be easily adapted to obtain AET by cell instead of by ecoregion, using latitude and longitude defining each AFE cell. Copyright: MIT License Open Access

Most of the missing values were taken from (Ordonez et al., 2010), and some of them inferred using a MICE (Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations) approach (Buuren and Groothuis-Oudshoorn, 2011). Based on plant growth forms, 2610 herbaceous species (aquatic, herbs, or graminoid) were considered in this dataset. MODIS_AET_mean.bil: Mean (annual) actual evapotranspiration maps were obtained from data estimated through remote sensing (Mu et al., 2011), which are publicly available in the MODIS project website (http://www.ntsg.umt.edu/project/modis/mod17.php). This data was put into a .bil format using QGIS. A map for European ecoregions is included in the file ecoregions.bil. CODE: Python code for replicability of the results is provided. randomize.py: performs randomization tests for each cell, by comparing with random samples taken from species in the corresponding ecoregion. It yields p-value distributions for each ecoregion, from which it is easy to compute height clustering indices. The variation of coexistence probabilities as function of competitive strengths can also be reproduced using the output file from this code. evapo_data.py: calculates ecoregional mean and std for actual evapotranspiration from MODIS data. Similar code can be used to obtain gross primary productivity averages. This code can be used to correlate AET with clustering indices and latitude. Note that this code can be easily adapted to obtain AET by cell instead of by ecoregion, using latitude and longitude defining each AFE cell. Copyright: MIT License Open Access

M3  - Article
AB  - Throughout history, reservoirs have played a fundamental role in economic development. Darns transform landscapes, however, and create risks of irreversible impacts. Research on the environmental, social, and economic impacts is concentrated on large reservoirs, even though small reservoirs prevail in the landscape. In the Guariroba watershed a large reservoir has been created to supply the city of Campo Grande. Small reservoirs in the watershed have not yet been mapped or their environmental impacts analyzed. This work aimed to map the small reservoirs in the Guariroba watershed, and to analyze the associated environmental impacts, to generate information that can help with the planning and management of anthropic activities. The mapping was performed in a GIS using high spatial resolution satellite images available in World Imagery of ArcMap and historical images from Google Earth. For validation mapping, spectral indices of the dry (2019) and rainy (2020) season, were generated with images from the Sentinel-2A satellite. Sixty-six small reservoirs created by the construction of earth darns in natural watercourses have been mapped, located predominantly in the drainage headwaters, and 119 reservoirs in wetlands, mainly the riverine. Some of the mapped reservoirs did not have stored water, both in the dry and rainy periods. In the drainage headwaters, most of the springs were degraded, with exposed soil, mud sliding and the absence of surrounding Forest vegetation. Many reservoirs, used for animal drinking and fish farming, in riverside wetlands are also in the process of environmental degradation.

TI  - Google Earth Engine for land surface albedo estimation: comparison among different algorithms

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing for Agriculture, Ecosystems, and Hydrology XXIII
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Albedo has long been recognized as a relevant bio-geophysical variable to model Earth surface and it was involved in all the climate simulation models. Therefore, the correct modelling of albedo is essential to reduce the error propagation in the prediction algorithms. To meet such a purpose, different methods have been developed over the past years. Among them, the simplified approach proposed by Liang in 2000 and the corrected algorithm introduced by Silva et al. (2016) are commonly used. To the best of our knowledge, the outcomes produced by applying such techniques have not been investigated yet. The present paper is intended to explore the potentialities of Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform in estimating land surface albedo from three medium-resolution geospatial data gathered by different Landsat sensors in diverse acquisition periods. Java-script code was developed to numerically implement the above-mentioned algorithms in GEE environment. Their performances were compared and the error committed adopting the simplified method was quantified. As a result, the corrected algorithm reported more accurate values. Nevertheless, its complexity implies a high implementation difficulty and, consequently, a higher processing time is required to handle the data. Conversely, the simplified approach allowed to estimate land surface albedo in a short time. Quantifying the error committed using the simplified approach allows us to correct its results, improving their accuracy. Although obtained results are preliminary, this research enhanced the possibility to model the albedo by adopting the simplified algorithm after correcting it. This implies to reduce error propagation and, simultaneously, to speed up the data handling.

CL  - Cagliari, ITALY
AB  - Over the last decades, Earth's surface has suffered an intense urbanisation process that has impacted Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) and Earth's surface energy balance. Such a rapid and unexpected phenomenon was not carried out in a sustainable way compromising Earth's existence in the long term. Therefore, the United States identified 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to meet within 2030. To make the world more resilient and sustainable and combat climate changes, information concerning LULC conversion trends and land surface albedo is essential. Such variables are directly responsible for the increment and decrement of air and surface temperature and, consequently, to the Urban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon. The present paper explores Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform potentialities in investigating the relationship between LULC transformation and land surface albedo extracted from medium-resolution satellite data. The present analysis was performed on the study area of Berlin for 8 years, from 2011 to 2019. Two radiometrically and atmospherically corrected Landsat images were gathered from Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 missions, respectively. Once clouds have been masked, SwirTirRed (STRed) and Normalized Difference Bareness (version 1) (NDB all) indices were implemented to distinguish LULC types. Subsequently, LULC changes were assessed, and land surface albedo was estimated by programming a proper code. Thus, the relationship among those features was investigated in such areas in the considered period. GEE appears as the optimal solution to meet research goals and to extend the analysis at a global scale.

TI  - Landslide susceptibility zonation in the Tartagal River basin, Sierras Subandinas, Salta, Argentina
T2  - ANDEAN GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - On February 2009 intense rainfall triggered landslides in the Tartagal River basin that evolved into a debris flow that caused severe flooding in the town of Tartagal, Salta, Argentina. Based on these events, this paper presents a first attempt to map the landslides susceptibility in the Tartagal River basin. First, we elaborated an inventory map by using a 10 m pixel SPOT image acquired just after the disaster. Second, we evaluated a set of conditioning factors, which included lithology, slope and curvature; we derived the topographical variables from a 12.5 m pixel digital elevation model (DEM) based on a stereo-pair of satellite images ALOS-PRISM. Finally, we used these conditioning factors and the 2009 landslides inventory map as input for a heuristic model to elaborate the susceptibility map. The results indicated that landslides affected an area of 8 km(2) and that at least 2.2x10(6) m(3) of material were removed. The susceptibility map identified zones of low, moderate, high and very high susceptibility that occupied 18, 22, 25 and 17 km(2), respectively. Accuracy assessment using data covering landslides occurred in 2006 showed that 95% of them fell within the high and very high susceptibility areas. The results presented herein provide vital baseline information for future studies and may contribute for the development of landslide hazard mitigation strategies.

TI  - Detecting Macro Floating Objects on Coastal Water Bodies using Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - OCEANS 2021: SAN DIEGO - PORTO
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - OCEANS Conference
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - The oceans are increasingly being polluted with overwhelming quantities of anthropogenic litter. Other pollutants originate from natural components, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, that increase the intensity and frequency of algal blooms which in turn have similarly negative impacts on marine ecosystems and human lives. Diverse types of floating objects agglomerate on water surfaces due to environmental aggregation processes such as water currents, oceanic fronts or winds. In this paper, we focus on the detection of floating objects on Sentinel-2 images over coastal areas likely to contain litter. While individual floating objects are too small to be detected by medium-resolution satellite imagery, we take advantage of the aggregation processes that generate floating patches visible remotely on water bodies. Unlike previous methods that exclusively focus on the spectral responses of the targets, we leverage the capacity of data-driven deep learning models to learn and predict the spatial characteristics of floating objects. We build on previous work and provide an enriched database of hand-labelled Sentinel-2 images. In this paper, we focus on highlighting the performance of the used deep learning architectures for the detection of floating debris and also the complexity of the training problem. Throughout the quantitative results, we demonstrate how the performances differ depending on the chosen scenes for learning. We show that the generalization of the detection of floating patches is a challenging problem due to the important variety of regions resulting in domain shift issues.

T2  - Journal of South American Earth Sciences
M3  - Article
AB  - Variations in the physico-chemical characteristics of estuaries, such as surface water salinity and temperature, lead to the establishment of gradients that are closely related with the distribution of nutrients and suspended sediment. This affects light penetration, which in turn influences Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration and primary productivity. We used MODIS imagery to identify spatio-temporal patterns of sea surface salinity, temperature, and Chl-a concentrations from 2003 to 2017, to explore relationships between these variables and oceanographic factors, such as streamflows, winds and currents in the mouth of Colombia's Magdalena River, which discharges to the Caribbean Sea. Sea surface salinity (SSS) in the study zone varied in time and space from estuarine to marine. Mean SSS was 10.8 [plus or minus] 3.4 at Bocas de Ceniza, and 28.4 [plus or minus] 0.4 in the Caribbean Sea, with the horizontal salinity gradient providing evidence for the existence of a salinity plume. Mean monthly sea surface temperatures (SST) averaged across all years were 27.6 [plus or minus] 1.5 [degree]C at Bocas de Ceniza, and 27.6 [plus or minus] 1.3 [degree]C in the Caribbean Sea. A significant, increasing trend in temperature was observed throughout the years of the study period. Average Chl-a values were 3.3 [plus or minus] 1.4 mg m-3 at Bocas de Ceniza, and 1.5 [plus or minus] 1.2 mg m-3 in the Caribbean Sea and the calculated average Trophic State Index (TSI) for Bocas de Ceniza indicated that the estuary trophic state varied between oligo-mesotrophic (30 < TSI<=40) and mesotrophic (40 < TSI<=50). The highest concentrations of Chl-a were found in intermediate salinities in the estuarine zone. Outside the saline plume, there is a considerable decrease in Chl-a concentrations (<0.5 mg m-3). Winds played the most important role in influencing spatio-temporal distribution of chemical and physical variables in the study zone. Our results emphasize the importance of physical processes on biological dynamics in the Magdalena River mouth.

TI  - On the Performance of One-Stage and Two-Stage Object Detectors in Autonomous Vehicles Using Camera Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Object detection using remote sensing data is a key task of the perception systems of self-driving vehicles. While many generic deep learning architectures have been proposed for this problem, there is little guidance on their suitability when using them in a particular scenario such as autonomous driving. In this work, we aim to assess the performance of existing 2D detection systems on a multi-class problem (vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists) with images obtained from the on-board camera sensors of a car. We evaluate several one-stage (RetinaNet, FCOS, and YOLOv3) and two-stage (Faster R-CNN) deep learning meta-architectures under different image resolutions and feature extractors (ResNet, ResNeXt, Res2Net, DarkNet, and MobileNet). These models are trained using transfer learning and compared in terms of both precision and efficiency, with special attention to the real-time requirements of this context. For the experimental study, we use the Waymo Open Dataset, which is the largest existing benchmark. Despite the rising popularity of one-stage detectors, our findings show that two-stage detectors still provide the most robust performance. Faster R-CNN models outperform one-stage detectors in accuracy, being also more reliable in the detection of minority classes. Faster R-CNN Res2Net-101 achieves the best speed/accuracy tradeoff but needs lower resolution images to reach real-time speed. Furthermore, the anchor-free FCOS detector is a slightly faster alternative to RetinaNet, with similar precision and lower memory usage.

M3  - Data study
AB  - This dataset provides rice field maps of Japan from the 1980s. The rice field raster layers were created using Landsat images, by combining temporal aggregation and a phenology-base algorithm in Google Earth Engine. Each layer represents an averaged representation of the distribution of rice fields over a period of 5 years. Methods for creating the rice layers are fully described in the associated publication: Carrasco et. al. 2022. Historical mapping of rice fields in Japan using phenology and temporally aggregated Landsat images in Google Earth Engine. (Under review). The "Raw-maps" folder contains the seven rice field binary maps (seven different time periods; 1 = rice fields; 0 = non-rice fields) described in the associated publication.The "Post-processed-maps" folder contains the seven rice field maps with additional post-processing (1 = rice fields; Non-rice fields are set to NA values). This post-processing consists on (1) water-bodies masking, and (2) masking of Hokkaido municipalities where rice was not present during the last two decades. As discussed in the associated publication, rice fields were overestimated in Hokkaido. For this reason, by masking out rice fields in areas where rice fields were not present in recent times we can improve the accuracy of the mapping for this area. For this masking, we used official (field-based) data on rice field area of Hokkaido municipalities provided by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries of Japan. Unfortunately, those data were not available at the municipality level for all prefectures. Each raster file is in geographic coordinates and has an original spatial resolution of 30 m. The accuracy of the maps is presented in the associated publication.  We suggest users to check the associated documentation and to understand the uncertainties and limitations of this dataset.

TI  - Phytoplankton strengthen CO<sub>2</sub> uptake in the South Atlantic Ocean
T2  - PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The influence of phytoplankton groups on carbon dynamics was investigated during six oceanographic spring cruises (three cruises were carried out in 2009, and another three were conducted in 2011) between the western (Brazil) and eastern (Africa) South Atlantic margins. A seventh cruise crossed the South Atlantic during the early winter of 2015. Sea surface temperature and salinity, oceanic and atmospheric partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)), chlorophyll a and other phytoplankton pigment data were gathered. Net CO2 fluxes were calculated for each cruise, characterizing the ability of each region to take up atmospheric CO2. We quantified phytoplankton chemotaxonomic groups using the HPLC/CHEMTAX approach. Thus, this study aimed to improve our understanding of the distribution of phytoplankton groups and their connection with the carbon biogeochemical cycle in the South Atlantic Ocean. Our results showed significant variations in both the zonal and meridional patterns of phytoplankton groups and the associated CO2 uptake magnitudes. Diatoms and haptophytes dominated the coastal regions of Brazil and Africa, respectively, whereas the open ocean was dominated by haptophytes and the picoplanktonic cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus. The CO2 uptake capacity increased eastward from -7.1 mmol CO2 m(-2) d(-1) on the Brazilian coast to 27.6 mmol CO2 m(-2) d(-1) on the African coast. There was a significant negative relationship (p < 0.05) between the phytoplankton biomass and the difference in sea-air pCO(2) (Delta pCO(2)), with increasing CO2 uptake corresponding to increases in the biomasses of diatoms and haptophytes. Therefore, according to our analysis, haptophytes and diatoms were the main phytoplankton groups related to a high uptake of CO2 along the South Atlantic Ocean regions covered in this study. Thus, we encourage further investigations on their traits and vulnerabilities to future environmental change scenarios.

TI  - Instance Segmentation for Large, Multi-Channel Remote Sensing Imagery Using Mask-RCNN and a Mosaicking Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Instance segmentation is the state-of-the-art in object detection, and there are numerous applications in remote sensing data where these algorithms can produce significant results. Nevertheless, one of the main problems is that most algorithms use Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) images, whereas Satellite images often present more channels that can be crucial to improve performance. Therefore, the present work brings three contributions: (a) conversion system from ground truth polygon data into the Creating Common Object in Context (COCO) annotation format; (b) Detectron2 software source code adaptation and application on multi-channel imagery; and (c) large scene image mosaicking. We applied the procedure in a Center Pivot Irrigation System (CPIS) dataset with ground truth produced by the Brazilian National Water Agency (ANA) and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery (7 channels with 30-m resolution). Center pivots are a modern irrigation system technique with massive growth potential in Brazil and other world areas. The round shapes with different textures, colors, and spectral behaviors make it appropriate to use Deep Learning instance segmentation. We trained the model using 512 x 512-pixel sized patches using seven different backbone structures (ResNet50- Feature Pyramid Network (FPN), Resnet50-DC5, ResNet50-C4, Resnet101-FPN, Resnet101-DC5, ResNet101-FPN, and ResNeXt101-FPN). The model evaluation used standard COCO metrics (Average Precision (AP), AP(50), AP(75), AP(small), AP(medium), and AR(100)). ResNeXt101-FPN had the best results, with a 3% advantage over the second-best model (ResNet101-FPN). We also compared the ResNeXt101-FPN model in the seven-channel and RGB imagery, where the multi-channel model had a 3% advantage, demonstrating great improvement using a larger number of channels. This research is also the first with a mosaicking algorithm using instance segmentation models, where we tested in a 1536 x 1536-pixel image using a non-max suppression sorted by area method. The proposed methodology is innovative and suitable for many other remote sensing problems and medical imagery that often present more channels.

AB  - This work aims to assess inter-seasonal changes of a supervised classification in San Juan city and surroundings, Argentina, focusing on urban land use. A land cover supervised classification was performed from Landsat 8 (OLI) and Sentinel-1 SAR images and a spectral indices set. This classification showed a right class differentiation (Short/medium vegetation, Medium/tall vegetation, Bare soil, Erodible sediment, Rocky Material, Urban and Peri-urban), however, variations of the Urban class area between winter and summer seasons were observed. Alternatively, a classification based on VIIRS (NOAA-20) night lights images was performed. Although this second classification shows significant inter-seasonal differences, these can be explained by the vegetation medium/tall (trees) contrast between both seasons. A combination of day and night images classification was carried out, which represents an improvement over previous work on the seasonal stability of the Urban and Peri-urban classes. The obtained map is suitable to be used in future studies on the region.

TI  - Reconstruction of Multi-Temporal Satellite Imagery by Coupling Variational Segmentation and Radiometric Analysis
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital images, and in particular satellite images acquired by different sensors, may present defects due to many causes. Since 2013, the Landsat 7 mission has been affected by a well-known issue related to the malfunctioning of the Scan Line Corrector producing very characteristic strips of missing data in the imagery bands. Within the vast and interdisciplinary image reconstruction application field, many works have been presented in the last few decades to tackle the specific Landsat 7 gap-filling problem. This work proposes another contribution in this field presenting an original procedure based on a variational image segmentation model coupled with radiometric analysis to reconstruct damaged images acquired in a multi-temporal scenario, typical in satellite remote sensing. The key idea is to exploit some specific features of the Mumford-Shah variational model for image segmentation in order to ease the detection of homogeneous regions which will then be used to form a set of coherent data necessary for the radiometric reconstruction of damaged regions. Two reconstruction approaches are presented and applied to SLC-off Landsat 7 data. One approach is based on the well-known histogram matching transformation, the other approach is based on eigendecomposition of the bands covariance matrix and on the sampling from Gaussian distributions. The performance of the procedure is assessed by application to artificially damaged images for self-validation testing. Both of the proposed reconstruction approaches had led to remarkable results. An application to very high resolution WorldView-3 data shows how the procedure based on variational segmentation allows an effective reconstruction of images presenting a great level of geometric complexity.

TI  - Thirty-two years of mangrove forest land cover change in Parita Bay, Panama
T2  - FOREST SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests have experienced a rapid decline. However, the rate of loss has decreased in recent years due to enhanced conservation and nature regeneration. The dynamics of mangrove forests in Panama have not been monitored since the year 2000, despite a significant loss during the 1980s. The objectives of our study were to quantify changes in mangrove cover and identify the dominant drivers of change in Parita Bay, Panama. Temporal changes in mangrove cover and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were determined using the supervised classification method on Landsat satellite images from 1987 to 2019. We identified a 4.7% increase in the mangrove area of Parita Bay during the 32 years; the mangrove forests were also considered healthy as reflected by high NDVI values. However, the conversion of mangroves to other land cover types resulted in a 1.26% decline in mangrove cover from 1987 to 1998. Moreover, the area of aquaculture and saltpans almost doubled during this period. During the following two decades, the conversion of other land cover classes (water, other vegetation, and bare soil) increased the mangrove area by 6%, and the annual rate of increase was greater during the second decade (0.43% year(-1)). From 2009 to 2019, mangroves declined at an annual rate of 0.11% in protected areas and increased at an annual rate of 0.50% in unprotected areas. Despite the regeneration potential of mangrove forests, our study highlights the need to continually manage and protect mangrove forests in order to facilitate their expansion in Parita Bay.

AB  - The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a well-known indicator of the greenness of the biomes. NDVI data are typically derived from satellites (such as Landsat, Sentinel-2, SPOT, Pleiades) that provide images in visible red and near-infrared bands. However, there are two main complications in satellite image acquisition: 1) orbits take several days to be completed, which implies that NDVI data are not daily updated; 2) the usability of satellite images to compute the NDVI value of a given area depends on the local meteorological conditions during satellite transit. Indeed, the discontinuous availability of up to date NDVI data is detrimental to the usability of NDVI as an indicator supporting agricultural decisions, e.g., whether to irrigate crops or not, as well as for alerting purposes. In this work, we propose a multivariate multi-step NDVI forecasting method based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. By careful selection of publicly available but relevant input data, the proposed method has been able to predict with high accuracy NDVI values for the next 1, 2 and 3 days considering regional data of interest.

TI  - Evaluation of a CONUS-Wide ECOSTRESS DisALEXI Evapotranspiration Product
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The atmosphere-land exchange inverse disaggregation (DisALEXI) algorithm is a multi-scale energy balance model that estimates evapotranspiration (ET) using land-surface temperature (LST) as a driving remote sensing input. Using LST products from ECOSTRESS, a thermal radiometer mounted on the International Space Station, DisALEXI ET products have been produced over the contiguous United States (CONUS) at 70 m resolution. The goal of this study is to demonstrate the accuracy of the CONUS-wide ET produced by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and to compare the results with the original DisALEXI ET produced by researchers at the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). DisALEXI-USDA has been produced ad-hoc using Landsat LST, and is routinely produced over six target sites using ECOSTRESS LST. DisALEXI-JPL was implemented in order to expand the spatial coverage. DisALEXI-JPL was evaluated at 26 CONUS eddy covariance sites, showing good correlation, with R-2 = 0.80 and RMSE = 0.81 mm/day, which is comparable to previous DisALEXI validation studies (RMSE similar to 1 mm/day). The two DisALEXI implementations compared well, with R-2 = 0.92. This article evaluates DisALEXI-JPL and shows that the algorithm is valid over a larger segment of CONUS. We also show the impact of quality flags, as pixels with high view zenith angles or high aerosol optical depth showed greater deviation from field measurements. As a product demonstration, we show a regional map of fine-scale ET, where the fine-scale variation over wider areas can detect small areas of stress much sooner than products with coarse resolution representing average conditions.

TI  - Patterns of ecosystem functioning as a tool for biological regionalization: the case of the Mediterranean-desert-tropical transition of Baja California
T2  - MEDITERRANEAN BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale ecological variations across Earth have impor t a n t consequences for biodiversity and, therefore, for biological conservation. Despite the widespread use of ecological maps in conservation schemes, they have been based mainly on structural and compositional features but scarcely on functional dimensions of life. Incorporating functional variables complements and improves the descriptions of regionalizations and offers a new understanding of biodiversity patterns. The development of remote sensing measurement allows for the description of the functional patterns of ecosystems through Ecosystem Functional Types (EFTs), opening new opportunities to analyze the geography of life. This article aims to examine the relationships between ecological regionalization based on components and structure and patterns of ecosystem functioning. As proof of case, we chose the Baja California peninsula, whose singularity has generated a rich variety of ecological and biogeographical interpretations, mainly based on ecosystem components and structure. We hypothesize that patterns in ecosystem functioning reflect ecoregionalization based on composition and structure features. We identified Ecosystem Functional Types (EFTs), from three descriptors of the seasonal curves of MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from 2001 to 2017. We characterized each ecoregion in terms of ecosystem functioning and we carried out a correspondence analysis between the EFTs classification and the ecoregions. At a large scale, EFTs showed a pattern with three general regions from northwest to south, capturing the north-south transition of climatic regimes shown in the ecoregions map, from the northwestern Mediterranean area to the southern tropical zone, with a desert transition area between them. However, differences between the functional characterization and some ecoregions were detected in ecoregions identified as discrepancy areas between authors. In particular, some ecoregions considered Mediterranean showed a Desert character in its functioning, and others considered as Desert were Tropical functionally. EFTs remotely sensed measured at regional scales provide the basis for a more comprehensive regionalization of geographical patterns of life and, therefore, an improvement for future conservation purposes.

TI  - EVALUATING THE POTENTIALITIES OF COPERNICUS VERY HIGH RESOLUTION (VHR) OPTICAL DATASETS FOR ASSESSING THE SHORELINE EROSION HAZARD IN MICROTIDAL ENVIRONMENTS
T2  - PLANET CARE FROM SPACE
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - In the past years, several studies have shown that Earth Observation (EO) data can be successfully used for analysing shoreline evolution trends and assessing coastal erosion hazard/risk. Within this framework, the exploitation of long-term archives of sensors data characterised by moderate spatial resolution (e.g., Landsat) has shown its potential; particularly in higher energy coastal environments (e.g., Oceanic areas) where the magnitude of long-term erosion/accretion processes (e.g., decadal) can be resolved by the abovementioned sensors. However, the spatial resolution of these data may prevent an accurate analysis in microtidal coastal environments (e.g., Mediterranean Sea), especially for analyses focused on a short-term period (e.g., few years). This is mainly due to the high level of uncertainty associated with the occurrence of erosion/accretion processes of lower magnitude detected by EO sensors retaining a moderate spatial resolution. Within this context, this work was conceived to evaluate the potentialities of the Copernicus Very High Resolution (VHR) optical datasets (spatial resolution: 2-4 m) for assessing the shoreline evolution trends in an exemplifying urbanised coastal area of the Mediterranean Sea (i.e., Lido di Ostia, Rome, Italy), over a short-term period (i.e., 4 years). To achieve this objective, an automatic technique of shoreline detection and extraction at subpixel level was tested. Results allowed to: i) detect a shoreline evolution trend coherent with the geomorphological characteristics of the study area; ii) smoothly identify/quantify fine-scale variations of accretion/erosion patterns along the coast. This is extremely important to map the areas most exposed to shoreline erosion hazard/risk.

TI  - Attentive Spatial Temporal Graph CNN for Land Cover Mapping From Multi Temporal Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite image time series (SITS) collected by modern Earth Observation (EO) systems represent a valuable source of information that supports several tasks related to the monitoring of the Earth surface dynamics over large areas. A main challenge is then to design methods able to leverage the complementarity between the temporal dynamics and the spatial patterns that characterize these data structures. Focusing on land cover classification (or mapping) tasks, the majority of approaches dealing with SITS data only considers the temporal dimension, while the integration of the spatial context is frequently neglected. In this work, we propose an attentive spatial temporal graph convolutional neural network that exploits both spatial and temporal dimensions in SITS. Despite the fact that this neural network model is well suited to deal with spatio-temporal information, this is the first work that considers it for the analysis of SITS data. Experiments are conducted on two study areas characterized by different land cover landscapes and real-world operational constraints (i.e., limited labeled data due to acquisition costs). The results show that our model consistently outperforms all the competing methods obtaining a performance gain, in terms of F-Measure, of at least 5 points with respect to the best competing approaches on both benchmarks.

AB  - According to Lee Young-geum, the ideas of grievance resolution and mutual beneficence were already present in shamanism. She also insists that Jeungsan merely theorized upon these ideas by inheriting them and his religious activities must be identified from within a shamanistic worldview. Contrary to Lee’s claim, Cha Seon-keun argues that the grievance resolution of Jeungsan is far beyond the contents and level of development found in shamanism. He also insists that Jeungsan’s religious activities must be identified as having a certain orderly uniqueness distinct from shamanism.The argument between these two different perspectives has not attracted other researchers besides those who are directly involved. However, this debate deserves attention with regard to the problem of how one approaches a given religion and which academic perspective should be applied.Based on the perspective of the Daesoon Jinrihoe, this study examines their debate by considering four issues. Firstly, whether Jeungsan inherited or expanded upon the subject of grievance resolution and its range remains undetermined. Secondly, the ethics of mutual beneficence and grateful reciprocation in Jeungsan’s concept of grievance resolution should be analyzed as to whether that idea reasserts the ethics of shamanism. Thirdly, it is necessary to study whether his method of grievance resolution fully embraced the methods of grievance resolution that exist in shamanism. Lastly, it should be determined whether or not Jeungsan’s religious activities and system of thought should be identified within a shamanistic worldview.Through this review, Lee and Cha can be shown to have different opinions on the academic approach to research on religion. Accordingly, this study concludes that Lee’s method of only interpreting Jeungsan’s religious thought via a shamanic worldview is incompatible with academic methodology. A scholar of religious studies should discuss Jeungsan on his own merits rather than just imply that Jeungsan thoroughly reflects the worldview of shamanism, doctrinal studies of Buddhism, and Daoist thought as well as other theologies. In other words, if certain tangible and intangible elements found in shamanism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Daoism, and Christianity are also observed in Jeungsan’s religious thought, it is necessary to comprehend how different or similar those elements are or whether they are re-interpreted in any manner. In the case of Lee, her method of overemphasizing similarities is now criticized as outdated. Nowadays, it is necessary to demonstrate awareness of modern religious studies tendency to pay equal attention to similarities and differences.

T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF PATHOLOGY AND MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Primary cutaneous apocrine carcinomas are rare cutaneous adnexal neoplasm with less than 100 cases reported in the literature. The tumor arises in areas rich in apocrine glands particularly axilla, modified apocrine glands such as ceromucinous and Moll's glands. Most of these carcinomas are indolent and slowly growing but few rapidly progressive and extremely aggressive? cases have also been reported. Wide local excision with clear margins and sentinel lymph node biopsy is standard treatment of choice.This case was of much interest from the diagnostic point of view both microscopically as well as immunohistochemically. We report a case of 46-year-old man who presented to our hospital with an ulcerated painless nodular mass in his right axilla.With combined use of microscpic features, special stains and immunohistochemical examination the case was correctly diagnosed as primary cutaneous apocrine carcinoma.

M3  - Article
AB  - The Great Shigir Idol is the largest anthropomorphic wooden sculpture in the world, a unique work of Stone Age art, and a valuable source for reconstructing the material culture and worldview of the ancient population of Northern Eurasia. Although study of it began more than 100 years ago, a number of issues, such as the place of discovery, context, date, methods of exhibition, etc., remain controversial. This article analyses archival documents relevant to the location and time of discovery of the Great Shigir Idol, and on the accompanying finds. The results of a recent comprehensive study conducted by Russian and German archaeologists and scientists in 2014 are outlined. The focus is on the analysis of AMS radiocarbon dates, spanning a period from the Late Pleistocene (similar to 10,500 cal BC) to the Late Mesolithic/Early Neolithic (similar to 6000 cal BC). These dates show a considerable range of variation, and they disagree with those derived from the conventional radiocarbon dating in 1997. Paleogeographic and archaeological data from the Trans-Urals do not support the early (9600-9000 cal BC) estimates of the time of the idol's creation, but rather correspond to later ones, derived from the AMS C-14 analysis conducted in 2014. Therefore, it is necessary to continue the study of Mesolithic sites and paleoclimate of the Urals, determine the nature of primary peat formation at the Ural peatlands, and assess their age and that of the microremains of peat in early cracks in the idol, etc.

TI  - Improving the Accuracy of Multiple Algorithms for Crop Classification by Integrating Sentinel-1 Observations with Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The availability of an unprecedented amount of open remote sensing data, such as Sentinel-1 and -2 data within the Copernicus program, has boosted the idea of combining the use of optical and radar data to improve the accuracy of agricultural applications such as crop classification. Sentinel-1's Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) provides co- and cross-polarized backscatter, which offers the opportunity to monitor agricultural crops using radar at high spatial and temporal resolution. In this study, we assessed the potential of integrating Sentinel-1 information (VV and VH backscatter and their ratio VH/VV with Sentinel-2A data (NDVI) to perform crop classification and to define which are the most important input data that provide the most accurate classification results. Further, we examined the temporal dynamics of remote sensing data for cereal, horticultural, and industrial crops, perennials, deciduous trees, and legumes. To select the best SAR input feature, we tried two approaches, one based on classification with only SAR features and one based on integrating SAR with optical data. In total, nine scenarios were tested. Furthermore, we evaluated the performance of 22 nonparametric classifiers on which most of these algorithms had not been tested before with SAR data. The results revealed that the best performing scenario was the one integrating VH and VV with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and cubic support vector machine (SVM) (the kernel function of the classifier is cubic) as the classifier with the highest accuracy among all those tested.

TI  - Fully convolutional recurrent networks for multidate crop recognition from multitemporal image sequences
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop recognition in tropical regions is a challenging task because of the highly complex crop dynamics, with multiple crops per year. Nevertheless, most automatic methods proposed thus far are devoted to temperate areas where normally a single crop is cultivated along the crop year. This paper introduces convolutional recurrent networks for crop recognition in areas characterized by complex spatiotemporal dynamics typical of tropical agriculture, where a per date classification is required. The proposed networks consist of two sequential steps. First, a deep network simultaneously models spatial and temporal contexts. Second, a post-processing algorithm enforces prior knowledge about the crop dynamics in the target area based on the posterior probabilities computed in the first step. The paper proposes deep network architectures that join a fully convolutional network (FCN) for modeling spatial context at multiple levels and a bidirectional recurrent neural network to explore the temporal context. The recurrent network is configured as N-to-N, where N is the sequence length. This allows it to produce classification outcomes for the entire sequence of multi-temporal images using a single network. Different network designs are proposed based on three FCN architectures: U-Net, dense network, and Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling. A convolutional Long-Short-Term-Memory (ConvLSTM) accounts for sequence modeling, whereas the Most Likely Class Sequence (MLCS) algorithm is adopted for enforcing prior knowledge. The paper finally reports experiments conducted on Sentinel-1 data of two publicly available datasets from different tropical regions. The experimental results indicated that the proposed architectures outperformed state-of-the-art methods based on recurrent networks in terms of Overall Accuracy and per-class F1 score.

TI  - Biden vs Trump: Modeling US General Elections Using BERT Language Model
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Social media plays a crucial role in shaping the worldview during election campaigns. Social media has been used as a medium for political campaigns and a tool for organizing protests; some of which have been peaceful, while others have led to riots. Previous research indicates that understanding user behaviour, particularly in terms of sentiments expressed during elections can give an indication of the election outcome. Recently, there has been tremendous progress in language modelling with deep learning via long short-term memory (LSTM) models and variants known as bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT). Motivated by these innovations, we develop a framework to model the US general elections. We investigate if sentiment analysis can provide a means to predict election outcomes. We use the LSTM and BERT language models for Twitter sentiment analysis leading to the US 2020 presidential elections. Our results indicate that sentiment analysis can provide a general basis for modelling election outcomes where the BERT model indicates Biden winning the elections.

TI  - Impact assessment of Corridor Oriented development <i>A case of urban agglomerations of India</i>
T2  - INTERNATIONAL REVIEW FOR SPATIAL PLANNING AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanisation has been a factor affecting cities negatively and irreversibly in developing countries like India, adversely leading to depleting natural resources and promoting unbalanced and uneven urbanism. To handle the influx of population into core urban regions and to promote holistic, sustainable development, government and planning agencies are now looking upon regional development. Developing countries like India has laid plans for future urban corridor-oriented development. This study aims to understand the urban growth of two major developing cities influenced by transport corridor through a methodological approach using multi-temporal satellite data and its position in India's network of cities. Land use analysis was validated with the aid of measures such as overall accuracy and kappa statistics, with good values of more than 85% and 0.75 respectively were achieved. The hierarchical network analysis indicated five different clusters based on the urban growth rate. Among these clusters, Bangalore, Ahmedabad and Pune cluster was further shortlisted for analysis based on the urban transport corridor affecting the growth of these cities. Cellular automata-based SLEUTH model was adopted in this work to carefully observe sub-division level details of the region under the influence of the corridor. Exhaustive calibration, with three phases of coarse, fine and final, validation procedure along with statistical fit measures reveal urban expansion for Ahmedabad region has witnessed an increase from 497.50 km(2) (2017) to 826.24 km(2) (2025) while Pune region has experienced tremendous urban area transformation of 901.11 km(2) in the year 2025 against 497.27 km(2) in 2017. Results of this analysis would help policymakers and planners to inculcate decisions concerning future urban trends accommodating safer, healthier, sustainable and liveable urban ecosystem.

AB  - Historically the church is a shelter for the soul and has raised spiritual leaders for the next generation. It was also a community that worked to expand the Gospel by serving the diaspora. But now everything has stopped for a while due to COVID-19. Now is the time to go back to the Word of God and think deeply about what God’s will is and to start anew by solidifying the foundation of the church.Looking back on the history of the church, the church and theology have always been in conflict in the field of debate and faith according to the form and field of theology and faith. However in the 21st century the great religion of salvation known as Christianity is fighting against a completely different form of religious belief. Until now we have devoted ourselves to a theological movement centered on scholarship rather than a godly movement filled with spiritual life, that is God's heart for “salvation of soul”and spiritual development.Most theologians and pastors say this is the time for the second Reformation. However no concrete alternative has been proposed for how to reform. In order to overcome this reality God's salvation plan for multi-ethnic and diverse cultures must be achieved through the Reformed Life Theology Movement. At the same time establishing a worshiping community of diverse people and expanding evangelism through the gospel faith could be a new alternative.Reformed Life theology aims to achieve a restoration centered on the word of the Bible from a biblical point of view and restoration of theology. And the identity chaos of the theology of the 21st century, social science upheaval and human limitations in the age of demographic cliffs, AI(artificial intelligence) and the 4th industrial revolution, ‘axis shift’(How Today’s Trends Will Collide and Reshape the Future of Everything), ‘post corona’ era, climate crisis, industry, mobility, etc. It aims to spread the Gospel of God to the world based on a biblical perspective in the future situation after COVID-19. This goal-centered theological movement should soon achieve globalization through Reformed Life Theology but the expression “the world churchization of Reformed Life Theology sounds unfamiliar to many Korean theologians and church members.In order to find the theological direction for the globalization of Reformed Life theology, this presentation is based on church history: the patriarchal era, the medieval theology, the era of the Reformation, the 17th-18th century pietism, the 18th-19th century liberalism and the 20th century modern theology. By briefly examining the flow of the theology of the century, I would like to examine the direction in which Reformed Life theology will be recognized by the world theological world.When looking at the history of mankind, the church exerts a powerful force in proclaiming, teaching and healing the gospel of the kingdom of God. The movement to change the world by receiving the Spirit of God through salvation and exemption from God’s judgment and eternal life and forgiveness of sins and regeneration should take place and should continue.

TI  - Rice-Field Mapping with Sentinel-1A SAR Time-Series Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposed a feature-based decision method for the mapping of rice cultivation by using the time-series C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data provided by Sentinel-1A. In this study, a model related to crop growth was first established. The model was developed based on a cubic polynomial function which was fitted by the complete time-series SAR backscatters during the rice growing season. From the developed model, five rice growth-related features were introduced, including backscatter difference (BD), time interval (TI) between vegetative growth and maturity stages, backscatter variation rate (BVR), average normalized backscatter (ANB) and maximum backscatter (MB). Then, a decision method based on the combination of the five extracted features was proposed to improve the rice detection accuracy. In order to verify the detection performance of the proposed method, the test data set of this study consisted of 50,000 rice and non-rice fields which were randomly sampled from a research area in Taiwan for simulation verification. From the experimental results, the proposed method can improve overall accuracy in rice detection by 6% compared with the method using feature BD. Furthermore, the rice detection efficiency of the proposed method was compared with other four classifiers, including decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA). The experimental results show that the proposed method has better rice detection accuracy than the other four classifiers, with an overall accuracy of 91.9%. This accuracy is 3% higher than fine SVM, which performs best among the other four classifiers. In addition, the consistency and effectiveness of the proposed method in rice detection have been verified for different years and studied regions.

Railway Infrastructure Classification and Instability Identification Using Sentinel-1 SAR and Laser Scanning Data.Sensors (Switzerland), 20(24), 1-16. [7108]. https://doi.org/10.3390/s20247108 - Open AccessSatellite radar interferometry (InSAR) techniques have been successfully applied for structural health monitoring of line-infrastructure such as railway. Limited by meter-level spatial resolution of Sentinel-1 satellite radar (SAR) imagery and meter-level geolocation precision, it is still challenging to (1) categorize radar scatterers (e.g., persistent scatterers (PS)) and associate radar scatterers with actual objects along railways, and (2) identify unstable railway segments using InSAR Line of Sight (LOS) deformation time series from a single viewing geometry. In response to this, (1) we assess and improve the 3-D geolocation quality of Sentinel-1 derived PS using a 2-step method for PS 3-D geolocation improvement aided by laser scanning data; after geolocation improvement, we step-wisely classify railway infrastructure into rails, embankments and surroundings; (2) we recognize unstable rail segments by utilizing the (localized) differential settlement of rails in the normal direction (near vertical) which is yielded from the LOS deformation decomposition. We tested and evaluated the methods using 170 Sentinel-1a/b ascending data acquired between January 2017 and December 2019, over the Betuwe freight train track, in the Netherlands. The results show that 98% PS were associated with real objects with a significance level of 25%, the PS settlement measurements were generally in line with the in-situ track survey Rail Infrastructure aLignment Acquisition (RILA) measurements, and the standard deviations of the PS settlement measurements varied slightly with an average value of 6.16 mm Copyright: info:eu-repo/semantics/restrictedAccess License: http://dans.knaw.nl/en/about/organisation-and-policy/legal-information/DANSLicence.pdf

TI  - Collaborative Coupled Hyperspectral Unmixing Based Subpixel Change Detection for Analyzing Coastal Wetlands
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Owing to the complicated and heterogeneous distribution characteristics of wetland features, the existing hyperspectral technology is difficult to investigate the inner-pixel subtle changes. In this article, we present a subpixel change detection method based on collaborative coupled unmixing (SCDUM) for monitoring coastal wetlands. A novel multitemporal and spatial scale collaborative endmember extraction method based on joint spatial and spectral information is proposed. In the proposed method, the multitemporal hyperspectral images are first jointly clustered and segmented based on multifeature fusion of spectral features, texture features, and shape features. Then, a different spatial scale nonnegative matrix factorization based on original and downsampled multitemporal hyperspectral images is proposed to accurately extract the pure endmembers of each segmented images. Finally, the global abundance of the multitemporal image is effectively estimated for change detection. In addition, in order to verify the accuracy of the change detection results without reference, an accuracy verification strategy by using high spatial resolution Sentinel-2A image as auxiliary data is implemented. The Yellow River Estuary coastal wetland was selected as the research area, and the Gaofen-5 and ZY-1 02D hyperspectral images were used as the research data. In particular, the proposed method not only provides the overall change information, but also obtains the component of change direction and intensity of each kind of endmember, and the experimental results show that the SCDUM gives more accurate detection results, with closer to the endmember spectral curves of real objects, compared with other state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - Urban green infrastructure health assessment, based on landsat 8 remote sensing and entropy landscape metrics
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental changes significantly affect urban ecological systems that are supported by green infrastructure. Therefore, assessment of the health of green infrastructure is virtually a quality assessment of the residential environment. For the sustainable and healthy management of urban environments, we need an effective system for estimating, diagnosing, and constructing assessment tools for green infrastructure. In this study, remote sensing technology was used to assess the green infrastructure of the Taipei metropolitan area (Taiwan) in a systematic way. To this end, we used the comprehensive index method of vigor, organization, and resilience (VOR) to classify a landscape index and to construct a healthy assessment index. We determined the primary index and weights using the entropy weighting method to establish the assessment model. We show that the core of the metropolitan area lacks green infrastructure with the lowest VOR index, thus indicating that this district requires government-supervised intervention and improvement. We prove that the increase in green infrastructure has a promoting effect on the impact of various health assessment evaluations, and it will gradually slow down and get stabilized after reaching a certain degree. The entropy weighting method can make the data model more stable and reliable, making the results more representative.

M3  - Article
AB  - Zhenghe's epoch-making voyages and the subsequent European expansive maritime exploration have exacted varied historical impacts and impressions upon the world. This paper argues that the contrasts stem from their radically different underlying belief systems, namely Confucianism and Christianity. In the East, the Confucian's monistic and polytheistic ethos, coupled with a sanguine and circular worldview, underpinned Imperial China's multilateral and restrained approach in dealing with the outside world. In the West, the Christian's dualistic and monotheistic creed, together with a melancholic and linear worldview, moulded European Imperialism's unilateral and forthright strategy to transform the world. Aside from the past, these divergent philosophical and religious worldviews continue to affect the present, including the current China and US geopolitical and civilizational rivalry.

TI  - A Multiple-Jammer Deceptive Jamming Method Based on Particle Swarm Optimization Against Three-Channel SAR GMTI
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional deceptive jamming methods effectively generate false targets against three-channel synthetic aperture radar ground moving target indication (SAR GMTI). However, effectiveness of traditional methods is limited to azimuth distance between two jammers. When the distance requirement is not satisfied, the jamming amplitude coefficients will be too high to be used by jammers. To overcome this disadvantage, a novel multiple-jammer deceptive jamming method is proposed. The intercepted radar signal is retransmitted and performed by amplitude and time-delay modulation. Then, jamming signal is first modeled as a polynomial function where the polynomial order is equal to the number of jammers. The interferometric phase difference between a moving target and a false target is utilized as an objective function, the azimuth relocated position difference between a moving target and a false target is utilized as the constraint to reduce computational burden, and the optimal jamming amplitude coefficients are estimated by solving the optimization problem based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO). Hereby, the optimal jamming amplitude coefficients and gain calculated with the proposed method will be lower than those calculated with traditional methods when the distance requirement is not satisfied. By utilizing the optimal coefficients and jamming amplitude gain, a false target generated with the proposed method will be detected by displaced phase center antenna (DPCA) technique and be relocated in the desired position by along-track interferometry (ATI) technique. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB  - Christian social workers need to have a sense of mission or positive consciousness about their work to improve a sense of mission, job satisfaction, and service quality. However, because of the tendency which is faith and profession must be separated and the taboo the application of religion in social welfare practice, Christian social workers in practice have difficulties in applying and practicing Christian social welfare.This study explored the subjective recognition type of Christian social welfare by Christian social workers. To achieve the purpose of the study, this study used Q methodology that is useful in identifying the feelings, attitudes, beliefs, perceptions of the people. Specifically, after selecting Q samples of Christian social welfare through literature reviews and interviews, Q survey was conducted on 24 Christian social workers.According to the study, there were four subjective recognition Types of Christian Social Welfare by Christian Social Workers. First, the religious welfare practices type is type that understands the world and humans based on the Christian worldview and insists on the practice of Christian social welfare based on it. Second, the dualistic welfare pursuits type is type that considers faith and occupation dualistic way and does not understand Christian social welfare correctly. Third, realistic support needs type, is a type that strives to practice Christian social welfare, but is difficult to apply in reality and needs practical help. Fourth, independent selective welfare type, is a type that is provided independent funds by Christians and practices selective welfare according to the needs of Christians.Based on the results of the study, this study suggested that: First, efforts are needed to change the non-Christian perception that Christian social workers have about Christian social welfare. Second, education and training are needed to apply the Christian worldview to all areas of life. Third, it is necessary to establish a network that helps Christian social workers practice Christian social welfare.

AB  - The tvN drama 'Memories of the Alhambra' is a drama that became a hot topic in 2019 by combining a drama and a game based on augmented reality for the first time in Korea. Writer Song Jae-jung, who has consistently presented dramas based on the materials beyond time and space through his previous works, 'Queen Inhyeon's Man', 'Nine: Nine Times of Time Travel', and 'W', expressed his spatial imagination by freely crossing real and virtual space in the drama 'Memories of the Alhambra'. It also transformed the mythical characters and religious motifs from Prometheus and Odysseus in ancient Greek mythology to embody the fantastic storytelling of magic and fantasy.This study intends to analyze the mythological motifs and fantasies common to the two dramas 'Nine: Nine Times of Time Travel' and 'Memories of the Alhambra' and to consider the author's worldview and mythological imagination consistently expressed through the transformation of the mythological prototype. Through the similarity of mythological motifs repeated in the two dramas, this study looked at how the characters in the thematic consciousness and augmented reality that the writer wants to deliver consistently express the mythological representations. As a result, Song Jae-jeong's worldviews can be summarized as first, the epic of salvation through the reconstruction of boundaries; second, the refined evolution of the punishment on the absolute evil and the retributive justice; and third, the exhausted hero's absolute will and power of love. It would be meaningful that this study finds out how fantasy was transformed into clothes of mythological imagination in the combination of games and dramas finally encountered in the AI era.

TI  - Impacts of the Tropical Cyclone Idai in Mozambique: A Multi-Temporal Landsat Satellite Imagery Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Central Region of Mozambique (Sofala Province) bordering on the active cyclone area of the southwestern Indian Ocean has been particularly affected by climate hazards. The Cyclone Idai, which hit the region in March 2019 with strong winds causing extensive flooding and a massive loss of life, was the strongest recorded tropical cyclone in the Southern Hemisphere. The aim of this study was to use pre- and post-cyclone Idai Landsat satellite images to analyze temporal changes in Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) across the Sofala Province. Specifically, we aimed-(i) to quantify and map the changes in LULC between 2012 and 2019; (ii) to investigate the correlation between the distance to Idai's trajectory and the degree of vegetation damage, and (iii) to determine the damage caused by Idai on different LULC. We used Landsat 7 and 8 images (with 30 m resolution) taken during the month of April for the 8-year period. The April Average Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) over the aforementioned period (2012-2018, pre-cyclone) was compared with the values of April 2019 (post-cyclone). The results showed a decreasing trend of the productivity (NDVI 0.5 to 0.8) and an abrupt decrease after the cyclone. The most devastated land use classes were dense vegetation (decreased by 59%), followed by wetland vegetation (-57%) and shrub land (-56%). The least damaged areas were barren land (-23%), barren vegetation (-27%), and grassland and dambos (-27%). The Northeastern, Central and Southern regions of Sofala were the most devastated areas. The Pearson Correlation Coefficient between the relative vegetation change activity after Idai (NDVI%) and the distance to Idai's trajectory was 0.95 (R-square 0.91), suggesting a strong positive linear correlation. Our study also indicated that the LULC type (vegetation physiognomy) might have influenced the degree of LULC damage. This study provides new insights for the management and conservation of natural habitats threatened by climate hazards and human factors and might accelerate ongoing recovery processes in the Sofala Province.

TI  - The Spatial-Temporal Distribution of GOCI-Derived Suspended Sediment in Taiwan Coastal Water Induced by Typhoon Soudelor
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper discusses the use of a Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) to monitor the spatial-temporal distribution of suspended sediment (SS) along the coastal waters of northern Taiwan which was affected by Typhoon Soudelor from 8 to 10 August 2015. High temporal resolution satellite images derived from GOCI were processed to generate four-day average images of SS for pre- and post-typhoon periods. By using these four-day average images, characteristics of SS along the north of Taiwan coastal water can be tracked. The results show that SS concentration increased in the four-day average image immediately after the typhoon (11-14 August), and then decreased in the four-day average image 9 to 12 days after the typhoon (19-22 August). The mouths of the Dajia River and Tamsui River were hotspots of SS, ranging from 9 to 15 g/m(3) during the two post-typhoon periods. Moreover, the maximum suspended sediment (SSmax) and its corresponding time (tmax) can be computed using GOCI hourly images for the post-typhoon period from 08:30 on 11 August to 08:30 on 22 August. The results show that SSmax occurred in the west coastal water within 4 days post-typhoon, and SSmax occurred in the east coastal water 9 to 12 days post-typhoon. Furthermore, an exponential decay model was used to compute the time when 90% of typhoon-induced SS was dissipated after Typhoon Soudelor (t90). It was found that t90 in the mouths of the Tamsui River and Heping River was the longest among all coastal waters of our study area, with a range of 360-480 h. River discharge and ocean currents with suspended sediment concentration are discussed.

T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Conventional remote sensing data analysistechniques have a significant bottleneck of operating on a selectively chosen small-scale dataset. Availability of an enormous volume of data demands handling large-scale, diverse data, which have been made possible with neural network-based architectures. This article exploits the contextual information capturing ability of deep neural networks, particularly investigating multispectral band properties from Sentinel-2 image patches. Besides, an increase in the spatial resolution often leads to nonlinear mixing of land-cover types within a target resolution cell. We recognize this fact and group the bands according to their spatial resolutions, and propose a classification and retrieval framework. We design a representation learning framework for classifying the multispectral data by first utilizing all the bands and then using the grouped bands according to their spatial resolutions. We also propose a novel triplet-loss function for multilabeled images and use it to design an interband group retrieval framework. We demonstrate its effectiveness over the conventional triplet-loss function. Finally, we present a comprehensive discussion of the obtained results. We thoroughly analyze the performance of the band groups on various land-cover and land-use areas from agro-forestry regions, water bodies, and human-made structures. Experimental results for the classification and retrieval framework on the benchmarked BigEarthNet dataset exhibit marked improvements over existing studies.

AB  - As a foremost resource, water has a wide-ranging effect on numerous economic activities including agriculture, manufacturing, households etc. and services such as hydroelectricity generation, recreation, and amenity. Water is also very significant for the urban ecological community. Precise and systematic location of water resources is important for urban administration. Extraction of water resources and its management is extremely vital in a variety of remote sensing applications such as estimation of availability of water, flood, and drought prediction etc. This research work implements and investigates the applicability of the popular deep learning architectures such as U-Net and Encoder-Decoder for extraction of water features from sentinel-2 satellite Images of Delhi-NCR region, India The performance of both the models have also been evaluated by calculating F1-score as 82.70%, and 89.41% respectively. In general, the proposed deep learning approach is relevant to precise water planning with improved spatial goals and exactness, which conceivably encourages effective management of water resources.

TI  - Modeling the association between Aedes aegypti ovitrap egg counts, multi-scale remotely sensed environmental data and arboviral cases at Puntarenas, Costa Rica (2017-2018).
T2  - Current research in parasitology & vector-borne diseases
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Problems with vector surveillance are a major barrier for the effective control of vector-borne disease transmission through Latin America. Here, we present results from a 80-week longitudinal study where Aedes aegypti (L.) (Diptera: Culicidae) ovitraps were monitored weekly at 92 locations in Puntarenas, a coastal city in Costa Rica with syndemic Zika, chikungunya and dengue transmission. We used separate models to investigate the association of either Ae. aegypti-borne arboviral cases or Ae. aegypti egg counts with remotely sensed environmental variables. We also evaluated whether Ae. aegypti-borne arboviral cases were associated with Ae. aegypti egg counts. Using cross-correlation and time series modeling, we found that arboviral cases were not significantly associated with Ae. aegypti egg counts. Through model selection we found that cases had a non-linear response to multi-scale (1-km and 30-m resolution) measurements of temperature standard deviation (SD) with a lag of up to 4 weeks, while simultaneously increasing with finely-grained NDVI (30-m resolution). Meanwhile, median ovitrap Ae. aegypti egg counts increased, and respectively decreased, with temperature SD (1-km resolution) and EVI (30-m resolution) with a lag of 6 weeks. A synchrony analysis showed that egg counts had a travelling wave pattern, with synchrony showing cyclic changes with distance, a pattern not observed in remotely sensed data with 30-m and 10-m resolution. Spatially, using generalized additive models, we found that eggs were more abundant at locations with higher temperatures and where EVI was leptokurtic during the study period. Our results suggest that, in Puntarenas, remotely sensed environmental variables are associated with both Ae. aegypti-borne arbovirus transmission and Ae. aegypti egg counts from ovitraps.

AB  - This qualitative study analyzes 140 place names or toponyms of the Peruvian province of Huarochiri, department of Lima, under two aspects: morphological and semantic. The study of the toponyms presented relevant characteristics, such as simple and compound lexies, which outnumber simple lexemes; and determined different states of cultural symbiosis, in which it highlights the onomasiological ability of the ancient settlers to associate place names with their cultural worldview. It concludes that languages such as Jacaru, Aymara and Quechua, that were spoken before Spanish in the Peruvian area of Huarochiri, left in the place names a clear imprint.

AB  - We deal with the problem of generating textual captions from optical remote sensing (RS) images using the notion of deep reinforcement learning. Due to the high inter-class similarity in reference sentences describing remote sensing data, jointly encoding the sentences and images encourages prediction of captions that are semantically more precise than the ground truth in many cases. To this end, we introduce an Actor Dual-Critic training strategy where a second critic model is deployed in the form of an encoder-decoder RNN to encode the latent information corresponding to the original and generated captions. While all actor-critic methods use an actor to predict sentences for an image and a critic to provide rewards, our proposed encoder-decoder RNN guarantees high-level comprehension of images by sentence-to-image translation. We observe that the proposed model generates sentences on the test data highly similar to the ground truth and is successful in generating even better captions in many critical cases. Extensive experiments on the benchmark Remote Sensing Image Captioning Dataset (RSICD) and the UCM-captions dataset confirm the superiority of the proposed approach in comparison to the previous state-of-the-art where we obtain a gain of sharp increments in both the ROUGE-L and CIDEr measures.

M3  - Article
AB  - During the last 20 years, fast urbanization activities have been highly concentrated in just few countries (e.g., China, India, and Nigeria) and have led to the emergence of large urban aggregations, with high population density. Still, very few researches have focused on this dynamic phenomenon with a global perspective using multisource remote sensing data. In this article, combining radar and spectral sensors of different spatial resolution, a novel approach based on a novel hierarchical biclustering technique is proposed and proved to be effective in discriminating the underlying change patterns without pre-estimating the number of clusters. To this aim, experimental results focused on newly emerging megalopolis in China, India, and Nigeria, as well as on the highly urbanized and stable Lombardy region in Italy, are presented. The analysis of the results allows us to understand, in a global and comparative perspective, the spatiotemporal differentiation of urban density and how cities are changing and evolving in the building volume and, to some extent, their economic level.

TI  - Deep Learning for Feature-Level Data Fusion: Higher Resolution Reconstruction of Historical Landsat Archive
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple SummaryExisting freely available global land surface observations are limited by medium to coarse resolutions or short time spans. Here we developed a feature-level data fusion framework using a generative adversarial network (GAN), a deep learning technique, to leverage Landsat and Sentinel-2 observations during their over-lapping period from 2016 to 2019, and reconstruct 10 m Sentinel-2 like imagery from 30 m historical Landsat archives. Our tests with both simulated data and actual Landsat/Sentinel-2 acquisitions showed that the GAN-based super-resolution method could accurately reconstruct synthetic Landsat data at an effective resolution very close to that of the real Sentinel-2 observations. The promising results from our deep learning-based feature-level fusion method highlight the potential for reconstructing a 10 m Landsat series archive since 1984. It is expected to improve our capability of detecting and tracking finer scale land changes, identifying the drivers for and responses to global environmental changes.Long-term record of fine spatial resolution remote sensing datasets is critical for monitoring and understanding global environmental change, especially with regard to fine scale processes. However, existing freely available global land surface observations are limited by medium to coarse resolutions (e.g., 30 m Landsat) or short time spans (e.g., five years for 10 m Sentinel-2). Here we developed a feature-level data fusion framework using a generative adversarial network (GAN), a deep learning technique, to leverage the overlapping Landsat and Sentinel-2 observations during 2016-2019, and reconstruct 10 m Sentinel-2 like imagery from 30 m historical Landsat archives. Our tests with both simulated data and actual Landsat/Sentinel-2 imagery showed that the GAN-based fusion method could accurately reconstruct synthetic Landsat data at an effective resolution very close to that of the real Sentinel-2 observations. We applied the GAN-based model to two dynamic systems: (1) land over dynamics including phenology change, cropping rotation, and water inundation; and (2) human landscape changes such as airport construction, coastal expansion, and urbanization, via historical reconstruction of 10 m Landsat observations from 1985 to 2018. The resulting comparison further validated the robustness and efficiency of our proposed framework. Our pilot study demonstrated the promise of transforming 30 m historical Landsat data into a 10 m Sentinel-2-like archive with advanced data fusion. This will enhance Landsat and Sentinel-2 data science, facilitate higher resolution land cover and land use monitoring, and global change research.

AB  - The Geosynchronous Equatorial Orbit (GEO) is home to many important space assets such as telecommunication and navigational satellites. Monitoring Resident Space Objects (RSOs) in GEO is a crucial aspect in achieving Space Situational Awareness (SSA) and in protecting critical space assets. However, ground-based GEO object detection is challenging due to the extreme distance of the targets, as well as nuisance factors including cloud coverage, atmospheric/weather effects, light pollution, sensor noise/defects, and star occlusions. The Kelvins SpotGEO Challenge is designed to establish to what extent images coming from a low-cost ground-based telescope can be used to detect GEO and near-GEO RSOs solely from photometric signals that are without any additional meta-data. At the same time, the SpotGEO dataset also addresses the lack of publicly available datasets from a computer vision perspective on the satellite detection problem; by assembling and releasing such a dataset, we hope to spur more efforts on the optical detection of RSOs and enable objective bench-marking for existing and future methods. In this work, we present details of the SpotGEO dataset development, challenge design, evaluation metric, and result analysis.

AB  - Analyzing big geophysical observational data collected by multiple advanced sensors on various satellite platforms promotes our understanding of the geophysical system. For instance, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have achieved great success in estimating tropical cyclone (TC) intensity based on satellite data with fixed temporal frequency (e.g., 3 h). However, to achieve more timely (under 30 min) and accurate TC intensity estimates, a deep learning model is demanded to handle temporally-heterogeneous satellite observations. Specifically, infrared (IR1) and water vapor (WV) images are available within every 15 minute period, while passive microwave rain rate (PMW) is available about every 3 hours. Meanwhile, the visible (VIS) channel is severely affected by noise and sunlight intensity, making it difficult to be utilized. Therefore, we propose a novel framework that combines generative adversarial network (GAN) with CNN. The model utilizes all data during the training phase including VIS and PMW information and eventually uses only the high-frequent IR1 and WV data for providing intensity estimates during the predicting phase. Experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid GAN-CNN framework achieves comparable precision to the state-of-the-art models, while possessing the capability of increasing the maximum estimation frequency from 3 hours to less than 15 minutes.

AB  - This study cross-calibrated the brightness temperatures observed in the Arctic by using the FY-3B/MWRI L1 and the Aqua/AMSR-E L2A. The monthly parameters of the cross-calibration were determined and evaluated using robust linear regression. The snow depth in case of seasonal ice was calculated by using parameters of the cross-calibration of data from the MWRI T-b. The correlation coefficients of the H/V polarization among all channels T-b of the two sensors were higher than 0.97. The parameters of the monthly cross-calibration were useful for the snow depth retrieval using the MWRI. Data from the MWRI T-b were cross-calibrated to the AMSR-E baseline. Biases in the data of the two sensors were optimized to approximately 0 K through the cross-calibration, the standard deviations decreased significantly in the range of 1.32 K to 2.57 K, and the correlation coefficients were as high as 99%. An analysis of the statistical distributions of the histograms before and after cross-calibration indicated that the FY-3B/MWRI T-b data had been well calibrated. Furthermore, the results of the cross-calibration were evaluated by data on the daily average T-b at 18.7 GHz, 23.8 GHz, and 36.5 GHz (V polarization), and at 89 GHz (H/V polarization), and were applied to the snow depths retrieval in the Arctic. The parameters of monthly cross-calibration were found to be effective in terms of correcting the daily average The results of the snow depths were compared with those of the calibrated MWRI and AMSR-E products. Biases of 0.18 cm to 0.38 cm were observed in the monthly snow depths, with the standard deviations ranging from 4.19 cm to 4.80 cm.

TI  - Observational study of super typhoon Meranti (2016) using satellite, surface drifter, Argo float and reanalysis data
T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The present work describes the basic features of super typhoon Meranti (2016) by multiple data sources. We mainly focus on the upper ocean response to Meranti using multiplatform satellites, in situ surface drifter and Argo floats, and compare the results with the widely used idealized wind vortex model and reanalysis datasets. The pre-existing meso-scale eddy provided a favor underlying surface boundary condition and also modulated the upper ocean response to Meranti. Results show that the maximum sea surface cooling was 2.0 degrees C after Meranti. The satellite surface wind failed to capture the core structure of Meranti as the idealized wind vortex model deduced. According to the observation of sea surface drifters, the near-inertial currents were significantly enhanced during the passage of Meranti. The temperature and salinity profiles from Argo floats revealed both the mixed-layer extension and subsurface upwelling induced by Meranti. The comparison results show that the sea surface temperature and surface wind in the reanalysis datasets differs from those in remote sensing system. Sea surface cooling is similar in both satellite and in situ observation, and sea surface salinity response has a lower correlation with the precipitation rate.

AB  - Based on the Landsat images of 7-time phases from 1984 to 2016, this paper analyzes the center of gravity transfer of land types in Zhoushan City, China The research shows that the center of gravity migration distances of construction land, forest land, water, tidal flats, cultivated land/grassland and bare land are 1.80km, 0.37km, 4.27km, 3.84km, 0.55km and 1.60km respectively. The construction land expands along the coastal plain of each island, leading to the gradual encroachment of cultivated land/grassland and the spatial distribution of cultivated land/grassland tends to be discrete. This study will provide data support for the rational decision-making of land resource management in Zhoushan City and promote the sustainable use of land resources.

TI  - Improved Lake Level Estimation From Radar Altimeter Using an Automatic Multiscale-Based Peak Detection Retracker
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite radar altimetry is an important technique for monitoring the water levels of oceans and inland water bodies, especially in areas where in-situ data are sparse or nonexistent. This study presented an automatic multiscale-based peak detection retracker (AMPDR). The retracker can extract a robust threshold level for each track, then the stable lake level can be obtained from the multipeak waveforms using a shortest-path algorithm. Additionally, the retracker can be used for mountain lakes and for flat lakes, and is also suitable for many kinds of altimetry data, such as those of Cryosat-2, Sentinel-3, and Jason-2/3. To validate the lake levels derived by the AMPDR retracker, the in-situ gauge data of seven lakes in the Tibetan Plateau and two lakes in a flat area are used. Moreover, seven existing retrackers are compared to evaluate the performance of the proposed AMPDR retracker. The results suggest that AMPDR can efficiently process many complex multipeak waveforms, and the AMPDR has the lowest mean of all track standard deviations over all lakes. The root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of the lake level time series obtained using AMPDR is the lowest over several lakes: The mean RMSEs of all the lakes overpassed by Cryosat-2, Sentinel-3, and Jason-2/3 are 0.149, 0.139, and 0.181 m, respectively. The AMPDR retracker is easy to implement, computationally efficient, and can give a height estimate for even the most contaminated waveforms.

TI  - Remote Sensing Estimation of Chlorophyll-A in Case-II Waters of Coastal Areas: Three-Band Model Versus Genetic Algorithm-Artificial Neural Networks Model
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), an important indicator of phytoplankton biomass and eutrophication, is sensitive to water constitutes and optical characteristics. An integrated machine learning method of genetic algorithm and artificial neural networks (GA-ANN) was developed to retrieve the concentration of Chl-a. In situ spectra and simultaneous water quality parameters of 107 samples from two reservoirs (Res) and coastal waters (CW) were used to calibrate GA-ANN and three-band models (TBM) for comparison of Chl-a estimation. Both GA-ANN and TBM methods perform well for the joint dataset (WGD) of Res and CW with the R-2 exceeding 0.90, and the root mean square error (RMSE) of corresponding validation (N = 35) are 4.40 and 5.23 mu g/L, respectively. Similarly, for independent dataset of Res (N = 45), GA-ANN and TBM methods show robust performance: the R-2 values are 0.87 and 0.80, respectively; and the corresponding RMSE values are 7.79 and 7.73 mu g/L, respectively. For CW dataset (N = 62), the R-2 values of two methods are 0.81 and 0.62, respectively; and the corresponding RMSE values are 0.79 and 1.32 mu g/L, respectively. When the GA-ANN and TBM models were applied to retrieve Chl-a concentration from the calibrated Sentinel 2 MSI reflectance data in two Res on October 20, 2019, however, the validated results of MSI-derived Chl-a concentrations using quasi-synchronous in situ data (N = 36) indicated that the GA-ANN model outperforms TBM with higher R-2 value (0.91 vs. 0.26) and smaller RMSE (4.41 vs. 13.85 mu g/L) and mean absolute errors (3.40 vs. 11.87 mu g/L) values. Although TBM has obvious overestimation of Chl-a concentration when applied to remote sensing image, we still thought that both GA-ANN and TBM are useful methods for Chl-a estimation in case-II waters, and GA-ANN performs marginally better with less deviation to measured Chl-a for multispectral remote sensing data. The ratio of TSS to Chl-a, experimental measurements, abundance of sampling points, and Chl-a concentration range are several important factors affecting the accuracy and robustness of GA-ANN and TBM methods.

TI  - Seasonal Variations of Daytime Land Surface Temperature and Their Underlying Drivers over Wuhan, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization greatly alters land surface vegetation cover and heat distribution, leading to the development of the urban heat island (UHI) effect and seriously affecting the healthy development of cities and the comfort of living. As an indicator of urban health and livability, monitoring the distribution of land surface temperature (LST) and discovering its main impacting factors are receiving increasing attention in the effort to develop cities more sustainably. In this study, we analyzed the spatial distribution patterns of LST of the city of Wuhan, China, from 2013 to 2019. We detected hot and cold poles in four seasons through clustering and outlier analysis (based on Anselin local Moran's I) of LST. Furthermore, we introduced the geographical detector model to quantify the impact of six physical and socio-economic factors, including the digital elevation model (DEM), index-based built-up index (IBI), modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), population, and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on the LST distribution of Wuhan. Finally, to identify the influence of land cover on temperature, the LST of croplands, woodlands, grasslands, and built-up areas was analyzed. The results showed that low temperatures are mainly distributed over water and woodland areas, followed by grasslands; high temperatures are mainly concentrated over built-up areas. The maximum temperature difference between land covers occurs in spring and summer, while this difference can be ignored in winter. MNDWI, IBI, and NDVI are the key driving factors of the thermal values change in Wuhan, especially of their interaction. We found that the temperature of water area and urban green space (woodlands and grasslands) tends to be 5.4 degrees C and 2.6 degrees C lower than that of built-up areas. Our research results can contribute to the urban planning and urban greening of Wuhan and promote the healthy and sustainable development of the city.

TI  - Influence of observation angle change on satellite retrieval of aerosol optical depth
T2  - TELLUS SERIES B-CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Use of multi-angle sensors, which can perform ground observations in different view directions, provides an important technical means to acquire more comprehensive and detailed remote sensing information. This study explored the effect of angle changes on satellite-based aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieval using 2016-2018 Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) data in the Yangtze River Delta. The Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance determined by the MODIS V5.2 algorithm and MODIS BRDF data are used to obtain MISR surface reflectance at different angles after a spectral conversion between MODIS and MISR, and then MISR AOD with different angles were retrieved based on the MISR surface reflectance at different angles. Moreover, the errors and their formation mechanism in retrieving AOD using MISR remote sensing data at different angles were analyzed based on the Global Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) ground observations. We used six indicators, including correlation coefficient (R), significant level (P value), mean absolute error (MAE), mean relative error (MRE) root mean square error (RMSE) and relative mean bias (RMB), and AERONET AOD is used to verify the MISR AOD. The results show that at Taihu and Xuzhou stations, the highest R values are 0.81 (Aa AOD) and 0.75 (An AOD), and the minimum RMSE values at Taihu and Xuzhou-CUMT stations are 0.11 (Aa AOD) and 0.20 (An AOD), respectively. Incorrect surface reflectance measurement is the root cause of the angle effect in MISR AOD retrieval. With the same surface reflectance deviation, the larger the MISR observation angle, the closer the retrieved MISR AOD is to the AOD observed by AERONET. The AOD retrieval of the forward observation angle is closer to AERONET AOD than that of backward observation angle, and the retrieved error is greatest at the vertical angle (nadir). Therefore, sensors for vertical ground observation are not suitable for AOD retrieval, and sensors in non-vertical directions, especially forward to the ground, are more favorable to MISR AOD retrieval.

TI  - Estimating Soil Moisture Over Winter Wheat Fields During Growing Season Using Machine-Learning Methods
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is vital for the crop growth and directly affects the crop yield. The conventional synthetic aperture radar (SAR) based soil moisture monitoring is often influenced by vegetation cover and surface roughness. The machine-learning methods are not constrained by physical parameters and have high nonlinear fitting capabilities. In this study, machine-learning methods were applied to estimate soil moisture over winter wheat fields during its growing season. RADARSAT-2 data with quad polarizations and 240 sample plots in the study area were acquired and collected, respectively. In addition to the four linear polarization channels, polarimetric decomposition parameters were extracted to expand the SAR feature space. Three advanced machine-learning models were selected and compared, which were support vector regression, random forests (RF), and gradient boosting regression tree. To improve the performances of the models, three feature-selection methods were compared, which were based on Pearson correlation, support vector machine recursive feature elimination, and RF, respectively. The coefficient of determination (R-2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) were used to compare and assess the performances of those models. The results revealed that polarimetric decomposition parameters were effective in estimating soil moisture, and RF model obtained the highest prediction accuracy (training set: RMSE = 2.44 vol.% and R-2 = 0.94; and validation set: RMSE = 4.03 vol.%, and R-2 = 0.79). This study finally concluded that using polarimetric decomposition parameters combined with machine-learning and feature-selection methods could effectively estimate soil moisture at a high accuracy, which helps monitor soil moisture across the agricultural field during its growing season.

T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - FY-4A is a new-generation geostationary meteorological satellite independently developed by China. The Downward Surface Shortwave Radiation ( DSSR) products of FY-4A have broad application prospects in hydrology , ecological research , and energy development and utilization. In this study, the accuracy verification and error analysis of FY-4A DSSR products in Heihe River Basin were carried out based on the ground measurements of 12 radiation sites in the Qilian Mountains integrated observatory network from April to December 2018. The verification results showed that the FY-4A DSSR products fitted well with the field observations. Under clear-sky conditions, the FY-4A DSSR had a strong correlation with the observation data of the ground meteorological stations (r= 0.95) , with a mean bias error ( MBE) of 11.74 W.m(-2) and a root mean square error ( RMSE) of 59.43 W.m(-2). Under all-sky conditions , the accuracy was lower than that under clear sky conditions ( r= 0.82 , MBE =75.99 W.m(-2) , and RMSE =163.80 W.m(-2)) . The FY-4A products overestimated DSSR in different months. The correlation between FY-4A DSSR and measurements generally decreased with increasing elevation. With a quantitative analysis of the accuracy of FY-4A DSSR products, our results provided a scientific reference for understanding their quality and application.

AB  - This study critically re-examines the film A Simple Life from a deconstructionist perspective. The study first analyzes how the film’s compassionate narrative conceals the social and structural inequality experienced by the film’s main character ‘Ah Tao’, and questions the underlying motive for the concealment. The study then elucidates the dualistic worldview that is embodied in the reproduction of the master-servant relationship, which contradicts the film’s main theme of “humanistic love between the master and servant”, and argues that such a portrayal is the result of the internalization of a colonialist ideology. Finally, the study explores the fatalistic worldviews commonly present in Hong Kong films such as A Simple Life, and posits that such views are the consequence of Hong Kong’s colonial history and internal colonization. This study presents the implications related to forming an understanding of the ideological limitation that is inherent in a seemingly natural such as humanism. It also provides a number of clues to identifying the ways that films reinterpret the world, interact with the audience, and incorporate and reproduce the dominant ideology.

TI  - Spectral Characterization of Dissolved Organic Matter in Seawater and Sediment Pore Water from the Arctic Fjords (West Svalbard) in Summer
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Fjords in the high Arctic, as aquatic critical zones at the interface of land-ocean continuum, are undergoing rapid changes due to glacier retreat and climate warming. Yet, little is known about the biogeochemical processes in the Arctic fjords. We measured the nutrients and the optical properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in both seawater and sediment pore water, along with the remote sensing data of the ocean surface, from three West Svalbard fjords. A cross-fjord comparison of fluorescence fingerprints together with downcore trends of salinity, Cl-, and PO43- revealed higher impact of terrestrial inputs (fluorescence index: similar to 1.2-1.5 in seawaters) and glaciofluvial runoffs (salinity: similar to 31.4 +/- 2.4 psu in pore waters) to the southern fjord of Hornsund as compared to the northern fjords of Isfjorden and Van Mijenfjorden, tallying with heavier annual runoff to the southern fjord of Hornsund. Extremely high levels of protein-like fluorescence (up to similar to 4.5 RU) were observed at the partially sea ice-covered fjords in summer, in line with near-ubiquity ice-edge blooms observed in the Arctic. The results reflect an ongoing or post-phytoplankton bloom, which is also supported by the higher levels of chlorophyll a fluorescence at the ocean surface, the very high apparent oxygen utilization through the water column, and the nutrient drawdown at the ocean surface. Meanwhile, a characteristic elongated fluorescence fingerprint was observed in the fjords, presumably produced by ice-edge blooms in the Arctic ecosystems. Furthermore, alkalinity and the humic-like peaks showed a general downcore accumulation trend, which implies the production of humic-like DOM via a biological pathway also in the glaciomarine sediments from the Arctic fjords.

TI  - Staging of the Axilla in Breast Cancer and the Evolving Role of Axillary Ultrasound
T2  - BREAST CANCER-TARGETS AND THERAPY
M3  - Review
AB  - Axillary lymph nodes have long been recognized as a route for breast cancer to spread systemically. As a result, staging of the axilla has always played a central role in the treatment of breast cancer. Anatomic staging was believed to be important for two reasons: 1) it predicts prognosis and guides medical therapy, and 2) it is a potential therapy for removal of disease in the axilla. This paradigm has now been called into question. Prognostic information is driven increasingly by tumor biology, and trials such as the ACOSOG Z0011 demonstrates removal of axillary disease is not therapeutic. Staging of the axilla has undergone a dramatic de-escalation; however, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is still an invasive surgery and represents a large economic burden on the healthcare system. In this review, we outline the changing paradigms of axillary staging in breast cancer from emphasis on anatomic staging to tumor biology, and the evolving role of axillary ultrasound, bringing patients less invasive and more personalized therapy.

TI  - PM<sub>2.5</sub> Estimation and Spatial-Temporal Pattern Analysis Based on the Modified Support Vector Regression Model and the 1 km Resolution MAIAC AOD in Hubei, China
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The satellite-retrieved Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) is widely used to estimate the concentrations and analyze the spatiotemporal pattern of Particulate Matter that is less than or equal to 2.5 microns (PM2.5), also providing a way for the related research of air pollution. Many studies generated PM2.5 concentration networks with resolutions of 3 km or 10 km. However, the relatively coarse resolution of the satellite AOD products make it difficult to determine the fine-scale characteristics of PM2.5 distributions that are important for urban air quality analysis. In addition, the composition and chemical properties of PM2.5 are relatively complex and might be affected by many factors, such as meteorological and land cover type factors. In this paper, an AOD product with a 1 km spatial resolution derived from the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm, the PM2.5 measurements from ground sites and the meteorological data as the auxiliary variable, are integrated into the Modified Support Vector Regression (MSVR) model that proposed in this paper to estimate the PM2.5 concentrations and analyze the spatiotemporal pattern of PM2.5. Considering the relatively small dataset and the somewhat complex relationship between the variables, we propose a Modified Support Vector Regression (MSVR) model that based on SVR to fit and estimate the PM2.5 concentrations in Hubei province of China. In this paper, we obtained Cross Correlation Coefficient (R-2) of 0.74 for the regression of independent and dependent variables, and the conventional SVR model obtained R-2 of 0.60 as comparison. We think our MSVR model obtained relatively good performance in spite of many complex factors that might impact the accuracy. We then utilized the optimal MSVR model to perform the PM2.5 estimating, analyze their spatiotemporal patterns, and try to explain the possible reasons for these patterns. The results showed that the PM2.5 estimations retrieved from 1 km MAIAC AOD could reflect more detailed spatial distribution characteristics of PM2.5 and have higher accuracy than that from 3 km MODIS AOD. Therefore, the proposed MSVR model can be a better method for PM2.5 estimating, especially when the dataset is relatively small.

TI  - Vicarious Radiometric Calibration of Ocean Color Bands for FY-3D/MERSI-II at Lake Qinghai, China
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - To calibrate the low signal response of the ocean color (OC) bands and test the stability of the Fengyun-3D (FY-3D)/Medium Resolution Spectral Imager II (MERSI-II), an absolute radiometric calibration field test of FY-3D/MERSI-II at the Lake Qinghai Radiometric Calibration Site (RCS) was carried out in August 2018. The lake surface and atmospheric parameters were mainly measured by advanced observation instruments, and the MODerate spectral resolution atmospheric TRANsmittance algorithm and computer model (MODTRAN4.0) was used to simulate the multiple scattering radiance value at the altitude of the sensor. The results showed that the relative deviations between bands 9 and 12 are within 5.0%, while the relative deviations of bands 8, and 13 are 17.1%, and 12.0%, respectively. The precision of the calibration method was verified by calibrating the Aqua/Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP)/Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer (VIIRS), and the deviation of the calibration results was evaluated with the results of the Dunhuang RCS calibration and lunar calibration. The results showed that the relative deviations of NPP/VIIRS were within 7.0%, and the relative deviations of Aqua/MODIS were within 4.1% from 400 nm to 600 nm. The comparisons of three on-orbit calibration methods indicated that band 8 exhibited a large attenuation after launch and the calibration results had good consistency at the other bands except for band 13. The uncertainty value of the whole calibration system was approximately 6.3%, and the uncertainty brought by the field surface measurement reached 5.4%, which might be the main reason for the relatively large deviation of band 13. This study verifies the feasibility of the vicarious calibration method at the Lake Qinghai RCS and provides the basis and reference for the subsequent on-orbit calibration of FY-3D/MERSI-II.

TI  - Speckle-Free SAR Image Ship Detection
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ship detection is one of important applications for synthetic aperture radar (SAR). Speckle effects usually make SAR image understanding difficult and speckle reduction becomes a necessary pre-processing step for majority SAR applications. This work examines different speckle reduction methods on SAR ship detection performances. It is found out that the influences of different speckle filters are significant which can be positive or negative. However, how to select a suitable combination of speckle filters and ship detectors is lack of theoretical basis and is also data-orientated. To overcome this limitation, a speckle-free SAR ship detection approach is proposed. A similar pixel number (SPN) indicator which can effectively identify salient target is derived, during the similar pixel selection procedure with the context covariance matrix (CCM) similarity test. The underlying principle lies in that ship and sea clutter candidates show different properties of homogeneity within a moving window and the SPN indicator can clearly reflect their differences. The sensitivity and efficiency of the SPN indicator is examined and demonstrated. Then, a speckle-free SAR ship detection approach is established based on the SPN indicator. The detection flowchart is also given. Experimental and comparison studies are carried out with three kinds of spaceborne SAR datasets in terms of different polarizations. The proposed method achieves the best SAR ship detection performances with the highest figures of merits (FoM) of 97.14%, 90.32% and 93.75% for the used Radarsat-2, GaoFen-3 and Sentinel-1 datasets, accordingly.

TI  - Forest Canopy Height Estimation Using Polarimetric Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolInSAR) Technology Based on Full-Polarized ALOS/PALSAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest canopy height is a basic metric characterizing forest growth and carbon sink capacity. Based on full-polarized Advanced Land Observing Satellite/Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (ALOS/PALSAR) data, this study used Polarimetric Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolInSAR) technology to estimate forest canopy height. In total the four methods of differential DEM (digital elevation model) algorithm, coherent amplitude algorithm, coherent phase-amplitude algorithm and three-stage random volume over ground algorithm (RVoG_3) were proposed to obtain canopy height and their accuracy was compared in consideration of the impacts of coherence coefficient and range slope levels. The influence of the statistical window size on the coherence coefficient was analyzed to improve the estimation accuracy. On the basis of traditional algorithms, time decoherence was performed on ALOS/PALSAR data by introducing the change rate of Landsat NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index). The slope in range direction was calculated based on SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) DEM data and then introduced into the s-RVoG (sloped-Random Volume over Ground) model to optimize the canopy height estimation model and improve the accuracy. The results indicated that the differential DEM algorithm underestimated the canopy height significantly, while the coherent amplitude algorithm overestimated the canopy height. After removing the systematic coherence, the overestimation of the RVoG_3 model was restrained, and the absolute error decreased from 23.68 m to 4.86 m. With further time decoherence, the determination coefficient increased to 0.2439. With the introduction of range slope, the s-RVoG model shows improvement compared to the RVoG model. Our results will provide a reference for the appropriate algorithm selection and optimization for forest canopy height estimation using full-polarized L-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data for forest ecosystem monitoring and management.

TI  - Wildfire Risk Assessment of Transmission-Line Corridors Based on Naive Bayes Network and Remote Sensing Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Considering the complexity of the physical model of wildfire occurrence, this paper develops a method to evaluate the wildfire risk of transmission-line corridors based on Naive Bayes Network (NBN). First, the data of 14 wildfire-related factors including anthropogenic, physiographic, and meteorologic factors, were collected and analyzed. Then, the relief algorithm is used to rank the importance of factors according to their impacts on wildfire occurrence. After eliminating the least important factors in turn, an optimal wildfire risk assessment model for transmission-line corridors was constructed based on the NBN. Finally, this model was carried out and visualized in Guangxi province in southern China. Then a cost function was proposed to further verify the applicability of the wildfire risk distribution map. The fire events monitored by satellites during the first season in 2020 shows that 81.8% of fires fall in high- and very-high-risk regions.

TI  - An Assessment of Water Color for Inland Water in China Using a Landsat 8-Derived Forel-Ule Index and the Google Earth Engine Platform
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water color is an important parameter in water quality assessment. However, the existing water color investigations have mostly focused on the lakes with areas greater 1 km(2). In order to improve the understanding of the color of water bodies in China, a cloud-free composite image of China for the summer of 2015 was generated using time-series of Landsat-8 imagery and the best-available-pixel (BAP) compositing algorithm. Then, the first Forel-Ule index (FUI) water color product with a resolution of 30 m was produced for China using the generated BAP composite and the Google Earth Engine computing platform. Finally, the first national-scale assessment of the FUI of natural lakes with an area >0.01 km(2) (N = 60026) was conducted based on the generated FUI product. The generated FUI product was shown to have a high degree of consistency with in situ water surface reflectance-derived FUI (R-2 = 0.90, P < 0.001). Also, it had a high degree of consistency with the in situ Secchi depth (R-2 = 0.90, P < 0.001) and trophic level index (R-2 = 0.62, P < 0.001) datasets. In addition, we found that the most prevalent lake colors in China were yellow (about 49%) and green (about 41%). Besides, the proportion of small lakes (areas < 1 km(2)) found to be yellow was much larger than for large lakes (area >= 1 km(2)) (50% against 28%). Our results will provide important information that can be used for preserving and restoring inland water resources.

TI  - Green-depressing cropping system: A referential land use practice for fallow to ensure a harmonious human-land relationship in the farming-pastoral ecotone of northern China
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The farming-pastoral ecotone of northern China (FPENC) is a fragile ecosystem that severely suffers from the acute contradiction between population growth and limited land resources. The Chinese government emphasized that rehabilitated agriculture, such as current government-led fallow, should be developed in the FPENC. However, what kind of farmland needs to lay fallow, how to manage the fields during fallow periods, and the duration of fallow periods are unclear. Fortunately, the green-depressing cropping system (GDCS) (Yaqing in Chinese Pinyin) that has existed for approximately 300 years also as a farmland use practice to reduce farmland use intensity and to recover soil property has something in common with fallow in the field selection and field management, and can serve as the reference for specific fallow policy. Therefore, we aimed to improve our limited understanding of the GDCS and provide recommendations for future fallow policies. Given this, an approach using satellite data to map the GDCS fields was explored, and this information can be combined with a questionnaire survey to help understand the current state of the GDCS in the FPENC. Then, the factors influencing farmers' willingness to adopt the GDCS in the FPENC were evaluated using a binary logistic regression model (BLR). The results indicated that the GDCS was still a widely distributed and common land use practice in the FPENC, and approximately 3.34 % and 2.31 % of the total arable land of Shangdu experienced the GDCS in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Furthermore, farmers in the Houshan area had a higher willingness to adopt the GDCS than farmers in the Qianshan area. More specifically, passive GDCS predominated as a suboptimal choice due to severe drought, while older farmers and agro-pastoral households had a higher willingness to adopt an active GDCS. Ultimately, the GDCS plays an important role in improving soil fertility and conserving soil water, leading to an increase of at least 50 % in crop yields in the year immediately following implementation. Finally, according to the current state of the GDCS and factor analysis, we concluded that the future fallow program in FPENC should be first performed in regions with high proportions of dryland and sloping fields, a small resident population, high levels of mechanization and high farmland transfer rates. Additionally, fallow by omitting a year of cropping is enough for farmland to recover, and different fallow subsidies are required to encourage farmers to implement this practice.

TI  - Prediction of Maize Yield at the City Level in China Using Multi-Source Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Maize is a widely grown crop in China, and the relationships between agroclimatic parameters and maize yield are complicated, hence, accurate and timely yield prediction is challenging. Here, climate, satellite data, and meteorological indices were integrated to predict maize yield at the city-level in China from 2000 to 2015 using four machine learning approaches, e.g., cubist, random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (Xgboost), and support vector machine (SVM). The climate variables included the diffuse flux of photosynthetic active radiation (PDf), the diffuse flux of shortwave radiation (SDf), the direct flux of shortwave radiation (SDr), minimum temperature (Tmn), potential evapotranspiration (Pet), vapor pressure deficit (Vpd), vapor pressure (Vap), and wet day frequency (Wet). Satellite data, including the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), were used. Meteorological indices, including growing degree day (GDD), extreme degree day (EDD), and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), were used. The results showed that integrating all climate, satellite data, and meteorological indices could achieve the highest accuracy. The highest estimated correlation coefficient (R) values for the cubist, RF, SVM, and Xgboost methods were 0.828, 0.806, 0.742, and 0.758, respectively. The climate, satellite data, or meteorological indices inputs from all growth stages were essential for maize yield prediction, especially in late growth stages. R improved by about 0.126, 0.117, and 0.143 by adding climate data from the early, peak, and late-period to satellite data and meteorological indices from all stages via the four machine learning algorithms, respectively. R increased by 0.016, 0.016, and 0.017 when adding satellite data from the early, peak, and late stages to climate data and meteorological indices from all stages, respectively. R increased by 0.003, 0.032, and 0.042 when adding meteorological indices from the early, peak, and late stages to climate and satellite data from all stages, respectively. The analysis found that the spatial divergences were large and the R value in Northwest region reached 0.942, 0.904, 0.934, and 0.850 for the Cubist, RF, SVM, and Xgboost, respectively. This study highlights the advantages of using climate, satellite data, and meteorological indices for large-scale maize yield estimation with machine learning algorithms.

AB  - The latest Geostationary (GEO) Operational Environmental Satellite-16 (GOES-16) equipped with Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) has comparable spectral and spatial resolution as low earth orbiting (LEO) sensors [i.e., the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)], but with up-to-the-minute image acquisition capability. This enables greater opportunities to generate two essential climate variables-Leaf area index (LAI) and the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) absorbed by vegetation with more cloud-free observations and at much higher frequency. The improved GEO LAI/FPAR products will increase the capacity for monitoring highly dynamic ecosystems in a timely manner. However, the radiative transfer (RT)-based MODIS operational algorithm cannot be directly applied to GOES-16 ABI data due to different sensor characteristics. Fortunately, it has been shown theoretically and practically, that the RT-based algorithm can be transplanted to any other optical sensors by optimizing the sensor-specific parameters-the single scattering albedo (SSA) and relative stabilized precision (RSP). We built the RT-based ABI-specific lookup tables (LUTs) using a global optimizing algorithm (SCE-UA) that can quickly find the optimal solution. SCE-UA optimizes the SSAs and RSPs in the LUTs by minimizing the difference between ABI and MODIS retrievals and maximizing the main algorithm execution rate. Our efforts indicate that these strategies of parametric optimization is able to decrease the discrepancy between the ABI and MODIS LAI/FPAR products. Comprehensive evaluations were conducted to evaluate ABI retrievals. These indirect inter-comparisons suggest a spatiotemporal consistency between ABI and the benchmark MODIS products, while direct validation with field measurements increases confidence in their accuracy. The proposed approach is applicable to any other optical sensors for LAI/FPAR estimation, especially, GEO sensors (i.e., Himawari-8, Geo-KOMPSAT-2A, FengYun-4 etc.).

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy in oral cavity cancer using indocyanine green: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - CLINICS
M3  - Review
AB  - This meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the value of indocyanine green (ICG) in guiding sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for patients with oral cavity cancer.An electronic database search (PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science) was performed from their inception to June 2020 to retrieve clinical studies of ICG applied to SLNB for oral cavity cancer. Data were extracted from 14 relevant articles (226 patients), and 9 studies (134 patients) were finally included in the meta-analysis according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria.The pooled sentinel lymph node (SLN) sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, and diagnostic odds ratio were 88.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 74.0-96.0), 64.0% (95% CI, 61.0-66.0), 2.45 (95% CI, 1.31-4.60), 0.40 (95% CI, 0.17-0.90), and 7.30 (95% CI, 1.74-30.68), respectively. The area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.8805.In conclusion, ICG applied to SLNB can effectively predict the status of regional lymph nodes in oral cavity cancer.

AB  - Building footprint extraction in remote sensing data benefits many important applications, such as urban planning and population estimation. Recently, rapid development of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and open-sourced high resolution satellite building image datasets have pushed the performance boundary further for automated building extractions. However, CNN approaches often generate imprecise building morphologies including noisy edges and round corners. In this paper, we leverage the performance of CNNs, and propose a module that uses prior knowledge of building corners to create angular and concise building polygons from CNN segmentation outputs. We describe a new transform, Relative Gradient Angle Transform (RGA Transform) that converts object contours from time vs. space to time vs. angle. We propose a new shape descriptor, Boundary Orientation Relation Set (BORS), to describe angle relationship between edges in RGA domain, such as orthogonality and parallelism. Finally, we develop an energy minimization framework that makes use of the angle relationship in BORS to straighten edges and reconstruct sharp corners, and the resulting corners create a polygon. Experimental results demonstrate that our method refines CNN output from a rounded approximation to a more clear-cut angular shape of the building footprint.

TI  - A Bayesian Approach for Interpolating Clear-Sky MODIS Land Surface Temperatures on Areas With Extensive Missing Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The MODIS land surface temperature (LST) products contain large areas of missing data due to cloud contamination. Interpolating clear-sky equivalent LSTs on those areas is a first step in a stepwise approach toward fully recovering missing data. A previous study (viz. the Yu method) has implemented an effective clear-sky interpolation method, especially targeting large-area missing data. The Yu method postulates several global reference LST images that contain over 90% of valid pixels and that are assumed to have a close statistical relationship to the interpolated images. However, in practice, such reference images are rarely available throughout a one-year cycle, and the time gaps between the available reference images and the interpolated images are often huge, resulting in compromised interpolation accuracy. In this study, we intended to address those weaknesses and propose a novel clear-sky interpolation approach. The proposed approach uses multiple temporally proximate images as reference images, with which multiple initial estimates are made by an empirically orthogonal function method and then fused by a Bayesian approach to achieve a best estimate. The proposed approach was compared through two experiments to the Yu method and two other widely used methods, i.e., harmonic analysis of time series and co-kriging. Both experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over those established methods, as evidenced by higher spatial correlation coefficients (0.90-0.94) and lower root-mean-square errors (1.19-3.64 degrees C) it achieved when measured against the original data that were intentionally removed.

AB  - As an important area of wetland protection in the Yangtze River Economic Belt, Honghu Lake, is a habitat or wintering place for many wild animals. In the past two decades, the water environment of Honghu Lake has been suffering from serious deterioration due to the rapid development of agriculture and industry in the urbanization of surrounding areas. Under the combined effect of multiple non-point source pollution and point source pollution, cyanobacteria blooms often occur here. As a proxy of eutrophication, chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) has been considered to be an important indicator of water quality parameters. For better understanding of the change of the water quality of Honghu Lake, an improved empirical model for estimating chlorophyll-a concentrations (Chl-a) from different multi-spectral satellites images was established and validated. (1) We combined the results of two-band algorithms(2BDA), three-band algorithms(3BDA), normalized difference chlorophyll index (NDCI) and fluorescence line height (FLH) into support vector machine model (SVM) for better multi-nonlinear relationship establishment between Chl-a concentration and surface water reflectance, which acquired higher model accuracy.(2) Based on the long-term time series data derived from Landsat-7, Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2, the variation of Chl-a concentration of Honghu Lake over long term was obtained. (3) Our results demonstrate that the average chlorophyll concentration has been at a very high level and showing an increasing tendency in recent years, which may indicate the eutrophication in the Honghu Lake is still getting worse.

TI  - Dynamic Spatial Fusion of Cloud Vertical Phase from <i>CALIPSO</i> and <i>CloudSat</i> Satellite Data
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud phase is a core parameter of inversion of cloud characteristics. The accuracy of cloud phase affects the results of cloud optical and microphysical characteristics. In this study, we obtain the cloud vertical phase (cvP) products of CALIPSO and CloudSat satellites, then we put forward a dynamic spatial fusion algorithm for the fusion of the two products. A series of spatial optimal CVP fusion rules are presented for dual-source data, and we realize CVP fusion using these rules. We took Typhoon Lupit in the Pacific Ocean as an experimental object. The results show that the total cloud pixel amount increased by 124.09% and 10.54%, respectively, compared to those of CALIPSO and CloudSat. The recognition of different CVP is 7.97% and 1.37%. The results show that this method can improve the accuracy of multi-source CVP inversion effectively, and provide new ways for the synergy of multi-sensor satellites.

AB  - The improvement of urbanization level and the imperfection of waste treatment infrastructure have caused the problem that informal garbage dump become prominent problem in China. With the development of high resolution remote sensing images, the fast monitoring and management of informal garbage dumps become possible. The informal garbage dumps in Beijing are monitored by SPOT-6 image, and the rapid and accurate grasp of the number, position and size of the informal garbage dumps are identified by the establishment of the interpretation key using multivariate data. And then it is classified by the established interpretation key. Irregular garbage sites are uneven in shape and complex in composition, which leads to their atypical features in images. Visual interpretation and classification are more suitable for other methods.

TI  - Analysis of Earthquake Emergency Command System According to Cloud Computing Methods
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - An earthquake emergency command system is designed based on cloud computing and the Internet of Things (IoT) to mitigate slow information acquisition, low processing efficiency, and weak information storage and communication ability in earthquake rescue. First, cloud computing technology is introduced, and a traditional earthquake emergency command system is analyzed comprehensively. Then, the characteristics of midwave infrared remote sensing data are explored before and after recent earthquakes in China based on satellite remote sensing data. Subsequently, a new earthquake emergency command system is built based on cloud computing and IoT technology along with data from satellite midwave infrared remote sensing. Finally, system feasibility is evaluated. The results show that surface radiation changes significantly before an earthquake; infrared brightness and temperature fluctuates drastically; and the abnormal region gradually approaches the epicenter of the earthquake. The peak value of the relative power spectrum in the earthquake is more than 9 times the average. In conclusion, the proposed emergency command system based on satellite remote sensing data, cloud computing, and IoT can yield good evaluation results (5.36), demonstrating that multidimensional satellite thermal infrared remote sensing data analysis can improve the accuracy of earthquake prediction. The proposed earthquake emergency command system based on satellite remote sensing data combined with cloud computing and IoT technology can also provide a basis for optimizing earthquake rescue strategies.

TI  - Potential impact of the dramatical expansion of Lake Qinghai on the habitat facilities and grassland since 2004
T2  - Hupo Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - As China's largest inland saline lake, Lake Qinghai is an important source of water vapor in the northeast of the Tibetan Plateau, and plays an important role in the regional ecological environment and sustaining the semi-arid ecosystem function. In recent years, the water level of Lake Qinghai has risen rapidly, but the impact of lake expansion on the habitat facilities and grassland has not received widespread attention and reports. Based on Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI images from 1995 to 2019, Hydroweb multi-source altimetry measurements, and SRTM-1 DEM data, etc., this study aims to analyze the influence and potential threat of the lake rapid expansion on the habitat facilities (roads, settlements) and grassland by referring to the growth rate of Lake Qinghai in recent years. The results show that during the period of 1995-2004, Lake Qinghai was in a state of shrinkage, and the water level and area in 2004 was at the minimum. After 2004, Lake Qinghai entered a period of stable expansion. From 2004 to 2019, the water level of Lake Qinghai has increased by 3.27 m, and the annual increase rate is about 0.22 m/a; accordingly, the water storage has increased by 14.25 km(3), with an average annual growth rate of 0.95 km(3)/a. Lake expansion simulation results show that the water level of Lake Qinghai will reach about 3207 m around 2070 at the current rising rate of water storage (relative to the water level increase of about 10 meters in 2019), at that time, 178 settlements, about 1286.91 km of roads and 2042.22 km(2) of vegetation will be submerged, among which the predicted high-risk areas are mainly located in Qieji Township, Quanji Township, and Jintan Township. The study is expected to provide important scientific support for anticipating the impact and potential threats of the rapid expansion of Lake Qinghai on local residents, and to provide a scientific basis for formulating plans to mitigate climate change risks in the context of climate change.

AB  - Currently, mapping and accounting of certain sub-populations for public health matters is still a prevalent challenge in underdeveloped countries in sub-Sahara Africa, where necessary resources and technologies are still not widely available. This is especially true for the Maasai people in Tanzania. International non-profit groups are leading projects to map the Maasailand boma homesteads in northern Tanzania and provide targeted support for their health on specific matters, such as clean water initiatives, women's and children's health, and basic health clinics. To assist the non-profit group to map the locations of Maasailand boma, we have investigated different types of remote sensing data and deep neural networks that can be applied for broad area search through satellite imagery. Our area of interest encompasses over 3900 square kilometers of Maasailand, where we have manually identified 635 boma homesteads for ground-truth. In this work, we evaluated the application of Sentinel-2 Multispectral Imagery on automatic boma mapping using the ProxylessNAS model. Specifically, we evaluated Sentinel-2 data at different scales for level-1C and level-2A products. Additionally, we extended the ProxylessNAS model to accommodate 4-band full multi-spectral imagery from the sensor. We investigated the 4-band variations that add the near infrared channel to the traditional RGB using the extended ProxylessNAS model. The highest preliminary cross-validation scores using Sentinel-2-1C data and Sentinel-2-2A data are 73.42% and 73.19% respectively. This gives us insight into the utility of medium resolution Sentinel-2 imagery compared to high-resolution imagery in terms of broad area search and localization of boma in Maasailand.

AB  - Dabie Mountain in Anhui province is a genuine producing area of Poria cocos, commonly known as Anling. Jinzhai county in Anhui province is a traditional producing area of P. cocos, and it is also a key county for poverty alleviation in Dabie Mountains. Poverty alleviation of traditional Chinese medicine producing area is an important measure to implement the major strategic deployment of the central government. The planting of P. cocos is helpful to promote the development of traditional Chinese medicine industry in Dabie Mountains and help poverty alleviation. P. cocos is a saprophytic fungus with special demands on soil and ecological environment, and its planting appears a scattered and irregular distribution. Traditional investigation methods are time-consuming and laborious, and the results are greatly influenced by subjective factors. In order to obtain the suitable planting area of P. cocos in Jinzhai county, according to the field survey, the research team has explored the regional, biological characteristics and cultivation methods of P. cocos in the county, and obtained the altitude distribution area suitable for the growth of P. cocos. Then, the MaxEnt niche model was used to analyze the relationship between ecological factors and distribution areas, and the potential distribution zoning of P. cocos in Jinzhai county was studied. Combined with the characteristics of P. cocos planting pattern, taking ZY-3 remote sensing image as the data source, the maximum likelihood method was used to extract the area that could be used for P. cocos cultivation in Jinzhai county, and the reason why artificial planting P. cocos was mainly distributed in the west of Jinzhai county was analyzed. The suitable regional classification of P. cocos in Jinzhai county was obtained by superposition of suitable altitude distribution area, MaxEnt analysis and area extracted from remote sensing image, which provided data support for the planting planning of P. cocos in Jinzhai county.

M3  - research-article
AB  - This study aims to have a comparative analysis on the two beginnings of James Joyce’s Ulysses and examine the narrative implications of the different mornings opened by the two main protagonists. Unlike the novels before modernism that begin their stories in as much detail as possible, the modernist novels mostly start with casual beginnings, presenting the readers with extremely natural daily routines of a protagonist. However, such deceptively casual beginnings actually hide quite a few complicated meanings in them. Thus what ‘Telemachus’ and ‘Calypso’ as the two beginnings of Ulysses hide seems to be the predicament and agony of the Celtic Irish and the diasporic Jew. In short, Joyce has presented the different ways of responding to the predicaments by Stephen, who is surrounded by the ‘usurpers,’ threatening to deprive him of what he has, and by Bloom as a double-other, who is going through ceaseless contempt and alienation in the land of ‘the other.’ Doing so, the author presents the reader with a wide river to cross between the bank of ‘egotism’ and ‘egoism’ based on the worldview of ‘I-It’ relationship and that of ‘dialogue’ and ‘altruism’ based on the spirit of ‘I-You.’

AB  - This thesis begins with a very simple question. Is the classical Chinese word ‘animal’ the same as ‘dongwu’(動物)? Common sense might think so, but it was not pointed out that ‘animal’ is a modern concept that has started to be used in earnest as a translation for ‘animal’. If you look at the classical literature, you can see that various Chinese characters such as ‘chin-shou’(禽獸) and ‘chong’(蟲) were used rather than 'animal'.This thesis, with the character of an introductory study, deals with the representation of animals in ancient Chinese classics and their philosophical implications. This article outlines animal-related research discussions that have been dealt with in Korean academic circles, and raises the need for more systematic research. In addition, I pointed out that there is no representative taxonomy for animals in ancient Chinese classics, and that the boundaries between gods, humans, and animals are ambiguous. Lastly, by examining the representations and contexts of animals in   Mozi  ,   Mengzi  ,   Xunzi  , and   Zhuangzi  , we are examining that the perceptions of animals are also different.Unlike modern people who view nature and the animal world unilaterally from the scientific point of view of modern biology, the viewpoints on animals shown in ancient Chinese classics are much more diverse and unique. Today, humans are facing a major shift in how they relate to nature, machines, and even animals. We can understand ancient philosophy more concretely by studying animal representations in ancient Chinese classics. This paper intends to suggest that more active interest and research is needed on how ‘animals’ have been understood and thought in East Asian traditions. Perhaps through such achievements, we can not only understand the worldview of the past more concretely, but also gain a new perspective on the various issues of the 21st century.

AB  - In areas with extensive, nomadic, or transhumant livestock farming, it is important to access regular information on the location of ephemeral surface water bodies. SAR satellite images are used for water bodies mapping at high-resolution. Unlike optical data their use is not restricted to cloud-free conditions. Nevertheless, surface roughness, hill shadows, and presence of vegetation are known to affect the SAR backscatter and lead to false positives while detecting water. In this study, surface water was automatically mapped in hilly landscapes using Sentinel-1 images and the Otsu Valley Emphasis method to detect a threshold for water in the histogram of backscatter. In order to reduce the false positive rate in the steep areas, five different water masks using terrain and drainage information with different thresholds are compared in the mountainous province of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) in South-Africa. The quantitative assessment shows that the overall accuracy ranged between 0.865 and 0.958 with the highest value obtained with a threshold of Height Above the Nearest Drainage index of 10m, leading to the lowest specificity of 0.037. The visual inspection over two reservoirs (Midmar Dam and Wagendrift Dam) shows that there is high agreement between the produced map and the reference data despite differences in their spatial and temporal coverage. Besides, radiometrically terrain corrected SAR data, which could be advantageous in such landscapes were recently made available by the ASF vertex platform. Even though they are not available in NRT, the potential of using such data for water detection is investigated.

M3  - Article
AB  - New data are presented on tornadoes over land in Russia for the period of 1900-2018 based on various sources. In total, information on 1763 tornadoes was collected, including 993 tornadoes from eyewitness reports on tornado passage and/or associated impacts and 770 tornadoes from satellite data on tornado-induced windthrows. Both single tornadoes and tornado outbreaks, the cases of formation of several tornadoes within one meso- or synoptic-scale system, were reported. On average for 20092018, more than 100 tornadoes are observed in Russia per year, including 15 significant tornadoes (with a wind speed >50 m/s) and one intense tornado (with a wind speed >70 m/s). In some years, these rates can be significantly higher and reach 342, 52, and three tornadoes per year, respectively. Tornadoes are observed on about 41 days per year, up to 68 days per annum in some years. The frequency of occurrence of tornadoes of different categories and the probability of their passage over a point on the ground were estimated. These estimates can be further used to assess a risk of tor nado-hazardous situations. The general underestimation of the number of tornadic events in routine meteorological observations and existent statistics is discussed.

TI  - Experience of performing radical trachelectomy with uterine transposition in organ-preserving treatment of stage IB-II invasive cervical cancer
T2  - Voprosy Onkologii (St. Petersburg)
M3  - Article
AB  - The development and implementation of organ-preserving treatment modalities is the priority trend in the current cancer treatment of patients of the reproductive age. Methods of expanding indications for organ-preserving treatment in cancer patients are becoming relevant. We present our experience in performing radical trachelectomy with uterine transposition in patients with stage IB-II cervical cancer. Our surgical technique allows the preservation of the uterus and adnexa in patients with invasive cervical cancer, who need to receive combined modality treatment including extended surgery followed by chemotherapy or radiation therapy to the pelvis. Transposition of the uterus and adnexa after radical abdominal or laparoscopic trachelectomy allows the movement of the uterus and ovaries out of the radiation field. After completion of radiation therapy, the uterus with adnexa is repositioned into the pelvis and uterine-vaginal anastomosis is formed using an implant made of titanium nickelide. Independent pregnancy and the use of assisted reproductive technologies are permitted after passing the time when distant metastases are most likely to develop.

TI  - A Semi-Analytical Optical Remote Sensing Model to Estimate Suspended Sediment and Dissolved Organic Carbon in Tropical Coastal Waters Influenced by Peatland-Draining River Discharges off Sarawak, Borneo
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal water quality degradation is a global challenge. Marine pollution due to suspended sediments and dissolved matter impacts water colour, biogeochemistry, benthic habitats and eventually human populations that depend on marine resources. In Sarawak (Malaysian Borneo), peatland-draining river discharges containing suspended sediments and dissolved organic carbon influence coastal water quality at multiple locations along the coast. Optical remote sensing is an effective tool to monitor coastal waters over large areas and across remote geographic locations. However, the lack of regional optical measurements and inversion models limits the use of remote sensing observations for water quality monitoring in Sarawak. To overcome this limitation, we have (1) compiled a regional spectral optical library for Sarawak coastal waters, (2) developed a new semi-analytical remote sensing model to estimate suspended sediment and dissolved organic carbon in coastal waters, and (3) demonstrated the application of our remote sensing inversion model on satellite data over Sarawak. Bio-optical data analysis revealed that there is a clear spatial variability in the inherent optical properties of particulate and dissolved matter in Sarawak. Our optical inversion model coupled with the Sarawak spectral optical library performed well in retrieving suspended sediment (bias = 3% and MAE = 5%) and dissolved organic carbon (bias = 3% and MAE = 8%) concentrations. Demonstration products using MODIS Aqua data clearly showed the influence of large rivers such as the Rajang and Lupar in discharging suspended sediments and dissolved organic carbon into coastal waters. The bio-optical parameterisation, optical model, and remote sensing inversion approach detailed here can now help improve monitoring and management of coastal water quality in Sarawak.

TI  - Influence of image pixel resolution on canopy cover estimation in poplar plantations from field, aerial and satellite optical imagery
T2  - Annals of Silvicultural Research
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimates of canopy cover (CC) are central for a wide range of forestry studies. As direct measurements are impractical, indirect optical methods have often been used to estimate CC from the complement of gap fraction measurements obtained with restricted-view sensors. In this short note we evaluated the influence of the image pixel resolution (ground sampling distance; GSD) on CC estimation in poplar plantations obtained from field (cover photography; GSD < 1 cm), unmanned aerial (UAV; GSD <10 cm) and satellite (Sentinel-2; GSD = 10 m) imagery. The trial was conducted in poplar tree plantations in Northern Italy, with varying age and canopy cover. Results indicated that the coarser resolution available from satellite data is suitable to obtain estimates of canopy cover, as compared with field measurements obtained from cover photography; therefore, S2 is recommended for larger scale monitoring and routine assessment of canopy cover in poplar plantations. The higher resolution of UAV compared with Sentinel-2 allows finer assessment of canopy structure, which could also be used for calibrating metrics obtained from coarser-scale remote sensing products, avoiding the need of ground measurements.

TI  - Biomass retrieval based on genetic algorithm feature selection and support vector regression in Alpine grassland using ground-based hyperspectral and Sentinel-1 SAR data
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A general framework for the integration of multi-sensor data for dry and fresh biomass retrieval is proposed and tested in Alpine meadows and pastures. To this purpose, hyperspectral spectroradiometer (as simulation of hyperspectral imagery) and biomass samples were collected in field campaigns and Copernicus Sentinel-1 Interferometric Wide (IW) swath SAR backscattering coefficients were used. First, a genetic algorithm feature selection was performed on hyperspectral data, and afterwards the resulting most sensitive bands where combined with SAR data within a support vector regression (SVR) model. The most sensitive hyperspectral bands were mainly located in different regions of the SWIR range for both fresh and dry biomass, and in the red and near-infrared regions mainly for dry biomass, but with less influence for fresh biomass. The R (2) correlation values between the sampled and the estimated biomass range from 0.24 to 0.71. The relatively low performances are mainly related to the saturation effect in the optical bands, as well as to the paucity of points for high values of biomass. The methodology allows a better understanding of the interaction between grassland systems and the electromagnetic spectrum by offering a model with a reduced number of narrow bands in the context of a multi-sensor integration.

TI  - Structure-From-Motion Photogrammetry of Antarctic Historical Aerial Photographs in Conjunction with Ground Control Derived from Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A longer temporal scale of Antarctic observations is vital to better understanding glacier dynamics and improving ice sheet model projections. One underutilized data source that expands the temporal scale is aerial photography, specifically imagery collected prior to 1990. However, processing Antarctic historical aerial imagery using modern photogrammetry software is difficult, as it requires precise information about the data collection process and extensive in situ ground control is required. Often, the necessary orientation metadata for older aerial imagery is lost and in situ data collection in regions like Antarctica is extremely difficult to obtain, limiting the use of traditional photogrammetric methods. Here, we test an alternative methodology to generate elevations from historical Antarctic aerial imagery. Instead of relying on pre-existing ground control, we use structure-from-motion photogrammetry techniques to process the imagery with manually derived ground control from high-resolution satellite imagery. This case study is based on vertical aerial image sets collected over Byrd Glacier, East Antarctica in December 1978 and January 1979. Our results are the oldest, highest resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) ever generated for an Antarctic glacier. We use these DEMs to estimate glacier dynamics and show that surface elevation of Byrd Glacier has been constant for the past similar to 40 years.

TI  - Oceanic primary production trend patterns along coast of Ecuador
T2  - NEOTROPICAL BIODIVERSITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Primary productivity (PP) is a vital oceanographic process generated by photoautotrophic organisms that transform inorganic carbon into organic macronutrients and micronutrients via photosynthesis. While in situ studies have shed light onto the spatial and seasonal variations of chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration, and thus PP, in specific study sites, there are no comprehensive monitoring programs to assess its long-term variation nor its seasonal patterns in broader areas of coastal Ecuador. The main objective of the present study is to evaluate changes in Chl a concentration along the coast of Ecuador and examine how these changes correspond to changes in Sea Surface Temperature (SST). Eighteen offshore and nearshore sampling sites along the Ecuadorian coast were studied over 15 years, using satellite measurements of MODIS-Aqua and MUR. Results show mean Chl a concentration in coastal Ecuador is rather low (1.5 mg m(-3)) in comparison with other oceanic regions. Puerto Bolivar, Gulf of Guayaquil and Esmeraldas were characterized by the highest mean Chl a concentration; while Galera San Francisco Marine Reserve, Cojimies and Cabuyal were characterized by the lowest. A positive trend in Chl a concentration was detected at the southernmost (Puerto Bolivar and Gulf of Guayaquil) and northernmost (Esmeraldas) study sites, with a seasonal trend following the observed seasonal SST trend. Chl a is high in areas under the influence of both the Humboldt upwelling system and river discharge. The positive correlation between Chl a and SST is likely a response to increased precipitation during warmer months. These results highlight the importance of improving our understanding of the effects of climate change on coastal PP, and the potential for these effects to influence the health of commercial and threatened marine species. Further research should assess the implications of changes in PP and SST for species of commercial and conservation importance along the coast of Ecuador.

TI  - Green Cover (Tree) Analysis of Chennai Metropolitan Area Using High Resolution Satellite Imagery
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable urban environment addresses the issues associated with the urban development due to the increase in land use/land cover (LU/LC) and decrease in forest and agricultural areas. As vegetation plays a major role in ecological, social, health, and economic benefits to the inhabitants of a city, urban greeneries should be monitored through the remotely sensed data with high resolution imagery for a sustainable urban development. The present study investigates the green cover (tree) change of Chennai Metropolitan Area (CMA) through the satellite data of Resourcesat-1 LISS IV and Resourcesat-2 LISS IV. CMA consists of approximately 426 km(2) of urban area and 774 km(2) of sub-urban area with many LU/LC categories like settlements, vegetation and open spaces. Green cover mapping with the accuracy assessment was carried out by using both digital image processing technique and on-screen visual interpretation (Google Earth imagery). Vegetation indices and texture analysis were employed to extract the green cover for 2005 and 2012, to which the change detection was applied. The results reveal that the green cover area of CMA administrative boundary decreased approximately by 1.18% for 2005-2012 and the actual green cover for 2012 reduced by 8.62%. This analysis will be useful to the policy makers of urban development in planning infrastructure development projects and administrators of metropolitan cities, especially Chennai.

TI  - A General Framework for Change Detection Using Multimodal Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A general framework for change detection is proposed to analyze multimodal remotely sensed data utilizing the Kronecker product between two data representations (vectors or matrices). The proposed method is sensor independent and provides comparable results to techniques that exist for specific sensors. The proposed fusion technique is a pixel-level approach that incorporates inputs from different modalities, rendering enriched multimodal data representation. Thus, the proposed hybridization procedure helps to assimilate multisensor information in a meaningful manner. A novel change index (C) is defined for the general multimodal case. This index is then used to quantify the change in bitemporal remotely sensed data. This article explores the usability, consistency, and robustness of the proposed multimodal fusion framework, including the change index, with proper validation on two multimodal cases: 1) the dual-frequency (C- and L-band) fully polarimetric Danish EMISAR data and 2) the dual-polarimetric synthetic aperture radar and Sentinel-2 multispectral data. Detailed analysis and validation using extensive ground-truth data are presented to establish the proposed framework.

AB  - The effectiveness of communication strategies depends on the congruence of public communications with the basic values of the target audience. The values can be defined as the phenomena of social reality and as figurative associations to information stimuli. Communications are built on the mental and linguistic basis of society; it reflects the values that are traditional for this society. In the digital era, basic values in the form of figurative associations are still an integral part of people's public consciousness. Due to the fact that associations are related to social attitudes of people, their assimilation and transmission of the system of values, this poses the question about the extent to which associations were modified under the influence of the digital and media environment. Associations explicate people's collective and individual perceptions that are currently continuing to undergo a modification. This article is based on the material obtained as a result of studying positive events of the residents of Krasnoyarsk. The respondents were offered to name an important positive event and three association words connected to it. The nature of a research method is mediated by the content of public consciousness, which reflects the social experience of people who live in the same territory, but in different conditions and possess differentiated knowledge, habits and interests. In addition, the specificity of the paper is the following: it focuses on the qualitative study of the main groups of words denoting these events. In the course of the study, the authors have come to the conclusion that the digital environment of a metropolitan city influences the worldview of metropolitan city residents and is perceived by them as a communication tool, the space for communication and recreation. The basic life values remain the same: relationships in family and with friends, childbirth, communication with nature and with animals, favourite activities, professional fulfillment, etc.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE Statistical Signal Processing Workshop (SSP)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Multimodal remote sensing data analysis can strongly improve the characterization of physical phenomena on Earth's surface. Nonetheless, nonidealities and estimation imperfections between records and investigation models can limit its information extraction ability. Ensemble learning could be used to tackle these issues. Combining the information acquired by multiple weak classifiers can prevent the analysis of large scale heterogeneous datasets from being affected by overfitting and biasing. In this paper, we introduce an enhanced ensemble learning scheme where the information acquired by the weak classifiers is combined to optimize the maximum information extraction for the given system at a decision level. Using an asymptotic information theory-based approach, we define the capacity index associated with the maximum accuracy that can be achieved under optimal conditions for multimodal analysis. By selecting the decisions delivered by the different classifiers according to the capacity optimization, the performance of the ensemble learning scheme will be maximized.

TI  - A Systems Approach to Front-End Redesign With Rapid Triage Implementation
T2  - ADVANCED EMERGENCY NURSING JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The most common site for hospital sentinel events due to care delays, secondary to waiting and/or inefficient processes, occurs in the emergency department (ED). Decreasing patient length of stay in an ED is a key initiative for many hospitals in order to maximize both quality and efficiency. The purpose of this practice improvement project was to (1) standardize front-end processes across a 6-hospital health system, (2) move non-sorting-related clinical questions out of triage, and (3) improve door-to-triage and door-to-provider times. The project occurred within a 6-hospital East Coast health system. This was a continuous quality improvement initiative utilizing the Donabedian theoretical model, plus the DMAIC method, for process improvement. A system-wide performance work team was formed including ED leaders and staff; site-specific implementation teams were also formed. Rapid triage implementation was effective in producing statistically significant improvement in door-to-triage, door-to-provider, and ED length of stay for discharged patients at 3 of the 6 sites. Further performance improvement projects in this area are needed to better understand the generalizability of this process in other EDs. Furthermore, from a leadership perspective, additional investigation is needed into the cost savings as well as shared labor opportunities that may exist when policies and processes are standardized across a system's service line.

AB  - Purpose: At present, there are a variety of serious patient safety incidents related to problems in health information technology (HIT), specifically involving electronic medical records (EMRs). This emphasizes the need for an enhanced electronic medical record system (EMRS). As such, this study analyzed both the nature of and potential to prevent incidents associated with HIT/EMRS based on data from the Korea Patient Safety Reporting and Learning System (KOPS).Methods: This study analyzed patient safety incidents submitted to KOPS between August 2016 and December 2019. HIT keywords were used to extract HIT/EMRS incidents. Each case was reviewed to confirm whether the contributing factors were related to HIT/EMRS (HIT/EMRS-related incidents) and if the incident could have been prevented (HIT/EMRS-preventable incidents). The selected reports were summarized for general clarity (e.g., incident type, and degree of harm).Results: Of the 25,515 obtained reports, 2,664 incidents (10.4%) were HIT-related, while 2,525 (9.9%) were EMRS-related. HIT/EMRS-related incidents were the third largest type of incident followed by 'fall' and 'medication incidents.' More than 80% of HIT/EMRS-related incidents were medication-related, accounting for approximately one-third of the total number of medication incidents. Approximately 10% of HIT/EMRS-related incidents resulted in patient harm, with more than 94% of these deemed as preventable; further, sentinel events were wholly preventable.Conclusion: This study provides basic data for improving EMR use/safety standards based on real-world patient safety incidents. Such improvements entail the establishment of long-term plans, research, and incident analysis, thus ensuring a safe healthcare environment for patients and healthcare providers.

AB  - This study examines the characteristics and artistic value of BTS contents, which have proven their global influence, and explores the direction of culture and art education using digital media contents through the ‘BTS phenomenon’. The artistic value of BTS' works is the change in the way they partic- ipate in art acceptance, the power to create positive influence and positive change through their worldview and narrative, as well as fusion content that transcends genres and crosses all art fields.Accordingly, based on the contents of BTS, the direction of culture and art education is suggested as follows. First, by using the media content of the online platform as learning material, we encour- age the active participation of learners through practical experiences such as the interpretation, pro- duction and analysis of works. Second, storytelling learning helps learners actively learn by providing motivation, interest, and focus in learning. Third, by using media contents of performances or per- formance videos that converge modern and traditional arts, learners naturally become interested in Korean traditional culture and art. Fourth, as non-face-to-face education began due to the COVID-19 crisis, it is necessary to actively utilize online public performing arts contents in terms of the use of culture and art education in public performing arts. Finally, it is necessary to establish an educational environment for an online platform that provides a place for free communication in terms of com- munity activities in which learners create and share stories of themselves and their peers through music, dance, or video.

T2  - Journal of Christian Education in Korea

AB  - The purpose of this study is to explore the direction that Christian education should take as an ecological education in the crisis of climate change. What climate change shows is that it is impossible to survive even if the Earth's temperature rises by only 2-3 degrees. However, our current appearance is concerned about the crisis of climate change as long as we do not change our lives. First, the meaning of climate change and its causes were examined. The anthropocentric worldview, modern industrial, scientific and technological growth, and consumption-oriented social structure can be cited as the causes. An anthropocentric worldview justifies everything from the human point of view, and nature is the subject of human domination, but one regarded as a tool. In addition, as the scale of human economic activity increases, energy consumption increases, and the threat of ecosystem destruction increases with the increase in energy consumption. Individual affluence and increased consumption are exacerbating ecosystem tensions. In order to solve the problem of climate change, ecological education clues were found in the Bible. Through creation, the relationship between humans and nature was identified as coexistence and coexistence. Through the principle of sabbath, it is possible to bring about the restoration of humans and nature, and from the point of view of the incarnation, the world was understood as the ‘body’ of God. Based on these clues, the direction of Christian ecological education was explored by suggesting a transition to an ecological paradigm, restoration of creative spirituality, and cultivation of ecological imagination. In the crisis of climate change, it is hoped that the recovery of the earth will take place and that we will be able to stand again as a responsible being through the Christian ecological educational approach.

M3  - research-article
AB  - Jin Sup Yoon, one of Korea’s leading performance artists, worked as a critic, curator, and educator while pursuing avant-garde art throughout his life. Most notable within his long career is Yoon’s role as a living witness of the history of Korean performance art, and his seventy or so performance pieces that have been released to date. Many artists have practiced performance art since the genre’s introduction in Korea, but few have produced performance works consistently throughout their lifetime. In addition, it is rare to see artists with such diverse careersYoon worked simultaneously as a performance artist, a performance-related exhibition curator at home and abroad, a performance critic and a historical researcher. Therefore, examining Jin Sup Yoon’s works and the practices involved is a matter of examining the development process of the more than forty years of Korean performance art history. Although each era of Yoon’s performance shows its distinct nature, the ultimate motivation behind his works remains the same throughout. It is a continuous quest, explored through the medium of performance, to break free from the ideological dichotomy that modern and contemporary Korean art has been so obsessed with: ‘participation’ and ‘purity.’ For this goal he has traversed the inside and outside of the Korean art scene in order to bring a change of perception. Yoon’s performances, constructed freely and without any set path or strategy, are the result of the artist’s nomadic worldview. Less grandiose and more delightful, like a child’s play, they sought to create a fissure within the mainstream art scene instead of confronting it head to head. Yoon continues to create his unique kind of performance pieces to this day, using art as “play,” a new way of thinking that can free itself from hostile ideological divisions.

AB  - This paper analyzed the ideological characteristics of Yi Heongyeong (李獻慶, 1719∼1791) alongside the worldview of the Southerners faction in Gyeonggi province by examining his “Li (理, principle)-Se (勢, situation) theory” and “Sim (心, Heart Mind)-Seong (性, human nature) theory.” Yi Heongyeong attempted to explain various world phenomena in terms of the relationship between the concepts of principle and situation. He particularly focused his attention on Li that is inherent in all reality and interpreted it from the point of view of natural law. Through this, he formulated ideas that value the change of reality. Such concepts were also reflected in his Sim-Seong theory. Yi Heongyeong and his father, Yi Jehwa (李齊華, 1691∼1768), believed that Sadan (四端, four beginnings of human behavior) and Chilchong (七情, seven emotions of human behavior) had only one source, which they presented as Li. The　Sadan　Chilchong　theory, which resembles Yi Heongyeong’s theory, was widespread within the Southerners faction whose academic tradition was related to that of the Northerners faction. Against this backdrop, this paper suggests that the Northerners faction’s academic tradition was latent in Yi Heongyeong’s scholarship.

AB  - Aim of this research was to classify forest types at Wando in Jeonnam Province and develop warm temperate forest management system with application of Remote Sensing and GIS. Another emphasis was given to the analysis of satellite images to compare forest type changes over 10 year periods from 2009 to 2019. We have accomplished this study by using ArcGIS Pro and ENVI. For this research, Landsat satellite images were obtained by means of terrestrial, airborne and satellite imagery. Based on the field survey data, all land uses and forest types were divided into 5 forest classes; Evergreen broad-leaved forest, Evergreen Coniferous forest, Deciduous broad-leaved forest, Mixed fores, and others. Supervised classification was carried out with a random forest classifier based on manually collected training polygons in ROI. Accuracy assessment of the different forest types and land-cover classifications was calculated based on the reference polygons. Comparison of forest changes over 10 year periods resulted in different vegetation biomass volumes, producing the loss of deciduous forests in 2019 probably due to the expansion of residential areas and rapid deforestation.

M3  - research-article
AB  - Human history has been the process of expanding human control over environment. The critical factor from psychological viewpoint is the emergence of the selfhood owing to the capacity for self-consciousness and language. The Western self, armed with the political philosophies of individualism and liberalism, redefined the nature of humanity and provided incessant source of power to energize its quest of expanding control over environment in undeterred manner. The development of technology has got rid of most restraints which defined the humanity and posed a pivotal moment to proceed beyond the humanity. Facing the 4th industrial revolution, humanity experiences the age of selfhood being overly inflated. Two symptoms are noted as exposing such symptoms: the obsession with happiness and the increase of narcissism across nations. To understand this inflated self and the proposals to deflate it, we review briefly two approaches-- self actualization and self transcendence-- and relate them to mature personality. We review some alternative conceptions arising to quiet the self such as self-expansion, selflessness, and the interactive self. We propose a new perspective of the interactive selfhood(Chok self), couched in the Korean worldview, is a promising alternative to cure the overly inflated self.

As a result, the changing details and basic frameworks start with an ambiguous distinction between the nation and the class, and serve as a basis for the understanding of the general trend of the North Korean narrative after a sacrifice commitment to the state, especially extreme overwork. However, in order to make it more meaningful, the analysis of the articles at the time and after the implementation of the land reform and the epic on-site coverage should be supplemented.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to elucidate the spatio-temporal characteristics of ultrafine dust generation in East Asia and the synoptic climate patterns related to its dispersal which has its adverse effects on public health across East Asia. To achieve this purpose, Level 3 monthly Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) data extracted from MODIS satellite imagery (MOD08_M3) representing particle matters less than 2.5 micrometer (PM 2.5) and the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis I upper-level climatic data associated with the exacerbation of ultrafine dust problem are analyzed for the recent 20-year (2001-2020) period. Analyses of long-term average MOD08 data show that high AOD value exceeding 0.5 or more frequently occurred in populous cities in East Asia but mainly in the vicinity of densely populated large rivers and the eastern lowlands in China between mid-winter and mid-spring, which is attributable to the accumulation effects of continuous fossil fuel consumption for heating and manufacturing.Despite the overall decreasing trend of ultrafine dust across China in the 2010s, the weakened westerlies in the warmer climate as well as its continuous generation from the densely populated industrial regions of China provide a favorable synoptic climate condition for frequent severe ultrafine dust problems across East Asia including South Korea. These results indicate that ultrafine dust from China is a long-lasting transboundary environmental problem across East Asia, which needs long-term international cooperation in developing the sustainable policies.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to explore the spatio-temporal patterns of transboundary ultrafine dust extreme events (TUDEE), which migrate from China toward neighboring countries in East Asia based on longterm (2001-2020) monthly MODIS satellite imagery data (MOD08_M3). The characteristics of the atmospheric circulation related to their dispersal in extreme cases are also examined by analyzing the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis I data. Long-term average maps of monthly maximum MODIS Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) show that the TUDEE with “Very Bad”level (exceeding 1.5 of AOD) originates mainly from northeastern China (115-120Â°E, 30-40Â°N). It is also observed that the southeastward propagation of ultrafine dust plumes following the northwesterlies exacerbates the air quality over Yellow Sea as well as over the western region of the Korean Peninsula. The intensity of TUDEE moving from China toward the western region of the Korean Peninsula is enhanced between earlyspring and mid-spring (March-April), when the significant amount of ultrafine dust from fossil fuel consumption for heating and manufacturing in China can be stagnant over Yellow Sea due to the weakened northwesterly wind compared with that in winter. Time series data of monthly maximum AOD demonstrate that the intensity of TUDEE from China is persistent without decreasing trend even in the late 2010s. Analyses of synoptic climate charts for extreme cases reveal that the formation of anomalous anti-westerlies across East Asia by weaker Aleutian low pressure as well as the formation of stable vertical atmospheric structure help the stagnation of severe ultrafine dust plume over Yellow Sea. It is also notable that the dry air condition indicated by negative anomalies of precipitable water in southern China may also contribute to more intense TUDEE from China toward the neighboring countries including South Korea.

TI  - A Fast Retrieval of Cloud Parameters Using a Triplet of Wavelengths of Oxygen Dimer Band around 477 nm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds act as a major reflector that changes the amount of sunlight reflected to space. Change in radiance intensity due to the presence of clouds interrupts the retrieval of trace gas or aerosol properties from satellite data. In this paper, we developed a fast and robust algorithm, named the fast cloud retrieval algorithm, using a triplet of wavelengths (469, 477, and 485 nm) of the O-2-O-2 absorption band around 477 nm (CLDTO4) to derive the cloud information such as cloud top pressure (CTP) and cloud fraction (CF) for the Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS). The novel algorithm is based on the fact that the difference in the optical path through which light passes with regard to the altitude of clouds causes a change in radiance due to the absorption of O-2-O-2 at the three selected wavelengths. To reduce the time required for algorithm calculations, the look-up table (LUT) method was applied. The LUT was pre-constructed for various conditions of geometry using Vectorized Linearized Discrete Ordinate Radiative Transfer (VLIDORT) to consider the polarization of the scattered light. The GEMS was launched in February 2020, but the observed data of GEMS have not yet been widely released. To evaluate the performance of the algorithm, the retrieved CTP and CF using observational data from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2), which cover the spectral range of GEMS, were compared with the results of the Fast Retrieval Scheme for Clouds from the Oxygen A band (FRESCO) algorithm, which is based on the O-2 A-band. There was good agreement between the results, despite small discrepancies for low clouds.

T2  - JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, abnormally high water temperature (AHWT) phenomena are occurring more often due to the global warming and its impact. These phenomena have damaged extensively to the maritime economy around the southern coast of Korea and caused an illness by exacerbating the propagation of Vibrio pathogens. To mitigate damages by AHWT phenomena, it is necessary to respond as quickly as possible or predict them in advance. In this study, therefore, we proposed a deep learning-based methodology to predict the occurrences of AHWT phenomena using the long short-term memory (LSTM) model. First, a LSTM model was trained using the satellite-derived water temperature data over the past ten years. Then, the water temperatures after a few days were estimated using the trained LSTM model. In a performance evaluation, when estimating water temperatures after one-day, the model achieved results of 1.865 and 0.412 in terms of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root mean square error (RMSE), respectively. Second, we developed a decision algorithm based on the Markov state transition in order to predict the AHWT occurrence probability. As a result, we obtained 0.88 of F1 score for predicting AHWT phenomena after 1 day in case of the southern coast of Korea.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to examine the characteristics of Junggoje school and the transmission context of Shimcheongga among Pansori by master singer Park Dong-jin. To this end, we first looked into information about Kim Chang-jin, the master of Park Dong-jin's master, his learning history, and his activities. Kim Chang-jin became a master singer of his time based on Kim Chang-ryong's Shimcheongga, but unfortunately, he passed away in Seocheon in his later years. Park Dong-jin handed down his Shimcheongga, and completed the first Shimcheongga in 1970, and performed the full part again at the Deep Rooted Tree appreciation party in 1976. Park Dong-jin's Shimcheongga has strong middle-class characteri stics, and it can be confirmed that there are many parts that are very similar to those of Sim Jeong-soon, Kim Chang-ryong, and Heo Heung-sik.In terms of narrative, Park Dong-jin's Shimcheongga strengthens the narrative of Mr Shim(Shimcheong’s father) and sets the process of his downfall and recovery as an important axis. It embodies the active Shimcheong against the fatalistic world. The editorial is rich and the dramatic depiction is excellent. Park Dong-jin's Shimcheongga aims for a fantastic ending that awakens the eyes with plants that see again, but shows a conservative worldview in that festivals and feasts with various blind people are reduced in number and ended with a didactic editorial. This point can be said to have been handed down in the tradition of the middle class. It was also confirmed that the master singer Dong-jin Park transmitted Shimcheongga creatively and flexibly through the middle-class tradition and editorial peculiar to Park Dong-jin.

Its analysis is focused on the writings, songs, proclamations, meeting records, etc. as primary sources produced by the youth involved in the Wandervogel at that time. This paper follows the trajectory of the youth movement, differentiating it by periods of development and by points of change in its worldview and reality and looks at the process of the Wandervogel’s development dividing it into three stages. The First World War was the decisive point of change in the worldview of the Wandervogel.Inquiring into what the world the German youth dreamed of a century ago looked like, what the problems of the older generation and of modern society were from their point of view, we can see that in our reality of the present day certain unchanged truths lie in the symptoms of an old crisis.

AB  - The scholars who studied Seongho Yi Ik (1681~1764)'s concepts focused on the remarkable differentiation of Seongho's Li (理). They understood differentiation as a severance between Wu-li (物理) and Dao-li (道理), nature and humanities, and facts and values.Also, based on the differentiation of the Li concept, they evaluated that Seonghohak (星湖學) was moving away from the Zuja's unified worldview and moving toward modern thinking. On the other hand, other researchers argued that there was no inevitable reason for Seongho to preempt European scientific knowledge, and that subdivision phenomenon of Li did not appear for the purpose of dismantling Zujahak.This article aims to examine the mixed views of previous studies and to infer the point of the idea and plan of Seonghohak. To this end, in Chapter 2, we checked the manner in which Seongho classified Li, and reviewed from the fundamental stages whether the classification framework of previous studies suits it. In Chapter 3, Seongho's concept of Tai-ji (太極) and Yi-li (一理) was analyzed in detail to examine whether he deviated from the undifferentiated thinking of Zujahak. Subsequently, in Chapter 4, the reason for Seongho's differentiation of Li was inferred by linking it with his wonderings and contemplation of Toegye's Li-issuance (理發) theory.

AB  - Vegetation processes have a significant impact on rainfall runoff processes through evapotranspiration control, but are rarely considered in the conceptual lumped hydrological model. This study evaluated the model performance of the Hapcheon Dam watershed by integrating the ecological module expressing the leaf area index data sensed remotely from the satellite into the hydrological partition module. The proposed eco-hydrological model has three main features to better represent the eco-hydrological process in humid regions. 1) The growth rate of vegetation is constrained by water shortage stress in the watershed. 2) The maximum growth of vegetation is limited by the energy of the watershed climate. 3) The interaction of vegetation and aquifers is reflected. The proposed model simultaneously simulates hydrologic components and vegetation dynamics of watershed scale. The following findings were found from the validation results using the model parameters estimated by the SCEM algorithm. 1) Estimating the parameters of the eco-hydrological model using the leaf area index and streamflow data can predict the streamflow with similar accuracy and robustness to the hydrological model without the ecological module. 2) Using the remotely sensed leaf area index without filtering as input data is not helpful in estimating streamflow. 3) The integrated eco-hydrological model can provide an excellent estimate of the seasonal variability of the leaf area index.

AB  - Wes Anderson is a classic example of the filmmaker that the Cahiers du cinema critics labeled an auteur. He has a distinct worldview and visual characteristics and has produced animated films as well as live-action films. When he first directed the "Fantastic Mr. Fox", he was praised as "Wes found the perfect medium." It is due to his live-action movie, in which he designs and controls everything like animation. It makes his film looks artificial with unique visual images, unrealistic characters, notorious symmetry composition, and planimetric composition. His directing characteristics were consistent with freedom and restriction in <Isle of Dogs>. To create an intense moment, he used the Dutch angle with exceptions to the director's signature symmetry composition. Also, there were technical difficulties in filming small miniature actors to create a plane composition of the director. It makes a unique harmony of tragedy and comedy by Dogs' witty expressions and vocal performances created comic elements and the colorful colors of the sunset created a fairytale-like landscape, in the grim reality of <Isle of Dogs>.  The <Isle of Dogs> is an auteur work that has a rarity and encourages various attempts in the animation industry full of Disney and Pixar styles.

AB  - This paper is an attempt to observe the musical as a youth theme, and to observe the entire activities of the musical enthusiasts on the Yeonmugal platform in order to observe the musical enthusiasts who are increasingly influential in the Korean musical market over time, and to find out where they overlap with the general tendencies of the 20-30s MZ generation. To understand the worldview of the Yeonmugal platform, three criteria are applied: First, compared to PC communication online clubs in the 1990s, enthusiasts gathered on the Yeonmugal platform thoroughly as a community of tastes and emotions and have a principle of working on the premise of equal relationships. Second, the political and cultural experiences accumulated in the activities of Yeonmugal strengthen the belief in correctness in their actions and judgment, which easily leads to opposition to the performance based on political correctness and fairness. Finally, the Yeonmugal enthusiasts expand the narrative of the performance and distinguish Muggles from Mudoks through collective actions that make up the worldview, and reveal their identity most strongly. Watching a show repeatedly is an essential condition for this, and the process of sharing daily theatrical content to fill the gaps and deficiencies in the narrative together is key to maximizing the pleasure of fandom activities. Through analysis by these criteria, we observe the way in which Yeonmugal enthusiasts perceive the entire fandom activity as a performing act in a community of tastes and emotions and desire its practical influence.

AB  - This paper examined that the multiple viewpoints description method of Kyung-hee Lee's That Day, There and Bo-young Kim's The Prophet of Mundanity classified as SF novels, is a device that effectively reflects on disasters in the real world and studied its ethical significance.The emergence of the science fiction genre is embodied in today's imagination in disaster literature. However, the way of dealing with disasters cannot be irrelevant to ethical concerns. Primo Levi's “The Drowned” and “The Saved” provides clues for ethical reproduction. The testimony of the Saved cannot represent the experience of the Drowned because it is not rescued. Therefore, literature that testifies to disasters seeks an ethical approach with subjective and multiple oral phrases. This paper reviews the fact that the ethical methodology of multi-gwan writing described above can be doubled by mediating the attributes of science fiction novels that add discontinuous variables to the real world.Since That Day, There is an SF novel, it solves disasters by intersecting the viewpoint of mothers, daughters, and younger siblings through time travel devices possible. The Prophet of Mundanity explores ethics about others through a speculative worldview seeking learning through self-division and integration. The two works present new solutions to disasters through multiple viewpoints and SF elements. This allows the reader to reflect on the limitations of reality and incomprehensible possibilities together andcompletes ethics as literature.

AB  - Science, which has developed along with the long history of mankind, has entered our lives and has permeated our culture. Newton’s theory of gravity also provided us with a mechanistic worldview, and has had its influence from the 17th century to the present in terms of civilization and cultural history. However, quantum theory, relativity, and thermodynamics shake the solidity of Newton’s laws of nature. In particular, Prigogine not only criticized Newton’s classical dynamics with the theory of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, but ultimately insisted on a new evolutionary science paradigm.The purpose of this study is to philosophically analyze whether Prigogine’s theory is applicable to the study of Confucian culture. To this end, I focused on the concepts of the dissipative structures, self-organization, and irreversibility of time, and examined the connection between these concepts and the Confucian culture, and revealed the limitations of Prigogine’s theory of time.

AB  - Six years of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data were employed to analyze the detection variability of Internal Solitary Waves (ISW) in the Lombok Strait when the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) occurs from 2015 to 2020. Sentinel-1 SAR images were employed to investigate the annual and monthly distribution frequency in the Lombok Strait. The annual distribution of ISW signatures detection shows an inter-annual variability, indicating long-term modification process. ISW detection frequencies increased during Positive IOD in 2019 and decreased during La Nina events in 2020 in Indonesian seas. ISW detection for the monsoonal variation is often detected during the South East Monsoon (SEM) when the southward through-flow exists in the generation site. The monthly distribution reveals that the highest frequency in October is as high as 53% and the lowest frequency in June is as low as 37% over a six-year period. The potential cause of variability depends on the difference in the thermocline's depth, which indirectly affects the amplitude and wavelength of the ISW.

TI  - Gravity field of Sarmatia according to satellite data (model EIGEN-6S2) and its interpretation
T2  - GEOFIZICHESKIY ZHURNAL-GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper presents a brief overview of satellite observations of the CHAMP, GRACE and GOCE missions to study the Earth's global gravity field, and the used mathematical apparatus in the form of an expansion of the geopotential in spherical harmonics. The application of satellite data in various fields of Earth Sciences is considered. As a basic global model of the Earth's gravity field based on satellite data we used the EIGEN-6S2 model [Rudenko et al, 2014] that combines satellite mission data GRACE and GOCE, and also uses satellite data of LAGEOUS laser ranging. On its basis, the gravity field of Sarmatia was analyzed using the Free Air anomalies, Bouguer anomalies, the second radial derivative of the geopotential and the geoid heights. The geological units of Sarmatia and its surroundings are most clearly manifested in the Free Air anomalies and in the distribution of the second derivative of the geopotential, showing differences in the gravity field pattern of the Ukrainian Shield, the Voronezh Massif, and the Pripyat-Dnieper-Donets basin (PDDB) with characteristic anomalies of the general northwest strike. The continuation of the PDDB in a southeastern direction through the Karpinsky Swell to the northern part of the Caspian Sea confirms the existence of an extended ancient tectonic zone of the Sarmato-Turanian lineament. The geoid within Sarmatia shows in general a regional west-east gradient change from +40 m in the west to -10 m in the east. Such large-scale geoid changes are determined by the Sarmatia position between two global geoid anomalies - the maximum of the North Atlantic and the minimum of the Indian Ocean.

TI  - YEVHEN CHYKALENKO AND KHARKIV: THE HISTORY OF RELATIONSHIP

M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the research is to find out the aspects of Yevhen Chykalenko's stay in Kharkiv during his studies at Kharkiv University which have various interpretations in his Spohady (Memoirs) and scientific literature; to establish the specificity of Yevhen Chykalenko's circle of influence made up of the closest to him at the university; to highlight Yevhen Chykalenko's attitude to Kharkiv in order to determine the Ukrainian nationalist movement members' attitude to everything related to the urban world. The Research Methodology. The article focuses on the analysis of Yevhen Chykalenko's reception of such basic features of the urban environment as people; city space; the function of the city; the conditions of everyday life, which are based on the analysis of the archival materials, the documents of Kharkiv University, the full set of his Shchodennyk (Diary) of 1907 - 1929 and the correspondence of an outstanding entrepreneur and philanthropist Yevhen Chykalenko. The scientific novelty consists in the fact that the chronological framework of Yevhen Chykalenko's stay in Kharkiv, the peculiarities of the social environment of the circle of his closest friends among the students and teachers as well as specificity and evolution of Ye. Chykalenko's attitude to Kharkiv have been regarded in the research for the first time. The Conclusions. Ye. Chykalenko's life in Kharkiv covered no more than two academic years, during which he studied at Physics and Mathematics Faculty and later at the Law Faculty of Kharkiv University. Taking into account the fact that he was just an audit student at university as well as the specificity of the educational process organization, he did not have the opportunity to "feel" the spirit of a big city. His childhood friends from Yelisavetgrad had the greatest impact on both his life in Kharkiv and the reception of the city. His closest social circle consisted of students from raznochintsy. Yevhen Chykalenko witnessed Kharkiv's evolution from the educational center on the border of the Ukrainian lands and therefore functioning mainly as a transit city for many young Ukrainians, to the centre of the Bolshevik political repression known as The Red Terror. Ye. Chykalenko's attitude to Kharkiv remained neutral rather than hostile. Nevertheless, it wasn't friendly. The main reason for such reception of the city was the central government. Concerning urban space, Ye. Chykalenko was mainly interested in such locations as hotels and theatres. However, the houses where he lived were less significant for him. He didn't like urban romance, urban lifestyle and he did not write anything about the social strata of the urban population, streets, and districts of the city, types of random passers-by. Ye. Chykalenko regards a big city as a necessary space for the implementation of the projects of the Ukrainian national and cultural revival. On the contrary, the romance of the rural world was just as inherent for Ye. Chykalenko as for the bearers of the traditional worldview - the Ukrainian peasants.

AB  - Synthetic Apreture Radar (SAR) is attracting attentions with its possibility of producing high resolution data that can be used for soil moisture estimation. High resolution soil moisture data enables more specific observation of soil moisture than existing soil moisture products from other satellites. It can also be used for studies of wildfire, landslide, and flood. The SAR based soil moisture estimation should be conducted considering vegetation, which affects backscattering signals from the SAR sensor. In this study, a SAR based soil moisture estimation at regions covered with various vegetation types on the middle area of Korea (Cropland, Grassland, Forest) is conducted. The representative backscattering model, Water Cloud Model (WCM) is used for soil moisture estimation over vegetated areas. Radar Vegetation Index (RVI) and in-situ soil moisture data are used as input factors for the model. Total 6 study areas are selected for 3 vegetation types according to land cover classification with 2 sites per each vegetation type. Soil moisture evaluation result shows that the accuracy of each site stands out in the order of grassland, forest, and cropland. Forested area shows correlation coefficient value higher than 0.5 even with the most dense vegetation, while cropland shows correlation coefficient value lower than 0.3. The proper vegetation and soil moisture conditions for SAR based soil moisture estimation are suggested through the results of the study. Future study, which utilizes additional ancillary vegetation data (vegetation height, vegetation type) is thought to be necessary.

AB  - Detection of surface water features including river, wetland, reservoir from the satellite imagery can be utilized for sustainable management and survey of water resources. This research compared the water indices derived from the multispectral bands and the machine learning technique for detecting the surface water features from he Landsat-8 satellite image acquired in Daegu through the following steps. First, the NDWI(Normalized Difference Water Index) image and the MNDWI(Modified Normalized Difference Water Index) image were separately generated using the multispectral bands of the given Landsat-8 satellite image, and the two binary images were generated from these NDWI and MNDWI images, respectively. Then SVM(Support Vector Machine), the widely used machine learning techniques, were employed to generate the land cover image and the binary image was also generated from the generated land cover image.Finally the error matrices were used for measuring the accuracy of the three binary images for detecting the surface water features. The statistical results showed that the binary image generated from the MNDWI image(84%) had the relatively low accuracy than the binary image generated from the NDWI image(94%) and generated by SVM(96%). And some misclassification errors occurred in all three binary images where the land features were misclassified as the surface water features because of the shadow effects.

AB  - In previous research, the coastal wetlands were detected by using the vegetation indices or land cover classification maps derived from the multispectral bands of the satellite or aerial imagery, and this approach caused the various limitations for detecting the coastal wetlands with high accuracy due to the difficulty of acquiring both land cover and topographic information by using the single remote sensing data. This research suggested the efficient methodology for detecting the coastal wetlands using the sentinel-2 satellite image and SRTM(Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) DEM (Digital Elevation Model) acquired in Gomsoman Bay, west coasts of South Korea through the following steps. First, the NDWI(Normalized Difference Water Index) image was generated using the green and near-infrared bands of the given Sentinel-2 satellite image. Then, the binary image that separating lands and waters was generated from the NDWI image based on the pixel intensity value 0.2 as the threshold and the other binary image that separating the upper sea level areas and the under sea level areas was generated from the SRTM DEM based on the pixel intensity value 0 as the threshold. Finally, the coastal wetland map was generated by overlaying analysis of these binary images. The generated coastal wetland map had the 94% overall accuracy.In addition, the other types of wetlands such as inland wetlands or mountain wetlands were not detected in the generated coastal wetland map, which means that the generated coastal wetland map can be used for the coastal wetland management tasks.

T2  - CHUNG WAI LITERARY QUARTERLY
M3  - Article
AB  - With the molecular turn in contemporary technosciences, the emergence of nano-reality and the dynamic flows of matter, energy, information, and life have resulted in a radical transformation of the traditional humanist and anthropocentric worldview. The breach, transversal, and reconstitution of boundaries as well as the non-linear feedback loops of complex systems increasingly complicate the notion of human accountability. This paper engages in such a discursive field from a molecular feminist perspective. First, I foreground the implosion of the Anthropocene and the Virocene, and thereby propose an embodied perspectivism of trans-species diffraction. Second, I discuss Donna Haraway's politics of making kins with her interpretation of Lynn Margulis's symbiogenesis. Third, I examine Luciana Parisi's microfeminist politics with regard to her articulation of Margulis's endosymbiosis. Last, drawing on relevant studies, I outline a living imagery of heterogeneous symbiosis from the perspective of organisms' extended organization and explore the micropolitics of boundaries in complex life connectivities.

T2  - UROLOGICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: The utility of indocyanine green dye (ICG) has evolved significantly to the robotic operations including Robotic Assisted Radical Prostatectomy (RARP). The technology can help the identification of sentinel lymphatic drainage in lymphadenectomy for the majority of prostate cancer (PCa) patients. We describe the potential indications of ICG for lymphadenectomy assistant in PCa patients without lymph node or distant metastasis. Materials and Methods: We prospectively analyzed PCa patients without lymph node or distant metastasis with clinical pathological stage T1c to T3a received RARP from November 2019 to May 2020. The clinical data and pathological data, including Gleason score, tumor volume, pathological stage, and surgical findings, were described. All lymph nodes were divided into ICG positive or negative. All patients were divided into low, moderate, and high risk according to the European Association of Urology PCa risk stratification. Results: Cystoscope-guided intraprostatic injection was performed successively in 34 localized PCa patients in this study. The mean age was 66.1 +/- 7.8 years old. The patients' number of high, moderate, and low risk was 18, 10, 6. A total of 447 lymph nodes were identified. Two hundred and sixty-two lymph nodes were ICG positive and 181 lymph nodes were ICG negative. ICG positive rate higher in high risk patients 158/259 (61.0%) compare to intermediate/low risk patients 104/188 (55.3%). There was no statistic significant result, but lymph node could be identified in all ICG-positive tissues. There were 12 patients revealed higher Gleason grade group after RARP and two patients revealed lower Gleason grade group after RARP. There were 18 patients showed upgrade stage after RARP and 4 patients showed down stage after RARP. Conclusion: Cystoscope-guided intraprostatic ICG injection with fluorescence lymphangiography can help identify pelvic lymph nodes in RARP for PCa patients without lymph node or distant metastasis.

AB  - The article aims to reaffirm ‘the essence of true humanity and the conditions of human life’ for the church and the world to be restored after the corona pandemic by criticizing the alternative anthropology of posthumanism and presenting answers from Christian theology.The global pandemic of Corona is predicting a worldview shift by asking fundamental questions about humanity. In particular, the Fourth Industrial Revolutionists argue that science and technology is a breakthrough in the era of constant epidemic disease, and say that the corona pandemic will be ‘The Great Reset’ of the transformation of world history. Behind the Fourth Industrial Revolution theory is posthumanism, which dismantles the foundation of human biological life through ‘the disappearance of time and space’ and promotes technological evolutionary reconstruction through the fusion of humans and machines.Posthumanism erases the boundary between man and machine and tries to evolve human biological life in the physical world into mechanical life through fusion with machines such as androids, cyborgs, and clones. For posthumanism, time, space, and body are elements that hinder human expansion, and the soul is a concept unsuitable for the fusion of humans and machines. This unfamiliar worldview sees humans as mechanisms and understands human souls as algorithms, and argues that human life can be extended through VR(virtual reality) or AR(augmented reality). Posthumanism is a technological-utopianism ideology and an anti-Christian idol invented by our time.On the other hand, the anthropology of Christian theology asks the Creator God, the transcendent reference point, what human nature and human life are. Time and space, the biological body, and the physical world are the ‘given’ conditions as a gift from God through which humans must live.It is the covenant order of time, space, and relationship that human light should be reflected and illuminated as the image of God. Human life is realized in time and in a relationship that goes back and forth between spaces. As Imago Dei, human is a homo relationis, living in a threefold relationship between God, his/her fellow human, and the world. As a pilgrim of time and space(homo viator), Christians live eschatological time and the kingdom of God. In the time of redemption and holy communal relationship, we become human and Christian. God will redeem time, space, and humans living in it without extinguishing it.In conclusion, against the vain worldview of posthumanism, Christian theology must emphasize that the field of time, space, and relationship is an irreducible condition as God’s covenant order for true humanity and human life.

AB  - In the field of modern professional counseling, the field of Christian Counseling has developed with a high level of expertise and public influence. However, behind it, Christian counselors who learn and use general counseling theory as a methodology have experienced the discomfort of ambiguity in front of questions about the identity of Christian Counseling. Therefore, as Christian Counseling has developed into a practical discipline, studies on identity have been continuously conducted. It was mainly approaches that theological hermeneutics of general counseling psychology theory or methodology to establish the counseling methodological identity of Christian Counseling. While inheriting the achievements of precedent studies about the identity of Christian Counseling, this study attempted to propose the Christian Counseling identity of a new approach by presenting the practical worldview of Christian Counseling and the spirit and attitude that counselors should have based on the Trinity theological spirit.This study proposes the identity model of Christian Counseling by linking the English initials of the Christian Trinity Theological spirit with the name "3I Model". The first "I" means Incarnation, that is, theological spirit of Incarnation. This is a spirit to follow Christ with the spirit of sympathizing with the client. The second "I" means Imago-Dei, that is, the spirit of Imago-Dei(God) theology. This is the spirit of respecting the client, who has been created in the Imago-Dei(God), and discovering the image of God inside the client together. The third "I" means Inspiration, that is, the spirit of the Holy Spirit and Inspiration theology. This is the spirit to promote spiritual insights and enlightenment in the clients, who are spiritual beings. The purpose of this study is to propose a Christian Counseling identity model that presents the "3I model" that connects these three "I"s as a spiritual element that Christian counselors must have.

AB  - According to media theorist McLuhan, the medium is ‘extension of man’.This argument of McLuhan not only concisely expresses the power of media, but also becomes the premise of all media philosophies. Before McLuhan, Walter Benjamin mentions the media and reshaping of human sense. Of course, his interest is not in the media itself, but in tracking changes in the definition and role of art and works of art with the introduction of technological copying. This thesis discusses Benjamin’s argument from the perspective of media philosophy, focusing on Das Kunstwerk im Zeitalter seiner technischen Reproduzierbarkeit (1939).First, we confirm through McLuhan’s theory which is the most representative theoretical model for the media and reshaping of human sense, and changes in media and worldview. Second, it examines Benjamin’s thoughts on media, especially film, but reveals the technological difference between film and theater. Third, we examine Benjamin’s arguments for the media, reshaping of human sense, and differences in recognition methods through examples of paintings and films. Fourth, Benjamin’s statement of the media and problems of social change will be considered through the social function of film.Finally, we will examine the limitations of Benjamin's media philosophy.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a tool for measuring the effect of character education on Sahmyook University students. The major findings are as follows. First, by reconceptualizing the educational philosophy of Sahmyook University and linking the domains and dimensions of universal character education, the structure of the measurement tool is divided into 4 domains (moral cognition, moral emotion, moral behavior, spiritual element) and 2 dimensions (personal, relational) was selected. Second, the character factors collected through literature review are allotted to the 4 domains and 2 dimensions, and integrated and organized so that self-understanding, conscience, understanding others, community consciousness, self-respect, patience, empathy, compassion, self- management, responsibility, communication, care, and the Christian worldview was selected as a sub-factor. Third, 130 preliminary questions were made from the existing scale questions and newly developed questions that meet the operational definition of sub-factors, and the final questions were organized into 58 questions by analyzing the results of a survey of 392 students at Sahmyook University. Fourth, the construct validity of the developed measurement tool was verified through exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and convergent validity analysis, and reliability was verified through internal consistency coefficient. Finally, suggestions for the future studies were discussed.

AB  - In Korea, narrative comics have grown into the main pillar of the cultural industry, starting with the fantasy worldview and laying the foundation firmly. Various genres under this fantasy worldview are conventionally conducted through the desire that can be said to be the core of fantasy. However, the recent advances in the works of the realism worldview, not due to the fantasy world view, are notable. If fantasy elements are omitted from the cartoon, what is there instead of them? Therefore, this study set out to conceptualize cartoons with no fantasy elements as realism cartoons and examine the characteristics of the two world views in narratives, images, and readers’ consumption values. The investigator selected two sample works that revealed the characteristics of the two world views best, What’s Wrong with Secretary Kim? and Suchan No Koi, and investigated their characteristics contrastively. Each of the works of the worldview is well-accepting the definitions of fantasy and realism, while particularly reinforcing verisimilitude and probability. On the other hand, in realism cartoons, the importance of probability in narrative elements stood out above all else. When it comes to image characteristics, unlike fantasy that pursues splendor, move toward pursuing more simplicity, and are walking the opposite way to fantasy cartoons. In the fantasy world view, cartoon signs became specific and diverse. In contrast, the realism world view had all the signs omitted. And while female readers consumed works of the fantasy world view to enjoy aesthetic images they wanted and satisfy their desire for the conclusion of love, they consumed narratives of the realism world view to get consolation and comfort by uniting with the sentiment of the author. The present study raised an issue with the two world views with huge differences being mixed and classified as the same genre instead of being distinguished proactively and also made a proposal that world views should be distinguished first.

TI  - Dependence of the Photosynthetic Quantum Yield on Phytoplankton Light Absorption: Equations for Assessing Primary Production in the Black Sea
T2  - PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. Investigations were performed during a scientific cruise to characterize hydrophysical properties, chlorophyll a concentration, photosynthesis-irradiance curves, spectral light absorption coefficients by phytoplankton, and spectral quantum downwelling irradiance. From these results, the dependence of the photosynthetic quantum yield upon environmental factors was studied with the purpose of adapting an algorithm developed for the Baltic Sea so that it can be applied for the Black Sea.Methods and Results. Complex hydrophysical and biological studies were carried out at several depths within the euphotic zone. Spectral bio-optical parameters were measured in accordance with the latest NASA protocols (2018). Experiments to determine the photosynthesis-light relationship were performed under temperature and light conditions similar to those in situ. The quantum yield of photosynthesis was calculated from parameters of photosynthesis-light curves (photosynthesis efficiency, light saturation parameter) and the spectral light absorption coefficients by phytoplankton pigments. It was found out that the main photosynthetic characteristics of phytoplankton, including the maximum photosynthetic quantum yield and the fraction of phytoplankton absorption associated with photoprotective accessory pigments, varied with depth within the euphotic zone, due to phytoplankton acclimation to environment factors during the period of seasonal stratification. The relationship between the photosynthetic quantum yield and the quanta absorbed by photosynthetically active phytoplankton pigments was revealed. The results of this research made it possible to build on the approach developed for other regions and modify the equation for calculating the quantum yield to apply specifically for environmental conditions in the Black Sea.Conclusions. For the first time, comprehensive studies carried out in the Black Sea, including measurements of the photosynthesis-light dependence, spectral light absorption coefficients by phytoplankton and spectral downwelling irradiance as a function of optical depths within the euphotic zone, made it possible to reveal the equation for calculating photosynthetic quantum yield. This new equation can be applied for calculating primary production of the Black Sea using a spectral approach, based both on the results of in situ measurements and remote sensing data.

AB  - Bangka Belitung Archipelago is a province consisting of many islands and coastal areas, including mangrove ecosystems. Mangrove forests have experienced a decline since the 1990s due to land clearing for mining. However, there was a restoration of mangrove forests due to the replanting of mangrove forests in the 2000s. Based on these problems, this research aims to identify the changes area of mangrove forests that occurred in 1990 - 2020 in the Belitung Islands. For this purpose, multi-source remote sensing data is used (Landsat 5, Landsat 7, and Landsat 8), machine learning random forest, a free cloud-based platform of Google Earth Engine, and several vegetation indices including MSAVI (Modified, Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index), NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), and EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) which are used as indicators of mangrove forest decline and recovery. Based on the processing results, the highest area obtained in 2020 is 119.91 Ha, with a land cover classification accuracy of 99.09%. Meanwhile, the lowest area occurred in 2000, 70.88 Ha, with a land cover classification accuracy of 98.98 %.

TI  - Management of the Axilla and the Breast After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Patients with Breast Cancer: A Systematic Review
T2  - MEDICAL BULLETIN OF SISLI ETFAL HOSPITAL
M3  - Review
AB  - Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide. Breast cancer is traditionally treated with surgery, plus adjuvant systemic therapy and radiotherapy as required. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) for the treatment of breast cancer is used for locally advanced operable breast cancer to reduce the tumor size, to perform breast conserving surgery, and to perform a limited axillary approach. Adjuvant chemotherapy for the treatment of inflammatory breast cancer and even in inoperable breast cancer is used to increase overall survival time and to delay disease progression while relieving symptoms. NACT for breast cancer is a new strategy that was introduced toward the end of the 20th century and is increasingly used in the treatment of breast cancer. At present, NACT is increasingly being used to reduce the need for axillary dissection and to convert patients with large tumors to candidates for breast conservation therapy in both locally advanced and operable breast cancers. Breast conserving procedures are currently more preferred by surgeons and axillary dissection is being replaced by sentinel lymph node biopsy after chemotherapy. One of the targets of neoadjuvant systemic therapy is to try to perform a less aggressive surgery by breast conservation, mainly for cosmetic reasons and avoiding axillary dissection mainly for arm mobility, pain, and lymphedema risk. The other target of neoadjuvant systemic therapy is to see the response of the tumor to chemotherapy and determine the treatment accordingly. Neoadjuvant systemic therapy increases the rate of complete pathological response by clearing the breast and axilla from tumor cells before surgery. In this review, we examine the key points of using the NACT in breast cancer, considering radiological imaging methods, surgical management, and reconstruction after NACT.

AB  - Advances in data processing and the availability of large datasets from very high-resolution (VHR) SAR satellite missions are promoting the use of multi-temporal InSAR techniques for the near-real-time assessment and the health monitoring of bridges and transport infrastructures. On the other hand, the Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR) is a Non-destructive technology widely applied to monitor the internal state of infrastructure assets by rapid electromagnetic inspections. This research aims to investigate the viability of a novel Non-Destructive Health-Monitoring Approach (ND-HMA) based on the synergistic use of satellite remote sensing and GPR techniques for structural assessment of bridges and the prevention of damages induced by structural subsidence. The analyses were developed to identify and detect structural displacements of the Olivieri Bridge, located in Salerno, Italy. To this purpose, commercial VHR COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) products, provided by the Italian Space Agency (ASI), were acquired and processed by persistent scatterers (PS) InSAR technique. The historical time-series of deformations of the scatterers, found in correspondence of critical structural elements of the structure (i.e., bridge piers and arcs), were analyzed. Furthermore, in-situ GPR inspection analyses were carried out by using multi-frequency GPR systems equipped with both air-launched and ground-coupled antennas with central frequency ranging between 200 MHz and 1000 MHz. The implementation of the integrated approach provides a technologically enhanced and reliable mechanism for the provision of "early warning" information to be more rapidly processed and conclusively actioned by asset owners and management agencies. In particular, a novel data interpretation approach is proposed based on the selection of several PS data-points with coherent deformation trends on the bridge and the analysis of GPR outputs. The outcomes of this study demonstrate that multi-temporal InSAR remote sensing techniques can be applied to complement non-destructive ground-based analyses (e.g., ground-penetrating radars), thereby paving the way for integrated approaches in the smart monitoring of infrastructure assets.

TI  - Associating Field Actors in the Observation of Visitor Flows and Recreational Activities in Mountain Regions: Lessons Drawn from two Collaborative Projects in France and Switzerland
T2  - REVUE DE GEOGRAPHIE ALPINE-JOURNAL OF ALPINE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Alps are particularly affected by the effects of climate change. The average temperature increase is twice as high as that observed at the global level (Beniston, 2012). Climate change is having a profound impact on tourism, sports and, more broadly, recreational activities in mountain regions. First of all, this concerns the rise in the rain-snow limit and the increasing scarcity of snow (Gonseth, 2013), leading ski lift companies to invest heavily in the production of artificial snow in order to sustain the activities of skiing and snowboarding (Abegg, 2011; Clivaz et al., 2015). However, climate change also has important repercussions for other sports and recreational pursuits in these regions, especially in summer (hiking, climbing, mountaineering, etc.).Observing the effects of climate change on recreational activities in less-developed mountain regions proves complex. In this context, an exploratory participatory research-action project, presented in this paper, was carried out in 2019 with the objective of both taking stock of existing data on the use of less-developed mountain regions and studying the feasibility of an approach involving field actors in the observation of the evolution of this use. This contribution is an opportunity to look back at this project and to show the challenges and difficulties linked to this deliberately collaborative approach, in particular by putting it into perspective with the French observation program "Refuges Sentinelles" (RS) (Sentinel Hut Program) from which it was inspired. More generally, it is also a question of examining the knowledge issues, for both research and field actors (hut keepers, mountain guides and leaders), linked to a collaborative research approach. The results in terms of data collected or issues identified (changes in visitor flows, the role of hut keepers, types of clientele, etc.) are not part of the subject of this contribution, even if they are mentioned from time to time in order to illustrate the topic.Our methodology is based on the final report of the participatory research-action project we conducted (Obin et al., 2020), on a student thesis on the feasibility of the Sentinel Hut program and of the approach to be implemented (Berthet, 2014), as well as on the minutes of various sessions and events related to this program. We supplemented these sources with a semi-structured interview conducted online in January 2021 with the scientific leader of this program, focusing specifically on the theme of the collaborative methodology utilised.

TI  - Evaluating the Potentiality of Sentinel-2 for Change Detection Analysis Associated to LULUCF in Wallonia, Belgium
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Land Use/Cover changes are crucial for the use of sustainable resources and the delivery of ecosystem services. They play an important contribution in the climate change mitigation due to their ability to emit and remove greenhouse gas from the atmosphere. These emissions/removals are subject to an inventory which must be reported annually under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. This study investigates the use of Sentinel-2 data for analysing lands conversion associated to Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry sector in the Wallonia region (southern Belgium). This region is characterized by one of the lowest conversion rates across European countries, which constitutes a particular challenge in identifying land changes. The proposed research tests the most commonly used change detection techniques on a bi-temporal and multi-temporal set of mosaics of Sentinel-2 data from the years 2016 and 2018. Our results reveal that land conversion is a very rare phenomenon in Wallonia. All the change detection techniques tested have been found to substantially overestimate the changes. In spite of this moderate results our study has demonstrated the potential of Sentinel-2 regarding land conversion. However, in this specific context of very low magnitude of land conversion in Wallonia, change detection techniques appear to be not sufficient to exceed the signal to noise ratio.

T2  - UNIVERSITY POLITEHNICA OF BUCHAREST SCIENTIFIC BULLETIN SERIES C-ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND COMPUTER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Current visualization techniques of Earth Observation (EO) multispectral data rely on limited settings depending on the combination of three spectral bands or the usage of the true-color representation. The visual information is incomplete, many spectral similarities or dissimilarities remain hidden to the human visual perception. We propose a deep learning-based approach translating the multispectral signatures into R - G - B images. A stacked autoencoder (SAE) is used to embed the information from all spectral bands into three bands. The resulted bands are further used for the false-color representation of the image. The experimental evidences using both Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 datasets show that the proposed method improves the visualization performance compared with classical methods like R - G - B, minimum redundancy maximum relevance criterion (mRMR) and principal component analysis (PCA). Mutual information quantization is used for results evaluation.

AB  - Telomeres, the end fragments of chromosomes, play key roles in cellular proliferation and senescence. Here we characterize the genetic architecture of naturally occurring variation in leukocyte telomere length (LTL) and identify causal links between LTL and biomedical phenotypes in 472,174 well-characterized UK Biobank participants. We identified 197 independent sentinel variants associated with LTL at 138 genomic loci (108 new). Genetically determined differences in LTL were associated with multiple biological traits, ranging from height to bone marrow function, as well as several diseases spanning neoplastic, vascular and inflammatory pathologies. Finally, we estimated that, at the age of 40years, people with an LTL >1s.d. shorter than the population mean had a 2.5-year-lower life expectancy compared with the group with ≥1s.d. longer LDL. Overall, we furnish new insights into the genetic regulation of LTL, reveal wide-ranging influences of LTL on physiological traits, diseases and longevity, and provide a powerful resource available to the global research community.

AB  - Most of the municipalities of the Italian territory are located in areas of high hydrogeological risk, i.e. exposed to flooding and landslides. Consequently, part of the existing cultural heritage on the national territory is located in areas subject to flood risk, which compromises the accessibility, preservation and integrity of cultural heritage. As an example, we consider a single flood event that occurred in southern Italy on November 11th and 12th, 2019, which mainly affected the city of Matera and its surroundings. This episode appears to be significant for the violence of the phenomenon that led to considerable quantities of water flowing inside the city, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, causing damage to buildings, including historical ones. The event has been analysed using both meteorology and geomatic technologies, to have an overview on spatial and temporal evolution of the phenomenon. Global Navigation Satellite System Zenith Total Delay (GNSS-ZTD) data obtained by receivers located around the city of Matera, were compared with measurements from ground-based devices (i.e. weather stations), Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models, and ERA5 reanalysis. To assess the extent of the flood and show the flooded areas, the images provided by the Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) were used, isolating and analyzing the images captured before and after the event. Finally, through a digital terrain model, developed using Agisoft Metashape software from satellite images, the morphology of Matera was recreated to evidence the areas of accumulation of water. Once all the information was obtained, the data correlated showed an overall view of the event.

TI  - Assessment of High Resolution Air Temperature Fields at Rocky Mountain National Park by Combining Scarce Point Measurements with Elevation and Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - There is necessity of considering air temperature to simulate the hydrology and management within water resources systems. In many cases, a big issue is considering the scarcity of data due to poor accessibility and limited funds. This paper proposes a methodology to obtain high resolution air temperature fields by combining scarce point measurements with elevation data and land surface temperature (LST) data from remote sensing. The available station data (SNOTEL stations) are sparse at Rocky Mountain National Park, necessitating the inclusion of correlated and well-sampled variables to assess the spatial variability of air temperature. Different geostatistical approaches and weighted solutions thereof were employed to obtain air temperature fields. These estimates were compared with two relatively direct solutions, the LST (MODIS) and a lapse rate-based interpolation technique. The methodology was evaluated using data from different seasons. The performance of the techniques was assessed through a cross validation experiment. In both cases, the weighted kriging with external drift solution (considering LST and elevation) showed the best results, with a mean squared error of 3.7 and 3.6 degrees C-2 for the application and validation, respectively.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Patterns Of the Sea Surface Temperature Using Statistical Anomaly Detection Across the 18-Year-Old Global Scale
T2  - OCEANS 2021: SAN DIEGO - PORTO
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - OCEANS Conference
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Climate change impacts the temperature and acidity of the oceans, seas and lakes through the air-water interface. Worldwide patterns of the sea surface temperature (SST) can be monitored using spaceborne observations of the 4 mu m wavebands during nighttime since July 2002 by AquaMODIS. Despite the spatial collection, most studies examine the part of the time-series as lineplots. This research proposes to decipher the 18-year-old SST trends, from July 2002 to December 2020, by focusing on the spatiotemporal detections of the SST anomalies, in order to decompose, hindcast and forecast the time-series. An array of >200 Level-3 SST4 global maps was subject to the Reed-Xiaoli Anomaly Detector, then high, moderate and low anomaly areas were decomposed (seasonal effect removal) and modelled using state space smoothing. Southern Newfoundland and Eastern Hokkaido were representatives of ice-free high anomalies, while the Philippine Sea and Northern Canary were identified as moderately and slightly anomalous, respectively. The modelling accuracy was very satisfactory for both western boundary currents, and excellent for less anomalous regions. The global analysis better fitted with the anomalous Southern Newfoundland than the other regions, indicating an overall rapid increase in SST.

TI  - PyGEE-SWToolbox: A Python-Google Earth Engine Surface Water Analysis Toolbox
T2  - Zenodo
M3  - Software
AB  - PyGEE-SWToolbox is a toolbox for surface water mapping and time series analysis using Google Earth Engine (GEE). The toolbox is a Python Jupyter notebook that relies on the GEE Python API to retrieve and process Landsat, Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and NAIP high-resolutionimagery. Other dependencies are the geemap, geetools, hydrafloods, and plotly python packages. The toolbox is capable of extracting surface water from multispectral satellite images using water extraction indices such as NDWI, MNDWI, AWEI, and DSWE. Water detection from Sentinel-1 SAR images is carried out using the Otsu thresholding algorithm. This toolbox was developed in an attempt to reconstruct historical wetland surface water dynamics. Therefore the toolbox is capable of generating time series of changes in surface water area which can be exported to CSV format for further analysis or export generated graphs into desired graphic formats. Retrieved satellite images and extracted water masks can be exported to Google Drive or downloaded to the user's local drive. Spatial analysis such as pixel-level water occurrence frequency and hydroperiod analysis can also be carried out. This toolboxis based upon work supported by the Natural Resources Conservation Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, and The Nature Conservancy, under award number 68-5C16-17-015. Any opinions, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in this publication are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Natural Resources Conservation Service or The Nature Conservancy.

TI  - Application of OSNA Nomogram in Patients With Macrometastatic Sentinel Lymph Node: A Retrospective Assessment of Accuracy.
T2  - Breast cancer : basic and clinical research
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Almost 50% to 70% of patients who undergo axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) because of a single metastatic sentinel lymph node (SLN) have no further metastatic nodes at the axillary histology. On these grounds, the one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) nomogram was designed and validated. As a mathematical model, calculated through tumor size (expressed in millimeters) and CK19 mRNA copy number, it is thought to predict nonsentinel lymph node (NSLN) status. The aim of the study is to verify the diagnostic accuracy of the OSNA nomogram in a group of patients with macrometastatic SLN, with a retrospective analysis.METHODS: The OSNA nomogram was retrospectively applied to a group of 66 patients with macrometastatic SLN who underwent ALND. The result of the final histology of the axillary cavity was compared to the nomogram prediction. We calculated the prevalence of NSLN metastasis in patients who underwent ALND, sensitivity and specificity, negative and positive predictive value of the nomogram.RESULTS: In patients with macrometastasis in SLN, the prevalence of patients with metastatic NSLN was 45%. The sensitivity of the nomogram was excellent (90%). The specificity was low (36%). Positive predictive value amounted to 54%, while negative predictive value was good (81%).CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the OSNA nomogram is a valid instrument that can help choose the best surgical strategy for the treatment of axillary cavity. The mathematical model is useful to avoid surgery in a selected group of patients because it accurately predicts NSLN status.

TI  - Persistence of secukinumab in patients with psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis
T2  - FARMACIA HOSPITALARIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To determine persistence of treatment with secukinumab across its different indications.Method: This is a retrospective descriptive observational study including adult patients treated with secukinumab in its different indications from the drug's introduction in November 2015 to October 2019. The variables included were sex; age; diagnosis; initiation date; line of treatment; number of patients who discontinued treatment and reason for discontinuation; overall persistence at 12 months; distribution of patients; and persistence according to indication, line of treatment and reason for suspension.Results: One-hundred forty-three patients were started on secukinumab, but only patients who had been in treatment at least 12 months before the end of the study were included. Mean patient age was 49.8 years (+/- 12.6); 52.9% were men. Fifty-six patients (53.8%) had discontinued treatment by the end of the study, with a mean duration of treatment of 12.7 months (+/- 10.2). The other patients (n = 48) continued with their therapy. Mean duration of treatment in these patients was 25.7 months (+/- 9.9). Overall persistence at 12 months was 10.0 months (+/- 3.3) with a discontinuation rate at 12 months of 31.7%. Persistence at 12 months was 10.7 months (+/- 2.9) for patients with psoriasis, 9.7 months (+/- 3.4) for patients with psoriatic arthritis, and 8.8 months (+/- 3.8) for those with ankylosing spondylitis. Of the 48 patients who continued with their treatment after completion of the study, 22 (45.8%) received the drug as first-line treatment. Of the 56 discontinuations, 15 (26.8%) were due to primary failure (persistence: 3.8 months [+/- 1.1]) and 27 (48.2%) were due to secondary failure (persistence: 18.6 months [+/- 9.6]). Persistence in patients who continued treatment was higher in psoriasis (28.8 months [+/- 10.3]). In those who discontinued due to secondary failure it was higher in the group with ankylosing spondylitis (28.0 months [+/- 4.2]). Persistence among patients on first-line secukinumab was higher than for other patients: 21.2 months (+/- 7.2) if they stayed on treatment, 3.5 months (+/- 0.5) if they presented with primary treatment failure, and 8.3 months (+/- 2.5) in those with secondary treatment failure.Conclusions: Our data show slightly higher persistence levels in patients with psoriasis and lower discontinuation rates in those without previous exposure to biological therapy. Long-term studies are needed to confirm these findings and to gain a better understanding of the factors that can influence persistence of secukinumab.

T2  - CUADERNOS DE INVESTIGACION GEOGRAFICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Floods are recurring events in Buenos Aires Province, mainly caused by high-intensity precipitation, and in some cases, they persist for long periods. The objective of this study is to analyze how the topography of the central-western portion of Buenos Aires Province determines the occurrence and the extent of floods. The presence of shallow lakes characterizes the area which is controlled by the topogaphy. LANDSAT 5 and 8 images corresponding to periods of drought and flooding in the area were compared with topographic profiles and digital elevation models generated from SRTM 3 arc/sec data. The results showed that in those areas where there are aligned dunes, and after significant storm drain engineering works, during the wet periods, the lakes, their overflows, and the subsequent runoff to the east of Buenos Aires Province flow freely, limiting the flood areas. Due to this topography, the lakes became a more permanent feature of the landscape, even during extreme drought events. In contrast, in those areas where parabolic dunes predominate, the landscape is more affected by droughts and floods. During drought events, we observed a small number of shallow lakes, and during strong storms with high-intensity rainfall, the number of lakes increases and large flooded areas generate damage to agricultural fields and neighboring cities, either due to natural causes or improvised and illegal storm drains. Early warning of flood risks and a systematic territorial ordaining would be the key to the management of the area.

TI  - Simulations of seasonal snowpack duration and water storage across New Zealand
T2  - WEATHER AND CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal snow dramatically alters surface-atmosphere exchanges of heat and moisture, particularly in the South Island of New Zealand. Despite this, detailed simulations of seasonal snow and comparisons to remotely sensed snow observations are lacking in New Zealand, partly due to uncertainties in near-surface meteorology in mountainous areas with sparse in-situ observations. Here we simulate seasonal snow cover and water storage across New Zealand on a 250 m x 250 m grid over a 3-year period (April 2017 to March 2020) with a simple snow model and near-surface meteorology extracted from the New Zealand Convective Scale Model (NZCSM). Simulations are validated against snow cover derived from MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite remote sensing observations. While NZCSM near-surface meteorology is generally colder and wetter than observations, we find that the spatial patterns and elevation distribution of simulated snow cover duration (SCD) agrees well with MODIS observations. Biases in SCD are found in areas, particularly the ranges east of the main divide, where simulated snow cover persists longer than observed. In contrast, alternate simulations using daily gridded observations of near-surface meteorology show a poor fit to MODIS SCD, with large areas having little or no simulated snow cover. The simulated seasonal cycle of New Zealand-wide total snow water storage shows a peak around 1 September equating to around half the long-term average monthly total rainfall for the South Island. The correspondence between simulated and MODIS snow covered area is found to be sensitive to the threshold used to define simulated snow cover, particular in early winter when widespread thin snow cover is common. To improve estimates of snow cover and water storage, future work should exploit new remote sensing products for validation and assimilation as well as disentangle uncertainties in snow model parameters and meteorological input using detailed meteorological and snow observations.

AB  - Aerial remote sensing continues its progression into wider applications and functionality. At the same time, the field of robotics has generated many useful technologies such as the Robotics Operating System v.2 (ROS2) which allows researchers and designers to implement autonomous systems as a meta-operating system. In this paper, such a holistic autonomous data collection system (STARDOS) is shown with the goal of integration of remote sensing data collection (payload) and the robotic platform (in this case, unmanned aerial vehicles). The architecture of STARDOS is shown, along with example payload configurations and analysis use cases such as triangular greeness index (TGI) and feature extraction and matching for real-time 2d photogrammetry.

TI  - Classification of homogeneous regions of vegetation cover in the State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil and its temporal dynamics, using AVHRR GIMMS and MODIS data sets
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to classify the homogeneous regions of vegetation cover, which occur in Rio Grande do Sul, formed by clustering of pixels with same pattern of temporal variability of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) of AVHRR GIMMS and MODIS series and to compare their temporal dynamics. We use K means cluster analysis for defining homogeneous regions, based on the temporal variability of GIMMS (8 km spatial resolution) and MODIS (1 km spatial resolution) NDVI data sets, using monthly images mean from 2000 to 2008 (overlapping period); and we analyzed the annual pattern of NDVI. Accuracy assessment was done with Landsat images. The results show that the temporal variability of GIMMS and MODIS NDVI allows to delimit similar homogeneous regions in order to mapping the main vegetation cover. MODIS series shows a greater detail in the definition of the regions, but with compatibility with those generated by GIMMS. The temporal dynamics show a typical seasonal pattern, with variations of NDVI amplitude between the groups, that allow to monitor phenological changes. The deviations from calibration between times series are linear, which would facilitate a correction in order to construct a long synthetic time series for studies of land cover change.

TI  - Optical characterization of the deep-waters of the Gulf of Mexico by <i>in situ</i> PAR during summer
T2  - LATIN AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Phytoplankton is a sentinel group of organisms of climate change due to their capacity to respond to multiple stressors, so studies documenting the optimal optical conditions within the water column affecting their growth and production are imperative. As a contribution to this topic, this study report selected optical properties in deep-waters of the Gulf of Mexico by in situ measurements during summertime. A multidisciplinary research cruise was carried during August/September of 2018. A CTD instrument configured with underwater quantum and fluorescence sensors were used to acquire data of temperature, conductivity, depth, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and fluorescence of chlorophyll-a, which were used to determine selected optical coefficients, including the light extinction (k), the compensation light intensity (E-c), the compensation depth (Z(c)), the critical depth (Z(cr)), and the incident irradiance (E-0). The Brunt-Vaisala frequency calculated from CTD data was used as a magnitude indicator of the water column stratification. The results showed a pycnocline located between 23 and 68 m depth, and favorable conditions for phytoplankton production with high values of E-0 reaching 1523.4 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), Ec values ranging from 3 to 8 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), values of Z(cr) greater than Z(c) and maximum records of k values of 0.06. Based on multivariate statistical techniques, two zones were clearly defined. These results represent the first observational report on the optical properties in the deep region of the Gulf of Mexico. Studies on the ideal optical conditions for carrying out phytoplankton photosynthesis and their possible seasonal and interannual variability are essential to understand the processes that support the phytoplankton production, especially in regions that are characterized by their high biodiversity.

TI  - Rapid response to the M<sub>w</sub> 4.9 earthquake of November 11, 2019 in Le Teil, Lower Rhone Valley, France
T2  - COMPTES RENDUS GEOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - On November 11, 2019, a M-w 4.9 earthquake hit the region close to Montelimar (lower Rhone Valley, France), on the eastern margin of the Massif Central close to the external part of the Alps. Occuring in a moderate seismicity area, this earthquake is remarkable for its very shallow focal depth (between 1 and 3 km), its magnitude, and the moderate to large damages it produced in several villages. InSAR interferograms indicated a shallow rupture about 4 km long reaching the surface and the reactivation of the ancient NE-SW La Rouviere normal fault in reverse faulting in agreement with the present-day E-W compressional tectonics. The peculiarity of this earthquake together with a poor coverage of the epicentral region by permanent seismological and geodetic stations triggered the mobilisation of the French post-seismic unit and the broad French scientific community from various institutions, with the deployment of geophysical instruments (seismological and geodesic stations), geological field surveys, and field evaluation of the intensity of the earthquake. Within 7 days after the mainshock, 47 seismological stations were deployed in the epicentral area to improve the Le Teil aftershocks locations relative to the French permanent seismological network (RESIF), monitor the temporal and spatial evolution of microearthquakes close to the fault plane and temporal evolution of the seismic response of 3 damaged historical buildings, and to study suspected site effects and their influence in the distribution of seismic damage. This seismological dataset, completed by data owned by different institutions, was integrated in a homogeneous archive and distributed through FDSN web services by the RESIF data center. This dataset, together with observations of surface rupture evidences, geologic, geodetic and satellite data, will help to unravel the causes and rupture mechanism of this earthquake, and contribute to account in seismic hazard assessment for earthquakes along the major regional Cevenne fault system in a context of present-day compressional tectonics.

TI  - Combining Radar and Optical Satellite Imagery with Machine Learning to Map Lava Flows at Mount Etna and Fogo Island
T2  - ENERGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Lava flow mapping has direct relevance to volcanic hazards once an eruption has begun. Satellite remote sensing techniques are increasingly used to map newly erupted lava, thanks to their capability to survey large areas with frequent revisit time and accurate spatial resolution. Visible and infrared satellite data are routinely used to detect the distributions of volcanic deposits and monitor thermal features, even if clouds are a serious obstacle for optical sensors, since they cannot be penetrated by optical radiation. On the other hand, radar satellite data have been playing an important role in surface change detection and image classification, being able to operate in all weather conditions, although their use is hampered by the special imaging geometry, the complicated scattering process, and the presence of speckle noise. Thus, optical and radar data are complementary data sources that can be used to map lava flows effectively, in addition to alleviating cloud obstruction and improving change detection performance. Here, we propose a machine learning approach based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to analyze simultaneously the images acquired by the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensor, on board of Sentinel-1 mission, and by optical and multispectral sensors of Landsat-8 missions and Multi-Spectral Imager (MSI), on board of Sentinel-2 mission. Machine learning classifiers, including K-means algorithm (K-means) and support vector machine (SVM), are used to map lava flows automatically from a combination of optical and SAR images. We describe the operation of this approach by using a retrospective analysis of two recent lava flow-forming eruptions at Mount Etna (Italy) and Fogo Island (Cape Verde). We found that combining both radar and optical imagery improved the accuracy and reliability of lava flow mapping. The results highlight the need to fully exploit the extraordinary potential of complementary satellite sensors to provide time-critical hazard information during volcanic eruptions.

TI  - The environmental recovery of the main tourist destinations in the Colombian Caribbean during the Covid-19 quarantine
T2  - Boletin de Investigaciones Marinas y Costeras
M3  - Article
AB  - To counteract the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic disease, the Colombian government decreed a quarantine period from March 24 to July 1, 2020, which forced the cessation of tourist activities and the closure of the main tourist destinations of the Colombian Caribbean: Santa Marta, Cartagena, and San Andres. During this period, a significant increase in the environmental quality of these coastal zones was perceived. To quantify environmental changes in the coastal zone, the variation in chlorophyll concentration and total suspended solids observed by the Sentinel-3 satellite mission, 30 days before and after the start of the quarantine, was analyzed. The results showed a decrease in the concentration of chlorophyll (> 20 %) and suspended solids (> 40 %) in Santa Marta and Cartagena, but no significant change in San Andres. Although part of this reduction was linked to seasonal changes in local forces, the results suggest that environmental recovery could be a remote effect of the cessation of polluting activities in the continental territory. Thus, the Covid-19 quarantine provides a reference to observe the effects of productive and tourist activities, potentially useful to establish the carrying capacity and recovery of coastal ecosystems.

TI  - Is Breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging an Accurate Predictor of Nodal Status After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy?
T2  - The Journal of surgical research
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: With increasing use of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), preoperative imaging assessment of axillary lymph nodes (ALNs) has become more important in operative planning and patient counseling. We aimed to assess if MRI is an accurate predictor of the ALN status after NAC.METHODS: We used our institutional proprietary prospective database to review all patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer between August 2015 and March 2017 who received NAC, underwent post-NAC MRI, and axillary surgery. Imaging findings, axillary surgery, and histopathology results were analyzed.RESULTS: Of 114 patients receiving NAC, 50 underwent post-NAC MRI before surgery. The mean age was 46y; 36% were triple-negative, 26% were triple-positive, 26% were ER-positive and HER2/neu-negative, and 12% were ER-negative and Her2/neu-positive. Post-NAC MRI ALN status was normal in 35 patients, of which 30 underwent SLNB and five went directly to axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). 26 of these 35 were negative for metastasis on final pathology resulting in a negative-predictive value of 74.3%. In 15 patients with an abnormal post-NAC MRI ALN status, eight went directly to ALND and seven underwent SLNB. Eight of these 15 were positive for metastasis on final pathology resulting in a positive predictive value of 53.3%.CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of axillary imaging findings on post-NAC MRI predicts the absence of nodal disease with higher accuracy than its presence but not with adequate accuracy as surrogate for surgical pathologic evaluation of ALNs. This information is valuable in both patient counseling and axillary surgical management after NAC.

TI  - Biting Midges in Jamari National Forest, in the Brazilian Amazon, With 12 New Records of <i>Culicoides</i> Species (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) for the State of Rondonia
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Culicoides biting midges are small hematophagous flies, some species of which transmit pathogens to livestock and humans. In the Brazilian Amazon Basin, Culicoides diversity has remained largely unexamined. Jamari National Forest (JNF) is a conservation area in Rondonia State where research and environmental education are conducted in conjunction with the protection of natural resources, and the recovery of degraded areas. The present study augments our knowledge of Culicoides diversity in JNF. The survey collected 640 individuals from 41 species; 632 individuals were collected by HP light trap and 8 were collected by the BG Sentinel trap. Twelve species are first-time records for Rondonia: Culicoides acotylus Lutz, Culicoides albuquerquei Wirth & Blanton, Culicoides baniwa Felippe-Bauer, Culicoides bricenoi Ortiz, Culicoides brownei Spinelli, Culicoides carsiomelas Wirth & Blanton, Culicoides debilipalpis Lutz, Culicoides forattinii Ortiz, Culicoides ginesi Ortiz, Culicoides profundus Santarem, Felippe-Bauer & Trindade, Culicoides pseudoreticulatus Santarem, Felippe-Bauer & Castellon, and Culicoides spurius Santarem, Felippe-Bauer & Trindade. The most abundant species were Culicoides glabrior Macfie, Culicoides pseudodiabolicus Fox, Culicoides debilipalpis, Culicoides quasiparaensis Clastrier, and Culicoides brownei Spinelli. The present study updates the Culicoides species count in Rondonia to 55, and highlights the importance of JNF as a hotbed for biting midge diversity.

TI  - Benefits of Combining ALOS/PALSAR-2 and Sentinel-2A Data in the Classification of Land Cover Classes in the Santa Catarina Southern Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Santa Catarina Southern Plateau is located in Southern Brazil and is a region that has gained considerable attention due to the rapid conversion of the typical landscape of natural grasslands and wetlands into agriculture, reforestation, pasture, and more recently, wind farms. This study's main goal was to characterize the polarimetric attributes of the experimental quad-polarization acquisition mode of the Advanced Land Observing Satellite/Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (ALOS/PALSAR-2) for mapping seven land cover classes. The polarimetric attributes were evaluated alone and combined with SENTINEL-2A using a supervised classification method based on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. The results showed that the intensity backscattering alone reached an overall classification accuracy of 37.48% and a Kappa index of 0.26. Interestingly, the addition of polarimetric features increased to 71.35% and 0.66, respectively. It shows that the use of polarimetric decomposition features was relatively efficient in discriminating land cover classes. SENTINEL-2A data alone performed better and achieved a weighted overall accuracy and Kappa index of 85.56% and 0.82. This increase was also significant for the Z-test. However, the addition of ALOS/PALSAR-2 derived features to SENTINEL-2A slightly improved accuracy and was marginally significant at a 95% confidence level only when all features were considered. Possible implications for that performance are the accumulated precipitation prior to SAR data acquisition, which coincides with the rainy season period. The experimental quad-polarization mode of ALOS/PALSAR- 2 shall be evaluated in the near future over different seasonal conditions to confirm results. Alternatively, further studies are then suggested by focusing on additional features derived from SAR data such as texture and interferometric coherence to increase classification accuracy. These measures would be an interesting data source for monitoring specific land cover classes such as the threatened grasslands and wetlands during periods of frequent cloud coverage. Future investigations could also address multitemporal approaches employing either single or multifrequency SAR.

TI  - Poor quality monitoring data underestimate the impact of Australia's megafires on a critically endangered songbird
T2  - Zenodo
M3  - Software
AB  - Aim: Catastrophic events such as south-eastern Australia's 2019/20 megafires are predicted to increase in frequency and severity under climate change. Rapid, well-informed conservation prioritisation will become increasingly crucial for minimising biodiversity losses resulting from megafires. However, such assessments are susceptible to bias, because the quality of monitoring data underpinning knowledge of species' distributions is highly variable and they fail to account for differences in life-history traits such as aggregative breeding. We aimed to assess how impact estimates of the 2019/20 megafires on the critically endangered regent honeyeater Anthochaera phrygia varied according to the quality of available input data and assessment methodology. Innovation: Using Google Earth Engine Burnt Area Mapping, we estimated the impact of the megafires on the regent honeyeater using six monitoring datasets that differ in quality and temporal span. These datasets are representative of the variable quality of monitoring data available for assessing fire impact on 326 other threatened species; most are poorly monitored and few have standardised, species-specific monitoring programs. We found that assessments based on Area of Occupancy (AOO), Extent of Occurrence (EOO) and public sightings underestimated the fire impact relative to recent, targeted monitoring datasets; a MaxEnt model, sightings from a national monitoring program and nest locations since 2015. Using an impact threshold of 30% of habitat burned, regent honeyeaters would not meet this criteria using estimates derived from EOO, AOO or public sightings, but would exceed the cut-off based on estimates derived from the targeted monitoring data that account for population density. Main conclusions: To ensure that conservation prioritisation has the greatest capacity to minimise biodiversity losses, we highlight the need to improve targeted, threatened species monitoring. We demonstrate the importance of using recent, standardised monitoring data to estimate accurately the impact of major ecological disturbances, particularly for declining, nomadic species undergoing range contractions. File 'PPN_burnt.csv' summarises the 1km x 1km grid cells in each moniotoring datasetand whether they were burnt or not (1 = yes 0 = no) and the breakdown of fire severity (low, medium, high and very high) in the fire-affected grid cells. This dataset is used to fit the logistic regression summarised in Table 3 of the manuscript. File 'Stacked_barchart.csv' summarizes fire severity in each monitoring dataset according to the proportion of fire-affected grid cells in each. File 'Regent honeyeater fire impact assessment' provides code to run the logistic regression (Table 3) and plot the fire impact by dataset (i.e. stacked barchart in Figure 2). Due to the sensitive nature of the raw data (involving breeding locations of a critically endangered species), these data are not available. Please contact the corresponding author (ross.crates@anu.edu.au) for further information. For further information on the spatial analysis, please contact Dr Jason Mackenzie (jasonbmackenzie@gmail.com). Study species The regent honeyeater is endemic to Australia's eastern seaboard and was abundant and widespread as recently as 60 years ago (Franklin et al. 1989). Extensive land clearing has led to a rapid population decline, with fewer than 350 individuals estimated to persist in the wild today in a range exceeding 600,000 km2 from Victoria to southern Queensland (Crates et al. 2021). Regent honeyeaters nest primarily in association with flowering events in a small number of Eucalyptus tree species, which show very high spatio-temporal variation in flowering phenology (Birtchnell and Gibson 2006; Franklin et al. 1989). Regent honeyeaters have evolved a highly nomadic life-history to track these dynamic nectar resources. Individuals can travel hundreds of kilometres, and typically nest in loose aggregations when flowering conditions allow. Aggregative nesting could help optimise settlement decisions, antipredator defence and the cultural transmission of information amongst conspecifics (Crates et al. 2017a). The entire population represents a single genetic management unit but the core remaining population persists within the greater Blue Mountains area of central / eastern New South Wales (Crates et al. 2019a,b). Fire severity mapping We used the Australian Google Earth Engine Burnt Area Map (GEEBAM, Commonwealth of Australia 2020), derived remotely from Sentinel 2 satellite imagery. GEEBAM calculates the difference between pre-fire (April 2018 to April 2019) and post-fire (November 2019 to May 2020) Normalized Burn Ratio using near infrared and shortwave infrared spectral data. Fire severity classes reported in GEEBAM include low (little change), medium (crown unburnt), high (crown partially burnt), very high (crown fully burnt) and unclassified (i.e. non-native vegetation or areas outside of the fire footprint). Further details of the fire severity mapping are available at https://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/pages/a8d10ce5-6a49-4fc2-b94d-575d6d11c547/files/ageebam.pdf. Regent honeyeater monitoring datasets We used six monitoring datasets based on varying degrees of data quality (Table 1). Since 2015, we have used these datasets to establish a standardised, targeted and range-wide monitoring program for the regent honeyeater - the National Regent Honeyeater Monitoring Program (NRHMP). The aim of the NRHMP is to increase the quality and quantity of monitoring data available for the regent honeyeater, with the ultimate goal of informing targeted conservation action to help prevent the species' extinction in the wild. Developed over the past 6 years through extensive field surveys, habitat modelling and expert elicitation, the NRHMP now surveys over 1300 sites stratified in known or potential breeding areas throughout the species' contemporary breeding range (Figure S1) during the Austral spring and early summer (Crates et al. 2019). The NRHMP sampling regime aims to account for both the nomadic life-history and the breeding biology of the regent honeyeater (Crates et al. 2017b). The six monitoring datasets based on wild birds are: 1) Extent of Occurrence (EOO): minimum convex polygon of verified regent honeyeater sightings since 1990, sourced from BirdLife Australia and used for IUCN classification. 2) Area of Occupancy (AOO): 1 km x 1 km grids containing a verified regent honeyeater sighting since 1990, sourced from BirdLife Australia. 3) Public sightings: Location of wild regent honeyeaters detected by the general public and reported to BirdLife Australia between January 2015 and December 2019. We refined the database to remove duplicate records of the same individuals in each year. The final database contained 152 point locations for 290 individuals, with potential for duplicate records of the same individuals across different years. 4) MaxEnt species distribution model: A raster model with 1 km2 resolution developed using public sightings of regent honeyeaters between 2000 and 2010, and six month lagged rainfall data (Stojanovic et al. in revision). SDMs were individually run for six-month periods between July and December, or 'time slices' (n = 22). The final consensus model flags all cells modelled as suitable breeding habitat in at least 11 of the 22 seasons (i.e., probability of suitability greater than 50%). See Supplementary File S1 for further details on the modelling process. 5) Public and NRHMP sightings: Location of wild regent honeyeaters detected either by the general public or through the NRHMP between 2015 and 2019. We refined the database to remove duplicate records of the same individuals in each year. The final database contained 416 point locations for 899 individuals, with potential for duplicate records of the same individuals across years. 6) Nests: Location of regent honeyeater nesting attempts that reached the egg stage, located either through the NRHMP (n = 138) or by members of the public (n = 6) since August 2015 (Crates et al. 2019a). We also included three nests involving a captive-released regent honeyeater if the partner was of wild origin. Spatial and statistical analysis We used ArcGIS Desktop 10.8 (ESRI, 2020a) for all geoprocessing. Prior to spatial analysis, we projected all spatial data to EPSG: 3577 (GDA94 - Australian Albers), ensuring equal area between raster cells. We resampled the GEEBAM data to 40m resolution during projection, then converted from raster to polygon for later use in analysis. We clipped the EOO minimum convex polygon to the coastline and converted each pixel of the MaxEnt raster (i.e., 0 | 1; unsuitable | suitable) into a distinct polygon using a three-step procedure involving: i) raster to point conversion; ii) creation of a fishnet based on the raster dimensions; and iii) conversion of point feature to polygon with raster values, using the raster to point output for labelling the final polygons. We projected all point data for known nests, public sightings and NRHMP sightings from WGS84 to Australian Albers, buffered by 500m radius, and converted from circular polygons to square polygons. We used a 500m buffer to account for foraging and dispersal movements of regent honeyeaters (Geering and French 1998) and created square buffers around point data to ensure consistency and comparability between reporting of impacts based on raster data (1 km2 cells) versus vector distribution data. Because the sightings and nesting databases confer data at the individual level, some of the buffered polygons overlapped. We therefore created a complementary fire impact estimate for the sightings databases by dissolving the boundaries around overlapping buffered sightings locations. To calculate the proportion of habitat within each dataset impacted by the 2019/20 bushfires, we overlaid each projected vector distribution dataset (EOO, AOO, the MaxEnt model, public sightings, NRHMP plus public sightings, and nests) with the GEEBAM fire severity mapping using a 'Summarize Within' function in ArcPro (ESRI, 2020b). Using R version 3.4.3 (R Core Team 2017), we fitted a logistic regression model via package lme4 v1.1-21 (Bates et al. 2019) to compare the proportion of fire-affected 1km grid cells in each database.

TI  - Poor quality monitoring data underestimate the impact of Australia's megafires on a critically endangered songbird
T2  - Zenodo
M3  - Software
AB  - Aim: Catastrophic events such as south-eastern Australia's 2019/20 megafires are predicted to increase in frequency and severity under climate change. Rapid, well-informed conservation prioritisation will become increasingly crucial for minimising biodiversity losses resulting from megafires. However, such assessments are susceptible to bias, because the quality of monitoring data underpinning knowledge of species' distributions is highly variable and they fail to account for differences in life-history traits such as aggregative breeding. We aimed to assess how impact estimates of the 2019/20 megafires on the critically endangered regent honeyeater Anthochaera phrygia varied according to the quality of available input data and assessment methodology. Innovation: Using Google Earth Engine Burnt Area Mapping, we estimated the impact of the megafires on the regent honeyeater using six monitoring datasets that differ in quality and temporal span. These datasets are representative of the variable quality of monitoring data available for assessing fire impact on 326 other threatened species; most are poorly monitored and few have standardised, species-specific monitoring programs. We found that assessments based on Area of Occupancy (AOO), Extent of Occurrence (EOO) and public sightings underestimated the fire impact relative to recent, targeted monitoring datasets; a MaxEnt model, sightings from a national monitoring program and nest locations since 2015. Using an impact threshold of 30% of habitat burned, regent honeyeaters would not meet this criteria using estimates derived from EOO, AOO or public sightings, but would exceed the cut-off based on estimates derived from the targeted monitoring data that account for population density. Main conclusions: To ensure that conservation prioritisation has the greatest capacity to minimise biodiversity losses, we highlight the need to improve targeted, threatened species monitoring. We demonstrate the importance of using recent, standardised monitoring data to estimate accurately the impact of major ecological disturbances, particularly for declining, nomadic species undergoing range contractions. File 'PPN_burnt.csv' summarises the 1km x 1km grid cells in each moniotoring datasetand whether they were burnt or not (1 = yes 0 = no) and the breakdown of fire severity (low, medium, high and very high) in the fire-affected grid cells. This dataset is used to fit the logistic regression summarised in Table 3 of the manuscript. File 'Stacked_barchart.csv' summarizes fire severity in each monitoring dataset according to the proportion of fire-affected grid cells in each. File 'Regent honeyeater fire impact assessment' provides code to run the logistic regression (Table 3) and plot the fire impact by dataset (i.e. stacked barchart in Figure 2). Due to the sensitive nature of the raw data (involving breeding locations of a critically endangered species), these data are not available.

Study species The regent honeyeater is endemic to Australia's eastern seaboard and was abundant and widespread as recently as 60 years ago (Franklin et al. 1989). Extensive land clearing has led to a rapid population decline, with fewer than 350 individuals estimated to persist in the wild today in a range exceeding 600,000 km2 from Victoria to southern Queensland (Crates et al. 2021). Regent honeyeaters nest primarily in association with flowering events in a small number of Eucalyptus tree species, which show very high spatio-temporal variation in flowering phenology (Birtchnell and Gibson 2006; Franklin et al. 1989). Regent honeyeaters have evolved a highly nomadic life-history to track these dynamic nectar resources. Individuals can travel hundreds of kilometres, and typically nest in loose aggregations when flowering conditions allow. Aggregative nesting could help optimise settlement decisions, antipredator defence and the cultural transmission of information amongst conspecifics (Crates et al. 2017a). The entire population represents a single genetic management unit but the core remaining population persists within the greater Blue Mountains area of central / eastern New South Wales (Crates et al. 2019a,b). Fire severity mapping We used the Australian Google Earth Engine Burnt Area Map (GEEBAM, Commonwealth of Australia 2020), derived remotely from Sentinel 2 satellite imagery. GEEBAM calculates the difference between pre-fire (April 2018 to April 2019) and post-fire (November 2019 to May 2020) Normalized Burn Ratio using near infrared and shortwave infrared spectral data.

TI  - Environmental chemical exposures in the urine of dogs and people sharing the same households
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Urothelial carcinoma (UCC) develops in both humans and dogs and tracks to regions of high industrial activity. We hypothesize that dogs with UCC may act as sentinels for human urothelial carcinogen exposures. The aim of this pilot study was to determine whether healthy people and dogs in the same households share urinary exposures to potentially mutagenic chemical carcinogens. Methods: We measured urinary concentrations of acrolein (as its metabolite 3-HPMA), arsenic species, 4-aminobiphenyl, and 4-chlorophenol (a metabolite of the phenoxyherbicide 2,4-D) in healthy dogs and their owners. We assessed possible chemical sources through questionnaires and screened for urothelial DNA damage using the micronucleus assay. Results: Biomarkers of urinary exposure to acrolein, arsenic, and 4-chlorophenol were found in the urine of 42 pet dogs and 42 owners, with 4-aminobiphenyl detected sporadically. Creatinine-adjusted urinary chemical concentrations were significantly higher, by 2.8- to 6.2-fold, in dogs compared to humans. Correlations were found for 3-HPMA (r = 0.32, P = 0.04) and monomethylarsonic acid (r = 0.37, P = 0.02) between people and their dogs. Voided urothelial cell yields were inadequate to quantify DNA damage, and questionnaires did not reveal significant associations with urinary chemical concentrations. Conclusions: Healthy humans and pet dogs have shared urinary exposures to known mutagenic chemicals, with significantly higher levels in dogs. Higher urinary exposures to acrolein and arsenic in dogs correlate to higher exposures in their owners. Follow-up studies will assess the mutagenic potential of these levels in vitro and measure these biomarkers in owners of dogs with UCC.

AB  - The coverage of three Landsat satellite images (P030 and R046) from the 1990s (Sensor TM), 2003 and 2013 (Sensor ETM) were classified using ArcGIS 10 software (ESRI, 2008). Thematic maps were generated with four kinds of coverage. The reliability was 75%, 78% and 86% with Kappa coefficient estimates of 0.61, 0.67 and 0.80, respectively. The maps were compared using error matrices where evident processes were recorded such as the change in coverage to agricultural areas. The rate of change was 0.99% for temperate conifer forest cover, 1.02% for broad-leaved deciduous rainforest cover and 1.08% for agricultural areas with respect to the total watershed area. Urban areas were unchanged in the period under review likely due to the topographical conditions of the Cuale River basin.

TI  - SANet: A Sea-Land Segmentation Network Via Adaptive Multiscale Feature Learning
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea-land segmentation of remote sensing images is of great significance to the dynamic monitoring of coastlines. However, the types of objects in the coastal zone are complex, and their spectra, textures, shapes, and distribution features are different. Therefore, sea-land segmentation for various types of coastlines is still a challenging task. In this article, a scale-adaptive semantic segmentation network, called SANet, is proposed for sea-land segmentation of remote sensing images. SANet has made two innovations on the basis of the classic encoder-decoder structure. First, to integrate the spectral, textural, and semantic features of ground objects at different scales, we designed an adaptive multiscale feature learning module (AML) to replace the conventional serial convolution operation. The AML module mainly contains a multiscale feature extraction unit and an adaptive feature fusion unit. The former can capture the multiscale detailed information and contextual semantic information of objects from an early stage, while the latter can adaptively fuse feature maps of different scales. Second, we adopted the squeeze-and-excitation module to bridge the corresponding layers of the codec so that SANet can selectively emphasize the features of the weak sea-land boundaries. Experiments on a set of Gaofen-1 remote sensing images demonstrated that SANet achieved more accurate segmentation results and obtained sharper boundaries than other methods for various natural and artificial coastlines.

TI  - Regional wetland water storage changes: The influence of future climate on geographically isolated wetlands
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Geographically Isolated Wetlands (GIWs) are essential ecological and ecosystem entities that are vulnerable to climate change. The water storage volume (WSV) of GIWs is an important indicator to monitor their health and ecosystem services. Therefore, the projection of changes in future WSV of GIWs is crucial for conservation policies that are typically set at the regional scale. A limiting factor for the extended spatial projection of WSV of GIWs is the lack of data on their geometry, bathymetry, and the complexity of hydrologic relation to the surrounding drainage basin and the climate at a regional scale. In this study, we developed a hybrid Machine Learning (ML) - hydrologic modelling approach, from which a number of indices and variables derived to assess WSV of GIWs. We projected future changes in WSV of about a hundred thousand GIWs across 17 large river basins in western Canada, using a nine-model ensemble climate simulations under two greenhouse gas emissions scenarios (i.e., RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5). We estimated the baseline WSV by developing ML models using water depth measurements and geographical information features from 234 surveyed GIWs across the study area. Future WSV was quantified using a three-step procedure, where water balance simulations were facilitated through the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for the 2018-2034 period, and GIW specific mass-balance components were adapted using remote sensing data. The spatiotemporal analysis of the WSV offers new in-sights, and reveals (1) a baseline provincial WSV of 550 million m(3), with an average of 5,508 m(3) per GIW, (2) a decreasing future WSV at annual rates of -2.58 and -2.62 million m(3) for RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5, respectively, and (3) the minimum and maximum WSV loss rates occurring during October and February, respectively, and (4) a diverse trend and magnitude of changes in WSV across 17 river basins. Finally, we state that while a group of hydrologic, climatic, and geographic processes and factors drives WSV of GIWs, the dominating driving force in WSV trends might be spatially and temporally different depending on the environmental conditions and characteristics of river basins and their associated GIWs. This study facilitates a better understanding of the connections between the WSV of GIWs and watershed-scale hydrology and climate change across multiple spatial scales.

TI  - A New Fusion Algorithm for Simultaneously Improving Spatio-Temporal Continuity and Quality of Remotely Sensed Soil Moisture Over the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatio-temporally continuous and high-quality soil moisture (SM) is very important for assessing changes in the water cycle and climate, especially over the Tibetan plateau (TP). Data fusion is an important method to improve the quality of SM product. However, limited observation overlaps between different satellite SM products, caused by inherent gaps, make it difficult to fuse them to create a continuous and high-quality product. In this study, an SM spatio-temporal continuity and quality simultaneously improving algorithm is proposed. The first step of the approach is obtaining spatio-temporally continuous reference data, including land surface temperature (LST), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), Albedo, and digital elevation model (DEM). The second step is training the general regression neural network (GRNN) model with all available essential climate variables (ECV) and Fengyun (FY) SM. The last step is predicting the spatio-temporally continuous and high-quality SM using the trained GRNN derived by the spatio-temporal continuity reference data. An implementation of the algorithm on the TP showed that, compared with the original ECV and FY SM, both the continuity and quality of the fused SM product were largely improved in terms of coverage (72.5%), correlation (R = 0.809), root mean square error (0.081 cm(3) cm(-3)) and bias (0.050 cm(3) cm(-3)). The algorithm showed a good performance in obtaining spatio-temporal variation fusion weights over the TP. This spatio-temporally continuous and high-quality SM of the TP will help advance our understanding of global and regional changes in water cycle and climate.

TI  - Ship Detection in Large-Scale SAR Images Via Spatial Shuffle-Group Enhance Attention
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ship target detection using large-scale synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images has important application in military and civilian fields. However, ship targets are difficult to distinguish from the surrounding background and many false alarms can occur due to the influence of land area. False alarms always occur with ship target detection because most of the area in large-scale SAR images are treated as background and clutter, and the ship targets are considered unevenly distributing small targets. To address these issues, a ship detection method in large-scale SAR images via CenterNet is proposed in this article. As an anchor-free method, CenterNet defines the target as a point, and the center point of the target is located through key point estimation, which can effectively avoid the missing detection of small targets. At the same time, the spatial shuffle-group enhance (SSE) attention module is introduced into CenterNet. Through SSE, the stronger semantic features are extracted while suppressing some noise to reduce false positives caused by inshore and inland interferences. The experiments on the public SAR-ship-data set show that the proposed method can detect all targets without missed detection with dense-docking targets. For the ship targets in large-scale SAR images from Sentinel 1, the proposed method can also detect targets near the shore and in the sea with high accuracy, which outperforms the methods like faster R-convolutional neural network (CNN), single-shot multibox detector (SSD), you only look once (YOLO), feature pyramid network (FPN), and their variations.

AB  - The challenge of classifying and locating Phoenix palm trees in different scenes with different appearances and varied ages has been addressed with deep learning object detection over aerial images. Nevertheless, an explicit limitation hereof is that palms should be visually identifiable in the image i.e., palm crowns should be larger than the pixel size. Unfortunately, high-spatial resolution imagery is not widely and directly available in the Phoenix palm growing regions of the Mediterranean, Middle East, and North Africa. This study, therefore, presents the re-implementation of a semantic segmentation architecture to train a model able to classify Phoenix palm pixels. This is applied to freely available medium resolution space-borne Sentinel-2 images over the Spanish island of La Gomera (Canary Islands). At the study site, a total of 116,330 Phoenix palms had been inventoried by the local government. Palms appear in multiple, heterogeneous environments, which implies a background variability that is a persistent challenge for palm pixel classification. The re-implemented architecture is a novelty in deep semantic segmentation and density estimation initially developed for counting objects of sub-pixel size. And it proved to be successful for creating a model of palm classification, thereby compensating for the limited spatial resolution of the Sentinel-2 images. The palm tree sub-pixel classification model achieved an overall accuracy of 0.921, with a recall and precision of 0.438 and 0.522. These results demonstrate the potential of remote sensing data of medium-spatial resolution for vegetation mapping in applications where trees are scattered over extensive areas.

AB  - In the twenty-first century, trust has become an influential factor in people and organizations. As the world is advancing digitally, mobile and cloud services have become the principal drivers of this era. The conventional frameworks to protect such an environment have dissolved. There existed a period where organization resources were put away inside the secure perimeter and regarded as safe. Moreover, the recent work-from-home culture provides attackers with a rather significant opportunity to breach security controls. Everybody is deemed trustworthy inside the network, allowing an intruder to gain escalated access inside the perimeter. These fortresses currently permit clients to get sustained information from outside the fortification since everybody is 'trusted excessively.' making our current foundation defenseless to attackers. This paper proves 'Zero Trust' as another worldview of online protection. It explores the previous work related to Zero Trust implementation and its research. It discusses Zero Trust as a potential for future network security. It uses containers to implement the architecture, which responds to various types of attacks. It focuses on security at every OSI model layer and the advantages and disadvantages of Zero Trust Architecture.

TI  - Vegetation fire activity and the Potential Fire Index (PFIv2) performance in the last two decades (2001-2016)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire incidence has been linked to multiple factors such as climate conditions, population density, agriculture, and lightning. Recently, fire frequency and severity have induced health problems and contributed to increase atmospheric greenhouse gases. Based on atmospheric susceptibility to fire, this study evaluates the use of a Potential Fire Index (PFIv2) to identify regions prone to fire development, as demonstrated by the satellite detected-fire in the 2001-2016 interval. It is demonstrated that PFIv2 delivers an efficiency by up to 80% in matching the observed fires from Terra/MODIS satellite. The PFIv2 is also able to reproduce more accurately areas with fire activity with respect to its previous version, the PFI. This better performance is linked to the implementation of parameterization of water pressure deficit and atmospheric stability in the lower troposphere, and a new term to represent the effect of surface temperatures, particularly in mid-latitudes and extra-Tropics. To evaluate the performance of the PFIv2 in more details, its comparison to MODIS burned areas demonstrated correlations values higher than 0.6 over the most susceptible regions such as Africa and South America, slightly lower correlation is found where fire does not primary follows the climate annual cycle, and is dominated by high frequency events. These findings indicate that the PFIv2 can be an important tool for decision makers in predicting the potential for vegetation fires development and fire danger.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents the main contributions of Latin American decolonial and feminist thinking to geographic studies on body-territory. The research was carried out in the light of the phenomenological method. Through field research, it was verified the relational praxis between the bodies of women living in the Kaxarari and Rio Guapore Indigenous Lands and the territory. It was found that the decolonial and feminist thoughts found valuable sources in both the worldview and the historical resistance of Aboriginal peoples to colonialism and coloniality. These sources contributed to the updating of the geographical concept of territory, which was previously based exclusively on Eurocentric standards. The main responsible for the extension/ modernization of the geographic look on the body and the territory were Latin American Indigenous women and feminists, as they brought the interrelationship between body-territoryland to the center of the geographic and political debate, expanding the scales of analysis and the meanings of these categories. For them, the material and immaterial relations that the bodies maintain with the territory (and their worlds) ensure the existence of the collective in conditions of dignity, which is why the defense of the territory becomes a defense of the very life of the collective body.

TI  - Fire analysis in the Caatinga environment from Landsat-8 images, enhanced vegetation index and analysis by the main components
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Fires generate negative environmental and socioeconomic impacts that directly and indirectly influence the Earth's regional and global climate changes. Forest fires and fires play a relevant ecological role as they affect the local biodiversity, soil properties and water supply. The Caatinga biome has a high level of degradation of human and natural activities, being extremely affected by fires that burn predominantly due to human activities. Remote orbital sensing, as it presents specific spatial, spectral and temporal characteristics, is an essential technological alternative in monitoring areas affected by fire on the Earth's surface. This work aimed to analyze, in a spatial, spectral and temporal scope, the behavior of a fire in a Caatinga environment from the multivariate statistical analysis of Landsat-8 Images data, Enhanced Vegetation Index and Analysis by the Major Components. The quantification of characteristics of vegetation derived from the spectral index provides a better assessment of the physical condition of the earth's surface under the effects of fire. Remote sensing techniques and multivariate statistics were used to assess the spectral behavior of wildfires in the Caatinga biome. The results of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Normality Test showed a significance level of 5%. The integration of the statistical methods of Simple Linear Regression and Analysis by the Principal Components enabled important diagnoses in the estimates and/or relationships between the random variables. The multivariate technique allowed 94% of the data variation to be assessed. The maps resulting from the tested methodology represent an important improvement in mapping the distribution of vegetation. This study generates indications for future scientific research related to the management of space concerning to vulnerability and recovery of vegetation landscapes from the semi-arid climate under fire situations generated by burnings.

TI  - BACKDATING OF INVARIANT PIXELS: COMPARISON OF ALGORITHMS FOR LAND USE AND LAND COVER CHANGE (LUCC) DETECTION IN THE SUBTROPICAL BRAZILIAN ATLANTIC FOREST
T2  - BOLETIM DE CIENCIAS GEODESICAS
M3  - Article
AB  - A challenge for the use of medium spatial resolution imagery for land use change detection consists of the reduced availability of ground reference data for previous dates. This study aims to obtain invariant training points using the backdating process for supervised classification of images that have no field data available. The study area comprises 1,353 km(2) in Santa Catarina, southern Brazil. We compared the accuracy performance of invariant area sets (binary change maps) generated by using three methods (IR-MAD - Iteratively Reweighted Multivariate Alteration Detection, CVA - Change Vector Analysis and SGD - Spectral Gradient Difference) for two periods (20172011 and 2011-2006). The classification of the Landsat-5 TM image of 2006 was performed using as training data the sets of points indicated as invariant in the binary maps resulted from the three abovementioned methods. The accuracies for seven land-use classes were computed. The overall accuracy was greater (80,5% and 80,2%) when using training areas achieved by CVA and SGD, respectively than IR-MAD (76%). Were obtained accuracies greater than 80% for the forest class. The results stress that the combination of the IR-MAD and SGD is preferable since the CVA is more time consuming due to the subjective application of thresholds.

AB  - Advances in remote sensing technology have led to the capture of massive amounts of data. Increased image resolution, more frequent revisit times, and additional spectral channels have created an explosion in the amount of data that is available to provide analyses and intelligence across domains, including agriculture. However, the processing of this data comes with a cost in terms of computation time and money, both of which must be considered when the goal of an algorithm is to provide real-time intelligence to improve efficiencies. Specifically, we seek to identify nutrient deficient areas from remotely sensed data to alert farmers to regions that require attention; detection of nutrient deficient areas is a key task in precision agriculture as farmers must quickly respond to struggling areas to protect their harvests. Past methods have focused on pixel-level classification (i.e. semantic segmentation) of the field to achieve these tasks, often using deep learning models with tens-of-millions of parameters. In contrast, we propose a much lighter graph-based method to perform node-based classification. We first use Simple Linear Iterative Cluster (SLIC) to produce super-pixels across the field. Then, to perform segmentation across the non-Euclidean domain of superpixels, we leverage a Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN). This model has 4-orders-of-magnitude fewer parameters than a CNN model and trains in a matter of minutes.

TI  - wri/carbon-budget: Annual tree cover loss update 2001-2020
T2  - Zenodo
M3  - Software
AB  - This version is updated to run through 2020 (2001-2020). Updates involved in this are: new tree cover loss (TCL) data from the GLAD Lab at the University of Maryland (2001-2020), an updated drivers of tree cover loss model (same methods as Curtis et al. 2018 Science, but with TCL through 2020), and updated burned area data from MODIS collection 6. Beyond these updated inputs, the model is almost identical (one small correction was made to some emissions calculations). A few other improvements that do not affect the model methods or results are included in this release: Users can disable uploads of model logs and output rasters to AWS s3 using a new command line argument (--no-upload or -nu flag) in individual model stages or in run_full_model.py. This can expedite testing of the model because users don't have to wait for tiles to upload after each step of the model runs. It also makes it easier for people to run the model without access to s3 because they can easily make the model not upload outputs to s3. (It will still try to download from s3, though, and users would need to manually change that.) Users can disable the deletion of intermediate outputs during the later stages of run_full_model.py with a new command line argument (--save-intermediates or -si flag). The command line arguments in run_full_model.py to include stages for creating US and mangrove removal factors are now flags rather than requiring true or false arguments after them. The model log isn't uploaded to s3 as frequently now. Originally, it was uploaded anytime any text was added to the console. Assuming the --no-upload flag isn't turned on, now the log is only uploaded when it is created, when an exception is thrown, at the end of a function, after all tiles in a set are uploaded, and at the end of run_full_model.py. The constants and input raster names for all the main emissions C++ scripts are centralized in a new file called constants.h. This makes it easier to change the names of input files for the standard and sensitivity analysis C++ scripts because they only need to be changed in constants.h, rather than in each version of the emissions script. Note that flu_val.cpp and equations.cpp don't refer to constants.h and therefore need to be separately updated from constants.h. NOTE: The main model and everything involved in the 2020 updated work but the pre-processing scripts and sensitivity analysis functions haven't been retested and may not all work in this release.

AB  - In this study, the Gaofen-3 synthetic aperture radar (GF-3 SAR) wave mode data were recalibrated, and were further used to retrieve the ocean surface wind. The collocated data used include the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) and the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) wind data. First, the GF-3 data were recalibrated using a numerical weather prediction (NWP) method. Here the GF-3 measured normalized radar cross section (NRCS) were compared to the simulated NRCS (by collocated ECMWF winds and CMOD5.N model) to determine the recalibration coefficients at different polarizations and incidence angles. By the recalibration, the bias between the GF-3 NRCS and the simulated NRCS was significantly reduced (< 0.1 dB). Then, the wind speed and wind direction were retrieved from the recalibrated GF-3 data by the CMOD5.N model using the optimal scheme (co-polarized data, VV and HH data) and linear model (cross-polarized data, VH and HV data). Note that the cross-polarized data were only used to retrieved wind speed due to the weak sensitivity on wind direction. Finally, the wind retrievals were validated by the collocated ASCAT winds. The bias and root mean square error (RMSE) of the wind retrievals were obtained at different polarizations and incidence angles. From the validations, the retrieved wind speed and direction have better accuracies than the ones before recalibration. Take the retrieval accuracy at incidence angles from 40 degrees to 40.7 degrees as an example, the RMSEs are 1.89 m/s, 1.92 m/s, 2.07 m/s and 2.12 m/s for VV, HH, VH, HV data respectively. Moreover, for wind speed retrievals at all incidence angles, the RMSEs are around 2 m/s, while the RMSEs from cross-polarized data are slightly larger than the ones from co-polarized data. For retrieved wind direction, the RMSEs from co-polarized data are lower than 20 degrees. Results indicate that the NWP-based recalibration method can significantly improve the accuracy of GF-3 wind retrievals.

TI  - Patterns of forest cover loss in the terrestrial Key Biodiversity Areas in the Philippines: critical habitat conservation priorities
T2  - Journal of Threatened Taxa
M3  - Article
AB  - The Philippines, home to over 20,000 endemic species of plants and animals, is facing a biodiversity crisis due to the constant decrease of forest cover. The Key Biodiversity Area (KBA) approach was developed to conserve species threatened with extinction using a site-based conservation strategy to select globally important sites using threshold-based criteria for species irreplaceability and vulnerability. This study investigates the applicability of remotely sensed data through geospatial analysis to quantify forest cover loss of the 101 terrestrial KBAs in the country between 2001 and 2019. Results showed that the study sites had 4.5 million hectares (ha) of forest in the year 2000. However, these sites have lost about 270,000 ha of forest in nearly two decades, marking a steady decline with an annual deforestation rate of 14,213 ha per year in these terrestrial KBAs. The majority of the study sites (58) had a high percentage of forest loss (>3.13%), and these should be prioritized for conservation. By the year 2030, it is forecast that a total of 331 thousand ha of forest will be lost unless there is a transformational change in the country's approach to dealing with deforestation. The results of this study provide relevant data and information in forest habitat in near real-time monitoring to assess the impact and effectiveness of forest governance and approaches within these critical habitats.

TI  - Detection of Forest Cover Disturbances Using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Time Series Data in the Mount Pulag National Park: A Key Biodiversity Area in Luzon, Philippines.
T2  - Philippine Journal of Science
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest cover disturbances continue to occur at a very alarming rate, which greatly contributes to the loss of biodiversity resources. Therefore, an approach to detect and measure historical deforestation would be of utmost importance - particularly in the near real-time forest monitoring and management, biodiversity conservation, and estimation of carbon emissions. This study introduced a simple approach using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) time-series data, primarily the C-band Sentinel-1A (S1A) VH-polarization with a 10-m resolution, in detecting forest cover disturbances from 2016-2019 in Mount Pulag National Park (MPNP), a protected area (PA) within the island of Luzon and a priority biodiversity conservation area. The process involved using codes in Google Earth Engine (GEE) to produce a forest cover disturbance map; a grid-based geospatial and statistical analysis using the geographic information system; and data validation, and determination of possible causes of disturbances using Google Earth Pro (GEP). The results derived from Sentinel-1 data were also compared to existing optical data, which is a Landsat-based generated disturbance map. The output of this paper revealed that a total of 577 forest disturbances, with an equivalent area of 154.58 ha, were detected from a three-year period. For Landsat-generated data, 402 disturbances were detected with an area of 176.07 ha. However, based on the accuracy assessment using positive predictive value (PPV), the radar data produced higher accuracy (80%) compared to the optical data (73%). The visual observation and interpretation of satellite imageries made it clear that the primary drivers of forest cover disturbances in Mount Pulag are agricultural expansion (48%), forest clearings (26%), landslides (12%), slash-and-burn or "kaingin" (12%), and forest fires (2%).

T2  - Open research Europe
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Lagrangian analysis is becoming increasingly important to better understand the ocean's biological and biogeochemical cycles. Yet, biologists and chemists often lack the technical skills required to set up such analyses. Here, we present a new product of pre-computed ocean Lagrangian trajectories (OLTraj) targeting non-expert users, and demonstrate how to use it by means of worked examples. OLTraj is based on satellite-derived geostrophic currents, which allows one to directly compare it with other in-situ or satellite products.We anticipate that OLTraj will foster a new interest in Lagrangian applications in ocean biology and biogeochemistry.

AB  - The significant prognostic variables related with bosom malignant growth are far off metastasis and repeat. Both lympho-vascular attack (LVI) and vein intrusion (BVI) are significant courses for metastases to common center points of the lymph and essential metastases. Despite the noteworthiness of vascular interruption as a prognostic factor, there is a flawed point in using vascular assault as a histopathological worldview. The purpose of this examination was to perceive BVI LVI in the perception and rehash of chest damage using an explicit immunohistochemical recolation of the endothelial subtype explicit immuno-histochemical recolor (D2-40 and CD31).

TI  - Exploring the relationship between high-resolution aerosol optical depth values and ground-level particulate matter concentrations in the Metropolitan Area of SAo Paulo
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatiotemporal pattern of particulate matter (PM) concentrations is an important factor in predicting health issues in inhabitants of urban areas. The integration of satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) data with ground-level PM concentration data, obtained from monitoring networks, has contributed to better character-ization of the spatiotemporal variability of aerosols worldwide. However, before using satellite AOD data as a proxy for PM in epidemiological and air quality studies in specific regions, the applicability of that strategy must be evaluated. In this study, we evaluate the use of the high-resolution AOD, derived from Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm, as a predictor of surface PM concentrations in the Metropolitan Area of Sao Paulo (MASP). We found relatively weak or negative correlations between PM concentrations and MAIAC AOD, even after vertical correction by planetary boundary layer height and the hygroscopic growth factor. The weak correlations reported in this study are mainly due to the mismatch between the current MAIAC aerosol model and the properties of local aerosols in the MASP. Our results suggest that sources of aerosol particles in the MASP are quite diverse and that there is therefore no single optical model suitable for use with satellite-derived AOD.

TI  - Fire danger assessment using geospatial modelling in Mekong delta, Vietnam: Effects on wetland resources
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mekong Delta (MD), Vietnam is a large tropical wetland important for commodity provision, water balance regulation, and biodiversity conservation. However, the delta is under severe fire risk due to prolonged drought and rising temperatures largely emanating from climatic change. Our study applied MODIS Terra land surface reflectance (MOD09A1), MODIS Terra land surface temperature (MOD11A2), and ASTER digital elevation model (DEM) to develop fire danger models to assess spatial patterns in fire danger in the MD. Four variables: Potential Surface Temperature (PST), Modified Normalized Difference Fire Index (MNDFI), Perpendicular Moisture Index (PMI) and Normalized Multiband Drought Index (NMDI), were extracted from the satellite products to develop the models using Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) and weighted overlay methods to generate fire danger maps during the 2019 fire season. The models were validated using MODIS Terra and Aqua thermal anomaly product (MOD14), with overall accuracy of 84.13%. The result demonstrated that the model accurately estimates fire risk over the MD. The study also found that forests, especially Melaleuca wetland forests in U Minh wetlands, and agricultural land were under severe fire risk. The implication is that measures such as proper management of forests and agricultural activities for mitigating forest fires and integrated fire and water strategies for either fire risk mitigation or biodiversity conservation are necessary for sustainable management of the MD wetland.

CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing of the Ocean, Sea Ice, Coastal Waters, and Large Water Regions

AB  - Investigation of the mixing processes in river confluence zones is an important problem, particularly in application to ecological monitoring of rivers and inland waters. Such processes can be very complex and can affect riverbed deformation, mixing and pollution transport, etc. A typical example is a confluence zone (CZ) of the Volga and Oka rivers (Russia). In this paper, the Volga/Oka CZ signatures in satellite optical (Sentinel-2 MSI) and radar (Sentinel-1 SAR) images are analyzed for the period of ice/snow melting in early spring. First, the ice melting appears immediately downstream of the meeting point of the rivers. At the early stages of the ice cover melting the CZ is seen as a narrow dark band in the optical images and as a bright band in radar images because of wet snow/ice cover within the CZ. The faster melting in the CZ than outside can be associated both with the emissions of warm water from factories/thermal power plants and with water transportation towards the CZ by weak transverse currents in the river flows. The enhanced radar backscatter in the CZ can be associated with an increase of the snow/ice moisture and thus an increase of snow/ice cover roughness. With air temperature increase, an open water patch with fragmented ice appears transformed later into a long polynia. The polynia is manifested as a dark band in radar imagery presumably due to the suppression of wind waves associated with fragmented ice. This happens even at moderate wind velocities normally exceeding the threshold of wind wave excitation.

TI  - Culture As a Genome of Civilizational Development
T2  - VOPROSY FILOSOFII
M3  - Letter
AB  - The article discusses the problems of forming a new type of civilizational development, analyzes the features and new technologies for updating life's meanings and basic values. Characteristics and growth points are revealed where "world-view universals" (according to V.S. Styopin) act as some sort of basic genes of a different type of sociality. Just like the origin of new types of organisms is impossible without genetic transformations changing the organism genome, the emergence of new types of society and new types of sociality are impossible without updating fundamental life meanings and basic values. Today's actualization of the phenomena of culture as an object of transferring historical and national legacy is connected with an attempt to imagine it as the genome of civilization's development. Mostly on this way the strategies compete which preserve basic values of the previous type of development with innovational intentions focused on searching for new life meanings and on renewing the content of modern reality values. New values are generating within the old culture, and the humanity is interested in these seeds of the future to grow into new civilization. The author shows that the formation of a new value matrix and the renewal of vital meanings is a condition for the transition to a new type of civilizational development, which grows within modern civilization. The information revolution in the field of communication is radically changing the nature of civilizational development, it is one of the factors affecting the renewal of basic values and life meanings.

T2  - JOURNAL OF TAIBAH UNIVERSITY FOR SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to highlight the natural risks induced by spatiotemporal interaction between the geomorphological features and the urban growth of Jeddah, the largest city in Makkah Province, Saudi Arabia. The methodology is based on remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques. A spatial analysis of the GIS layers extracted from multisource remotely sensed data from 1965 to 2020 was performed. The results show that the urban area has doubled more than 30 times and has increased from around 36 sq. km in 1965 to more than 1,130 sq. km in 2020. Consequently, the city expands to all morphological units, resulting in multihazard susceptibility and exposure. In order to identify and and prioritize the various risks associated to geomorphic processes, a map has been designed to classify the natural risk areas according to their intensity and their factors. Thus, geomorphological constraints have a significant impact on urban planning.

TI  - Nearly One In Five Skilled Nursing Facilities Awarded Positive Incentives Under Value-Based Purchasing
T2  - HEALTH AFFAIRS
M3  - Article
AB  - Medicare's Skilled Nursing Facility Value-Based Purchasing Program, which awards value-based incentive payments based on hospital readmissions, distributed its first two rounds of incentives during fiscal years 2019 and 2020. Incentive payments were based on achievement or improvement scores-whichever was better. Incentive payments were as low as -2.0 percent in both program years and as high as +1.6 percent in FY 2019 and +3.1 percent in FY 2020. In FY 2019, 26 percent of facilities earned positive incentives and 72 percent earned negative incentives, compared with 19 percent positive and 65 percent negative incentives in FY 2020. Larger, rural, and not-for-profit facilities were more likely to earn positive incentives, as were those with the highest registered nurse staffing levels. Although these findings indicate the potential to reward high-quality care at skilled nursing facilities, intended and unintended outcomes of this new value-based purchasing program should be monitored closely for possible program refinements, particularly in light of the disproportionate impacts of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on nursing facilities.

AB  - Identification of geological structures must be done through observation of geological structures through remote sensing imaging to identify geological structures on the surface and interpretation of the results of geophysical surveys to identify continuity of subsurface geological structures. Geological structures or fault is an important parameter in geothermal exploration. It could be able as a secondary permeability that control and improve the fluid flow within a reservoir. Lineament analysis and gravity analysis (FHD & SVD) can be used to identify geological structures on the surface and subsurface. The surface structure analyzed with DEM satellite image and gravity data processing used Surfer 13 Software to separate (Complete Bouguer Anomaly) and filtered (First Horizontal & Second Vertical Derivative) the data. The result of fault correlation between remote sensing analysis had NW-SE dominant trend lineaments, similar pattern with FHD result. Based on SVD curve, the structure in this research area dominated by reverse faults and normal faults. By using geophysical tools (gravity), initial data from remote sensing is getting stronger.

CL  - St. Louis, MI
AB  - Onboard GNSS-based satellite navigation is becoming a reality due to the need for current and planned Earth observation missions to be equipped with real-time, high-accuracy positioning. In this perspective, an existing Precise Onboard Orbit Determination (P2OD) software (SW) tool, developed at the University of Padua, has been used as a starting point for an upgrade to a higher level of performance to meet the needs of real-time onboard navigation. The current features of the SW are presented along with a solution quality analysis. The SW is based on Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) using a reduced-dynamics approach. The force model implemented is comparable to those used in high-accuracy, ground-based processing, employing empirical accelerations to take into account residual force mismodeling. A test case using Sentinel-3A GPS dual-frequency data is analyzed. The computed orbit has been compared to the official ESA precise ephemeris over an 18-days period, showing a 7.6 cm and a 14.5 cm 3D RMS difference when using IGS final products and IGC products, respectively. Moreover, we investigate the use of stale ancillary data (Earth Orientation Parameters (EOP) and Solar And Geomagnetic Activity (SAGA) data) with a latency of several days-a relatively common situation for missions not supported by an extensive ground-station network. It is described how outdated ancillary data impact the solution depending on the reference frame used to model empirical accelerations. The reduced-dynamics approach is exploited to ensure the state vector prediction capability also during GNSS data outage. Here, we report on the results obtained for a selenocentric orbit (LRO mission data), showing a 3D RMS difference w.r.t. published estimated orbits lower than 5 m after three orbital periods. Finally, the current developments are described in the context of the onboard technology demonstration ESA/GOMspace GOMX-5 CubeSat mission within the DEIMOS G3PSTAR GNSS receiver in the second half of 2022. These include the capability to process dual-constellation, i.e., GPS and Galileo data, and the Galileo High Accuracy Service (HAS) corrections.

AB  - At present times monitoring of air quality is regarded to be of utmost importance. In that regard Nitrogen Dioxide concentration is an important factor to consider. Satellite measurements provide an excellent opportunity of global, round the clock measurements as opposed to in situ monitoring. However, given the fact that satellite measured Tropospheric Vertical Column Density does not offer much information about near-surface concentration, estimation methods become utterly necessary. In this paper we propose a novel Convolutional Neural Network based deep learning method to perform an estimation of near-surface NO2 concentration over Ireland using Tropospheric VCD as the sole input feature. The proposed method is validated against in situ data. The method shows a Root Mean Squared Error of 7.20 mu g/m(3). The work is novel in two aspects. Firstly, it treats the problem as an univariate estimation only dependent on satellite measurement. Therefore, independence from in situ data allows it to be used for estimation even in remote locations where no ground data is available. Secondly, in our knowledge Convolutional Neural Networks have not yet been explored as a possible method for estimation of near-surface NO2 concentration and our work is the first that does so with good results.

M3  - Data study
AB  - This datasets presents a spatial and temporal surface velocity analysis of 33 glaciers in the Jankar Chhu Watershed (JCW), western Himalaya. The surface velocity was computed using the Co-registration of Optically Sensed Images and Correlation (COSI-Corr) tool on the Landsat images spanning nearly three decades (1992-2020).Glaciers in the JCW exhibit three distinct spatial velocity patterns. The type-I glaciers show nearly stagnant (<5 m yrˉ1) debris-covered tongues but a maximum velocity of >60 m yrˉ1 in the debris-free accumulation area. The type-II glaciers exhibit active tongues (>50 m yrˉ1) yet have slow movement in the accumulation zone. The type-III glaciers show prolonged (<10 m yrˉ1) yet consistent movement throughout the flow line. Results show that the average surface velocity of studied glaciers was 11.10  4.1 m yrˉ1 in 1992/93, which increased (by 43%) to 15.87  2.4 m yrˉ1 in 2000/02 and further increased (by 59%) to 25.25  1.5 m yrˉ1 in 2017/18. Glaciers show seasonal fluctuations in surface velocities with an apparent summer speedup of 19%-200% compared to the winter velocities. Inter-annual velocities show an increasing trend during the observation periods. Copyright: info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess License: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0

AB  - Handling mixed pixel is a common problem for both multi as well as hyperspectral satellite data. This code proposes a fuzzy extension of Radial Basis Function Neural Network  for classification of satellite data. The proposed method first estimates fuzzy membership values of satellite data using fuzzy-c-means algorithm. Similarly fuzzy supervisedclassification is performed on the same sattelite image using ground truth samples. Then from both FCM and FSC classified data sample selected for RBFNN. The procedure for connecting the FCM and FSC through RBFNN is explained in the title image.Three experiments are performed with multi and hyperspectral satellite data, namely, Indian Remote Sensing Satellite-1A, LANDSAT-TM (Thematic Mapper) and Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) to compare the proposed FCM-RBFNN-FSC with basic FCM and FSC.

TI  - A novel framework for seamless mosaic of Cartosat-1 DEM scenes
T2  - COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital elevation model (DEM) is used as a source of elevation data in wide range of applications. The applications involving larger area than an individual DEM scene often need a mosaic of DEM scenes. A simple stitching exhibits seams along the borders of DEM scenes in the mosaic output. The presence of seam lines varies with the number of scenes in an overlapping region and their overlap extents. The conventional feathering-based blend method, by virtue of the method itself, considers only two input scenes in an instance of the mosaic process. This method requires a suitable ordering of the input DEM scenes, especially in the overlapping regions containing more than two scenes. In this paper, we propose a framework that automatically handles the multiple overlapping regions and creates a seamless mosaic of Cartosat-1 DEM scenes for a given region of interest. We use a tree data structure to arrange input DEM scenes hierarchically based on their metadata. A traversal algorithm is devised to establish an order of precedence among the DEM scenes. This determines a unique input sequence of DEM scenes during mosaic process. In addition, two variants of feathering-based blend method are formulated to handle all possible cases of the overlapping regions. The experiments have been conducted on Cartosat-1 DEM scenes over 1 degrees x 1 degrees region of interest. We analyze and compare our proposed methodology with average method and feathering-based blend method. We demonstrate that our framework exhibits a smooth transition of elevation values in the overlapping regions of the DEM mosaic output.

AB  - The main objective of this study is to monitor the land infrastructure growth over a period of time using multimodality of remote sensing satellite images. In this project unsupervised change detection analysis using ITPCA (Iterated Principal Component Analysis) is presented to indicate the continuous change occurring over a long period of time. The change monitoring is pixel based and multitemporal. Co-registration is an important criteria in pixel based multitemporal image analysis. The minimization of co-registration error is addressed considering 8- neighborhood pixels. Comparison of results of ITPCA analysis with LRT (likelihood ratio test) and GLRT (generalized likelihood ratio test) methods used for SAR and MS (Multispectral) images respectively in earlier publications are also presented in this paper. The datasets of Sentinel-2 around 0-3 days of the acquisition of Sentinel-1 are used for multimodal image fusion. SAR and MS both have inherent advantages and disadvantages. SAR images have the advantage of being insensitive to atmospheric and light conditions, but it suffers the presence of speckle phenomenon. In case of multispectral, challenge is to get quite a large number of datasets without cloud coverage in region of interest for multivariate distribution modelling.

Prediction and assessment of soil loss are, therefore, of utmost importance for soil fertility conservation, land and water management. Recent technological advances have provided useful models through which remotely-sensed data for a large scale area can be analysed and interpreted. The present study adopts a physiographically, biologically and climatically unique model for the assessment of soil erosion in the Indian Himalayan Region. The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation model was applied in conjunction with Geographic Information System to estimate the average annual rate of soil erosion at both state and district levels in India. The model was deployed using coarse resolution datasets to identify specific areas vulnerable to soil erosion. In determining the spatial distribution of average annual soil erosion within the study region, all cell-based parameters of the model were multiplied in the specified 500 m x 500 m spatial resolution. The spatial pattern of annual soil erosion indicates that maximum soil loss occurs in northern and eastern states whereas low rates of erosion is observed in the eastern-most part of the study area.

TI  - Pharmacological inhibition of focal adhesion kinase 1 (FAK1) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) identified via kinome profile analysis attenuates lipopolysaccharide-induced endothelial inflammatory activation
T2  - BIOMEDICINE & PHARMACOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sepsis is a life-threatening condition often leading to multiple organ failure for which currently no pharmacological treatment is available. Endothelial cells (EC) are among the first cells to respond to pathogens and inflammatory mediators in sepsis and might be a sentinel target to prevent the occurrence of multiple organ failure. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a Gram-negative bacterial component that induces endothelial expression of inflammatory adhesion molecules, cytokines, and chemokines. This expression is regulated by a network of kinases, the result of which in vivo enables leukocytes to transmigrate from the blood into the underlying tissue, causing organ damage. We hypothesised that besides the known kinase pathways, other kinases are involved in the regulation of EC in response to LPS, and that these can be pharmacologically targeted to inhibit cell activation. Using kinome profiling, we identified 58 tyrosine kinases (TKs) that were active in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) at various timepoints after stimulation with LPS. These included AXL tyrosine kinase (Axl), focal adhesion kinase 1 (FAK1), and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). Using siRNA-based gene knock down, we confirmed that these three TKs mediate LPS-induced endothelial inflammatory activation. Pharmacological inhibition with FAK1 inhibitor FAK14 attenuated LPS-induced endothelial inflammatory activation and leukocyte adhesion partly via blockade of NF-kappa B activity. Administration of FAK14 after EC exposure to LPS also resulted in inhibition of inflammatory molecule expression. In contrast, inhibition of ALK with FDA-approved inhibitor Ceritinib attenuated LPS-induced endothelial inflammatory activation via a pathway that was independent of NF-kappa B signalling while it did not affect leukocyte adhesion. Furthermore, Ceritinib administration after start of EC exposure to LPS did not inhibit inflammatory activation. Combined FAK1 and ALK inhibition attenuated LPS-induced endothelial activation in an additive manner, without affecting leukocyte adhesion. Summarising, our findings suggest the involvement of FAK1 and ALK in mediating LPS-induced inflammatory activation of EC. Since pharmacological inhibition of FAK1 attenuated endothelial inflammatory activation after the cells were exposed to LPS, FAK1 represents a promising target for follow up studies.

TI  - Dealing With Clouds and Seasonal Changes for Center Pivot Irrigation Systems Detection Using Instance Segmentation in Sentinel-2 Time Series
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The automatic detection of Center Pivot Irrigation Systems (CPIS) is fundamental for establishing public policies, especially in countries with a growth perspective in this technology, like Brazil. Previous studies to detect CPIS using deep learning used single-date optical images, containing limitations due to seasonal changes and cloud cover. Therefore, this research aimed to detect CPIS using Sentinel-2 multitemporal images (containing six dates) and instance segmentation, considering seasonal variations and different proportions of cloudy images, generalizing the models to detect CPIS in diverse situations. We used a novel augmentation strategy, in which, for each iteration, six images were randomly selected from the time series (from a total of 11 dates) in random order. We evaluated the Mask-RCNN model with the ResNext-101 backbone considering the COCO metrics on six testing sets with different ratios of cloudless (< 20%) and cloudy images (> 75%), from six cloudless images and zero cloudy images (6:0) up to one cloudless image and five cloudy images (1:5). We found that using six cloudless images provided the best metrics [80% average precision (AP), 93% AP with a 0.5 intersection over union threshold (AP50)]. However, results were similar (74% AP, 88% AP50) even in extreme scenarios with abundant cloud presence (1:5 ratio). Our method provides a more adaptive and automatic way to map CPIS from time series, significantly reducing interference such as cloud cover, atmospheric effects, shadow, missing data, and lack of contrast with the surrounding vegetation.

TI  - EDUCATION AS A COMMUNITY EXPERIENCE AND THE SCHOOL VIVA OLHO DO TEMPO: THE CIRCULAR OF KNOWLEDGE AS AN INNOVATIVE ALTERNATIVE PRACTICE
T2  - HOLOS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study seeks to analyze the dialogue circles of Escola Viva Olho do Tempo (EVOT) and understand their contributions to education based on practices based on common experiences between subjects. We start from the theoretical framework on popular and community education and, in the methodological aspect, we highlight the qualitative character of this research, with participant observation and the utilization of field diaries. Data analysis was carried out based on the categories Dialogue, Hope, Emancipation and Knowledge. The results point to the effectiveness of this educational conception, and it highlights the relevance of the dialogue circles to forge subjects who think, feel and act according to their worldview, aware of their transformative power over themselves and over the world. We conclude that EVOT's dialogue circles are spaces for the realization of community education, an educational concept that escapes the Eurocentric molds that exclude, segregate and determine the place of subjects in society.

TI  - Differential Yellow Fever Susceptibility in New World Nonhuman Primates, Comparison with Humans, and Implications for Surveillance
T2  - EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - A major outbreak of yellow fever (YF) occurred in Brazil during 2016-2018. Epizootics in New World nonhuman primates are sentinel events for YF virus circulation. However, genus-specific susceptibilities and suitability for YF surveillance remain poorly understood. We obtained and compared epidemiologic, histopathologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular results from 93 human and 1,752 primate cases submitted during the recent YF outbreak in Brazil (2017), with the support of the Brazilian National YF Surveillance Program. We detected heterogeneous YF-associated profiles among the various genera of primates we analyzed. Alouatta primates were the most reliable sentinel; Sapajus and Callicebus primates had higher viral loads but lower proportional mortality rates. Callithrix primates were the least sensitive, showing lower viral loads, lower proportional mortality rates, and no demonstrable YF virus antigen or extensive lesions in liver, despite detectable viral RNA. These differences in susceptibility, viral load, and mortality rates should be considered in strategic surveillance of epizootics and control measures for YF.

TI  - Environmental drivers influencing the abundance of round sardinella (<i>Sardinella aurita</i>) and European sprat (<i>Sprattus sprattus</i>) in different areas of the Mediterranean Sea
T2  - MEDITERRANEAN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Data on Sardinella aurita (round sardinella) and Sprattus sprattus (European sprat) in the Mediterranean Sea are limited due to their scarce commercial interest, at least in European countries. Yet, these two small pelagic fish, sitting at opposite ends of the thermal range, could be interesting sentinel species to monitor the effects of climate change in the basin. Using the Mediterranean International Acoustic Surveys (MEDIAS) - the most extensive source of information on these species - we analysed their biomass in several geographical subareas of the central and western Mediterranean Sea in relation to satellite-derived environmental parameters. Our findings highlight that the S. aurita biomass responded to temperature, salinity, chlorophyll concentration and sea level anomaly, depending on the GSA examined, whereas the S. sprattus biomass correlated significantly with salinity in GSA 6, with salinity and chlorophyll concentration in GSA 7 and with sea level anomaly in GSA 17. These data widen our knowledge of the factors that contribute to the ecology of these species. Further studies of their spatial distribution and of their interactions with other small pelagic species, predators and prey are needed to depict a more comprehensive scenario.

TI  - Regression Models for Soil Water Storage Estimation Using the ESA CCI Satellite Soil Moisture Product: A Case Study in Northeast Portugal
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative Soil Moisture (ESA CCI SM) product provides soil moisture estimates from radar satellite data with a daily temporal resolution. Despite validation exercises with ground data that have been performed since the product's launch, SM has not yet been consistently related to soil water storage, which is a key step for its application for prediction purposes. This study aimed to analyse the relationship between soil water storage (S), which was obtained from soil water balance computations with ground meteorological data, and soil moisture, which was obtained from radar data, as affected by soil water storage capacity (Smax). As a case study, a 14-year monthly series of soil water storage, produced via soil water balance computations using ground meteorological data from northeast Portugal and Smax from 25 mm to 150 mm, were matched with the corresponding monthly averaged SM product. Linear (I) and logistic (II) regression models relating S with SM were compared. Model performance (r(2) in the 0.8-0.9 range) varied non-monotonically with Smax, with it being the highest at an Smax of 50 mm. The logistic model (II) performed better than the linear model (I) in the lower range of Smax. Improvements in model performance obtained with segregation of the data series in two subsets, representing soil water recharge and depletion phases throughout the year, outlined the hysteresis in the relationship between S and SM.

T2  - HISTORY OF EDUCATION & CHILDRENS LITERATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to analyze the role of the university press and student participation in two journals published in Colegios Mayores (university residences) in Spain in the 1960s. Our documentary research looks into "Revista Anaya" (1963-64), published at San Bartolome, a Colegio Mayor in Salamanca, and "Revista Cisneros" (1967-1969), published at Ximenez Cisneros, a Colegio Mayor in Madrid. It highlights topics related to editorial management, as well as discussions on campus life and political positions. We have observed that both journals expressed the directive ideas of specific college groups, working as an official agency for the shaping of students' worldview. Also, our research critically reflects on the structure of said journals, especially as far as the need for establishing dialogue with society is concerned. Student organizations' failure to adhere to editorial projects may be interpreted as a critical stance before the model then in force.

TI  - Prediction of Categorized Sea Ice Concentration From Sentinel-1 SAR Images Based on a Fully Convolutional Network
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The consistent and long-term spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) missions such as Sentinel-1 (S-1) provide high-quality dual-polarized $C$-band images particularly suited to sea ice monitoring. SAR data are currently the primary source of information for sea ice charting made by human ice experts as a result of its integration with multiple information sources at different scales (mainly radiometers). The rise of deep learning now opens the prospect of automatic sea ice mapping. In this article, we investigate the potential of a fully convolutional network (FCN) for the automatic estimation of sea ice concentration (SIC). With input data down-sampled at 200 m and an FCN architecture (depth and receptive field) duly parameterized, our approach is to mimic the work of an analyst who considers general context and does not necessarily use the highest possible resolution but speckle-noise polluted data. A comprehensive database is generated with 1320 dual-polarized S-1 scenes collocated with ice charts produced by MET Norway. A dedicated attention is paid to seasonal representativeness to ensure the adequate performance for all sea ice types. Even if the FCN output is modeled as a categorical problem, the proposed architecture accounts for the semantic distances between SIC classes by introducing an auxiliary loss. A comparative benchmark with Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSISAF) and MET Norway SIC products is carried out, showing an overall accuracy of 78.2% for our 6-class classification approach. The FCN model is shown to be evenly robust to sea ice seasonal variability and incidence angle.

AB  - The present study is focused on investigating the capabilities of the combined use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) Sentinel-1 (S1) and optical Sentinel-2 (S2) for burn severity mapping. For this purpose, a fire that occurred in August 2018 in southern Portugal was analyzed. The composite burn index (CBI) was used to visually classify geo-referenced photographs in the field and create the training data for image classification. A supervised classification was carried out using the machine learning random forests (RF) algorithm, on which the optimization of the parameters setting was carried out through an exhaustive grid search approach. In order to assess the advantages of combining optical and SAR data, and the importance of each band, the approach was tested separately on three data combinations (S1, S2 and S1 + S2) and feature importance was computed to evaluate the contribution of each input layer. The multi-class F-score, used to assess the accuracy of the map, reached a value of 0.844 when both the datasets were combined (S1 + S2), compared with the values 0.514 and 0.805 achieved by only SAR (S1) and only optical (S2), respectively.

AB  - This work aims at developing a solution to aid concrete dam inspections using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery and DCNN-based (deep convolutional neural network) object detection. This paper introduces materials used to create the Sentinel dataset, which is a heterogeneous dataset that contains 304 images on the training set and 316 images on the test set from a roller-compacted concrete water dam, with a Creager profile spillway, with annotation of three different types of objects: unwanted objects, harmless objects, and structural damage. This work proposes the use of the Faster R-RCNN and the Single Shot Multibox Detector, which are two deep convolutional neural networks for object detection with singular architectures, to identify nonconformity during an automatic dam inspection system, and analyzes the robustness of both networks considering the accuracy, true positive rate, true negative rate, precision, and F1 metrics. Using the Sentinel dataset, the best result yielded a Faster R-RCNN model with accuracy and an F1 score of 88.9%, which shows the viability of using the proposed solution in an operational environment.

TI  - Evaluation of ocean chlorophyll-<i>a</i> remote sensing algorithms using <i>in situ</i> fluorescence data in Southern Brazilian Coastal Waters
T2  - OCEAN AND COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - A performance evaluation of ocean color chlorophyll-a algorithms was conducted based on the in situ fluorescence chlorophyll concentration (F-chl) measured by a sensor on the buoy SiMCosta-SC01 in coastal waters of South Brazil. The operational algorithms are used in MODIS and VIIRS sensors to derive satellite chlorophyll concentration (C-sat). F-chl values were successfully corrected for nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) by an interpolation of sunrise and sunset daily measurements. A laboratory-derived calibration coefficient was applied to convert the unquenching F-chl values into chlorophyll concentration (C-flu). Overall, linear regression analysis between C-flu and C-sat for both sensors showed good results, with the coefficient of determination (R-2) varying between 0.88 and 0.96, slopes between 0.92 and 1.02 and intercepts between -0.17 and 0.13. The MODIS algorithm (R-2 = 0.96, slope = 1.02, RMSE = 0.16 mg m(-3), BIAS = 0.16 mg m(-3), for N = 222 and time interval +/- 1 h) presented slightly better performance than VIIRS (R-2 = 0.92, slope = 0.96, RMSE = 0.25 mg m-3, BIAS = -0.25 mg m(-3), for N = 284 and time interval +/- 1 h). These results represent the most comprehensive satellite data analysis for this region, suggesting that the approach may be applicable to other SiMCosta buoys.

TI  - SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELING IN FOREST PLANNING OF ANNUAL PRODUCTION UNITS IN THE SOUTHWEST AMAZONIA
T2  - REVISTA ARVORE
M3  - Article
AB  - - The generally limited resources for forest management and the growing need of forest production regulation requires the optimization of planning approaches for the spatialization of annual production units (APU). An APU planning methodology for forest species of high wood value (Amburana acreana (Ducke) ACSm., Apuleia leiocarpa (Vogel) JF Macbr. and Castilla ulei Warb.) in management area was proposed, using prediction of potential distribution of these species with data from the occurrence of a census forest inventory. It was used sample inventory data simulated in three sampling systems (random, conglomerate systematic, and systematic) and sample intensities (0.5% and 0.8%). As predictive variables, it was used the altitude, vertical distance to the nearest drain, individual bands of the TM sensor on board the Landsat 5, and vegetation index by normalized difference. Eighteen models were obtained, six per species. The test area under the curve (AUC) of the models ranged from 0.517 to 0.804. For all species, the best predictive model was considered the conglomerate system with a sample intensity of 0.8%. Altitude was the predictor variable that most contributed to the models. The AUC values for the Amburana acreana models were significantly different from Apuleia leiocarpa and Castilla ulei (p = 0.0138). For species of lower density, it is recommended greater sampling intensity and sampling systems that provide better spatialization of occurrence records. The use of data from sampling forest inventories in different sampling systems is capable of predicting environmental suitability for forest species and helps to define APUs. Thus, it is possible to strenghten the exploration strategies and management planning of management areas and to contribute to the perpetuation of the activity in the unequal forests of the Amazon region.

AB  - This study presents an image database and a convolutional neural network for the segmentation of land use in agriculture, forest and pasture classes. LANDSAT-8/OLI images from an area of the Brazilian Amazon region were used. The reference data were extracted from the results of the TerraClass project in 2014. The image database was generated in two versions: the first with six bands and the second with three bands. Each version of the data set has 4,000 images and size 400x400 pixels. Each image was generated using the mosaic technique. Each mosaic image is created from small agricultural, forest and grassland patches that are extracted from satellite images. The mosaic image is created with almost the same amount of agriculture, forest and pasture patches. The convolutional neural network architecture was evaluated together with three optimization methods: SGDM, ADAM and RMSProp and the dropout and L2 regularization for generalization improvement. The best model, CNN + optimization method + technique for generalization improvement, evaluated on the validation set, was used to segment some regions of the Amazon. The best results were obtained using the ADAM optimization method and L-2 regularization. The accuracy values obtained for the evaluated images were above 94%.

AB  - The study presents comparisons between blood group frequencies beyond ABO and Rh blood systems in Native American populations and previously published data from Brazilian blood donors. The frequencies of Diego (c.2561C>T, rs2285644), Kell (c.578C>T, rs8176058), Duffy (c.125A>G, rs12075, c.1-67T>C, rs2814778) and Kidd (c.838A>G, rs1058396) variants in Kaingang (n=72) and Guarani (n=234) populations from Brazil (1990-2000) were obtained and compared with data from these populations sampled during the 1960s and with individuals of different Brazilian regions. Data showed high frequencies of DI*01 and FY*01 alleles: 11.8% and 57.6% in Kaingang and 6.8% and 75.7% in Guarani groups, respectively. The main results indicated: (1) reduction in genetic distance over time of Kaingang and Guarani in relation to other Brazilian populations is suggestive of ongoing admixture; (2) significant differences in some frequencies of blood group markers (especially Diego, Kidd and Duffy) in relation to Native Americans and individuals from different geographical regions of Brazil. Our study shows that the frequency of red blood cell polymorphisms in two Native American groups is very different from that of blood donors, when we evaluated blood groups different from ABO and Rh systems, suggesting that a better ethnic characterization of blood unit receptors is necessary.

T2  - URBE-REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE GESTAO URBANA
M3  - Article
AB  - Cities experience the extensive urban heat island effect (UHI), which continue to pose challenges for humanity's increasingly urban population, where tropical cities have experienced a continued and rapid urbanization process in the past few decades. We present the evolution of surface UHI and its controlling factors in the Metropolitan Region of Belem, over the last 16 years (2003-2018), which has experienced unique consolidated economic growth and urban transformation under wet equatorial climate. We incorporate MODIS and Landsat satellite data and evaluate statistical techniques for estimates the variation in the land surface temperature (LST) during two seasons: wet season and dry season. Our result revealed that the regions of fast urbanization resulted in a decrease of normalized difference vegetation index and increase of LST. In addition, annual maps showed the spatial pattern of surface UHI intensities were produced based on daytime and nighttime temperature, and the analysis result indicated that the spatial distribution of high heat capacity was closely related with the densely built-up areas. These findings are helpful for understanding the urbanization process as well as urban ecology, which both have significant implications for urban planning and minimize the potential environmental impacts of urbanization in Metropolitan Region of Belem.

TI  - DETECTION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF FOREST FIRE USING SENTINEL-1 CROSS-RATIO TIME SERIES DECOMPOSITION APPROACH. PRELIMINARY RESULTS ABOUT THE SUSA FIRE OF AUTUMN 2017
T2  - PLANET CARE FROM SPACE
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Forest Fire detection and monitoring is a key concept for addressing post-fire management decisions. Many approaches based on multitemporal analysis of optical-retrieved vegetation index time series were successfully applied to describe forest disturbances like forest fires; conversely, only few works make use of multitemporal Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. The European Sentinel-1 mission can provide SAR data with high temporal resolution making possible to improve vegetation monitoring. In this work, a multitemporal approach was used, based on Sentinel-1 cross-ratio polarimetric index time series directly calculated on Google Earth Engine platform, to detect forest burned areas and characterize their ecological response in the period 2015-2019. Some statistical-based approaches were applied on very small, but reliable, areas producing promising results that are expected to better focus future researches in forest fire severity characterization.

AB  - Extreme precipitation events, such as violent rainfall and hail storms, routinely ravage economies and livelihoods around the developing world. Climate change further aggravates this issue (Gupta et al. 2020). Data-driven deep learning approaches could widen the access to accurate multi-day forecasts, to mitigate against such events. However, there is currently no benchmark dataset dedicated to the study of global precipitation forecasts. In this paper, we introduce RainBench, a new multi-modal benchmark dataset for data-driven precipitation forecasting. It includes simulated satellite data, a selection of relevant meteorological data from the ERAS reanalysis product, and IMERG precipitation data. We also release PyRain, a library to process large precipitation datasets efficiently. We present an extensive analysis of our novel dataset and establish baseline results for two benchmark medium-range precipitation forecasting tasks. Finally, we discuss existing data-driven weather forecasting methodologies and suggest future research avenues.

TI  - Mapping Seasonal Agricultural Land Use Types Using Deep Learning on Sentinel-2 Image Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The size and location of agricultural fields that are in active use and the type of use during the growing season are among the vital information that is needed for the careful planning and forecasting of agricultural production at national and regional scales. In areas where such data are not readily available, an independent seasonal monitoring method is needed. Remote sensing is a widely used tool to map land use types, although there are some limitations that can partly be circumvented by using, among others, multiple observations, careful feature selection and appropriate analysis methods. Here, we used Sentinel-2 satellite image time series (SITS) over the land area of Norway to map three agricultural land use classes: cereal crops, fodder crops (grass) and unused areas. The Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and two variants of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), are implemented on SITS data of four different temporal resolutions. These enabled us to compare twelve model-dataset combinations to identify the model-dataset combination that results in the most accurate predictions. The CNN is implemented in the spectral and temporal dimensions instead of the conventional spatial dimension. Rather than using existing deep learning architectures, an autotuning procedure is implemented so that the model hyperparameters are empirically optimized during the training. The results obtained on held-out test data show that up to 94 % overall accuracy and 90% Cohen's Kappa can be obtained when the 2D CNN is applied on the SITS data with a temporal resolution of 7 days. This is closely followed by the 1D CNN on the same dataset. However, the latter performs better than the former in predicting data outside the training set. It is further observed that cereal is predicted with the highest accuracy, followed by grass. Predicting the unused areas has been found to be difficult as there is no distinct surface condition that is common for all unused areas.

TI  - Crisis of the Early Modern Period, Caravaggism, and the Rise of Gallery Painting
T2  - ARS ADRIATICA
M3  - Article
AB  - In this essay, the emergence of Caravaggist naturalism has been analyzed at the intersection of two historical configurations. The first was a macro-process, an epochal crisis that the Reformation brought with it. The Reformation turn caused a comprehensive crisis of legitimacy that manifested itself in all spheres of life in Western culture: from religion to politics and to the status of images. The most important element of this early modern paradigm was the gradual formation of a new episteme (or system of knowledge organization) that can be defined as postclassical or modern. The classical episteme implied a fixed, stable, and static relationship between images, i.e. phenomena and words, i.e. discourse. The modern episteme was the moment of disintegration of this static worldview, when the organic connection between things and words, the visible and the sayable, came into danger and even a complete discrepancy. The second process took place on the micro-level and was related to the social structuring of Rome at the end of the 16th century, when there was an obvious gap between the "official" policy of the Church and the taste of high aristocratic circles; from this structuring arose the difference between the "official" art of the Counter-Reformation (which nurtured the aesthetics of the altarpiece) and the "unofficial" art, intended for the art market and consumption in a semi-private or completely profane social setting. The once unquestionable space of religion was thus split into the "micro-spaces" of politics and art, with their own special systems of legitimization.

AB  - The National Medical Research Center for Endocrinology (NMRCE) received the right to implement the development program of the World -class Research Centre"The National Center for personalized medicine of endocrine diseases"(NMCPMED). The objective of the NMCPMED will be not only the creation of a system of personalized treatment, but also the training of new specialists for medicine.Fundamental researches, carried out on the basis of the already existing institutes and laboratories of the NMRCE will be expanded by creating new laboratories of the NCPMED created de novo in accordance with the approved project.This article introduces the reader to the most important laboratories that would be created in NCPMED. These are laboratories of general, molecular and population genetics, bioinformatics, pharmacogenomics, microbiota, genome editing, mathematical and digital technologies, non-invasive technologies for the diagnosis of endocrinopathies, cellular technologies, artificial intelligence and a fundamentally new laboratory of metabolic visualization and radioteranostics.The authors hope that readers of one of the main journals for endocrinologists in our country will actively participate in the implementation of NMRCE, as both young and experienced talented researchers will have a chance to be a part of the Centre. To realize the ambitious implementation plans for the achievements of the Centre, it is necessary to radically change the worldview of the doctors in our country, to train them in a new way, and to expand the structure of the Center's team by increasing the number of specialists in medical genetics, transcriptomics, biostatistics and bioinformatics, working at the intersection of experimental and clinical endocrinology, and ensuring the transit of innovative technologies into clinical practice.New laboratories of the World-Class Research Center, will become the place of routine work of a new generation of doctors, who possess not only the basics of clinical work, but also the skills of fundamental researches that will allow them to significantly improve the methods of diagnosis and treatment.

CP  - 48th IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference (PVSC)

AB  - We evaluate the viability of using onsite ambient temperature and performance ratio to determine snowfall on PV systems - both day counts and energy loss due to snow. We find results to be more accurate than legacy methods that rely on snow depth measurements from nearby meteorological stations or satellite data. Meteorological stations are at varying elevations and distances from each plant, and in fact they do not account for shedding of snow from the panels depending on the glass surface properties and the PV system's tilt. This leads to inconsistent results when relying on these measurements. By comparing against actual images of the PV arrays at each plant we conclude that our method's accuracy is as high as 98% for plants where we had a full year of data representing all season. We also find that actual snow accumulation on PV arrays is more accurately captured by our proposed method using ambient temperature and performance ratio rather than using external source of snow depth data.

TI  - Narcissistic Personality Features and Social Trust: The Mediating Roles of the Dangerous and Competitive Social Worldviews
T2  - PSIHOLOGIJSKE TEME
M3  - Article
AB  - Narcissism has been shown to be associated with a lack of trust in others, but little is known about the factors that may play a role in the tendency for narcissistic individuals to mistrust others. The present research examined whether the associations that specific narcissistic personality features had with social trust were mediated by social worldviews. A large study of Iranian community members (N = 3,446; mean age of 34.28 years) revealed that the antagonistic and neurotic aspects of narcissism had negative indirect associations with social trust through the competitive social worldview, whereas the extraverted aspect of narcissism had a positive indirect association with social trust through the competitive social worldview. In addition, the extraverted and neurotic aspects of narcissism had positive indirect associations with social trust through the dangerous social worldview. These results suggest that the extraverted, antagonistic, and neurotic aspects of narcissism diverged in their associations with social trust and that the dangerous and competitive social worldviews played important roles in these associations. Discussion will focus on the implications of these results for understanding the roles that social worldviews play in the connections between narcissism and social trust.

M3  - Data study
AB  - We developed a method using Landsat satellite images combined with a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) design, and applied this to an arid rural landscape, the Baviaanskloof in South Africa. Since 1990, various restoration projects have been implemented to halt and reverse degradation. We applied the BACI approach at pixel-level comparing the conditions of each intervened pixel (impact) with 20 similar control pixels. By evaluating the conditions before and after the restoration intervention, we assessed the effectiveness of long-term restoration interventions distinguishing their impact from environmental temporal changes. The BACI approach was implemented with Landsat images that cover a 30-year period at a spatial resolution of 30 meter. We evaluated the impact of three interventions (revegetation, livestock exclusion, and the combination of both) on three ecosystem services; forage provision, erosion prevention, and presence of iconic vegetation.

AB  - The poetry collection Trilce (1922), characterized by its vanguardism, innovated through transgressions of the traditional, propitious by irrational meanings and unusual formalities. From there, literature has developed exponentially and literary exegesis has obtained theoretical proposals that guarantee the quality of its discursive interpretations. In this regard, I have made a bibliographic classification of the frequent topics of the state of the matter. I opt for semantic analysis, along with hermeneutics and theory consolidated in the text. The purpose of this article is to corroborate the diverse postulates around this literary work, for the construction of thematic aspects that allow to configure the poet's worldview.

TI  - Dynamic spatio-temporal of the aerial biomass in high Andean grasslands based on NDVI-MODIS validated by spectrometry in situ
T2  - REVISTA DE INVESTIGACIONES VETERINARIAS DEL PERU
M3  - Article
AB  - Moderate resolution imagery (MODIS) data from the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) can be used to estimate aboveground biomass at large spatial scales; however, validation of the information with fieldwork is required to make more accurate grassland vegetation predictions. The study was conducted in three districts of the central highlands of Peru. In total, 153 grass samples (high grassland and low grassland) were collected after reading NDVI in situ within a pixel of 250x250 m, with a frequency of three months during a three year period. Satellite images were downloaded from the MODIS sensor to obtain the NDVI. The NDVI-MODIS values were calibrated with the NDVI registered in situ, using regression models. The calibrated equations modelled the dynamic trends of vegetation between 2000 and 2018 for the central highlands. The NDVI in situ of the low grassland ranged between 0.36 +/- 0.13 and 0.24 +/- 0.05 in the wet and dry seasons, respectively, while the high grassland ranged between 0.42 +/- 0.14 and 0.26 +/- 0.10 in the wet and dry seasons, respectively. The NDVI of the MODIS sensor for the low grassland ranged between 0.41 +/- 0.14 and 0.27 +/- 0.06 in the wet and dry seasons, respectively, and for the high grassland between 0.44 +/- 0.14 and 0.41 +/- 0.10 in the wet and dry seasons, respectively. The quadratic model obtained better estimators both for the NDVI calibration (RMSE: 0.06 and R2: 0.91) and for the biomass prediction (RMSE: 1300 and R2: 0.61). It is concluded that it is possible to use satellite information to evaluate the high Andean grasslands.

TI  - A DROP-IN Gamma Probe for Robot-assisted Radioguided Surgery of Lymph Nodes During Radical Prostatectomy
T2  - EUROPEAN UROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The DROP-IN gamma probe was introduced to overcome the restricted manoeuvrability of traditional laparoscopic gamma probes. Through enhanced manoeuvrability and surgical autonomy, the DROP-IN promotes the implementation of radioguided surgery in the robotic setting.Objective: To confirm the utility and safety profile of the DROP-IN gamma probe and to perform a comparison with the traditional laparoscopic gamma probe and fluorescence guidance.Design, setting, and participants: Twenty-five prostate cancer patients were scheduled for a robot-assisted sentinel lymph node (SN) procedure, extended pelvic lymph node dissection, and prostatectomy at a single European centre.Surgical procedure: After intraprostatic injection of indocyanine green (ICG)-Tc-99m-nanocolloid (n = 12) or Tc-99m-nanocolloid + ICG (n = 13), SN locations were defined using preoperative imaging. Surgical excision of SNs was performed under image guidance using the DROP-IN gamma probe, the traditional laparoscopic gamma probe, and fluorescence imaging.Measurements: Intraoperative SN detection was assessed for the different modalities and related to anatomical locations. Patient follow-up was included (a median of 18 mo).Results and limitations: Overall, 47 SNs were pursued in vivo by the DROP-IN gamma probe, of which 100% were identified. No adverse events related to its use were observed. In vivo fluorescence imaging identified 91% of these SNs. The laparoscopic gamma probe identified only 76% of these SNs, where the detection inaccuracies appeared to be related to specific anatomical regions.Conclusions: Owing to improved manoeuvrability, the DROP-IN probe yielded improved SN detection rates compared with the traditional gamma probe and fluorescence imaging. These findings underline that the DROP-IN technology provides a valuable tool for radioguided surgery in the robotic setting.Patient summary: Radioguided robot-assisted surgery with the novel DROP-IN gamma probe is feasible and safe. It enables more efficient intraoperative identification of sentinel lymph nodes than can be achieved with a traditional laparoscopic gamma probe. The use of the DROP-IN probe in combination with fluorescence imaging allows for a complementary optical confirmation of node localisations. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

TI  - Comparison of Digital Image Correlation Methods and the Impact of Noise in Geoscience Applications
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital image correlation (DIC) is a commonly-adopted technique in geoscience and natural hazard studies to measure the surface deformation of various geophysical phenomena. In the last decades, several different correlation functions have been developed. Additionally, some authors have proposed applying DIC to other image representations, such as image gradients or orientation. Many works have shown the reliability of specific methods, but they have been rarely compared. In particular, a formal analysis of the impact of different sources of noise is missing. Using synthetic images, we analysed 15 different combinations of correlation functions and image representations and we investigated their performances with respect to the presence of 13 noise sources. Besides, we evaluated the influence of the size of the correlation template. We conducted the analysis also on terrestrial photographs of the Planpincieux Glacier (Italy) and Sentinel 2B images of the Bodele Depression (Chad). We observed that frequency-based methods are in general less robust against noise, in particular against blurring and speckling, and they tend to underestimate the displacement value. Zero-mean normalised cross-correlation applied to image intensity showed high-quality results. However, it suffers variations of the shadow pattern. Finally, we developed an original similarity function (DOT) that proved to be quite resistant to every noise source.

AB  - As West Nile Virus (WNV) and St. Louis Encephalitis (SLE) become more prevalent across North America, there is an increased risk of fatal neuroinvasive cases. In order for public health officials to prepare for these cases and potentially intervene, the ability to forecast mosquito borne disease outbreaks is paramount. In practice, however, such vector borne diseases are notoriously difficult to predict due to their seemingly sporadic spatial and temporal outbreak patterns. Recent research has demonstrated that mosquito abundance is causally related to WNV/SLE prevalence, providing a practical starting point for developing mosquito-borne disease forecasting systems. When focusing on building mosquito population models, understanding the reproduction environment of Culex mosquitos (WNV and SLE's primary vectors) is key: they rely on warmth, water, and vegetation to reproduce. Previous work has shown that global-coverage multispectral imagery (MSI) (i.e., Landsat 8, Sentinel-2) is a valuable resource for characterizing vegetation health as a predictor of mosquito population, but it is limited in that it may not provide the spatial resolution necessary to distinguish between, e.g., a well-fertilized lawn (poor Culex habitat) and a stand of trees (good Culex habitat). The backscatter information collected by synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery provides opportunity to distinguish between broader categories of vegetation type, potentially helping to fill this gap. This research uses publicly available global-coverage MSI and SAR imagery (Landsat 8, Sentinel-2, and Sentinel-1) to explore if vegetation type, in tandem with vegetation health, improves our ability to forecast mosquito populations. Vegetation characterization is done over the Greater Toronto Area from 2014 to 2017, and we derive weekly time series from MSI, spectral indices, and SAR for this time period. We then quantify the strength of vegetation health and type as a predictor of Culex abundance.

M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - In the form of an interview, the author reveals the methods used by a prominent Russian sociologist to formulate a sociological worldview. The text intertwines biographical motives and constructs the "building" of sociology against the background of historical events of the last 50 years. The narrative focuses primarily on the transition from a historical and philosophical view of the world to a scientific sociological analysis with a special emphasis on an objective scientific approach to social reality. The author examines the emergence and transformation of the globalization theory, the modification of the meaning and content of the institute of higher education, the evolution of the social group of the intelligentsia (e.g., the theory of the "death of the intelligentsia"), the proliferation of globalization processes at the cellular level of Russian society and the formation of new meanings of Russian spaces using the example of the Near North, the impending decline in the potential of megacities and the increasing societal tendencies in favor of de-urbanization. Special attention is paid to the current state and prospects of the evolution of sociology in Russia and in the world.

T2  - PLANET CARE FROM SPACE
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Deep-seated gravitational slope deformations (DSGSDs) are slow-moving rock-mass movements that encompass entire valley flanks or hillslopes. An acceleration of slope movements leading to a potential catastrophic failure poses a threat to communities and monitoring of these slopes is important for early-warning and risk reduction. Therefore, we studied in detail DSGSDs and landslides in the inhabited areas of Pardu Valley in eastern-central Sardinia using integrated remote-sensing techniques, field mapping, and monitoring systems.Space-borne Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data using Sentinel-1 satellites identified downslope movement of up to 10 mm per year on Bruncu Pranedda DSGSD (Ulassai). To analyse the DSGSDs at local scale we used high-resolution digital elevation models acquired UAV (Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle), supported by structural and geomorphological field mapping surveys. This allowed to create a geological 3D models of the slope deformations.To better understand the kinematics and temporal evolution of deformation of the unstable slopes, a monitoring system, consisting of GNSS antenna, tiltmeter, and extensometer, has been installed along the DSGSDs near urban areas. A distribution of GNSS measurement points in the unstable area and adjacent stable areas has since 2021 provided periodic measurements of the deformation. With continuous acquisition, extensometers and tiltmeters have been recording changes in large block inclinations and movements over prominent fractures since 2021. Historical InSAR displacement rate and monitoring data support our model of rock slope deformation indicating large scale-toppling. Our 24/7 monitoring system could become an essential component of an early-warning system.

TI  - Monitoring of Drought in Central Yunnan, China Based on TVDI Model
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Central Yunnan, constantly in a state of water shortage, is a region of fragile ecological environment whose regional agricultural production and economic development are seriously restricted by drought, despite its relatively developed social economy and dense population. In order to study the drought situation in this area, Landsat TM\OLI remote sensing image data of the region in 2008, 2011, 2014, and 2017 was selected for the construction of the NDVI-LST characteristic space temperature vegetation drought index (TVDI) using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the land surface temperature (LST). The validity of TVDI was verified by Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and Potential Evapotranspiration (PET), and the TVDI calculation results were divided into 5 drought levels: wet, normal, moderately dry, dry and severe dry. It is shown that: (1) The TVDI values of different land use types have obvious changes and good applicability; (2) TVDI can effectively reflect the characteristics of drought and spatial-temporal changes in central Yunnan, and the severe drought is mostly distributed in the west and southwest; (3) In the past 10 years, the dynamics of drought in this area have changed significantly, mainly from drought to slight drought, and the overall drought has decreased with time. It is concluded that TVDI model accurately reflected the drought situation in central Yunnan and thus is an instructive tool for regional drought monitoring.

AB  - As for the information theory of Energy Internet, image signal processing and deep learning theory are important theories to support the information communication system of Energy Internet. The application of advanced remote sensing technology, such as radar, makes the theoretical system of Energy Internet improved. Power line safety is an important factor to be considered in the power transmission corridor, and radar technology can be used to effectively monitor it. This study proposes an interferometric inversion method of wide-area vegetation elevation range information, using radar satellite polarization data, by the simulation data of polarization interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolInSAR), firstly. There are three kinds of algorithms compared and analyzed, that is, Digital Elevation Model (DEM) difference algorithms, coherent amplitude inversion algorithm, and coherent amplitude and phase joint inversion algorithm. The actual ALOS 1-PALSAR telemetry data in Hechi has inverted the height of vegetation with coherent amplitude and phase joint inversion algorithm. The result is 16m of the average vegetation height, which is in line with the height grade of local pines and firs species. Then, the distance of ground object points and power line points range between poles and towers is measured by Light Detection and Ranging (Lidar) technology, to determine the distance between components in the power transmission corridor and external objects. This can identify the vegetation invasion. In conclusion, this study has guiding significance for the threat of vegetation in distant and close range. The methods can be used as an effective means to monitor the safety and stability of power lines. It can provide the basis for the operation optimization strategy of power transmission corridors.

T2  - SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Worldwide maps of lightning activity have been obtained from the ground-based World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) for 2007-2009. We have compiled these maps separately for different seasons and UT periods, using WWLLN data on the time and coordinates of each of the recorded lightning. The total number of flashes of lightning in WWLLN data is by an order of magnitude smaller than in satellite data from Optical Transient Detector and the Lightning Imaging Sensor satellites. However, the key features of the spatial distribution and seasonal trends coincide well. The main difference observed is the absence of diurnal variation (similar to Carnegie curve) in WWLLN data against the satellite one. This concerns the global lightning number as well as its density in major thunderstorm regions. The solar local time dependence is also weak in WWLLN data. We show that in 2007-2009 the mean latitude of lightning observation is shifted to the summer hemisphere up to 10 degrees from the annual mean value. From the beginning of 2007 to the end of 2009, the global monthly average number of flashes of lightning increased threefold. We attribute this fact primarily to improved processing techniques in WWLLN. The constructed maps are necessary for numerical simulation of the Global Electric Circuit.

TI  - A Threshold Method for Robust and Fast Estimation of Land-Surface Phenology Using Google Earth Engine
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud-based platforms are changing the way of analyzing remotely sensed data by providing high computational power and rapid access to massive volumes of data. Several types of studies use cloud-based platforms for global-scale analyses, but the number of land-surface phenology (LSP) studies that use cloud-based platforms is low. We analyzed the performance of the state-of-the-art LSP algorithms and propose a new threshold-based method that we implemented in Google Earth Engine (GEE). This new LSP method, called maximum separation (MS) method, applies a moving window that estimates the ratio of observations that exceed a given threshold before and after the central day. The start and end of the growing season are the days of the year when the difference between the ratios before and after the central day are minimal and maximal. The MODIS phenology metrics estimated with the MS method showed similar performances as traditional threshold methods when compared with ground estimations derived from the PhenoCam dataset, a network of digital cameras that provides near-surface remotely sensed observations of vegetation phenology. The main advantage of the MS method is that it can be directly applied to daily nonsmoothed time series without any additional preprocessing steps. The implementation of the proposed method in GEE allowed the processing of global phenological maps derived from MODIS. The distribution of code in GEE allows the reproducibility of results and the rapid processing of LSP metrics by the scientific community.

TI  - Dynamic changes in paediatric invasive pneumococcal disease after sequential switches of conjugate vaccine in Belgium: a national retrospective observational study
T2  - LANCET INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Ten-valent and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) have shown important benefits by decreasing invasive pneumococcal disease caused by vaccine serotypes. Belgium had an uncommon situation with sequential use of PCV7, PCV13, and PCV10 in the childhood vaccination programmes between 2007 and 2018. We aimed to analyse the changes in incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease and serotype distribution in children throughout this period.Methods Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were obtained from patients with invasive pneumococcal disease in Belgium between 2007 and 2018 by the national laboratory-based surveillance. Paediatric invasive pneumococcal disease incidence, serotype distribution, and antimicrobial susceptibility were analysed in periods during which PCV7 (2009-10), PCV13 (2013-14), both PCV13 and PCV10 (2015-16), and PCV10 (2017-18) were used. Incidence rates and trends were compared. Vaccination status was collected. For a subset of serotype 19A isolates, multilocus sequence type was identified.Findings After a decrease in PCV7 serotype invasive pneumococcal disease was observed during the PCV7 period, total paediatric invasive pneumococcal disease incidence significantly declined during the PCV13 period (-2.6% monthly, p<0.0001). During the PCV13-PCV10 period (2015-16), the lowest mean in paediatric invasive pneumococcal disease incidence was achieved, but the incidence increased again during the PCV10 period (2017-18), especially in children younger than 2 years (+1.7% monthly; p=0.028). This increase was mainly due to a significant rise in serotype 19A invasive pneumococcal disease incidence in the PCV10 period compared with the PCV13 period (p<0.0001), making serotype 19A the predominant serotype in paediatric invasive pneumococcal disease in the PCV10 period. Genetic diversity within the 2017-18 serotype 19A collection was seen, with two predominant clones, ST416 and ST994, that were infrequently observed before PCV10 introduction. In 2018, among children younger than 5 years with invasive pneumococcal disease who were correctly vaccinated, 37% (37 of 100) had PCV13 serotype invasive pneumococcal disease, all caused by serotype 19A and serotype 3.Interpretation After a significant decrease during the PCV13 period, paediatric invasive pneumococcal disease incidence increased again during the PCV10 period. This observation mainly resulted from a significant increase of serotype 19A cases. During the PCV10 period, dominant serotype 19A clones differed from those detected during previous vaccine periods. Whether changes in epidemiology resulted from the vaccine switch or also from natural evolution remains to be further elucidated. Copyright (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Urban surfaces analysis with remote sensing data for the evaluation of UHI mitigation scenarios
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Considering the new IPCC report and its recent suggestions, it is important to pay serious attention to the Urban Heat Island issue. In this study, satellite images acquired by the Worldview3 sensor (WV3) were processed to classify the different kinds of urban surface and to compute the albedo value for each surface. Then several UHI mitigation scenarios were analyzed, varying selectively the surface albedo by choosing solar reflective materials. Clay tile pitched roofs, dark roofs and parking areas were considered as "modifiable surfaces" and their albedo values were increased on the basis of the literature and of data made available by product manufacturers. For each proposed scenario, the reduction of intensity of the Urban Heat Island effect (ATD), the energy saving brought by lower absorption of air conditioning systems (Delta E) and the consequent cost savings were calculated. All the scenarios proved to be convenient and with a relatively fast return on investment. In particular, two scenarios involving the modification of several surfaces at the same time proved to be the most promising ones from the perspective of a public administration, with significant benefits on the well-being of the population, as well as with similar and relatively short payback periods.

AB  - Herein, we provide a broad variety of functions which are useful for handling, manipulating, and visualizing satellite-based remote sensing data. These operations range from mere data import and layer handling (eg subsetting), over Raster* typical data wrangling (eg crop, extend), to more sophisticated (pre-)processing tasks typically applied to satellite imagery (eg atmospheric and topographic correction). This functionality is complemented by a full access to the satellite layers' metadata at any stage and the documentation of performed actions in a separate log file. Currently available sensors include Landsat 4-5 (TM), 7 (ETM+), and 8 (OLI/TIRS Combined), and additional compatibility is ensured for the Landsat Global Land Survey data set.

TI  - Landslide susceptibility mapping using MT-InSAR and AHP enabled GIS-based multi-criteria decision analysis
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslide susceptibility maps (LSMs) are generally prepared by integrating multiple prominent thematic layers, including DEM derived products (elevation, slope, and aspect), and other parameters such as lithology, geomorphology, LULC, etc. These parameters can be assigned optimum weights using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method, followed by a GIS-based weighted overlay analysis. In recent years, multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MT-InSAR) techniques have been rigorously explored, for land deformation detection and monitoring, by extracting highly stable measurement pixels using tens of SAR acquisitions simultaneously. In this research work, a GIS-based multi-criteria decision analysis to prepare LSMs is proposed, with MT-InSAR derived displacement estimates used as a critical input parameter. An LSM is generated by processing 20 ERS-1/2 and Envisat ASAR images, acquired over similar to 120 sq. km wide river basin, located in Uttarakhand, India. The generated LSM is found to be congruent with the susceptible maps made available by the Geological Survey of India (GSI) under the National Landslide Susceptibility Mapping (NLSM) program. Preliminary results indicate that the majority of the unstable zones along the Alaknanda River are correctly identified. The approach is further implemented to generate an updated susceptibility map using 60 scenes of freely available Sentinel-1A dataset, followed by validation through actual field survey. This resulted in the generation of an updated susceptibility map, which helped in the identification of 44.5% new landslide susceptible zones (LSZs). Furthermore, the status of previously identified zones is also quantified. The performance of the proposed approach suggests its usability in generating and updating near-real-time LSMs.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

AB  - Unsupervised clustering is essential when in-hand information about crop phenological stages are not available. In addition, this technique assists in discriminating crop growth stages concerning the changes in the scattering mechanisms. Newly proposed parameter theta(FP) for full polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data is shown to be enhancing the target characterization capability over the existing parameter such as ff. Following this, the existing clustering technique by combinedly utilizing the Barakat degree of polarization and elements of the Kennaugh matrix along with scattering entropy HFP is effective over land cover classes. The clustering scheme is consisting of 12 zones where zones (Z1, Z2, Z3), (Z10, Z11, Z12), and (Z4, Z5, Z6, Z7, Z8, Z9) represent even, odd and multiple scattering types, respectively. In this study, we use the RADARSAT-2 FP SAR data from Jun to Nov 2019 acquired over the Indian test site of Vijayawada under the Joint Experiment for Crop Assessment and Monitoring (JECAM) initiative. The changes and shifts of the clusters are exciting according to the phenological development of rice fields. At the initial stage, dense clusters are evident in Z10, Z11, and Z12, while, during the advanced tillering stage, more data points are found in the Z3 zone. Following this, clusters in zone Z5, Z6, Z8 and Z9 are evident during the maturity stage.

TI  - Synergistic Use of TanDEM-X and Landsat-8 Data for Crop-Type Classification and Monitoring
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Classification of crop types using Earth Observation (EO) data is a challenging task. The challenge increases many folds when we have diverse crops within a resolution cell. In this regard, optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data provide complementary information to characterize a target. Therefore, we propose to leverage the synergy between multispectral and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data for crop classification. We aim to use the newly developed model-free three-component scattering power components to quantify changes in scattering mechanisms at different phenological stages. By incorporating interferometric coherence information, we consider the morphological characteristics of the crops that are not available with only polarimetric information. We also utilize the reflectance values from Landsat-8 spectral hands as complementary biochemical information of crops. The classification accuracy is enhanced by using these two pieces of information combined using a neural network-based architecture with an attention mechanism. We utilize the time series dual co-polarimetric (i.e., HH-VV) TanDEM-X SAR data and the multispectral Landsat-8 data acquired over an agricultural area in Seville, Spain. The use of the proposed attention mechanism for fusing SAR and optical data shows a significant improvement in classification accuracy by 6.0% to 9.0% as compared to the sole use of either the optical or SAR data. Besides, we also demonstrate that the utilization of single-pass interferometric coherence maps in the fusion framework enhances the overall classification accuracy by approximate to 3.0%. Therefore, the proposed synergistic approach will facilitate accurate and robust crop mapping with high-resolution EO data at larger scales.

TI  - Application of High-Resolution Remote-Sensing Data for Land Use Land Cover Mapping of University Campus.
T2  - TheScientificWorldJournal
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The study of Land Use Land Cover (LULC) is essential to understanding how land has been altered in recent years and what has caused the processes behind the change. This is significant for the future development of the area, particularly on the campus of the Universitas Padjadjaran Jatinangor. The purpose of this study was to apply remote-sensing techniques to map a university campus and vicinity by comparing the area of urban green space (UGS) and floor area ratios (FARs) of the campus in 2015 and 2017. Additionally, surface runoff analysis was also conducted. For our research, we used WorldView-2's high-resolution satellite imagery with a resolution of 0.46m in the Universitas Padjadjaran (Padjadjaran University, or Unpad) Jatinangor campus, Jawa Barat, Indonesia. Our approach was to interpret the imagery by running the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to distinguish UGS and FAR and using digital elevation model (DEM) interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data with hydrologic analysis to identify the direction of surface runoff. The results obtained are as follows: the UGS remained more extensive compared with FAR, but the difference decreased over time owing to infrastructure development. Surface runoff has tended to flow toward the southeast in direct relation to the slope configuration.

TI  - Building the bridge between Protected Needs and consumption corridors
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY-SCIENCE PRACTICE AND POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The concept of consumption corridors (CC) provides a fundament for developing sustainable consumption policies. It suggests to determine minima and maxima of consumption. Its implementation would lead to numerous policies covering a broad range of dimensions of consumption. To serve this purpose, the concept must proceed from a broad conceptualization of consumption that convincingly links a human-action lens and a natural-environment lens. The concept of CC is informed by the goal of ensuring quality of life for every human being living now and in the future. Accordingly, quality of life should be the criterion used to justify and determine corridors of consumption. This necessitates firmly linking consumption and a salutogenic definition of quality of life. This article explores how the theory of Protected Needs (PN), a quality-of-life-theory that has been specifically developed for the context of sustainability, contributes to advancing the concept of CC. In addition, drawing on the results of a Swiss survey, we show that embracing the existence of universal and incontestable human needs and endorsing the idea of limiting consumption might be part of the same worldview. The article concludes by identifying conceptual challenges to approach with a view to building a robust bridge from needs to lower and upper limits of consumption.

TI  - Processes in the Unsaturated Zone by Reliable Soil Water Content Estimation: Indications for Soil Water Management from a Sandy Soil Experimental Field in Central Italy
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable soil moisture data are essential for achieving sustainable water management. In this framework, the performance of devices to estimate the volumetric moisture content by means dielectric properties of soil/water system is of increasing interest. The present work evaluates the performance of the PR2/6 soil moisture profile probe with implications on the understanding of processes involving the unsaturated zone. The calibration at the laboratory scale and the validation in an experimental field in Central Italy highlight that although the shape of the moisture profile is the same, there are essential differences between soil moisture values obtained by the calibrated equation and those obtained by the manufacturer one. These differences are up to 10 percentage points for fine-grained soils containing iron oxides. Inaccurate estimates of soil moisture content do not help with understanding the soil water dynamic, especially after rainy periods. The sum of antecedent soil moisture conditions (the Antecedent Soil moisture Index (ASI)) and rainfall related to different stormflow can be used to define the threshold value above which the runoff significantly increases. Without an accurate calibration process, the ASI index is overestimated, thereby affecting the threshold evaluation. Further studies on other types of materials and in different climatic conditions are needed to implement an effective monitoring network useful to manage the soil water and to support the validation of remote sensing data and hydrological soil models.

AB  - The Daily and Annual PM2.5 Concentrations for the Contiguous United States, 1-km Grids, v1 (2000 - 2016) data set includes predictions of PM2.5 concentrations in grid cells at a resolution of 1 km for the years 2000 to 2016. A generalized additive model was used that accounted for geographic difference to ensemble daily predictions of three machine learning models: neural network, random forest, and gradient boosting. The three machine learners incorporated multiple predictors, including satellite data, meteorological variables, land-use variables, elevation, chemical transport model predictions, several reanalysis data sets, as well as other predictors. The annual predictions were calculated by averaging the daily predictions for each year in each grid cell. The ensembled model demonstrated better predictive performance than the individual machine learners with 10-fold cross-validated R-squared values of 0.86 for daily predictions and 0.89 for annual predictions.
