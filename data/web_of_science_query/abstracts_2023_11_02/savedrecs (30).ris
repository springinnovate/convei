TI  - Inpatient Cost of Stroke Care in Greece: Preliminary Results of the Web-Based "SUN4P" Registry.
T2  - Studies in health technology and informatics
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to calculate the average operational cost per sub-type of stroke patient and to investigate cost drivers (e.g. ALoS, NIHSS score, age) correlated to cost.METHODS: Direct medical costs (diagnostic imaging and clinical laboratory exams, overheads/bed cost, pharmaceuticals, ringers and other non-durables and inpatient rehabilitation) per patient were calculated from the providers' (hospitals') perspective. Resource use data derived from the "SUN4P" web-based registry and unit costs were retrieved from publically available sources and were assigned to resource use.RESULTS: The sample comprised 6,282 inpatient days of 750 patients (mean age: 75.5±13.3 years) admitted from July 2019 to July 2021, in nine public hospitals. Mean length of stay was 8.4±7.6 days and mean total operational cost was calculated to 1,239.4 (from which 45% and 35% related to diagnostic exams and overheads/bed cost respectively). Mean cost related to hemorrhagic stroke patients that were discharged alive was calculated significantly higher compared to mean cost related to ischemic stroke patients who didn't undertake thrombolysis and were also discharged alive from the hospital (2,155.2 vs. 945.2, p<0.001). Linear regression analysis revealed that length of stay was significantly correlated with cost (coefficient beta=232, 95% CI confidence interval = 220-243, p<0.001).CONCLUSIONS: These findings are in accordance with current evidence and should be thoroughly assessed to rationalize inpatient reimbursement rates in order to achieve improved value of care.

TI  - Evaluation of the Re-emergence Risk of Human African Trypanosomiasis in the Southwestern Burkina Faso, A Gold-Bearing Mutation Area
T2  - ACTA PARASITOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The boom in Burkina Faso's artisanal gold mining since 2007 has attracted populations from Cote d'Ivoire and Guinea, which are the West African countries most affected by human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) and therefore increases its risk of re-emergence. Our aim was to update the HAT data in Burkina Faso in the risk of the re-emergence context with the advent of artisanal gold mining. Methods The study was carried out in the southwestern Burkina Faso where entomological surveys were conducted using biconical traps in March 2017. Follow by an active medical survey in April 2017, which was targeted the gold panners in 7 villages closer to artisanal gold sites, using CATT, mini-anion exchange centrifugation technique, trypanolysis test (TL) and ELISA test to measure human/tsetse contacts. The buffy coat technique and the TL were also applied in pigs to check their reservoir role of human trypanosomes. Results Our results have shown no case of HAT among 958 individuals tested and all the 50 pigs were also negative, but the level of antibodies against tsetse saliva evidenced by ELISA revealed low human/tsetse contact. Moreover, gold panners practise agriculture and breeding in an infected tsetse area, which are increased the risk. Conclusion Our results illustrate that the risk of re-emergence is low. The passive surveillance system implemented in 2015 in southwestern Burkina Faso is needed to increase the sentinel sites to better cover this area by taking into account the gold mining. Finally, awareness-raising activities are needed among populations about HAT.

TI  - Secure VM Migration in Cloud: Multi-Criteria Perspective with Improved Optimization Model
T2  - WIRELESS PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Distributed computing has risen as a well-known worldview for facilitating an assortment of online applications and services. The present business distributed computing stages utilize a semi concentrated design, where cloud resources, such as servers and storage are hosted in a few large global data centers. Virtualization in computing is a creation of virtual (not real) of something such as hardware, software, platform or an operating system or storage, or a network device. Further, Virtual Machine (VM) technology has recently emerged as an essential building block for data centers and cluster systems, mainly due to its capabilities of isolating, consolidating, and migrating workload. Migration of VM seeks to improve the manageability, performance, and fault tolerance of systems. In a virtual cloud computing environment, a set of submitted tasks from different users are scheduled on a set of Virtual Machines (VMs), and load balancing has become a critical issue for achieving energy efficiency. Thus to solve this issue and to achieve a good load balance, a new improved optimization algorithm is introduced namely Dual Conditional Moth Flame Algorithm (DC-MFA) that takes into account of proposed multi-objective functions defining the multi-constraints like CPU utilization, energy consumption, security, make span, migration cost, and resource cost. The performance of the proposed model will be analyzed by determining migration cost, energy consumption, and response time, and security analysis as well.

TI  - <i>In situ</i> hyperspectral characteristics and the discriminative ability of remote sensing to coral species in the South China Sea
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge about the optical features of benthic objects is essential for quantifying spectral signatures, remote sensing-based mapping, and ecological monitoring in coral reefs. However, the spectral identification of benthic species and the accurate measurement of the in situ reflectance spectra of relevant research objects remain underexplored. An underwater radiation measuring system suitable for coral reef environments was specifically designed to obtain in situ reflectance spectra and match benthic photographs of various substrate targets. This instrument has the advantages of obtaining hyperspectral, dual-channel simultaneous measurements, and automatically adjusting the integration time according to the light intensity. Based on in situ hyperspectral datasets, the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used for exploring and discriminating spectral characteristics from three taxonomic ranks, which include typical substrates of six community groups, nine coral families, and six Acroporidae species. In situ full-resolution (1-nm) spectra provided the best discrimination ability with mean accuracies of 97.5%, 90.9%, and 91.6% for typical substrates, coral families, and coral species, respectively. The spectral abilities of remote sensors were assessed by applying the spectral response functions of three multispectral sensors (Landsat 8 OLI, Sentinel-2A, and World View-2) to the full-resolution spectra. Discrimination analyses of the simulated spectra demonstrated that the spectral separations of typical substrates might be apparent, with overall classification accuracies of 89.6%, 88.2%, and 90.4% for the Landsat 8 OLI, Sentinel-2A, and World View-2 sensors, respectively. The spectral separation for different corals, however, may not be effective when using multispectral sensors. The discrimination analyses of families and species produced overall classification accuracies of 67.1% and 69.6%, respectively, for the Landsat 8 OLI, 56.0% and 56.0% for the Sentinel-2A sensor, and 64.5% and 61.8% for the World View-2 sensor. In summary, this method has the potential for identifing substrate targets in communities and taxonomic coral groups by applying in situ hyperspectral datasets. Furthermore, multispectral satellite sensors are currently inadequate for spectrally separate corals, while spectral discrimination is possible and practical for different substrate targets with visual spectral differences.

TI  - Effect of Check Dam on Sediment Load Under Vegetation Restoration in the Hekou-Longmen Region of the Yellow River
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - With years of vegetation restoration and check dam construction on the Loess Plateau, the sediment load of the middle reaches of the Yellow River have decreased sharply; however, the effects of check dam on this decrease of sediment load with such extensive vegetation restoration remains unclear. In order to further clarify the effects of check dam on sediment load reduction under vegetation restoration, we calculated vegetation coverage and check dam index based on multi-source remote sensing data, and calculated sediment reduction rate caused by human activities by Mann-Kendall statistical test and double cumulative curve, then established regression equations incorporating the check dam index and the sediment reduction rate using data from different geomorphic regions with different vegetation coverages. The results showed that sediment load in the Hekou-Longmen region and its 17 tributaries decreased significantly every year, and the change in sediment load could be divided into 3 typical periods: the base period (P1), the period mainly impacted by check dam construction (P2) and the period with comprehensive impact of check dam construction and vegetation restoration (P3). Compared with sediment load of the tributaries during P1, the sediment load decreased by 60.96% during P2 and by 91.76% during P3. Compared with the contribution of human activities to the reduction in sediment load in P2, the contribution of human activities in P3 increased significantly, while that of precipitation decreased slightly. The sediment reduction effect of check dams is greater in basins with low vegetation coverage than in basins with high vegetation coverage. There are differences in sediment reduction effect of vegetation restorations in different geomorphic regions, and the effect of vegetation restoration alone have certain upper limits. Such as, the upper limit of sediment reduction rate of vegetation restoration for rivers flowing through the sandstorm region is 47.86%. Hence, only combined the construction of check dam with vegetation restoration can it achieve more significant sediment reduction benefit and control soil erosion more effectively.

AB  - Radiocolloides are essential for the detection of metastatic lymph nodes in breast cancer. In this study [Ga-67]Ga-phytate, as an long-lived alternative for [Tc-99m]Tc-radiocolloids was prepared. "Standard" labeling conditions for [Ga-67]Ga-phytate preparation (95-100 degrees C, 30 min, 0.5 mg phytic acid, aqueous solutions) has been adopted (radiochemical purity: > 98 +/- 2% ITLC, specific activity: 0.9-1.1 GBq/mmol). The complex is mainly cleared from the blood pool through the liver by hepatic system (> 90%) and a small percentage (< 7-8%) through the kidneys by renal excretion. Dosimetric simulations showed that the final radiopharmaceutical doses are safe for clinical administrations.

TI  - Assessing multi-year-drought vulnerability in dense Mediterranean-climate forests using water-balance-based indicators
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Water availability in mountain forests affects vegetation response to drought, which in turn changes evapotranspiration (ET). We investigated water-balance indicators based on precipitation (P) minus ET to assess Mediterranean-climate forest vulnerability to multi-year droughts. We used the drought-vulnerable dense mixed-conifer forests of California's Sierra Nevada, which includes 78 groves of giant sequoia as study area. With long-term Landsat-based ET data during 1985-2018, water-stress patterns at 30-m resolution during two historical droughts (1987-92 and 2012-15) were analyzed. Canopy moisture loss and tree mortality were used as indices of drought vulnerability. Using cumulative multi-year P-ET as an indicator, groves that were water stressed in 1987-92 were more vulnerable in California's unprecedented 2012-15 drought. Historical-minimum annual P-ET is an indicator of water stress, explaining 32% and 29% of the variances of canopy moisture loss and tree mortality, respectively. As an extreme test to explore potential vegetation response, we trained a deep-learning Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to project ET during hypothetical extended-drought scenarios. The LSTM model reasonably predicted ET with r(2) of 0.72 for the testing period. Annual P-ET using LSTM-based ET agreed (r(2) = 0.99) with that using ET values from Landsat. Historical water-stress-prone areas were projected to suffer larger ET decreases and to experience more-severe stress during a 12-yr drought scenario. Water stress is more severe in lower-elevation forests, versus mid-to-high areas that have higher precipitation and shorter growing season under current climate. Our study provides water-balance-based indicators to project drought vulnerability and assess effects of disturbance in forests in a warming climate.

TI  - Mapping rangeland ecosystems vulnerability to <i>Lantana camara</i> invasion in semi-arid savannahs in South Africa
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We mapped and modelled the potential areas vulnerable to Lantana camara (L. camara) invasion in semi-arid savannah ecosystems in the communal lands of Bushbuckridge and Kruger National Park, South Africa. Specifically, we modelled potentially vulnerable areas based on remotely sensed data and environmental variables. The Maximal Entropy (Maxent) algorithm was used to model the vulnerable area. The reliability of the modelled results was assessed using Skills Statistic (TSS), Area Under Curve (AUC) and Kappa statistics. According to the results, Bushbuckridge communal lands are more susceptible to L. camara invasions than Kruger National Park. The risk of L. camara invasion in the study site was modelled with high accuracy (AUC score of 0.95) using the best model (Model 7), which is a composite of all model variables (remote sensing and environmental variables). The spatial distribution maps derived from Maxent showed that L. camara was more likely to invade communal lands than protected areas. Using remotely sensed spectral indices as standalone model variables (Model 4) showed the lowest accuracy, with an AUC score of 0.85. Overall, model input variables such as elevation had a significant influence on the spatial distribution of L. camara in the study area.

TI  - Tracking hidden crisis in India's capital from space: implications of unsustainable groundwater use
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - National Capital Region (NCR, Delhi) in India is one of the fastest-growing metropolitan cities which is facing a severe water crisis due to increasing water demand. The over-extraction of groundwater, particularly from its unconsolidated alluvial deposits makes the region prone to subsidence. In this study, we investigated the effects of plummeting groundwater levels on land surface elevations in Delhi NCR using Sentinel-1 datasets acquired during the years 2014-2020. Our analysis reveals two distinct subsidence features in the study area with rates exceeding 11 cm/year in Kapashera-an urban village near IGI airport Delhi, and 3 cm/year in Faridabad throughout the study period. The subsidence in these two areas are accelerating and follows the depleting groundwater trend. The third region, Dwarka shows a shift from subsidence to uplift during the years which can be attributed to the strict government policies to regulate groundwater use and incentivizing rainwater harvesting. Further analysis using a classified risk map based on hazard risk and vulnerability approach highlights an approximate area of 100 square kilometers to be subjected to the highest risk level of ground movement, demanding urgent attention. The findings of this study are highly relevant for government agencies to formulate new policies against the over-exploitation of groundwater and to facilitate a sustainable and resilient groundwater management system in Delhi NCR.

TI  - Effects of urban greenspace and socioeconomic factors on air conditioner use: A multilevel analysis in Beijing, China
T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - High temperatures pose great threats to the health of urban populations. The use of air conditioners (AC) is an important adaptive means to reduce the morbidity and mortality of heat-related diseases. However, it remains unclear how exposure and sensitivity factors affect residents' AC use. This study aimed to answer this question through a case study in 78 residential areas in Beijing, China. We conducted over 7,000 structured interviews during June 20-August 5, 2017 to learn respondents' AC use, health conditions and socioeconomic status. We also used remote sensing data to obtain land surface temperature (LST) and proportion of greenspace in residential areas. We applied a multilevel logistic regression to assess the influences of these factors on probability of frequent AC use. The results showed mixed impacts from sensitivity factors on AC use. While respondents with chronic diseases were 14.7% more likely to use AC every day, probability of AC use decreased by 29.2% with the increase of age groups. Instead of economic cost, the main reason preventing respondents from using AC was "feeling uncomfortable" or consider it as "unhealthy". At the scale of residential area, results did not find significant impact of LST on AC use, while proportion of greenspace posed a negative impact on probability of using AC every day even when LST was considered.

TI  - Utilization of Landsat-8 (OLI) Image Data for Geological Mapping of the Neo-Proterozoic Basement Rocks in the Central Eastern Desert of Egypt
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article discusses in detail the ability of Landsat-8 remotely sensed data to recognize and map Neo-proterozoic basement rocks in the Igla area. The Igla area in the Central Eastern Desert of Egypt is covered by a variety of Neo-proterozoic rocks comprising three tectonostratigraphic assemblages: ophiolitic, island arc, and late-to-post-tectonic assemblages. Lithological and structural mapping was achieved using Landsat-8 image data analysis, field verification, and microscopic studies. Image enhancement techniques have been applied using correlation coefficient and optimum index factor for selecting the best false-color composite, principal component analysis (PCA), and band ratio images. Based on spectral signatures, the supervised classification provided useful information and substantially improved geological mapping. The spectral measurements of the rock samples from the study area were integrated with previously obtained data, and the improved and enhanced methods were used to yield good results. Principal component analysis (PCA) (PC4, PC1, and PC3) and band ratio (6/5, 4/3, and 2/1) and (4/2, 6/7, and 5/6) in RGB with supervised classification techniques have been proven to be the best for distinguishing between the different rock units. A comparison between the map in the current study and the published geologic maps of the Igla area and field verification indicates that the present mapping, identification, and discrimination of lithological units are more accurate and much better. Accordingly, we recommend the present processing enhancement using remote sensing techniques for geological studies in the Eastern Desert of Egypt and similar arid areas worldwide.

TI  - Crop diversity increases predator abundance but not predation on cereal leaf beetles in agricultural landscapes
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The indirect effect of seminatural habitats on pest suppression has been widely studied in agricultural landscapes. By contrast, the role of crop diversity on pest suppression by predators has seldom been explored, particularly using molecular gut-content analysis (MGCA). In addition, differences between early- and late-season effects of landscape complexity on pest control, crucial to ensure season-long control, have received little attention. During 2014 and 2015, we investigated the effect of agricultural landscape complexity and crop diversity on cereal leaf beetle (CLB, Oulema melanoplus) predation early in the season using sentinel egg cards and late in the season by assessing larval predation using MGCA. Early-season CLB egg predation and late-season abundance of Nabis americoferus and coccinellids in wheat fields were positively correlated with amount of woodland habitat in these landscapes. Contrary to our predictions, crop diversity had negative associations with the late-season frequency of larval predation and the abundance of N. americoferus. Predator diversity and the abundance of Hippodamia lady beetles had negative associations with CLB abundance, highlighting the significant contribution of some generalist predators to CLB suppression. Our results suggest that the proportion of woodland and a few major crops (e.g., canola and non-cereal crops), rather than crop diversity, are associated with higher predation at different temporal scales. Overall, our results suggest that a habitat management strategy could be implemented to adjust the crop rotation regime to add the right kind of crop diversity in the landscape to support the natural control of CLB.

TI  - Investigating the response of the Botswana High to El Nino Southern Oscillation using a variable resolution global climate model
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Botswana High is an important component of the regional atmospheric circulation during austral spring, summer and autumn. While the high tends to be stronger during El Nino and weaker during La Nina, its direct response to El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) remains unknown. To that end, a variable resolution global climate model (Model Prediction Across Scales version 7, hereafter MPAS) is applied with relatively high resolution (48-km grid spacing) over Southern Africa and a coarser resolution (240-km grid spacing) over the rest of the globe for the study period 1980-2010. The first model experiment uses observed sea surface temperatures (SSTs) everywhere during the study period, while the second experiment uses observed SSTs everywhere except over the Pacific Ocean, where monthly climatological SSTs are imposed. The model results were validated against satellite data (Global Precipitation Climatology Project, GPCP) and reanalysis datasets (Climate Forecast System Reanalysis, CFSR; European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts version 5, ERA5). The results of the study show that the MPAS model gives a credible simulation of the temporal variability of the Botswana High, the seasonal rainfall and 500-hPa geopotential heights over Southern Africa. In the absence of ENSO forcing, the amplitude of the Botswana High variability reduces but the signal of the variability remains. Hence, this study shows that ENSO enhances the strength of the Botswana High but does not aid in the formation of the high.

TI  - Relative Shannon's Entropy Approach for Quantifying Urban Growth Using Remote Sensing and GIS: A Case Study of Cuttack City, Odisha, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization is a developing process at the cost of the environment. Many fertile agricultural and forest land are concealed under the belt of urban growth. In this study, we integrate the statistical method (Relative Shannon's entropy) with remote sensing and GIS to quantify the urban growth pattern of Cuttack City of Odisha. Satellite images of Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper and Resourcesat-1 (IRS-P6) LISS-III were downloaded from USGS and Bhuvan sites of ISRO. The study area is clipped from images with AOI (area of interest) using masking tool and is classified using maximum likelihood classification tool of ArcGIS 10.3 software to prepare LULC (Land use/Land cover) map of the investigated area for the years 1990, 2000, 2010, 2018. The Cuttack City spreads over about 45.205 sq. Km. It has been observed that 46.75% growth of built-up has been made from 1990 to 2018. Similarly, vegetation cover and water bodies have been reduced by 35.71% and 68.60%, respectively, from 1990 to 2018. Relative Shannon's entropy method was used to quantify the pattern of urban growth of Cuttack City. The entire study area is classified into 37 zones to depict the growth pattern of every nook and corner of the city from 1990 to 2018.

TI  - How to estimate soil organic carbon stocks of agricultural fields? Perspectives using ex-ante evaluation
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks of agricultural fields has a range of important applications from development of sustainable management practices to monitoring carbon stocks. There are many estimation strategies with the potential for more reliable estimates of SOC stock and more efficient use of soil sampling and analysis resources, especially by leveraging readily available auxiliary information such as remote sensing. However, concrete guidance for strategy selection is lacking. This study narrows this gap with a comparison of strategies for estimating deep SOC stock (0-60 cm) in a prototypical field. Using high density SOC stock mea-surements and simulation, we built on past studies by 1) ex-ante evaluating a large number of strategy options, 2) using a Bayesian approach to quantify the uncertainty of the comparison, and 3) considering multiple Bayesian models to assess sensitivity to this modeling choice. We found that, using readily available auxiliary information, both balanced and stratified sampling offer substantial improvements over simple random sampling. The auxiliary information most important for this improvement is a Sentinel-2 SOC index = blue / (green x red), followed by the topographic wetness index. We found that these results are robust to the choice of mapping method, but that there is uncertainty in the magnitude of improvement. We recommend future studies imple-ment this Bayesian approach for simulated ex-ante evaluation of SOC stock estimation strategies across more fields to investigate the generalizability of these findings.

TI  - Dynamic variations of cyanobacterial blooms and their response to urban development and climate change in Lake Chaohu based on Landsat observations
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Recurring cyanobacterial blooms have seriously hindered the sustainable development of cities. In this study, the variation trend of cyanobacterial blooms was analyzed by taking Lake Chaohu in China as the study area, and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from Landsat observations combined with the development index of surrounding cities from 2009 to 2019 was used to quantitatively analyze the response of cyanobacterial blooms to urban development and climate change. The results showed that the NDVI of the Northwest Lake region was significantly higher than that of other regions. Summer and autumn were the main seasons for the outbreak of cyanobacterial blooms. The NDVI of Lake Chaohu and Baohe Lake region showed a significant correlation with the gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate of Hefei city (HF), the districts and counties around the lake (DCL), Baohe District (BH), and the population (P). As the economic regions gradually focused on BH rather than on HF and DCL, there was an increasing trend correlation between the NDVI of Baohe Lake region and the GDP growth rate. However, the elimination of GDP in BH did not affect the consistency relationship between the economic growth of other regions and the NDVI of Lake Chaohu on a large scale. In addition, the results of relative importance analysis indicated that the GDP growth rate of BH and the area of Hefei except DCL (HF-DCL) accounted for important contribution to the R-2 of the regression. This study has momentous reference value for understanding the coupling relationship between urban development and lake environment.

TI  - A unified model for high resolution mapping of global lake (> 1 ha) clarity using Landsat imagery data
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake clarity, usually measured by Secchi disc depth (SDD), is a reliable proxy of lakes trophic status due to its close link with total suspended matter, chlorophyll-a, and nutrients. Trained with in-situ measured SDD and match-up Landsat images, we established various regression models to estimate SDD for global lakes. We selected a unified model which demonstrated good spatiotemporal transferability, and has potential to map SDD in different years with good quality of Landsat top-of-atmosphere (TOA) images embedded in Google Earth Engine (GEE). The unified model was successfully calibrated (n = 3586 data points, R-2 = 0.84, MAPE = 29.8%) against SDD measured in 2235 lakes across the world, and the validation (n = 1779, R-2 = 0.76, MAPE = 38.8%) also exhibited stable performance. The unified model was tuned to historical SDD measurements coincident with different Landsat sensors (L5-TM, L7-ETM+, L8-OLI) launched over the past four decades (1984-2020), thus confirming its temporal stability. Global SDD was mapped using GEE with OLI TOA products mainly acquired in 2019 to examine the spatial variation of lake water clarity (lake surface area >= 1 ha) all over the world. Worldwide, lake water clarity averaged 3.13 +/- 1.71 m in 2019, but exhibited remarkable spatial variability due to catchment hydrological and landscape settings, lake morphology, elevation and anthropogenic impact. Inland waters in Europe (4.18 +/- 1.82 m) and North America (3.84 +/- 1.77 m) had the highest clarity due to greater water depth combined with less human disturbance in the high latitude regions. Lakes in South America (2.50 +/- 2.33 m), Asia (2.44 +/- 1.63 m) and Africa (2.36 +/- 0.72 m) displayed intermediate clarity. Lakes in Oceania (1.97 +/- 1.48 m) exhibited the lowest clarity for all continents except Antarctica. Further, we used the mapped SDD to evaluate water trophic status using the Carlson trophic state index. Our results indicate that, in 2019, about 63.6% of the lake areas and 47.8% of total lake numbers (2,219,627/4,646,056) were oligotrophic for global lakes, while about 23.6% areal percent and 37.1% of lake numbers are eutrophic mostly as a result of their being located in agricultural and urban-dominated drainage basins. This study, for the first time, provides water clarity information for lakes with area >= 1 ha all over the world with 30-m resolution and facilitates the understanding of the water clarity relevant to TSM (r = 0.95), Chl-a (r = 0.73), total phosphorus (r = 0.75), total nitrogen (r = 0.60), which could further provide water clarity data and technical support for trophic level evaluations as well. This unified model could serve as a powerful research tool for long-term monitoring of aquatic ecosystems and assessing their resilience to anthropogenic disturbance and climate change-related stressors.

TI  - In-Transit Metastasis of Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma With Lymphovascular Invasion in an Immunocompetent Patient
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In-transit metastases of melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers are metastases located in the skin or subcutaneous tissue between the primary tumor and the nearest nodal basin. Although rare, in-transit cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is an emerging diagnosis in immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients that may have significant implications on treatment and prognosis. Lymphovascular invasion is an uncommon high-risk feature of SCC. Here, we present a case of a 73-year-old non-immunosuppressed man with no previous history of skin cancer, found to have in-transit metastasis with lymphovascular invasion during Mohs surgery for a primary SCC of his right ear. Patients with intransit SCC should receive further staging imaging and a multimodal approach to treatment, including Mohs micrographic surgery, adjuvant radiation, and possibly sentinel lymph node biopsy and immunotherapy or chemotherapy.

TI  - INSAT-3D SST and its diurnal variability assessment using in-situ and MODIS observations
T2  - PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Review
AB  - Sea Surface Temperature is an Essential Climate Variable used in oceanographic and meteorological application studies such as air-sea interaction, ocean mixing, boundary layer processes, and ocean state forecast, which require high temporal resolution SST. Indian geostationary satellite INSAT-3D imager has been designed to provide such information at 30 min intervals, 4 km spatial resolution along with several other parameters over the North Indian Ocean. In this study, the 30-minute interval INSAT-3D SST and its diurnal variability are validated (inter-compared) with collocated in-situ buoy measurements and compared with contemporary MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer SST observations. A reasonable agreement exists between the INSAT-3D and in situ data with a correlation coefficient of 0.70 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.28 C. This relationship is better for the daytime observations and during the pre and post-monsoon seasons, while the relationship is relatively weaker for the nighttime and monsoon seasons with remarked imprints from convective processes in the upper oceans. For the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal regions, the INSAT-3D SST shows better correlation and negative bias in comparison with in situ observations, while it is weaker with positive bias for the Equatorial Indian Ocean. Inter-comparison with MODIS Aqua/Terra day and night passes SST also shows a similar relationship, however with a much-improved correlation coefficient (~0.95) and highly consistent in spatial and temporal variability with a cool bias of 0.14 C. INSAT-3D SST shows a significantly high average diurnal temperature difference of 2.24 C, whereas buoys show 0.54 C. These high RMSE and diurnal variability results suggest that INSAT-3D SST retrieval can be improved to study the many oceanographic processes such as eddies, fronts, and estimation of air-sea fluxes. Therefore, this study helps to improve the retrieval algorithm of INSAT-3D SST, by developing the region-specific regression coefficients along with data merging and assimilation techniques.

TI  - A Landsat-derived annual inland water clarity dataset of China between 1984 and 2018
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Water clarity serves as a sensitive tool for understanding the spatial pattern and historical trend in lakes' trophic status. Despite the wide availability of remotely sensed data, this metric has not been fully explored for long-term environmental monitoring. To this end, we utilized Landsat top-of-atmosphere reflectance products within Google Earth Engine in the period 1984-2018 to retrieve the average Secchi disk depth (SDD) for each lake in each year. Three SDD datasets were used for model calibration and validation from different field campaigns mainly conducted during 2004-2018. The red / blue band ratio algorithm was applied to map SDD for lakes (> 0.01 km(2)) based on the first SDD dataset, where R-2 = 0.79 and relative RMSE (rRMSE) = 61.9 %. The other two datasets were used to validate the temporal transferability of the SDD estimation model, which confirmed the stable performance of the model. The spatiotemporal dynamics of SDD were analyzed at the five lake regions and individual lake scales, and the average, changing trend, lake number and area, and spatial distribution of lake SDDs across China were presented. In 2018, we found the number of lakes with SDD <2 m accounted for the largest proportion (80.93 %) of the total lakes, but the total areas of lakes with SDD of <0.5 and >4 m were the largest, both accounting for about 24.00 % of the total lakes. During 1984-2018, lakes in the Tibetan-Qinghai Plateau region (TQR) had the clearest water with an average value of 3.32 +/- 0.38 m, while that in the northeastern region (NLR) exhibited the lowest SDD (mean 0.60 +/- 0.09 m). Among the 10 814 lakes with SDD results for more than 10 years, 55.42 % and 3.49 % of lakes experienced significant increasing and decreasing trends, respectively. At the five lake regions, except for the Inner Mongolia-Xinjiang region (MXR), more than half of the total lakes in every other region exhibited significant increasing trends. In the eastern region (ELR), NLR and Yungui Plateau region (YGR), almost more than 50 % of the lakes that displayed increase or decrease in SDD were mainly distributed in the area range of 0.01-1 km(2), whereas those in the TQR and MXR were primarily concentrated in large lakes (>10 km(2)). Spatially, lakes located in the plateau regions generally exhibited higher SDD than those situated in the flat plain regions. The dataset is freely available at the National Tibetan Plateau Data Center (https://doi.org/10.11888/Hydro.tpdc.271571, Tao et al., 2021).

TI  - Exploring cropping intensity dynamics by integrating crop phenology information using Bayesian networks
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The demand for agricultural products continues to increase while there is little room for cropland expansion. Agricultural intensification on existing croplands may provide a promising solution to increase agricultural production and alleviate the human-land conflict. To achieve this, the spatio-temporal dynamics of cropping intensity are essential information for agricultural production. However, existing methods are usually based on machine learning and are highly reliant on training samples. There are relatively few studies on automatic change detection of cropping intensity. In this study, a knowledge-based dynamic Bayesian network model for change analysis (DBN-CA) was developed for automatic detection of cropping intensity dynamics as well as the overall trends. Four statuses of cropping intensity dynamics were designed by referencing crop phenology to delineate the temporal dynamics of cropping intensity, and the overall trends from 2001 to 2019 were extracted based on their combinations. The conclusions were as follows: (1) the DBN-CA model based on crop phenology knowledge has a remarkable ability to effectively detect cropping intensity dynamics as well as its overall trends. (2) The cropping intensity in Hubei Province has shown a significant decreasing trend during the early 21st century.

TI  - Multi-temporal phenological indices derived from time series Sentinel-1 images to country-wide crop classification
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop classification is a crucial prerequisite for the collection of agricultural statistics, efficient crop management, biodiversity control, the design of agricultural policy, and food security. Crops are characterized by significant change during the growing season, and this information can be used to improve classification accuracy. However, capturing variation in vegetation cover requires a reliable source of valid data. Sentinel-1 radar images are a good candidate, as they supply information about Earth's surface every six days, independent of weather and light conditions. In this paper, we present a method for crop classification based on radar polarimetry. We propose a set of multi-temporal indices derived from time series Sentinel-1 images that aim to characterize crop phenology. A big data, object-oriented classification technique is developed and tested on 16 crop types for the whole of Poland. Our analysis found that overall accuracy varied (regionally) from 86.36 to 89.13% in 2019, and from 85.95 to 89.81% in 2020. Fl scores for individual crops varied from 0.73 to 0.99, and the use of our multi-temporal phenological indices increased Fl scores by about 0.14 compared to calculations using only basic parameters. Results obtained for the whole country demonstrate the efficacy of the method and its resistance to environmental conditions.

TI  - Near-real-time estimation of hourly open biomass burning emissions in China using multiple satellite retrievals
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Open biomass burning (OBB) is an important source of air pollutants and greenhouse gases, but its dynamic emission estimation remains challenging. Existing OBB emission datasets normally provide daily estimates based upon Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) retrievals but tend to underestimate the emissions due to the coarse spatial resolution and sparse observation frequency. In this study, we proposed a novel approach to improve OBB emission estimations by fusing multiple active fires detected by MODIS, Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (VIIRS S-NPP) and Himawari-8. The fusion of multiple active fires can capture the missing small fires and the large fires take place during the non-overpass time of MODIS observations. Also, regional-based fire radiative power (FRP) cycle reconstruction models and OBB emission coefficients were developed to address the large spatial discrepancies of OBB emission estimations across China and to promote the estimate to an hourly resolution. Using the new approach, hourly gridded OBB emissions in China were developed and can be updated with a lag of 1-day, or even near-real-time when real-time multiple active fires are available. OBB emissions in China based on this approach were more than 3 times of those in previous datasets. Evaluations revealed that the spatial distribution of the estimated PM2.5 emissions from this study was more consistent with the ambient PM2.5 concentrations during several episodes than existing datasets. The hourly OBB emissions provide new insight into its spatiotemporal variations, enhance timely and reliable air quality modeling and forecast, and support the formulation of accurate prevention and control policies of OBB.

TI  - Visual Saliency via Multiscale Analysis in Frequency Domain and Its Applications to Ship Detection in Optical Satellite Images
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NEUROROBOTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article proposes a bottom-up visual saliency model that uses the wavelet transform to conduct multiscale analysis and computation in the frequency domain. First, we compute the multiscale magnitude spectra by performing a wavelet transform to decompose the magnitude spectrum of the discrete cosine coefficients of an input image. Next, we obtain multiple saliency maps of different spatial scales through an inverse transformation from the frequency domain to the spatial domain, which utilizes the discrete cosine magnitude spectra after multiscale wavelet decomposition. Then, we employ an evaluation function to automatically select the two best multiscale saliency maps. A final saliency map is generated via an adaptive integration of the two selected multiscale saliency maps. The proposed model is fast, efficient, and can simultaneously detect salient regions or objects of different sizes. It outperforms state-of-the-art bottom-up saliency approaches in the experiments of psychophysical consistency, eye fixation prediction, and saliency detection for natural images. In addition, the proposed model is applied to automatic ship detection in optical satellite images. Ship detection tests on satellite data of visual optical spectrum not only demonstrate our saliency model's effectiveness in detecting small and large salient targets but also verify its robustness against various sea background disturbances.

TI  - Application of Sentinel-1 SAR Data for Detecting a Nuclear Test Location in North Korea
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-1 C-band radar data were applied for the first time to determine a nuclear test, its underground H-bomb explosion location and the affected zone in North Korea on September 3, 2017. The nuclear test location was found according to line-of-sight displacement images via its maximum value. In this research, three scenes of Sentinel-1B data acquired in descending orbits, one after and two before the event (the nuclear test date), were used to detect the nuclear test location. The nuclear test location was found northeast of the Punggye-ri nuclear test site (8 km) with the following geographic coordinates: 41 degrees 11 ' 1.85 '' N, 129 degrees 13 ' 28.86 '' E. It was revealed that only a pair of Sentinel-1B radar scenes from August 17 and September 10 have been successfully applied to detect nuclear test zones.

TI  - Determining satellite-based evapotranspiration product and identifying relationship with other observed data in Punjab, Pakistan
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration is an important hydrological parameter that takes place due to water bodies and many physical features (plants, soil) on earth. Punjab lies in the zone of Pakistan that is mostly affected by climate change. A decrease in rainfall and an increase in temperature and potential evapotranspiration (PET) tend toward a more disastrous situation particularly in the southern region of Punjab. MODIS satellite imagery (MOD16) and climatic data over the 16 and 23 years' time periods (1993-2016) were utilized in this study. Firstly for the estimation of the average spatial and temporal trend of rainfall patterns. Maximum of 2000 mm annual rainfall was estimated in 1997, while in 2016 about 1300 mm of annual rainfall was estimated. A declining trend of annual rainfall has been observed both in satellite imagery and observed data results from 1993 to 2016. Modified Penman-Monteith equation was used to estimate PET and moisture index. Thornthwaite Moisture Index was applied on different scales for moisture observation. It was estimated that from 1993 to 2016 the trend of PET increased while that of moisture content decreased in the study area. Results obtained from both datasets showed that southern Punjab having less amount of rainfall and a gradually increasing trend in potential evapotranspiration as compared to the northern part of the province Punjab.

TI  - Low RUFY3 expression level is associated with lymph node metastasis in older women with invasive breast cancer
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Sentinel lymph node biopsy is omitted in older women (>= 70 years old) with clinical lymph node (LN)-negative hormone receptor-positive breast cancer as it does not influence adjuvant treatment decision-making. However, older women are heterogeneous in frailty while the chance of recurrence increase with improving longevity. Therefore, a biomarker that identifies LN metastasis may facilitate treatment decision-making. RUFY3 is associated with cancer progression. We evaluated RUFY3 expression level as a biomarker for LN-positive breast cancer in older women. Methods Clinical and transcriptomic data of breast cancer patients were obtained from the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC, n = 1903) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, n = 1046) Pan-cancer study cohorts. Results A total of 510 (METABRIC) and 211 (TCGA) older women were identified. LN-positive breast cancer, which represented 51.4% (METABRIC) and 48.4% (TCGA), demonstrated worse disease-free, disease-specific, and overall survival. RUFY3 levels were significantly lower in LN-positive tumors regardless of age. The area under the curve for the receiver operator characteristic (AUC-ROC) curves showed RUFY3-predicted LN metastasis. Low RUFY3 enriched oxidative phosphorylation, DNA repair, MYC targets, unfolded protein response, and mtorc1 signaling gene sets, was associated with T helper type 1 cell infiltration, and with intratumor heterogeneity and fraction altered. Low RUFY3 expression was associated with LN-positive breast cancer and with worse disease-specific survival among older women. Conclusion Older women with breast cancers who had low expression level of RUFY3 were more frequently diagnosed with LN-positive tumors, which translated into worse prognosis.

TI  - Evaluating urban flood hazard index (UFHI) of Dehradun city using GIS and multi-criteria decision analysis
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban flooding is one of the major issues in Dehradun city. Lack of preparedness and lack of flood hazard zonation at city level resulted in increasing number of life losses every year. This research aims to evaluate urban flood hazard index (UFHI) and generate flood hazard zonation map, which can be used for prioritizing flood mitigation strategies and efficient allocation of resources in Dehradun city. UFHI is evaluated by linear combination of weighted overlay analysis of indicators using multiple criteria decision analysis. Here Satty's AHP matrix is used for determining the weightage of each indicator. These indicators are integrated in geographic information systems as layers, resulting in a composite index map. Remote sensing data from Landsat 8 OLI, 2015; DEM 2013 of CARTOSAT-I data, and Survey of India toposheets, are used for creating base layer of the city. Six indicators which include, elevation, slope, drainage density, land use/land cover (LULC) runoff, flood water depth, and distance from river stream, are used for evaluation. As a result of analysis, urban flood hazard zones are identified and classified into-very high risk with 10 wards (16.67%), high risk with 20 wards (30.33%), medium risk with 22 wards (36.67%) and low risk with 8 wards (13.33%); out of the total 60 wards (smallest administrative unit) in city. The study indicates that two parameters namely LULC runoff and proximity to river stream have a direct co-relation to high flood hazard zones in Dehradun city. As a further scope of research, a greater number of indicators and micro-level studies can be taken up for more accurate results.

TI  - Erosion risk assessment: A contribution for conservation priority area identification in the sub-basin of Lake Tana, north-western Ethiopia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion is a serious environmental problem arising from agricultural intensification and landscape changes. Improper land management coupled with intense rainfall has intricated the problem in most parts of the Ethiopian highlands. Soil loss costs a profound amount of the national GDP. Thus, quantifying soil loss and prioritizing areas for conservation is imperative for proper planning and resource conservation. Therefore, this study has modeled the mean soil loss and annual sediment yield of the Gumara watershed. Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 7ETM+, and Landsat 8 OLI were used for land use land cover (LULC) change analysis. Besides these, other datasets related to rainfall, digital soil map, Digital Elevation Model, reference land use, and cover (LULC) ground truth points were used to generate parameters for modeling soil loss. The watershed was classified into five major land-use classes (water body, cultivated land, grazing land, built-up and forest and plantation) using a maximum likelihood algorithm covering a period of the last 30 years (1988-2019). The mean annual soil loss and sediment yield were quantified using RUSLE, Sediment delivery ratio (SDR), and Sediment Yields models (SY). The analysis result unveils that within the past 30 years, the watershed has undergone significant LULC changes from forest & plantation (46.33%) and grazing land to cultivated land (31.59%) with the rate of -1.42km(2)yr(-1) and -2.80km(2)yr(-1) respectively. In the same vein, the built-up area has expanded to cultivated and grazing land. Subsequently, nearly 15% (207 km(2)) of the watershed suffered from moderate to very severe soil loss. On average, the watershed losses 24.2 t ha-(1) yr-(1) of soil and yields 2807.02 t ha-(1) yr-(1) sediment. Annually, the watershed losses 385,157 t ha-(1) yr-(1) soil from the whole study area. Among the admirative districts, Farta (Askuma, Giribi, Mahidere Mariam and Arigo kebeles), Fogera (Gazen Aridafofota and Gura Amba kebeles), East Este (Witimera kebele), and Dera (Gedame Eyesus and Deriana Wechit kebeles) districts which cover 50% of the watershed were found severely affected by soil erosion. Thus, to curve back this scenario, soil and water conservation practices should prioritize in the aforementioned districts of the watersheds.

TI  - Dynamic response of underreamed batter piles subjected to vertical vibration
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the dynamic vertical response of a vertical and two batter piles with an underreamed bulb. Batter angles (i.e. inclination to the vertical) of 10 and 20 degrees have been considered. The dynamic vertical tests were conducted using a mechanical oscillator-motor assembly by varying the intensity of exciting force level with a change in eccentricity setting of the oscillator. The dynamic response was recorded in terms of operating frequency and acceleration response. The test data were analysed to estimate the dynamic vertical responses of the piles in terms of resonant frequency, f(y)'; peak vertical displacement amplitude, d(y)' and axial strain epsilon(y), and they were compared. For all three piles, with an increase in intensity of exciting force level, the resonant frequency decreased, whereas the peak vertical displacement and axial strain increased.

TI  - Comparison between economic growth and satellite-based measurements of NO<sub>2</sub> pollution over northern Italy
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study is to investigate to what extent spatiotemporal fluctuations in the tropospheric NO2 column concentration can map variations in economic output. To do so satellite based tropospheric NO2 column mea-surements obtained from the ERS-2, ENVISAT, MetOp-A, and MetOp-B satellite missions covering the period from 1996 to 2017 over the Po valley in northern Italy is analyzed. A harmonic analysis is carried out in order to exclude influences such as the annual or semi-annual cycle. Afterwards the residues of the tropospheric NO2 time series are further investigated by means of a wavelet analysis method. The result is a spectrogram which implies the NO2 variability for the study area between 1996 and 2017. Therefore, the gross domestic product (GDP) is used as an indicator for economic performance and thus, as an approximation, of anthropogenically induced NO2 pollution. Clear conspicuous signatures occurred almost simultaneously both within the temporal development of the GDP growth rate and the spectral characteristic of the NO2 variability during the studied period. The comparison of the temporal course of the GDP shows that the period of systematically reduced spectral intensity in NO2 coincides strikingly well with the period of the global financial crisis in 2008 which was then followed by a second crisis in 2014. The economic growth decreased by 7.9% between 2007 and 2009 and by 5.2% between 2011 and 2014 in comparison to the same quarter of the previous year. It is found that during the crises (2007-2013) the variability of NO2 is reduced by about 80%.

TI  - Institutional implant and economic stagnation: a counterfactual study of Somalia
T2  - PUBLIC CHOICE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper investigates the impact of international state-building efforts on economic development in Somalia. Owing to non-existent or poor-quality national income accounts, we use satellite data capturing nightlight emissions to measure economic activity. Using the synthetic control method, we find that the establishment of the Transitional Federal Government in 2004 was associated with economic stagnation relative to the preceding years, when Somalia did not have a formal central government. The result remains whether we enter the total lights emitted from the country or the distribution of lights across the country. Our empirical findings are consistent with the idea that the exogenously imposed Transitional Federal Government destabilized the nation by creating inconsistencies with the informal institutions that had led to development during Somalia's statelessness.

TI  - The effect of concentrate feeding strategy and dairy cow genotype on milk production, pasture intake, body condition score and metabolic status under restricted grazing conditions
T2  - LIVESTOCK SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to compare the effects of contrasting concentrate feeding strategies and dairy cow genotypes on milk production, pasture intake, energy balance, and metabolic status under restricted grazing conditions. Fifty-eight Holstein Friesian cows were assigned to concentrate feeding strategy and genotype treatments in a 2 ? 2 factorial arrangement, in a randomized complete block design. Treatments were balanced for days in milk, parity, previous 305-day milk yield, and body condition score (BCS). The dietary treatments offered over the 11-week experimental period were a low flat rate concentrate allowance of 1.76 kg DM/d typical of a low input system (CON, n = 29) or a "feed to yield " concentrate allowance (FY, n = 29). The FY treatment included feeding a base of 1.76 kg DM plus 0.44 kg DM of concentrates/kg of milk above the base milk yield. All cows were allocated 13 kg DM of grass. The genotype treatments consisted of lower fertility higher milk (LFHM) and higher fertility lower milk (HFLM) cows based on Economic Breeding Index figures. The FY strategy resulted in a higher milk (+ 1.77 kg/d) and a higher fat plus protein yield (+ 0.12 kg/d) and increased BCS (+ 0.12 units) compared to CON. The metabolic status of FY cows differed from CON cows as evidenced by the reduced beta-hydroxybutyrate and non-esterified fatty acid concentrations. Genotype did not influence milk output but did affect total dry matter intake (DMI) and BCS. Cows of LFHM tended to have higher yields on the FY resulting in increased milk yield of 11% compared to FY-HFLM cows. Cows of HFLM fed CON had greater fat and protein output of 0.5 kg and 0.5 kg, respectively compared to the CON-LFHM. No differences in feed efficiency was observed between treatments. Despite cows originating from a higher output herd, differences in genotype had a significant effect on the response to the concentrate feeding strategies. These observations are important when identifying suitable genotypes or feeding strategies that most suit grazing systems.

TI  - Diagnosis and modelling of two destructive derecho events in European Russia in the summer of 2010
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In the summer of 2010, European Russia experienced an unprecedented high air temperature, catastrophic wildfires, heavy air pollution, but also several severe convective storms. Two of them occurring on June 27 and July 29 had a particularly high intensity and resulted in unprecedented forest damage. In this study, we estimate storm-related forest damage using Landsat images and analyse the synoptic-scale and mesoscale peculiarities of these storms formation and evolution using satellite and reanalyses data, surface observations, and mesoscale numerical simulation. The total area of stand-replacing windthrow caused by these two storms amounts to 1250 km(2). We found for both events that dark-coniferous and pine forests were more impacted than deciduous and re-grown forests. Damage track length exceeds 500 km for one storm and 600 km for another; therefore, we classify them as derecho events, which are documented for the first time in Russia. Formation of both derecho-producing mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) was triggered by fast-moving waves formed on the polar front under conditions of substantial temperature gradients on a western flank of long-lived blocking anticyclones in their termination dates. Backward trajectories analysis shows that advection from the Caspian Sea was one of the sources of high atmospheric water content during the MCSs formation. Both MCSs developed within environ-ments of moderate to strong convective instability and extremely high wind shear due to strong midlevel jet stream. We performed convection-permitting simulation of storms using the WRF model started with the initial data of CFSR and ERA5 reanalysis. For the event of June 27, the simulations with both initial conditions un-derestimate the maximum wind gusts since the model reproduces only a squall line without dominating derecho-producing storm. For the event of July 29, the ERA5 based simulation successfully reproduced the main features of the storm life cycle, while the CFS-based simulation substantially underestimated the wind gusts and the storm-affected area. Our results highlight the importance of the atmospheric blocking influence on the convective severe storms formation and development, which deserves further research.

TI  - Regional-scale fire severity mapping of<i> Eucalyptus</i> forests with the Landsat archive
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire managers seek accurate methods to map fire severity for forest management efforts. Fire severity data with wide spatial and temporal coverage enhances understanding of fire's impact on vegetation and improves planning to mitigate the risk of destructive wildfires. In this study, we develop a machine learning workflow that converts a spatial database of known fire events into a collection of gridded fire severity maps representing levels of canopy scorch due to wildfires and planned fuel reduction burns (prescribed burns). This workflow uses a dataset of observed fire severity interpreted from post-fire aerial images (3-7 cm spatial resolution; -11,649 labels from 64 unique fires) to train and test a supervised classifier that predicts fire severity using 13 Landsatderived spectral indices. For a target fire, the classifier generates a pixel-level prediction of fire severity with classes belonging to one of five ordinal categories ranging from unburnt, three levels of canopy scorch, and canopy consumed by fire. The classifier's accuracy was 84.2% (Kappa score = 0.799) and testing was undertaken across multiple fire types (wildfire / prescribed burn), seasons, forest types and topography. MODIS thermal anomalies and a MODIS-derived burn area product were used to augment the fire severity database with startand end-of-fire dates to enable accurate delineation of pre- and post-fire Landsat imagery; this method increased model accuracy from 78.0% (Kappa = 0.72). The model was then applied to a regional 16-year (2005 to 2020) history of fire events (n fires = 713, -1Mha) in the sclerophyll eucalypt forests and woodlands of the Northern Jarrah Forest, Western Australia. On fires with MODIS-adjusted start and end dates, high severity fire (>80% canopy scorch) was predicted more often in wildfires (67.9%, 124900 ha) compared to prescribed burns (14.6%, 110300 ha). However, the total predicted area of high-severity fire was comparable between fire types due to prescribed burns being more frequent on the landscape. We provide the first fire severity model in Western Australia that is broadly calibrated to both prescribed burns and wildfires across multiple conditions. Our model outputs are made freely available and offer opportunities to better understand the interactions between prescribed burns and wildfires, and the effects of fire severity on the environment.

TI  - Canadian Dairy Network for Antimicrobial Stewardship and Resistance (CaDNetASR): An On-Farm Surveillance System
T2  - FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Canada has implemented on-farm antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance systems for food-producing animals under the Canadian Integrated Program for Antimicrobial Resistance (CIPARS); however, dairy cattle have not been included in that program yet. The objective of this manuscript was to describe the development and implementation of the Canadian Dairy Network for Antimicrobial Stewardship and Resistance (CaDNetASR). An Expert Panel (EP) of researchers was created to lead the development of the dairy surveillance system. The EP initiated a draft document outlining the essential elements of the surveillance framework. This document was then circulated to a Steering Committee (SC), which provided recommendations used by the EP to finalize the framework. CaDNetASR has the following components: (1) a herd-level antimicrobial use quantification system; (2) annually administered risk factor questionnaires; and (3) methods for herd-level detection of AMR in three sentinel enteric pathogens (generic Escherichia coli, Campylobacter spp., and Salmonella spp.) recovered from pooled fecal samples collected from calves, heifers, cows, and the manure pit. A total of 144 dairy farms were recruited in five Canadian provinces (British-Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, Quebec, and Nova-Scotia), with the help of local herd veterinarians and regional field workers, and in September 2019, the surveillance system was launched. 97.1 and 94.4% of samples were positive for E. coli, 63.8, and 49.1% of samples were positive for Campylobacter spp., and 5.0 and 7.7% of samples were positive for Salmonella spp., in 2019 and 2020, respectively. E. coli was equally distributed among all sample types. However, it was more likely that Campylobacter spp. were recovered from heifer and cow samples. On the other hand, it was more common to isolate Salmonella spp. from the manure pit compared to samples from calves, heifers, or cows. CaDNetASR will continue sampling until 2022 after which time this system will be integrated into CIPARS. CaDNetASR will provide online access to farmers and veterinarians interested in visualizing benchmarking metrics regarding AMU practices and their relationship to AMR and animal health in dairy herds. This will provide an opportunity to enhance antimicrobial stewardship practices on dairy farms in Canada.

M3  - Article
AB  - Spatio-temporal change detection analysis of Jamuna River using low and medium-resolution satellite data between the years of 1972 and 2013 are dynamic to assess river spatio-temporal changes and their impacts on the local settlements over the specific time. This study employs remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) proficiencies to identify the river bank shifting, erosion, and depositional features along with the population displacement. The satellite image of LANDSAT multispectral (MSS), thematic mapper (TM), and operational land imager (OLI) and thermal infrared sensor (TIRS) were used in this study. Supervised and unsupervised classification techniques have been used to identify land cover types and detect the changes using ArcGIS Pro 2.3.2. Supervised classifications performed well by validating >= 90% overall accuracy. The result shows total erosion was 3356 ha from 1972 to 2013, while the deposition was 5342 ha. Erosion and deposition cause the bank line shifting, river widening, and settlement displacement. Hundreds of displaced people suffered from loss of land, livelihood, increased poverty, food insecurity, lack of sanitation, and drinking water facilities. Thus, this study will be earnest in assisting the environmental management and associated planning including necessary measures.

AB  - Urogenital chlamydial infection is the most common sexually transmitted infection. Many cases of chlamydial infection are reported worldwide every year. Genital chlamydial infection in women can also cause obstetric issues, including infertility and miscarriage. For that purpose, appropriate care should be conducted with the latest knowledge. Only few guidelines come from Asian countries. The Asian Association of Urinary Tract Infection and Sexually Transmitted Infection (AAUS) belonging to the Urological Association of Asia (UAA) had developed the guidelines regarding chlamydial urethritis. We have collected the feedback and updated the guidelines which is now submitted for consideration of publication. In addition to the levels of evidence, the recommendation grades were defined using the modified GRADE methodology. Herein, we present the new edition of the UAA-AAUS guidelines for chlamydial urethritis.

TI  - Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) RNA in Wastewater Settled Solids Reflects RSV Clinical Positivity Rates
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) uses concentrations of infectious agent targets in wastewater to infer infection trends in the contributing community. To date, WBE has been used to gain insight into infection trends of gastrointestinal diseases, but its application to respiratory diseases has been limited. Here, we report that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) genomic ribonucleic acid can be detected in wastewater settled solids at two publicly owned treatment works. We further show that its concentration in settled solids is strongly associated (Kendalls tau = 0.65-0.77, p < 10(-7)) with clinical positivity rates for RSV at sentinel laboratories across the state in 2021, a year with anomalous seasonal trends of RSV disease. Given that RSV infections have similar clinical presentations to COVID-19, can be life threatening for some, and immunoprophylaxis distribution for vulnerable people is based on outbreak identification, WBE represents an important tool to augment current RSV surveillance and public health response efforts.

T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Feature complexity and heterogeneity of urban areas pose a challenge for tree species classification. This study examined the effectiveness of the integrated Worldview-2 (WV-2) bands, vegetation indices and normalized Digital Surface Model (nDSM) dataset in mapping common urban tree species and other land use and land cover (LULC) types using Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. The study also ranked the importance of nDSM, WV-2 bands and vegetation indices. The results indicate that the integrated dataset was effective as shown by high classification accuracies of 97% for the RF and 94% for SVM classifiers. The nDSM was the top-ranked variable with high Mean Decrease in Accuracy (MDA) and Mean Decrease in Gini (MDG) scores of 0.98 and 0.61, respectively. This research provides information to municipalities on the methods and data that can be used for the sustainable management of urban tree species.

TI  - Modelling soil organic carbon using vegetation indices across large catchments in eastern Australia
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) is an important soil component. However, examining SOC at the large catchment scale is difficult due to the intensive labour requirements. This study examines SOC distribution at large (>500 km(2)) catchment scales using field-sampled SOC data and remote sensed vegetation indices located in eastern Australia (Krui River catchment - 562 km(2); Merriwa River catchment - 808 km(2)) on grazing land-use basalt soil. The SOC data obtained was compared to digital elevation model (DEM) derived elevation and insolation data, as well as Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) values corresponding to each sample site. These indices were obtained from the MODIS sensor (Terra/Aqua) and Landsat series satellites. Vegetation Indices (VI) captured immediately prior to sampling demonstrated a poor correlation with SOC. The use of multiple, aggregated, prior VI data sets provided a good match with SOC. The strongest match occurred for Landsat 8 EVI, indicating that Vls with higher spatial and spectral resolution, which can account for atmospheric interference, have the potential to produce more accurate SOC mapping (Krui samples in 2006, R-2 = 0.31, P < 0.01; Krui sampled in 2014, R-2 = 0.41, P < 0.01; Merriwa samples in 2015, R-2 = 0.37, P< 0.01). A sensitivity test for both remote sensing platforms demonstrated that the findings were robust. The results demonstrate that Vls are a reliable surrogate for historical vegetation growth in pasture dominated landscapes and therefore soil carbon inputs allowing for mapping of SOC across large catchment scales. Both Landsat and MODIS produced similar results and demonstrate that SOC can be reliably predicted at the large catchment scale and for different catchments in this environment with RMSE range of 0.79 to 1.06. The method and data can be applied globally and provides a new method for environmental assessment.

TI  - Monitoring water transparency, total suspended matter and the beam attenuation coefficient in inland water using innovative ground-based proximal sensing technology
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term and high-frequency observations are vital to reveal water quality dynamics and responses to climate change and human activities. However, the datasets collected from traditional in situ and satellite observations may miss the rapid dynamics of water quality in the short term due to low temporal-spatial monitoring frequency and cloudy or rainy weather. To address this shortage, innovative ground-based proximal sensing (GBPS) technology was proposed to monitor water quality and identify emergencies with a wavelength range of 400-1000 nm, a spectral resolution of 1 nm and a minimal observation interval of 30 s. The GBPS was equipped with a hyperspectral imager placed 4-5 m above the water surface to minimize the impacts of the atmosphere and clouds. In this study, combined with 583 water samples obtained from four field samplings, GBPS datasets were first applied to estimate the total suspended matter (TSM), Secchi disk depth (SDD) and beam attenuation coefficient at 550 nm (C(550)) in Taihu Lake (TL), Liangxi River (LR) and Funchunjiang Reservoir (FR). The results demonstrated good performance with the TSM (R-2 = 0.83, RMSE = 8.35 mg/L, MAPE = 24.0%), SDD (R-2 = 0.88, RMSE = 0.09 m, MAPE = 14.7%), and C(550) (R-2 = 0.79, RMSE = 3.55 m(-1), MAPE = 35.8%). The time series of TSM and C(550) at the second-minute level showed consistent changes, but they were opposite to those of SDD. Taking TSM as an example, the datasets captured two mutations in TL with an 853.6% increase in 65 min and a rapid change from 40.3 mg/L to 256.9 mg/L and then to 51.0 mg/L in 224 min on November 1 and 3, respectively. Meanwhile, a significant decreasing trend (r =-0.83, p < 0.01) in LR from November 7 to 9 and a periodic diurnal increasing trend of TSM in FR during November 11 to 13 (0.46 <= R-2 <= 0.70, p < 0.01) were observed. GBPS, with the advantages of high-frequency observations and the applicability of complex weather conditions, compensates for the in situ, aircraft and satellite observation deficiencies. Therefore, GBPS allows us to capture more detailed water quality information and episodic events, which is an important part of an integrated air-space-ground monitoring system in the future.

TI  - Assessing the effects of urban green landscape on urban thermal environment dynamic in a semiarid city by integrated use of airborne data, satellite imagery and land surface model
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The response of the urban thermal environment to green space landscapes has been studied previously, while its detailed pattern is insufficiently explored owing to the constraints of spatial and temporal resolution of available datasets. This study uses integrated Thermal Airborne Spectrographic Imager (TASI) data, Landsat TM/ETM and MODIS satellite imagery, and Noah land surface model output to investigate the effects of landscape pattern on the urban thermal environment across Shijiazhuang, China. The present study not merely proposes a generalized framework for the spatiotemporal analysis of urban thermal environment, but also affords several insights into the cooling effects related to urban green space landscapes in semiarid cities. Firstly, trees and lawns show a noticeable disparity in land surface temperature (LST) response to urban green landscape metrics, primarily due to the difference in cooling efficiency via evapotranspiration. This disparity can be explained further by the radiation-shading effect of trees. Secondly, analysis confirms that the composition of urban green space has a substantial impact on LST throughout summer. This pattern is largely stable for trees owing to the constant Bowen ratio, but they are altered for lawns. Conversely, the configurations of urban green space exhibit less impact on LST. These effects vary temporally in magnitude and can be enhanced notably in humid conditions. The lower correlation between the configuration metrics of urban green and LST has to do with the surface resistance alterations and additional cooling effects. Finally, consistent patterns of the impact of urban green space landscape metrics on LST are illustrated at different spatial scales and region sizes but greater effects are revealed for smaller analytical units, further confirming the impacts of urban green landscape on urban thermal environment.

TI  - Development of aerosol optical properties for improving the MESSy photolysis module in the GEM-MACH v2.4 air quality model and application for calculating photolysis rates in a biomass burning plume
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The photolysis module in Environment and Climate Change Canada's online chemical transport model GEM-MACH (GEM: Global Environmental Multi-scale MACH: Modelling Air quality and Chemistry) was improved to make use of the online size and composition-resolved representation of atmospheric aerosols and relative humidity in GEM-MACH, to account for aerosol attenuation of radiation in the photolysis calculation. We coupled both the GEM-MACH aerosol module and the MESSy-JVAL (Modular Earth Submodel System) photolysis module, through the use of the online aerosol modeled data and a new Mie lookup table for the model-generated extinction efficiency, absorption and scattering cross sections of each aerosol type. The new algorithm applies a lensing correction factor to the black carbon absorption efficiency (core-shell parameterization) and calculates the scattering and absorption optical depth and asymmetry factor of black carbon, sea salt, dust and other internally mixed components.We carried out a series of simulations with the improved version of MESSy-JVAL and wildfire emission inputs from the Canadian Forest Fire Emissions Prediction System (CF-FEPS) for 2 months, compared the model aerosol optical depth (AOD) output to the previous version of MESSyJVAL, satellite data, ground-based measurements and reanalysis products, and evaluated the effects of AOD calculations and the interactive aerosol feedback on the performance of the GEM-MACH model. The comparison of the improved version of MESSy-JVAL with the previous version showed significant improvements in the model perfor- mance with the implementation of the new photolysis module and with adopting the online interactive aerosol concentrations in GEM-MACH. Incorporating these changes to the model resulted in an increase in the correlation coefficient from 0.17 to 0.37 between the GEM-MACH model AOD 1-month hourly output and AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network) measurements across all the North American sites. Comparisons of the updated model AOD with AERONET measurements for selected Canadian urban and industrial sites, specifically, showed better correlation coefficients for urban AERONET sites and for stations located further south in the domain for both simulation periods (June and January 2018). The predicted monthly averaged AOD using the improved photolysis module followed the spatial patterns of MERRA-2 reanalysis (Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications - version 2), with an overall underprediction of AOD over the common domain for both seasons. Our study also suggests that the domain-wide impacts of direct and indirect effect aerosol feedbacks on the photolysis rates from meteorological changes are considerably greater (3 to 4 times) than the direct aerosol optical effect on the photolysis rate calculations.

TI  - Comparative analysis of AVIRIS-NG and Landsat-8 OLI data for lithological mapping in parts of Sittampundi layered complex, Tamil Nadu, India
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study addresses a comparative analysis of the potentials of Airborne Visible and infrared imaging spectrometer -next generation (AVIRIS-NG) data, with respect to Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data for mapping of sporadic exposures of mafic cumulates within the anorthosite intrusion and delineation of major lithological units of Sittampundi layered complex. AVIRIS-NG and Landsat-8 OLI data were initially compared using scene-based relative signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) analysis. Subsequently, spectral anomaly maps were generated to map different lithological rock units using the constrained energy minimization (CEM) approach. Spectral maps derived using CEM were further filtered by low-pass filtering to control the false-positive result. Spectral angle mapper (SAM) classification technique was applied to analyze the suitability of AVIRIS-NG and Landsat-8 OLI data for lithological mapping. Confusion matrix analysis was carried out to assess the SAM classified maps. The first vertical derivative (FVD) map of magnetic anomaly and field evidence/geological exposures were used to validate the results. SNR analysis indicates the superior signal strength of AVIRISNG data than Landsat-8 OLI data. Moreover, combined analysis based on CEM and SAM of remote sensing data and FVD of magnetic anomaly reveals that the false-positive area indicating metagabbro/mafic cumulate is lower in AVIRIS-NG data than Landsat-8 OLI data. This is because of the relatively poor SNR, spectral and spatial resolutions of Landsat-8 OLI data; however, it can be good enough for mapping of metagabbro/mafic cumulate when AVIRIS-NG data is unavailable.

M3  - Article
AB  - Lima, Peru's capital, has about 9.6 million inhabitants and keeps attracting more residents searching for a better life. Many citizens, without access to housing subsidies, live in informal housing and shack settlements. A typical social phenomenon in Lima is the sudden illegal occupation of areas for urban settlements. When such areas are unsafe against natural hazards, it is important to relocate such a population to avoid significant future losses. In this communication, we present an application of Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images to map the extension of a recent occupation of an area with unfavorable soil conditions against earthquakes.

TI  - Use of remote sensing to evaluate the effects of environmental factors on soil salinity in a semi-arid area
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The global water crisis, driven by water scarcity and water quality deterioration, is expected to continue and intensify in dry and overpopulated areas, and will play a critical role in meeting future agricultural demands. Sustainability of agriculture irrigated with low quality water will require a comprehensive approach to soil, water, and crop management consisting of site- and situation-specific preventive measures and management strategies. Other problem related with water quality deterioration is soil salinization. Around 1Bha globally are salinized and soil salinization may be accelerating for several reasons including the changing climate. The consequences of climate change on soil salinization need to be monitored and mapped and, in this sense, remote sensing has been successfully applied to soil salinity monitoring. Although many issues remain to be resolved, some as important as the imbalance between ground-based measurements and satellite data. The main objective of this paper was to determine the influence of environmental factors on salinity from natural causes, and its effect on irrigated agriculture with degraded water. The study was developed on Campo de Cartagena, an intensive water-efficient irrigated area which main fruit tree is citrus (30%), a sensible crop to salinity. Nine representative citrus farms were selected, soil samples were analysed and different remote sensing indices and sets of environmental data were applied. Despite the heterogeneity between variables found by the descriptive analysis of the data, the relationship between farms, soil salinity and environmental data showed that applied salinity spectral indices were valid to detect soil salinity in citrus trees. Also, a set of environmental characterization provided useful information to determine the variables that most influence primary salinity in crops. Although the data extracted from spatial analysis indicated that to apply soil salinity predictive models, other variables related to agricultural management practices must be incorporated.

TI  - A Structural Equation Modeling Approach to Disentangling Regional-Scale Landscape Dynamics in Ghana
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover (LC) change is an integrative indicator of changes in ecosystems due to anthropogenic or natural forcings. There is a significant interest in the investigation of spatio-temporal patterns of LC transitions, and the causes and consequences thereof. While the advent of satellite remote sensing techniques have enhanced our ability to track and measure LC changes across the globe, significant gaps remain in disentangling specific factors that influence, or in certain cases, are influenced by, LC change. This study aims to investigate the relative influence of regional-scale bioclimatology and local-scale anthropogenic factors in driving LC and environmental change in Ghana. This analysis builds upon previous research in the region that has highlighted multiple drivers of LC change in the region, especially via drivers such as deforestation, urbanization, and agricultural expansion. It used regional-scale remotely sensed, demographic, and environmental data for Ghana across 20 years and developed path models on causal factors influencing LC transitions in Ghana. A two-step process is utilized wherein causal linkages from an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) are constrained with literature-based theoretical constructs to implement a regional-scale partial least squares path model (PLSPM). The PLSPM reveals complex interrelationships among drivers of LC change that vary across the geography of Ghana. The model suggests strong effects of local urban expansion on deforestation and vegetation losses in urban and peri-urban areas. Losses of vegetation are in turn related to increases in local heating patterns indicative of urban heat island effects. Direct effects of heat islands are however masked by strong latitudinal gradients in climatological factors. The models confirm that decreases in vegetation cover results in increased land surface albedo that is indirectly related to urban and population expansion. These empirically-estimated causal linkages provide insights into complex spatio-temporal variations in potential drivers of LC change. We expect these models and spatial data products to form the basis for detailed investigations into the mechanistic underpinnings of land cover dynamics across Ghana. These analyses are aimed at building a template for methods that can be utilized to holistically design spatially-disaggregated strategies for sustainable development across Ghana.

TI  - An integration method to improve the quality of global land cover
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover plays a major role in global climate change and biogeochemical cycles. It is widely used in ecological and Earth-system models to simulate atmosphere-biosphere exchanges of energy, water, and carbon. However, the current global land cover (GLC) products lack data consistencies in land cover classes, spatial scale, temporal extent, and the image source and have low accuracy. This study aimed to create a time-series GLC dataset with high accuracy by integrating the current multiple GLC products and correcting the spatial and temporal errors that did not conform to reasonable rules. A logistic regression indicator method was proposed to integrate CCI2012, MODIS2012, and GLCNMO2013 for spatial optimization and integration. As a result, the GLC2012 was generated with the user's accuracy of 74.4%, which was 3.4-10.9% higher than that of the above products. The GLC2012 product was sequentially superimposed by the yearly changes of the CCI-LC product to form a time-series dataset from 1999 to 2018. Then, an abnormal temporal change detection and reconstruction model (CDR) was developed to detect and correct data sequences. The pixels with any changes from 1999 to 2018 were divided into three types of real, possible, and pseudo change. The possible change was required to determine fault or truth and pseudo change was defined as a false change. The spectral similarity method was proposed to correct the false change class. Finally, a 2000-2017 improved GLC annual time-series dataset (IGLC) with a spatial resolution of 0.01 degrees was produced. Hence, the production of a set of high-precision, time-continuous GLC datasets is of great significance for monitoring global ecological environmental protection and urban development, and for proposing corresponding policies and recommendations.

TI  - Vertical characterization on global ionospheric variations during the magnetic storm in September 2017 with hierarchical subtraction method
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the global ionospheric responses at different altitudes during the geomagnetic storm in September 2017 by using the observations from IGS GIMs and GRACE, TerraSAR-X, COSMIC, Metop LEO satellite missions. According to different satellite heights, a hierarchical subtraction method is proposed to characterize the disturbance of total electron content (TEC) at the vertical regions of below 340km, 340-520km, 520-800km and above 800km, respectively. The integrated TEC from IRI-Plas2017 are applied to verify the feasibility and rationality of the proposed method and the electron density (Ne) profiles from the ionosonde and radio occultation (RO) measurements are used to explore the variations of Ne in different height regions. The resulting TEC disturbances (DTEC) on a global scale show that: 1) There was significant increase on Ne peak in F2 region during the magnetic storm, due to the strong recombination in the lower ionosphere while more intense electron ionization in the upper ionosphere; 2) During the main phase, TEC enhancement had a tendency to drift westward, which may correlate with the twice Dst minimums. 3) The east-west and north- south hemispheric asymmetry of DTEC exist simultaneously in this magnetic storm. However, the former is mainly attributed to ionospheric plasma bubbles, while the latter might be the seasonal thermospheric effects or the energetic particle emissions. (c) 2021 COSPAR.

TI  - First global observation of tropospheric formaldehyde from Chinese GaoFen-5 satellite: Locating source of volatile organic compounds
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing is an important technique providing long-term and large-scale information of formaldehyde (HCHO), which plays a crucial role in atmospheric chemistry. Low signal-to-noise ratio and poor stability of the Environmental Trace Gases Monitoring Instrument (EMI) On board Gaofen-5 satellite, the first Chinese space-borne spectrometer, make HCHO retrieval extremely difficult. Here we firstly retrieved HCHO vertical column densities (VCDs) from EMI through in-flight spectral calibration, retrieval setting optimization and stripe correction. Retrieved EMI HCHO VCDs correlate well with those measured by Multi-AXis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) with normalize mean bias (NMB) below 25%. EMI HCHO VCDs are comparable with those observed by Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). This study reveals that HCHO can be observed successfully by algorithm optimization despite of poor performance of space-borne spectrometer. The retrieved EMI HCHO VCDs are applied to locate emission sources of volatile organic compounds (VOCs).

T2  - Cell genomics
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Genetic studies on telomere length are important for understanding age-related diseases. Prior GWAS for leukocyte TL have been limited to European and Asian populations. Here, we report the first sequencing-based association study for TL across ancestrally-diverse individuals (European, African, Asian and Hispanic/Latino) from the NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program. We used whole genome sequencing (WGS) of whole blood for variant genotype calling and the bioinformatic estimation of telomere length in n=109,122 individuals. We identified 59 sentinel variants (p-value <5*10-9) in 36 loci associated with telomere length, including 20 newly associated loci (13 were replicated in external datasets). There was little evidence of effect size heterogeneity across populations. Fine-mapping at OBFC1 indicated the independent signals colocalized with cell-type specific eQTLs for OBFC1 (STN1). Using a multi-variant gene-based approach, we identified two genes newly implicated in telomere length, DCLRE1B (SNM1B) and PARN. In PheWAS, we demonstrated our TL polygenic trait scores (PTS) were associated with increased risk of cancer-related phenotypes.

TI  - Technical and organizational challenges in the risk management of road infrastructures
T2  - JOURNAL OF RISK RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper outlines a theoretical framework for the risk management of road infrastructures from the perspective of organizational studies and engineering science. The framework moves beyond the traditional approach analysing each road infrastructure in isolation, and adopts the emerging systemic approach aimed at optimizing the interrelation between infrastructures, while at the same time extending this approach by considering actors as well as infrastructures. The initial focus is on the interaction between the parts (infrastructure and related actors) within a system (infrastructure and related actors within administrative boundaries) with a focus on two organizational modes: coordination and fragmentation. The choice between coordination and fragmentation depends on the span of safety and the level of risk. Furthermore, coordination and fragmentation offer useful insights for decision-makers by addressing specific modes of governance aimed at avoiding a lack of cooperation and ineffective responses. The paper then examines satellite data obtained from differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) in a geographical information system (GIS) platform. The aim is to identify the span of safety within a system, concerning specific infrastructures with the related actors, and to assess the risk levels for road infrastructures. The approach is intended to identify the most appropriate organizational mode. The potential of this approach was tested in a sample area of Rome (Italy), and the results reveal a significant span of safety with a common negligible risk, and a subspan of safety with a moderate risk. In the first case, coordination between the parts is desirable. As a result, long-term and fully shared solutions can be adopted, including joint planning operations and standard operating rules. In the second case, fragmentation is indicated, with more flexible solutions characterized by sharing and local autonomy.

TI  - Mapping mangrove species using combined UAV-LiDAR and Sentinel-2 data: Feature selection and point density effects
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping mangrove species is important for mangrove conservation and rehabilitation. However, due to the similar spectral signatures of most mangrove species, accurately mapping mangrove species remains an ongoing challenge. Unmanned aerial vehicles paired with light detection and ranging sensors (UAV-LiDAR) have the potential to increase separability between mangrove species by providing vertical structure information with high flexibility and low cost and could be complementary to optical imagery. In this study, we combined UAV-LiDAR and Sentinel-2 data to classify mangrove species in two representative mangrove forests in China. Moreover, an architecture diagram of important features for discriminating mangrove species was first constructed using a modified recursive feature elimination method and a proposed step-by-step method, including hierarchical clustering, scatterplots, and boxplots. This architecture diagram could indicate the specific role of each feature (or group) in demarcating specific mangrove species and help other mangrove studies prepare candidate features. The combined UAV-LiDAR and Sentinel-2 data produced the highest overall accuracies of 85.60% and 91.61% in the Dongzhaigang National Nature Reserve and Qinglangang Provincial Nature Reserve areas, respectively, compared to those of the Sentinel-2 (80.00% and 80.42%, respectively) and UAV-LiDAR (77.60% and 75.52%, respectively) data alone by using the novel canonical correlation forest algorithm. Important LiDAR features included metrics describing the top, bottom, and overall (e.g., Hstd and GM2nd) morphological characteristics of the mangrove canopy, which characterized the vertical stratification and shape of the canopy. The added value of the UAV-LiDAR data mainly lies in improving the separability between shrub-like mangroves and arbor mangroves that had similar spectral signatures, such as A. marina and R. stylosa. The point density might have little effect on feature selection and classification accuracy, while 10% of the initial point density (similar to 10 pts/m(2)) could produce similar accuracy (differences less than 0.5%). This study suggests that the combined UAV-LiDAR and Sentinel-2 data provide a cost-efficient and accurate approach for mangrove species classification. (C) 2021 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Optical remote sensing cloud detection based on random forest only using the visible light and near-infrared image bands
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud detection is of great significance for optical remote sensing images. Most existing cloud detection approaches often rely on many thresholds among multiple bands with a wide spectrum range, and normally just can be applied to specific satellite data. Cloud detection is difficult in some sensor data with limited number of available spectral bands. To tackle this challenge, we propose a cloud detection method based on random forest (RFCD) only with the most common RGB and NIR bands. The RFCD normalizes different sensor data by calculating the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance and combines stable spectral and texture features extracted from the most common bands, which improves accuracy, reduces reliance on multi-band information, and improves the extendibility of the method. Moreover, the RFCD effectively avoids the complicated threshold setting and reduces subjective factors. Few parameters and strong generalization ability of RF further improve the extendibility of RFCD and provide the application possibility in a variety of data. Experimental results show the total validity obtained by 107 Landsat-8 images is 93.46%. The accuracy of the RFCD is higher than the Function of mask method and similar to the SegNet deep learning method, while the RFCD need fewer training samples and hyperparameters which makes it easier to be used. The extended experimental results show RFCD also gets good detection results in Sentinel-2 and GaoFen-1 images. The new RFCD is an accurate cloud detection method with strong extendibility and stability, also avoiding the complicated threshold setting.

TI  - Analysis of Influence Mechanism of Spatial Distribution of Incoming Solar Radiation Based on DEM
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - When using high-resolution satellite remote sensing data to estimate incoming solar radiation, the influence of complex topography must be taken into account. Elevation, land cover, slope and aspect are the controlling factors that affect the spatial distribution of incoming solar radiation. How can we quantify the above factors influence degree? Studying the influence mechanism on the spatial distribution of incoming solar radiation and using remote sensing inversion method and geographic detector for quantitative analysis can provide a scientific basis for the study of incoming solar radiation in complex topography. The remote sensing quantitative inversion method was used to retrieve the incoming solar radiation in the river valley area, and to obtain the spatial distribution of incoming solar radiation in the study area. At the same time, geographical detector was used to quantify the factors affecting the spatial distribution of incoming solar radiation, quantitatively analyzed the influence of various factors on incoming solar radiation, and thoroughly analyzed the influence mechanism factors on its spatial distribution through interaction. The results are as follows: (1) There is a good correlation between the inversion value and the observed value, the average relative error is 4.5%; (2) The distribution of incoming solar radiation has a strong topographic law; (3) The incoming solar radiation decreases with the increase of slope; (4) The incoming solar radiation tends to increase with the increase of elevation. According to the analysis results of geographic detector, in different periods, the influence degree of aspect on the spatial distribution of incoming solar radiation was 0.6940, 0.5661, 0.3368, 0.2646, 0.5929, 0.6562 and 0.6964 respectively, the influence degree of slope was 0.1242, 0.2900, 0.6339, 0.7214, 0.2846, 0.1861 and 0.1252 respectively, the influence degree of land cover was no more than 0.2465, and elevation has the least influence degree, not exceeding 0.0423.

TI  - Quantitative estimation of the factors impacting spatiotemporal variation in NPP in the Dongting Lake wetlands using Landsat time series data for the last two decades
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are important ecosystems and constitute one of the major carbon reservoirs on Earth. Therefore, accurate estimation of wetland carbon stocks, quantitative analysis of spatial and temporal changes in wetland carbon stocks, and maintenance and enhancement of wetland carbon sink functions play a pivotal role in achieving China's "carbon neutral" strategy. Vegetation net primary productivity (NPP) is one of the core components of wetland ecosystem carbon budgets. In this study, an improved CASA model and the spatiotemporal fusion algorithm were employed to obtain NPP data with good accuracy and high spatiotemporal resolution for the Dongting Lake wetland area for the last two decades. Quantitative methods based on partial derivatives were used to assess the contribution of climate and anthropogenic factors to NPP changes. The results demonstrate that the NPP of wetland vegetation in Dongting Lake showed a significant increasing trend from 2000 to 2019 (0.86 g C/m(2)-yr, P < 0.05). Temperature, precipitation and solar radiation contributed positively to the NPP changes in wetland vegetation, with solar radiation making the greatest contribution (10.31 g C/m(2).year), followed by precipitation (1.61 g C/m(2).year) and then temperature (0.03 g C/m(2).year). The contributions of climate change and human activities to changes in wetland vegetation NPP were 1.08 and 0.58 g C/m(2).year, respectively. Human activities dominate in terms of vegetation degradation, while climate dominates in terms of vegetation restoration.

TI  - The accuracy and clinical impact of intraoperative frozen section in determining the extent of surgical intervention in patients with early stage endometrial cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNAECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare intraoperative frozen section (FS) with the final pathology (FP), and determine its clinical impact in clinically apparent early stage endometrial cancer (EC) at the American University of Beirut Medical Center (AUBMC). Data for patients 18 years or older, with clinically apparent early stage, grade 1 or 2, endometrioid EC, who underwent hysterectomy +/- lymph node dissection (LND) at AUBMC between January 1(st) 1996 and June 30(th) 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. 70 patients were included. The overall concordance between FS and FP was 92.3% for histological subtype, 77% for tumour grade, 82% for Myometrial invasion (MI) and 100% for tumour size. At a median follow up of 30 months, 8 recurrences (11.4%) were noted, with a 5-year PFS and OS of 76 and 84% respectively, with a trend towards lower recurrence and improved survival in patients who underwent FS or LND.Impact statement What is already known on this subject? Hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is the standard surgery for stage I endometrial cancer (EC). Intraoperative frozen section (FS) facilitates the decision on performing lymph node dissection (LND). However, its accuracy and clinical impact have been questioned. What do the results of this study add? Our objective is to compare FS with the final pathology (FP), and determine its clinical impact in clinically apparent early stage EC at the American University of Beirut Medical Center (AUBMC). There is a lack of standardisation regarding FS use and reporting at AUBMC. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? The strong correlation between FS and FP can serve as a tool to guide decision to perform LND in patients with apparent early stage disease, where use of sentinel LN biopsy technique is not available.

T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The initial phase of the Gulf of Suez rifting in the late Oligocene was accompanied by the eruption of continental basaltic magmas, which continued to the early Miocene. Within the rift zone at Abu Zenima area, west-central Sinai, several km-scale Oligo-Miocene basaltic exposures in the form of dykes, sills and lava flows intruded/extruded the Phanerozoic sedimentary successions. These basaltic outcrops were successfully discriminated from their country rocks by remote sensing techniques, using the Landsat-8 dataset. The basalts are evolved tholeiitic, Ti-rich varieties and exhibit narrow compositional range with absence of any felsic counterparts, suggesting equilibrium crystallization process in their evolutions rather than fractional crystallization mechanism. Simulations of equilibrium crystallization process and evolution trajectories of these basalts have been modeled. (c) 2022 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science.

TI  - Expected spatio-temporal variation of groundwater deficit by integrating groundwater modeling, remote sensing, and GIS techniques
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - For the last 6 decades, the Nile Valley region has been subjected to expanding reclamation, advancing agricultural and human activities. Extreme changes in the groundwater regime and land cover have been detected. Evaluation and mapping of groundwater and its controlling factors as important environmental factors have been assessed and managed based on their Spatio-temporal distribution and effect on the hydrologic properties. Visual MODFLOW and GIS database modeling are applied to simulate and predict the future aquifer response due to increased pumping rates to match the continuous need for water resources. Two pumping scenarios are proposed. The first scenario assumes that the current extraction rates continue without modification over the next 50 years. The second scenario assumes to increase the pumping rates by 50% from those of the first scenario. An obvious decline in groundwater heads is resulting in both scenarios. It reaches 20 m in the first scenario while it exceeds 30 m in the second one. Results obtained from the model have been merged with remote sensing data under GIS framework. GIS model using the weighted overlay approach is applied to produce the groundwater potentiality map, classified to five potential zones; very good, good, intermediate, poor, and very poor, the model showed that zone of very good recharge will decrease with time and disappear with increase pumping rate by 50% while the poor and very poor zones increase with time. There is a reciprocal relationship between the human and geological factors on the efficiency of the aquifer.(c) 2022 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Development, progression, and impact on urban air quality of the dust storm in Asia in March 15-18, 2021
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - An intense dust storm on 15-18 March 2021 that originated from the central and southern parts of the Gobi Desert in Mongolia affected most of northern, central, and eastern China. The dust storm had a significant impact on air quality over an area of more than 1.4 million km(2) and threatened the lives of 350 million people. The analysis of the storm provided here is based on satellite, ground-based observations and reanalysis data. Satellite measurements showed that the maximum aerosol optical depth (AOD) values ranged from 2.4 to 4.5. In 42 Chinese cities, the mass average daily PM10 concentrations exceeded 1000 mu g/m(3) and the atmospheric visibility was reduced to 500-1000 m. Ordos and Jiayuguan had the highest hourly average PM10 concentrations at over 9999 mu g/m(3), the maximum value for measurements. Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service (CAMS) reanalysis showed maximum dust AOD values of 2.4. Data from Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) found dust aerosols at an altitude of up to 12 km, and in many areas, the dust was found at an altitude between 0 and 4 km. A strong dust storm can result in a large amount of mineral aerosols of different sizes in the atmosphere that can significantly increase the heating rate of the atmosphere, subsequently affecting the regional dynamics of the atmosphere and the climate system as a whole.

TI  - Remote Sensing Image Fusion Algorithm Based on Two-Stream Fusion Network and Residual Channel Attention Mechanism
T2  - WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - A two-stream remote sensing image fusion network (RCAMTFNet) based on the residual channel attention mechanism is proposed by introducing the residual channel attention mechanism (RCAM) in this paper. In the RCAMTFNet, the spatial features of PAN and the spectral features of MS are extracted, respectively, by a two-channel feature extraction layer. Multiresidual connections allow the network to adapt to a deeper network structure without the degradation. The residual channel attention mechanism is introduced to learn the interdependence between channels, and then the correlation features among channels are adapted on the basis of the dependency. In this way, image spatial information and spectral information are extracted exclusively. What is more, pansharpening images are reconstructed across the board. Experiments are conducted on two satellite datasets, GaoFen-2 and WorldView-2. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is superior to the algorithms to some existing literature in the comparison of the values of reference evaluation indicators and nonreference evaluation indicators.

TI  - Hyperspectral vs. Multispectral data: Comparison of the spectral differentiation capabilities of Natura 2000 non-forest habitats
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Identification of the Natura 2000 habitats using remote sensing techniques is one of the most important chal-lenges of nature conservation. In this study, the potential for differentiating non-forest Natura 2000 habitats from the other habitats was examined using hyperspectral data in the scope of VNIR (0.4-1 mu m), SWIR (1-2.5 mu m) and simulated multispectral data (Sentinel-2). The aim of the research was also to determine the most informative spectral ranges from the optical range. Five different Natura 2000 habitats common in Central Europe were analysed: heaths (code 4030), mires (code 7140), grasslands (code 6230) and meadows (codes 6410 and 6510). In order to guarantee the objectivity and transferability of the results each habitat was tested in two areas and in three campaigns (spring, summer, autumn). Hyperspectral data was acquired using HySpex VNIR-1800 and SWIR-384 scanners. The Sentinel-2 data was resampled based on HySpex spectral reflectance. The overflights were performed simultaneously with ground reference data - habitats and background polygons. The Linear Discriminant Analysis was performed in iterative mode based on spectral reflectance acquired from hyperspectral and multispectral data. This resulted in distribution of correctness rate values and information about the most differentiating spectral bands for each habitat. Based on the results of our experiments we conclude that: (i) hyperspectral data (both VNIR and SWIR) obtained from May to September was useful for differentiation of habitats from background with efficiency reaching over 90%, regardless of the area; (ii) the most useful spectral ranges are: in VNIR -0.416-0.442 mu m and 0.502-0.522 mu m, in SWIR -1.117-1.165 mu m and 1.290-1.361 mu m; (iii) the potential of multispectral data (Sentinel-2) in distinguishing Natura 2000 habitats from the background is diverse; higher for heaths and mires (comparable to hyperspectral data) lower for meadows (6410, 6510) and grasslands (6230); (iv) in case of meadows and grasslands, the correctness rate for the Sentinel-2 data was on average about 20% lower compared to the hyperspectral data.

TI  - An Arsenic-76 radiotracer to study the routes of assimilation, hemolymph distribution, and tissue inventories in the bioindicator organism <i>Pomacea canaliculata</i>
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this work was to study the absorption, distribution through the hemolymph, and bioaccumulation of arsenic by the freshwater Pomacea conaliculata using a short-lived tracer (As-76, t(1)(/2): 1.07 d) with high specific activity. Arsenic travels mainly dissolved in the plasma of the snail's hemolymph. This element is transferred from the hemolymph to the tissues (87%) 4 h after the inoculation of 50 mu L of a 0.04 g/L of As-76 radiotracer solution, being the digestive gland, kidney, and head-foot the main places of arsenical inventories. Snails exhibited a rapid arsenic accumulation response in a wide range of concentrations (from 1 to 1000 mu g/L) of the metalloid dissolved in water and in a concentration-dependent manner. Also, snails incorporated As from the digestive system when they received a single safe dose of similar to 2 mu g of As-76 inoculated in a fish food pellet. The (semi) physiologically based toxicokinetic model developed in this study is based on anatomical and physiological parameters (blood flow, irrigation, tissue volume and other). Together, these findings make P. canaliculata an excellent sentinel organism to evaluate freshwater bodies naturally contaminated with As.

TI  - The 2016 record-breaking marine heatwave in the Yellow Sea and associated atmospheric circulation anomalies
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are becoming more frequent and intense in many regions around the world. However, the MHWs over China's marginal seas and associated physical drivers are largely unknown. During August 2016, the Yellow Sea experienced the most intense MHW on record since 1982. Here, we used a set of high resolution satellite data and reanalysis products to examine the characteristics of the MHW in August 2016 and analyze the potential influencing factors from atmospheric perspective. MHW was directly caused by great than-normal solar radiation and much weaker wind speeds which reduced upper oceanic mixing and caused substantial warming of the stratified surface layer. These anomalies were associated with an unusually fractured western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) and the distinctly more active transmission of Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) eastward to the western Pacific in August 2016. The MJO triggered more frequent tropical cyclones, splitting the WPSH into two parts. The western segment of the WPSH combined with the continental high to form an abnormally positive geopotential height at the west of 120?degrees E, causing strong subsiding flows at its east and extremely high solar radiation. An unambiguous cyclonic circulation anomaly in the lower troposphere, encompassing much of the northwestern Pacific, reduced the surface wind speed in the Yellow Sea. Therefore, MJO was critical to driving the extreme MHW in August 2016 in the Yellow Sea.

TI  - Outcomes of Sentinel Node Biopsy for Women with Breast Cancer After Neoadjuvant Therapy: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Real-World Data
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Evidence on the accuracy of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) after neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) for patients with breast cancer is inconclusive. This study reviewed the real-world data to determine the acceptability of SLNB after NAT. Methods The study searched for articles in the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases. The primary outcomes were the identification rate for sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) and the false-negative rate (FNR) for SLNB. The study also evaluated the FNR in subgroups defined by tumor stage, nodal stage, hormone receptor status, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 status, tumor response, mapping technique, and number of SLNs removed. Results The study retrieved 61 prospective and 18 retrospective studies with 10,680 initially cN +/- patients. The pooled estimate of the identification rate was 0.906 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 0.891-0.922), and the pooled FNR was 0.118 (95 % CI, 0.103-0.133). In subgroup analysis, the FNR was significantly higher for the patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-negative status and fewer than three SLNs removed. The FNR did not differ significantly between the patients with and those without complete tumor response. Among the patients with initial clinical negative axillary lymph nodes, the incidence of node metastasis was 26.8 % (275/1041) after NAT. Conclusion Real-world evidence indicates that the FNR of SLNB after NAT in breast cancer is 11.8 %, exceeding only slightly the commonly adopted threshold of 10 %. The FNR is significantly higher for patients with ER-negative status and removal of fewer than three SLNs. Using a dual tracer and removing at least three SLNs may increase the accuracy of SLNB after NAT.

TI  - An Operational Methodology for Validating Satellite-Based Snow Albedo Measurements Using a UAV
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow albedo is highly variable over multiple temporal and spatial scales. This variability is more pronounced in areas that experience seasonal snowpack. Satellite retrievals, physically based models and parameterizations for snow albedo all require ground-based measurements for calibration, initialization, and validation. Ground measurements are generally made using upward and downward-facing pyranometers at opportunistically located weather stations that are sparsely distributed, particularly in mountainous regions. These station-based measurements cannot capture the spatial variability of albedo across the land surface. Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with upward and downward-facing pyranometers provide near-surface measurements of broadband albedo that are spatially distributed across landscapes, offering improvements over in-situ sensors. At the hillslope to watershed scale albedo measurements from UAVs taken over heterogeneous terrain are a function of the spatial variability in albedo and topography within the downward-facing sensor's field-of-view (FOV). In this research we propose methods for topographic correction of UAV snow albedo measurements and comparison to gridded satellite albedo products. These methods account for the variability of surface topography and albedo within the sensor FOV, sensor tilt, and the angular response of pyranometers. We applied the proposed methodologies to UAV snow albedo measurements collected over an alpine meadow in southwest Montana, United States (45.23 & DEG;, -111.28 & DEG;). Sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine the effect of altering the processing FOV (PFOV) for both topographic corrections and comparison to coincident Landsat 8-derived albedo measurements. Validation from ground-based albedo measurements showed the topographic correction to reduce albedo measurement error considerably over mildly sloping terrain. Our sensitivity analyses demonstrated that outcomes from the topographic correction and satellite comparison are highly dependent on the specified PFOV. Based on field observations and analyses of UAV albedo measurements made at different altitudes, we provide guidelines for strategizing future UAV albedo surveys. This research presents considerable advances in the standardization of UAV-based albedo measurement. We establish the foundation for future research to utilize this platform to collect near-surface validation measurements over heterogeneous terrain with high accuracy and consistency.

TI  - Anthropogenic Drivers of Variation in Concentrations of Perfluoroalkyl Substances in Otters (<i>Lutra lutra</i>) from England and Wales
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are ubiquitous environmental contaminants that have been linked to adverse health effects in wildlife and humans. Here, we report the presence of PFASs in Eurasian otters (Lutra lutra) in England and Wales and their association with anthropogenic sources. The following 15 compounds were analyzed: 10 perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs), 4 perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids (PFSAs), and perfluorooctane sulfonamide, in livers of 50 otters which died between 2007 and 2009. PFASs were detected in all otters analyzed, with 12/15 compounds detected in >= 80% of otters. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) accounted for 75% of the Sigma PFAS profile, with a maximum concentration of 6800 mu g/kg wet weight (ww). Long-chain (>= C8) PFCAs accounted for 99.9% of the Sigma PFCA profile, with perfluorodecanoic acid and perfluorononanoic acid having the highest maxima (369 mu g/kg ww and 170 mu g/kg ww, respectively). Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) concentrations were negatively associated with the distance from a factory that used PFOA in polytetrafluoroethylene manufacture. Most PFAS concentrations in otters were positively associated with load entering wastewater treatment works (WWTW) and with arable land, suggesting that WWTW effluent and sewage sludge-amended soils are significant pathways of PFASs into freshwaters. Our results reveal the widespread pollution of British freshwaters with PFASs and demonstrate the utility of otters as effective sentinels for spatial variation in PFAS concentrations.

TI  - Mapping land subsidence and aquifer system properties of the Willcox Basin, Arizona, from InSAR observations and independent component analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term excessive groundwater exploitation for agricultural, domestic and stock applications has resulted in substantial ground subsidence in Arizona, USA, and especially in the Willcox Groundwater Basin. The land subsidence rate of the Willcox Basin has not declined but has rather increased in recent years, posing a threat to infrastructure, aquifer systems, and ecological environments. In this study, we first investigate the spatiotemporal characteristics of land subsidence in the Willcox Groundwater Basin using an interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) time series analytical approach with L-band ALOS and C-band Sentinel-1 SAR data acquired from 2006 to 2020. The overall deformation patterns are characterized by two major zones of subsidence, with the mean subsidence rate increasing with time from 2006 to 2020. An approach based on independent component analysis (ICA) was adopted to separate the mixed InSAR time series signal into a set of independent signals. The application of ICA to the Willcox Basin not only revealed that two different spatiotemporal deformation features exist in the basin but also filtered the residual errors in InSAR observations to enhance the deformation time series. Integrating the InSAR deformation and groundwater level data, the response of the aquifer skeletal system to the change in hydraulic head was quantified, and the hydromechanical properties of the aquifer system were characterized. Historical spatiotemporal storage loss from 1990 to 2020 was also estimated using InSAR measurements, hydraulic head and estimated skeletal storativity. Understanding the characteristics of land surface deformation and quantifying the response of aquifer systems in the Willcox Basin and other groundwater basins elsewhere are important in managing groundwater exploitation to sustain the mechanical health and integrity of aquifer systems.

TI  - Retrieval of Surface Roughness Over Cropped Area using Modified Water Cloud Model (MWCM), Oh Model and SAR Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is a critical factor for plant growth; therefore accurate information is needed for planning and protection measures. Surface roughness is an important factor that controls the near surface soil moisture in an agricultural field. The present aim of the work was to retrieve surface roughness using Sentinel-1A and Modified Water Cloud Model (MWCM) and Oh model. Inversion models were used to derive the surface parameters of crop with the aid of Sentinel-1A data. We have implemented the inversion algorithm of the MWCM and Oh model for vertical surface roughness estimation. Three Sentinel-1A images were collected and pre-processed before retrieval of backscattering coefficients (sigma o) of VV (or sigma o(VV)) and VH (or sigma o(VH)) polarizations using MWCM. In case of non-availability of sigma o(HH), Oh inversion algorithm was used as a calibration function to estimate surface roughness. The statistical accuracy of the results was found satisfactory (R-2 = 0.93).

TI  - Multi-decadal dynamics of the Saloum River delta mouth in climate change context
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The coast of Senegal is subject to climate variability that affects coastal dynamics. The Sangomar spit bounding the Saloum River delta provides a striking example. The spit dynamics has been characterized by complex changes involving both erosion and accumulation. Using a methodological approach combining remote sensing and data analysis in a Geographic Information System (GIS) we calculated a mean annual erosion rate of -3.55 m of the spit shoreline from 1954 to 1987. In 1987 the spit was breached by storm in its most eroded sector (- 4.59 m/year). This breach widened significantly to attain 5.25 km in 2018 and has now become the Saloum River mouth. The breach has resulted in exacerbated erosion of adjacent shorelines, especially at the down-drift coast, where the retreat attains a peak of -20.16 m/year, the average erosion rate remaining at -3.56 m/year for the entire coast. Extension of the spit tip has favoured progradation of the Sangomar Pointe which has lengthened by 5.74 km between 1954 and 2018, diverting gradually the Saloum River former mouth towards the South, and corresponding to a 5,185,009 m3 sedimentation. Extrapolation of shoreline mobility reveals high erosion rates due to sea-level rise by 2050 and 2100.

TI  - "Late-stage" deforestation enhances storm trends in coastal West Africa
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation affects local and regional hydroclimate through changes in heating and moistening of the atmosphere. In the tropics, deforestation leads to warming, but its impact on rainfall is more complex, as it depends on spatial scale and synoptic forcing. Most studies have focused on Amazonia, highlighting that forest edges locally enhance convective rainfall, whereas rainfall decreases over drier, more extensive, deforested regions. Here, we examine Southern West Africa (SWA), an example of "late-stage" deforestation, ongoing since 1900 within a 300-km coastal belt. From three decades of satellite data, we demonstrate that the upward trend in convective activity is strongly modulated by deforestation patterns. The frequency of afternoon storms is enhanced over and downstream of deforested patches on length scales from 16 to 196 km, with greater increases for larger patches. The results are consistent with the triggering of storms by mesoscale circulations due to landscape heterogeneity. Near the coast, where sea breeze convection dominates the diurnal cycle, storm frequency has doubled in deforested areas, attributable to enhanced land-sea thermal contrast. These areas include fastgrowing cities such as Freetown and Monrovia, where enhanced storm frequency coincides with high vulnerability to flash flood-ing. The proximity of the ocean likely explains why ongoing deforestation across SWA continues to increase storminess, as it favors the impact of mesoscale dynamics over moisture availability. The coastal location of deforestation in SWA is typical of many tropical deforestation hotspots, and the processes highlighted here are likely to be of wider global relevance.

AB  - Background: Guam, a United States of America (USA) island territory in the Pacific Ocean, is known to have large populations of ticks; however, it is unclear what the risk is to wildlife and humans living on the island. Dog (Canis familiaris), cat (Felis catus), and wild pig (Sus scrofa) sentinels were examined for ticks, and environmental sampling was conducted to determine the ticks present in Guam and the prevalence of tick-borne pathogens in hosts.Methods and Results: From March 2019-November 2020, ticks were collected from environmental sampling, dogs, cats, and wild pigs. Blood samples were also taken from a subset of animals. A total of 99 ticks were collected from 27 environmental samples and all were Rhipicephalus sanguineus, the brown dog tick. Most ticks were collected during the dry season with an overall sampling success rate of 63% (95% CI: 42.4-80.6). 6,614 dogs were examined, and 12.6% (95% CI: 11.8-13.4) were infested with at least one tick. One thousand one hundred twelve cats were examined, and six (0.54%; 95% CI: 0.20-1.1) were found with ticks. Sixty-four wild pigs were examined and 17.2% (95% CI: 9.5-27.8) had ticks. In total, 1,956 ticks were collected and 97.4% of ticks were R. sanguineus. A subset of R. sanguineus were determined to be the tropical lineage. The other tick species found were Rhipicephalus microplus (0.77%), Amblyomma breviscutatum (0.77 %), and a Haemaphysalis sp. (0.51%). Blood samples from 136 dogs, four cats, and 64 wild pigs were tested using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing methods. Five different tick-borne pathogens with the following prevalences were found in dogs: Anaplasma phagocytophilum 5.9% (95% CI: 2.6-11.3); Anaplasma platys 19.1% (95% CI: 12.9-26.7); Babesia canis vogeli 8.8% (95% CI: 4.6-14.9); Ehrlichia canis 12.5% (95% CI: 7.5-19.3); Hepatozoon canis 14.7% (95% CI: 9.2-28.8). E. canis was detected in one cat, and no tick-borne pathogens were detected in wild pigs. Overall, 43.4% (95% CI: 34.9-52.1) of dogs had at least one tick-borne pathogen. Serological testing for antibodies against Ehrlichia spp. and Anaplasma spp. showed prevalences of 14.7% (95% CI: 9.2-28.8) and 31.6% (95% CI: 23.9-40), respectively.Conclusion: Four different tick species were found in Guam to include a Haemaphysalis sp., which is a previously unreported genus for Guam. Dogs with ticks have a high prevalence of tick-borne pathogens which makes them useful sentinels.

TI  - Spatio-temporal pattern of urban vegetation carbon sink and driving mechanisms of human activities in Huaibei, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon neutrality is a strategic choice for the sustainable development of global cities. Quantitatively assessing the spatio-temporal patterns of urban vegetation carbon sink and the impact of human activities has become an essential basis for adjusting urban carbon balance. We used Huaibei, a typical city with vigorous human coal resource mining activities, as the case study area. We regarded the net ecosystem productivity (NEP) as an indicator parameter of vegetation carbon sink and calculated it based on the improved Carnegie-Ames-Stanford approach (CASA). We then revealed the spatial-temporal evolution of vegetation carbon sink through trend analysis, coefficient of variation, and standard direction. Finally, we used geographic detectors to evaluate the impact of human activities on NEP. We found that net primary productivity (NPP) accuracy was good, and the R-2 value was 0.755 compared with MODIS NPP products. NEP was characterized by the first decrease and then increase, showing a slow increase overall, with an average trend coefficient of 0.15 gC center dot m(-2)center dot a(-1). The average value in 2010 was the lowest at 18.30 gC center dot m(-2)center dot a(-1). In terms of spatial characteristics, NEP showed a gradual decrease from north to south. High and severe fluctuations were distributed along the southeast, mainly concentrated in Duji District, Xiangshan District, and Lieshan District. The driving factors with reliable explanatory power for NEP were population density, GDP, and road density, while land use type, soil erosion intensity, and mining and collapse area had weak explanatory power. Meanwhile, factors of cooperative interaction enhanced the explanatory power of the results.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study was conducted to quantify, analyze and map soil erosion risk areas using remotely sensed data and GIS-based Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model at Mihtsab-Azmati Irrigation Dam Watershed, Northern Ethiopia. Based on the result, the watershed has potential soil erosion risk which ranges from 0 ton hectare(-1) year(-1) to 2980.12 ton hectare(-1) year(-1) with an average annual soil erosion rate of 110.06 ton hectare(-1) year(-1). From the entire watershed area, only 27% of it has a soil loss a value less than 15 ton hectare(-1) year-1 which is relatively categorized under low soil erosion risk, while the remaining area (73%) experiences moderate to very high soil loss rates. A large area (50.7%) is under high to very high soil loss (>50 ton hectare(-1) year(-1)). The majority of the study watershed area experiences a very high soil erosion rate and this could be a major threat to the new irrigation dam constructed at the outlet of the watershed due to the sedimentation problem, which could decrease the economic lifespan of the dam. Hence, from the conservation perspective, a large proportion of the upper watershed area requires immediate and appropriate soil conservation measures.

TI  - Improved detection of abrupt change in vegetation reveals dominant fractional woody cover decline in Eastern Africa
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - While cropland expansion and demand for woodfuel exert increasing pressure on woody vegetation in East Africa, climate change is inducing woody cover gain. It is however unclear if these contrasting patterns have led to net fractional woody cover loss or gain. Here we used non-parametric fractional woody cover (WC) predictions and breakpoint detection algorithms driven by satellite observations (Landsat and MODIS) and airborne laser scanning to unveil the net fractional WC change during 2001-2019 over Ethiopia and Kenya. Our results show that total WC loss was 4-times higher than total gain, leading to net loss. The contribution of abrupt WC loss (59%) was higher than gradual losses (41%). We estimated an annual WC loss rate of up to 5% locally, with cropland expansion contributing to 57% of the total loss in the region. Major hotspots of WC loss and degradation corridors were identified inside as well as surrounding protected areas, in agricultural lands located close to agropastoral and pastoral livelihood zones, and near highly populated areas. As the dominant vegetation type in the region, Acacia-Commiphora bushlands and thickets ecosystem was the most threatened, accounting 69% of the total WC loss, followed by montane forest (12%). Although highly outweighed by loss, relatively more gain was observed in woody savanna than in other ecosystems. These results reveal the marked impact of human activities on woody vegetation and highlight the importance of protecting endangered ecosystems from increased human activities for mitigating impacts on climate and supporting sustainable ecosystem service provision in East Africa.

TI  - Hotspot analysis and long-term trends of absorbing aerosol index from dust emissions measured by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument at different urban locations in India during 2005-2018
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The dust storm is a natural hazard and knowledge of hotspots of dust emission is important to improve forecasting the dust events by numerical models of climate and air quality. The absorbing aerosol index (AAI) observations derived from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) sensor are analyzed over India covering the period from 2005 to 2018. In this manuscript, the hotspot analysis of AAI was conducted using the spatial autocorrelation technique for different seasons. The results showed significant spatial and temporal variability in the observed AAI. During pre-monsoon, the hotspot region is widely distributed, though with noticed spatially varying intensities, from the Thar Desert to West Bengal through the Indo Gangetic Plain (IGP) region. It is revealed from the back trajectory analysis that the airmasses were originated from the arid desert regions located in the West of India transporting the dust particles during the pre-monsoon over the IGP regions. Further, the trend analysis of AAI during the pre-monsoon over selected metropolitan in India was done using the Mann-Kendall (MK) test and Sen's robust slope estimator. The results showed a significant increasing (0.02 yr(-1)) and decreasing (-0.01 yr(-1)) trend in AAI at Patna and Hyderabad, respectively, while it is noticed stable or no trend at other cities. MERRA-2 Dust aerosol optical thickness was found to be very well correlated with AAI and shows decreasing and increasing trends at Nagpur (0.0005 yr(-1)) and Jaisalmer (0.004 yr(-1)), respectively. A negative correlation is observed between rainfall and AAI, indicating the reduction of AAI with increasing rainfall.

TI  - Estimation, modeling, and prediction of land subsidence using Sentinel-1 time series in Tehran-Shahriar plain: A machine learning-based investigation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land subsidence (LS) is a major geologic hazard threatening most areas in Iran due to excessive groundwater extractions. The main objective of this study was to estimate LS applying PS-InSAR technique and then model and predict it through machine learning methods. Sentinel-1 time series images were used to retrieve LS from 2014 to 2019. Random forest regression (RFR) and artificial neural networks (ANN) were implemented to model LS of 2014-2017 using some conditioning factors including groundwater level decline, aquifer media, precipitation rate, slope, landuse type, depth to water table, distance from exploiting wells, distance from rivers and distance from faults as independent variables. The best calibrated method was used to predict LS over 2018-2019. In addition, all k-combinations (k=1: n, n is the number of factors) of conditioning factors were evaluated to identify the best combination resulting in the best output. The procedure was examined in the Southwest of Tehran and Shahriar plain, Iran. The maximum cumulative displacement values were 561.78 and 638.5 mm for Tehran and Shahriar, respectively. The accuracy assessment showed the RMSE value of 9.97 mm for LS retrieval. The experimental results of LS modeling indicated that RFR outperformed ANN, representing more robust and reliable results with the RMSE value of 1.35 mm for the both study areas. The investigation of the possible factor combinations showed that using the 4-factor combination consisting of precipitation, ground water table change and depth to water table along with distance from faults for S1 and the thickness of fine-grained soil layers (clay and silt) for S2 have presented promising results in modeling and predicting LS. Using all the conditioning factors, LS was predicted with RMSE value of 2.53 mm and 2.09 mm for S1 and S2, respectively. Using the 4-factor combination, however, the prediction RMSE increased by 0.13 mm and 0.04 mm for S1 and S2, respectively. This 5-percent difference can be ignored against decreasing the total cost of applying all factors. This study demonstrates the usability of processing Sentinel-1 data for LS retrieval and applying RFR for LS prediction.

TI  - Validity and reliability of drought reporters in estimating soil water content and drought impacts in central Europe
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing drought is considered one of the major threats associated with climate change in central Europe. To provide an objective, quantitative tool that represents current drought conditions, the Czech Drought Monitor System (CzechDM) was established in 2012. Like other drought monitoring systems worldwide, the CzechDM uses several approaches to provide drought data. However, the CzechDM is unique internationally due to its utilization of a network of voluntary reporters (farmers) who complete a weekly online questionnaire to provide information about soil water content and the impacts of drought on crop yield. In this study, the results from the questionnaires from individual farms were aggregated by district. Reporters' data were compared and validated with the outputs of the SoilClim model (a core tool of the CzechDM) and with other drought monitoring tools, such as the water balance model, the soil water index and the evaporative stress index. The soil water content estimated by the reporters was significantly correlated (on average r = 0.8) with the outputs of the SoilClim model. Conversely, the correlation between the drought impacts on yield estimated by the reporters and the SoilClim outputs was lower (on average r = 0.4), suggesting that in situ observations by farmers provide additional insights into the occurrence of drought impacts. Importantly, it was found that farmers reported significant drought impacts on yield earlier in the season than any other methods (models or remote sensing). The main findings of this study are that the drought monitoring provided by reporters is a useful and reliable component of the CzechDM. We conclude that weekly reports by farmers represent a significant enhancement to drought monitoring and have potential for use in developing automated approaches that combine in situ, modeling and remote sensing data within a data fusion or machine learning framework.

TI  - Assessing the performance of satellite soil moisture on agricultural drought monitoring in the North China Plain
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite soil moisture (SM) has been increasingly available and the use of SM-based indices has a great potential for agricultural drought monitoring. This study evaluates the performance of two satellite SM products, the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), on drought detection and assessment in the North China Plain (NCP) over the period of 2015-2018, with a comparison between two SMbased drought indices, Soil Water Deficit Index (SWDI) and Soil Moisture Condition Index (SMCI). Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) and Vegetation Drought Index (VDI) were adopted as the reference indices. Overall, SMAP outperformed SMOS in SM data validation as well as drought detection in the NCP region. A simple bias correction of the satellite SM data was able to improve their performance in characterizing agricultural drought via SM-based indices. Compared with SWDI, SMCI appeared to be the more appropriate index for drought monitoring, by showing a better agreement with both VCI and VDI in terms of drought characteristics (i.e. spatial distribution, drought category and frequency), though both SM-based indices overestimated drought severity to some extent. A simply SM-based drought indicator could be effective when satellite SM was applied for capturing agricultural drought, and a full consideration of longer term satellite data might be necessary.

TI  - MINImal vs. MAXimal Invasive Axillary Staging and Treatment After Neoadjuvant Systemic Therapy in Node Positive Breast Cancer: Protocol of a Dutch Multicenter Registry Study (MINIMAX)
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - In node positive breast cancer patients who are treated with neoadjuvant systemic therapy, axillary staging and treatment is still a topic of debate. This multicenter study will contribute to evidence-based guidelines with regard to the oncologic safety and impact on quality of life of less vs. more invasive axillary staging and treatment strategies.Background: Node positive breast cancer (cN+) patients with an axillary pathologic complete response after neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST) are not expected to benefit from axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Therefore, less invasive axillary staging procedures have been introduced to establish response-guided treatment. However, evidence is lacking with regard to their oncologic safety and impact on quality of life (QoL). We hypothesize that if response-guided treatment is given, less invasive staging procedures are non-inferior to standard ALND in terms of oncologic safety, and superior to standard ALND in terms of QoL. Patients and Methods: MINIMAX is a Dutch multicenter registry study that includes patients with cN1-3M0 unilateral invasive breast cancer, who receive NST, followed by axillary staging and treatment according to local protocols. In a retrospective registry of +/- 4000 patients, the primar y endpoint is oncologic safety at 5 and 10 years (disease-free, breast-cancer-specific and overall survival, and axillary recurrence rate). In a prospective multicenter registry, the primar y endpoints are QoL at 1 and 5 years, and we aim to verify the 5-year oncologic safety. With an estimated 5-year disease-free survival of 72.5% and anticipated loss to follow-up of 10%, a sample size of 549 is needed to have 80% power to detect non-infer iority (with a 10% margin) of less invasive staging procedures. Conclusion: In cN+ patients treated with NST, less invasive axillary staging procedures are already implemented globally. Evidence is needed to support the assumed oncologic safety and superior QoL of such procedures. This study will contribute to evidence-based guidelines. (C) 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Intraoperative Radiotherapy for Breast Cancer in Elderly Women
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) with low-energy photons was delivered to 191 women >65 years of age. Only 8 patients had postoperative external beam radiotherapy. 5-year local relapse rate was 1.7%. Postoperative complications were rare, without delay in wound healing, even in older women. Cosmetic result was good or excellent in >90% of the patients.Purpose: To evaluate outcomes and postoperative toxicities after intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) in elderly women. Population: Women older than 65 years, with infiltrating ductal breast cancer <= 3 cm, expressing estrogen receptor (ER+) without Her2 overexpression, and with negative axillary nodes. Treatment: Treatment consisted of partial mastectomy with a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) procedure; in case of positive SLNB, IORT was cancelled. IORT consisted in a total dose of 20 Gy in 1 fraction delivered at the surface of the applicator with the Intrabeam (R) technique. Results: IORT was planned to be administered to a total of 225 patients but was cancelled for 34 patients during surgery. Thus 191 patients were analyzed; mean age was 76 years, with 57 patients (30%) >80 years. Despite inclusion criteria, 15 had lobular carcinoma and 7 were triple negative. With a median follow-up of 40 months, we observed only 1 local recurrence, located in the skin over the initial tumor. The 5-year local relapse rate was 1.7%. A wound healing delay ( >15 days) was observed in 21 patients (11%). Sixty-six patients (35%) had postoperative complications, mainly grade 2, resolving within a few days. Two patients needed surgical drainage for local abscesses. Long-term ( >1 year) cosmetic outcome was evaluated in 120 patients and was judged excellent or good in 102 (91%). Conclusion: IORT can be safely given to elderly women, with a good local control rate and without major toxicities. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Civil war hinders crop production and threatens food security in Syria
T2  - NATURE FOOD
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing the impact of violent conflict on Syrian agriculture is challenging given data limitations and attributability issues. Using satellite data at 30 m spatial resolution, we found that the extent of productive cropland showed greater interannual variability and spatial heterogeneity after the start of the civil war in 2011. Using changes in satellite-based night-time light as a proxy for war impact intensity, we also found that cropland close to severely impacted urban settlements faced greater disruption. Fixed-effects models revealed the relationship between productive cropland and precipitation for the pre-war period, whereas a counterfactual scenario constructed for the period 2012-2019 showed substantial variation at the regional level. While the ongoing conflict promoted cropland cultivation in safer zones, cropland reduction took place in the country's northwest and southeast regions. Our study demonstrated the combined utility of daytime and night-time satellite data to assess food insecurity in extreme environments and can help guide distribution of food and aid in Syria.Conflicts are known to disrupt agriculture, food supply chains and the economy at large. Mapping and quantifying such disruptions, although key for aid planning, remains a challenge in war zones. This study uses daytime and night-time satellite data from Syria over 1998-2019 to assess the link between war-induced impacts on infrastructure and urban areas with cropland dynamics.

Traditional methods are easily affected by ground object interference, noise interference and other factors, and problems such as missing detection and false detection are prone to occur in the process of cloud detection. In addition, due to insufficient edge information extraction capabilities, traditional methods have very rough segmentation results for cloud and cloud shadow boundaries. In order to improve the accuracy of cloud and cloud shadow detection, a Multi-scale Strip Pooling Feature Aggregation Network is proposed. This method uses the residual network as the backbone to extract different levels of semantic information. And, in order to improve the multi-scale information extraction ability of the network, an Improved Pyramid Pooling module is introduced to mine deep multi-scale semantic information. Then, the Mutual Fusion module is used to guide the fusion of different levels of information. Finally, in view of the problem of rough segmentation boundaries in traditional methods, the Strip Boundary Refinement module is used to repair the boundary information of clouds and cloud shadows. The experimental results conducted on the datasets collected by Landsat-8, Sentinel-2 and a public dataset HRC_WHU show that this method is superior to the existing methods.

TI  - Surgical Management of Axilla of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer in the Z1071 Era: A Propensity Score-Matched Analysis of the National Cancer Database
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The role of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients who present with clinical N1 (cN1) disease and undergo complete clinical response (cCR) to neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NAST) remains unclear. We aimed to study the outcomes of SLNB versus axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in this setting. Patients and Methods Patients with cN1 TNBC who showed cCR to NAST were selected from the National Cancer Database (NCDB), and propensity score matched 1:1 between SLNB and ALND in all-comers, ypN0, and ypN1 subgroups. Overall survival (OS) was compared using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox regression was used to identify predictors of OS. Results Of the 2953 patients selected. 1062 (36.0%) underwent SLNB and 1891 (64.0%) underwent ALND. There was a chronological increase in national SLNB utilization (from 20% in 2012 to 46% in 2017). One thousand three patients were propensity matched between SLNB and ALND, and no OS difference was noted (81.73 +/- 1.04 vs. 80.07 +/- 0.70 months; p = 0.127). In the ypN0 subgroup, 884 pairs were matched and no significant OS difference was found (85.29 +/- 0.84 vs. 82.60 +/- 0.68 months; p = 0.638). In ypN+ patients, 129 pairs were matched and demonstrated a trend toward decreased OS with SLNB (64.37 +/- 3.12 vs. 72.45 +/- 72.45; p = 0.085). Cox regression identified age, inner tumors, advanced T stage, partial/no in-breast response, and nodal status as unfavorable predictors of OS. Definitive axillary surgical procedure was not a predictor in the final model. Conclusion SLNB and ALND appear to yield comparable OS in cN1 TNBC patients who demonstrate cCR to NAST. Caution should be exercised in ypN1 patients as worse OS could be associated with SLNB.

TI  - Flow-induced vibration of a cantilevered cylinder in oscillatory flow at high KC
T2  - JOURNAL OF FLUIDS AND STRUCTURES
M3  - Article
AB  - Flow-induced vibrations of a cantilevered circular cylinder are measured in sinusoidal, oscillatory, water flows with amplitude of reduced velocity in the range 1.9 <= U-r <= 4.4 and Keulegan-Carpenter number in the range 120 <= KC <= 900 respectively. Flow velocities are measured using laser Doppler anemometry, and forces and moments are measured using a 6-axis load cell; the two-degree-of-freedom (2-DOF) cylinder motions are determined from the measured moments. The dominant type of vibration occurring within the flow half-period is shown to depend mainly on U-r, with predominantly in-line vibration occurring for U-r (sic) 2.7, figure-8 vibration occurring for 2.7 (sic) U-r (sic) 4, and transverse vibration occurring for U-r (sic) 4. In-line vibration frequency, f(x) , is close to, or slightly higher than the cylinder's natural frequency in still-water, while transverse vibration frequency, f(y), is generally close to the vortex shedding frequency given by Strouhal number St = 0.2. Some unsteadiness is seen in the transverse vibration frequency in that accelerating flow f(y) is consistently higher than decelerating flow f(y) for the same instantaneous reduced velocity u(r) . The most notable unsteady effect is seen in the in-line vibration amplitude, A(x), which is much higher during flow deceleration than during flow acceleration; maximum A(x) occurs at decelerating u(r) approximate to 2 for all three vibration types. Transverse vibration amplitude, A(y), increases with increasing u(r) and shows only slight asymmetry between accelerating and decelerating flow. Experiments with the cylinder placed within a large array of similar cylinders with a spacing between cylinders of six cylinder diameters, show that cylinder vibrations within the array are more variable than those of the isolated cylinder, but exhibit similar average vibration amplitudes and frequencies as the isolated cylinder. An empirical model for unsteady in-line vibration based on theoretical considerations and the experimental data is presented. Model-predicted and measured in-line vibration amplitudes through the flow half-period show good agreement for in-line, figure-8 and transverse vibrations. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Sugarcane Crop Type Discrimination and Area Mapping at Field Scale Using Sentinel Images and Machine Learning Methods
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop mapping and acreage estimation are the simplest yet the most critical issues in agriculture. Remote sensing technology has been extensively used in the past few decades for executing these tasks. The objective of this study is to map sugarcane fields at a catchment level and segregate the plant and ratoon fields using the freely available Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. The study is carried out at the Kisan Sahkar Chini Mill catchment in the Saharanpur district of Uttar Pradesh. The objective was achieved by a two-step process where firstly the sugarcane fields are identified using Random Forest and SVM classifiers over temporal optical and microwave images. The most accurate result is used as a crop mask to separate the plant and ratoon fields. This was achieved by attempting a phenology based classification and spectral based classification. The results revealed that temporal Sentinel-2 data are highly competent in classifying sugarcane at farm level and segregating the plant and ratoon fields. The sugarcane crop mask was created with a kappa coefficient of 0.95 using the SVM classifier, and the plant and ratoon fields were discriminated using the Random Forest classifier with a kappa coefficient of 0.81. The sugarcane crop area was estimated to be approximately 535 acres of plant crop and 560 acres of the ratoon crop while the mill estimate was 520 acres and 540 acres, respectively. The results showed that Sentinel-2 has promising capabilities and is a convenient asset in delineating small-sized farms and classifying sugarcane and its crop types.

TI  - Deep learning-based national scale soil organic carbon mapping with Sentinel-3 data
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping of soil organic carbon (SOC) at the regional level is critical for climate change policy and the mitigation of its adverse effects. However, reliable SOC estimates particularly over a large extent remains a major challenge due to among others limited sample points, quality of simulation data and the algorithm adopted. Remote sensing (RS) strategies have emerged as a suitable alternative to field and laboratory SOC determination, especially at large spatial extent. The use of Sentinel-3 sensor, the latest of the Sentinel series is minimal and has not been fully developed, despite its impressive attributes that include high spectral-temporal resolution and large coverage. Compared to linear and classical ML models, deep learning (DL) models offer a considerable improvement in data analysis due to their ability to extract more representative features and identify complex spatial patterns associated with big data. Yet, there is paucity in literature on the application of DL-based remote sensing strategies for SOC prediction. Consequently, this study adopted a deep neural network (DNN) to predict SOC at a national scale, using Sentinel-3 image, and compared the results with random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) models. The models were trained based on 10-fold cross-validation with 1936 soil samples and 31 predictors. The DNN model generated the best result with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 10.35 t/ha (26 % of the mean), followed by RF (RMSE = 11.2 t/ha), ANN (RMSE = 11.6 t/ha) and SVM (RMSE = 13.6 t/ha). The analytical prowess of the DNN, together with its ability to handle big data by learning patterns through a series of hidden layers (10) to draw conclusions, gives it an edge over other classical ML models. The study concluded that the DNN model with Sentinel-3 data is promising and provides an effective framework for continuous national level SOC modelling.

TI  - Satellite mapping of air temperature under polar night conditions
T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel satellite technique for air temperature mapping with a spatial resolution of similar to 100 m was proposed for the town of Apatity, the Kola Peninsula (Russia), taken as a case study. The main idea behind this novel technique is to find the statistical relationships between the land surface temperatures in each point of the study area, observed by multiple infrared thermal satellite imagery, and the time series of air temperatures recorded by World Meteorological Organization (WMO) weather station. Fourteen scenes of infrared thermal spectral band of the Landsat satellites for the period 2014-2019 were used, as well as the long-term time series of air temperature from the weather station and the results of air temperature observations carried out by the network of loggers. For calm weather conditions, according to the ground truth, the error of air temperature mapping was sigma = 1.5 degrees C, and the precision was estimated as delta = 1.0 degrees C. An analysis of the compiled air temperature map showed that, under polar night conditions, the air temperature on the hilltops was by 10-18 degrees C higher than in the lowlands. It was concluded that, for economic reasons, as well as for the reasons of population health protection in the Arctic, it would be advisable to plan the placement of new cities on the hills. Each of these new areas should be designed in a "semi-isolated" manner in order to minimize the time needed by the local people for crossing the lowlands between the nearby districts. A characteristic feature of modern megalopolises is their internal structure formed by the growing primary settlements that can be considered as nuclei interlinked by transportation routes. Thus, the new Arctic cities can be called "Arctic megalopolises" because of their internal structure that is specific to megalopolises.

TI  - Applying Human-Centered Design Principles to Digital Syndromic Surveillance at a Mass Gathering in India: Viewpoint
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, digital health tools have been deployed by governments around the world to advance clinical and population health objectives. Few interventions have been successful or have achieved sustainability or scale. In India, government agencies are proposing sweeping changes to India's digital health architecture. Underpinning these initiatives is the assumption that mobile health solutions will find near universal acceptance and uptake, though the observed reticence of clinicians to use electronic health records suggests otherwise. In this practice article, we describe our experience with implementing a digital surveillance tool at a large mass gathering, attended by nearly 30 million people. Deployed with limited resources and in a dynamic chaotic setting, the adherence to human-centered design principles resulted in near universal adoption and high end-user satisfaction. Through this use case, we share generalizable lessons in the importance of contextual relevance, stakeholder participation, customizability, and rapid iteration, while designing digital health tools for individuals or populations.

TI  - A new severity classification of lower limb secondary lymphedema based on lymphatic pathway defects in an indocyanine green fluorescent lymphography study
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Most protocols for lymphatic imaging of the lower limb conventionally inject tracer materials only into the interdigital space; however, recent studies indicate that there are four independent lymphatic vessel groups (anteromedial, anterolateral, posteromedial, and posterolateral) in the lower limb. Thus, three additional injection sites are needed for lymphatic imaging of the entire lower limb. We aimed to validate a multiple injection designed protocol and demonstrate its clinical benefits. Overall, 206 lower limbs undergoing indocyanine green fluorescent lymphography with the new injection protocol were registered retrospectively. To assess the influence of predictor variables on the degree of severity, multivariable logistic regression models were used with individual known risk factors. Using a generalized linear model, the area under the curve (AUC) of the conventional clinical model, comprising known severity risk factors, was compared with that of the modified model that included defects in the posterolateral and posteromedial groups. Multivariable logistic regression models showed a significant difference for the posteromedial and posterolateral groups. The AUC of the modified model was significantly improved compared to that of the conventional clinical model. Finding defects in the posteromedial and posterolateral groups is a significant criterion for judging lymphedema severity and introducing a new lymphedema severity classification.

TI  - Quantification of CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from waste disposal sites near the city of Madrid using ground- and space-based observations of COCCON, TROPOMI and IASI
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study is to derive methane (CH4) emissions from three landfills, which are found to be the most significant CH4 sources in the metropolitan area of Madrid in Spain. We derive CH4 emissions from the CH4 enhancements observed by spaceborne and ground-based instruments. We apply satellite-based measurements from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) and the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) together with measurements from the ground-based COllaborative Carbon Column Observing Network (COCCON) instruments.In 2018, a 2-week field campaign for measuring the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases was performed in Madrid in the framework of Monitoring of the Greenhouse Gases Concentrations in Madrid (MEGEIMAD) project. Five COCCON instruments were deployed at different locations around the Madrid city center, enabling the observation of total column-averaged CH4 mixing ratios (XCH4). Considering the prevalent wind regimes, we calculate the wind-assigned XCH4 anomalies for two opposite wind directions. Pronounced bipolar plumes are found when applying the method to NO2, which implies that our method of wind-assigned anomaly is suitable to estimate enhancements of trace gases at the urban level from satellite-based measurements. For quantifying the CH4 emissions, the wind-assigned plume method is applied to the TROPOMI XCH4 and to the lower tropospheric CH4/ dry-air column ratio (TXCH4) of the combined TROPOMI+IASI product.As CH4 emission strength we estimate 7.4 x 10(25) +/- 6.4 x 10(24) molec. s(-1) from the TROPOMI XCH4 data and 7.1 x 10 25 +/- 1.0 x 10 25 molec. s -1 from the TROPOMI+IASI merged TXCH4 data. We use COCCON observations to estimate the local source strength as an independent method. COCCON observations indicate a weaker CH4 emission strength of 3.7 x 10(25) molec. s(-1) from a local source (the Valdemingomez waste plant) based on observations from a single day. This strength is lower than the one derived from the satellite observations, and it is a plausible result. This is because the analysis of the satellite data refers to a larger area, covering further emission sources in the study region, whereas the signal observed by COCCON is generated by a nearby local source. All emission rates estimated from the different observations are significantly larger than the emission rates provided via the official Spanish Register of Emissions and Pollutant Sources.

TI  - Impact of Fine-Mode Fraction on the Relationship Between MODIS AOD and Ground-Based Particulate Matter
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating the mass concentration of near-surface atmospheric particulate matter by using satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) is a commonly used technique nowadays. In this study, moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) AOD, fine-mode fraction (FMF) and near-surface atmospheric particulate matter data (PM2.5 and PM10) from March 2014 to February 2019 in major urban areas of Nanjing, China, were obtained. The differences between impact of FMF on the relationship between AOD and PM2.5/PM10 were discussed under three cases, respectively: (1) classification due to different FMF scores; (2) different weather conditions (fine and haze weather); and (3) different seasons. The results show that FMF had different effects on the estimation of PM2.5 and PM10 in different seasons. PM2.5 estimation was more favorable in summer and winter when FMF is relatively high, and r (correlation coefficient) reached 0.74 and 0.65. In contrast, PM10 estimation was more favorable in spring and autumn when FMF is relatively low, and r reached 0.65 and 0.63. FMF can be used as an indicator of the pros and cons of PM2.5 and PM10 estimation based on AOD.

TI  - Towards a rapid assessment of highway slope disasters by using multidisciplinary techniques
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - Mega-earthquakes and extreme climate events accompanied by intrinsic fragile geology lead to numerous landslides along mountain highways in Taiwan, causing enormous life and economic losses. In this study, a system for rapid slope disaster information integration and assessment is proposed with the aim of providing information on landslide occurrence, failure mechanisms, and subsequent landslide-affected areas to the highway authority rapidly. The functionality of the proposed system is deployed into three units: (1) geohazard rapid report (GeoPORT I), (2) multidisciplinary geological survey report (GeoPORT II), and (3) site-specific landslide simulation report (GeoPORT III). After landslide occurrence, the seismology-based monitoring network rapidly provides the initial slope disaster information, including preliminary location, event magnitude, earthquake activity, and source dynamics, within an hour. Within 3 days of the landslide, a multidisciplinary geological survey is conducted to collect high-precision topographical, geological, and remote-sensing data to determine the possible failure mechanism. After integrating the aforementioned information, a full-scale three-dimensional landslide simulation based on the discrete element method is performed within 10 days to reveal the failure process and to identify the areas potentially affected by subsequent disasters through scenario modeling. Overall, the proposed system can promptly provide comprehensive and objective information to relevant authorities after the event occurrence for hazard assessment. The proposed system was validated using a landslide event in the Central Cross-Island Highway of Taiwan.

M3  - Article
AB  - Net primary productivity (NPP) is a critical component in terrestrial ecosystem carbon cycles. Thus, quantitatively estimating and monitoring the dynamics of NPP have become key aspects for exploring the carbon cycle of terrestrial ecosystems. Anthropogenic activity, such as urbanization, has significant effects on NPP and increases pressure on the natural resources of a specific region. However, to date, although many studies have focused on the relationship between NPP variation and urbanization, they usually ignored any differences at a long-term spatiotemporal variation of urbanization factors, which led to the insufficient understanding of the urbanization-induced impacts on NPP. As a result, this study effectively explored the spatiotemporal variation of NPP from 2001 to 2012 and its corresponding relationship with urbanization, taking the Hubei Province in China as a case study area. To clarify the degree of urbanization, the spatial distribution and temporal variation of population and gross domestic product (GDP) were simulated based on the elevation-adjusted human settlement index and nighttime lights data. The major results showed that high NPP areas were located in those highlands with widespread woodland, in which the NPP value continued to grow during the period. The low NPP areas were mainly distributed in urban areas, and the NPP value had a continued and visible loss. The population and GDP both had a strong correlation with NPP. The significant negative correlation was concentrated in the center of Hubei, with a dense population and developed economy. In order to further realize their complex relationship, the correlation coefficients between the annual NPP and the two factors from 2001 to 2012 were calculated, and the changing trends were investigated. Overall, the findings of this study may provide a reference for studies on the interaction between ecological environment and socioeconomic processes under the background of global rapid urbanization.

TI  - Combining ground-based and remotely sensed snow data in a linear regression model for real-time estimation of snow water equivalent
T2  - ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Effective water resources management in California relies substantially on real-time information of snow water equivalent (SWE) at basin scale and mountain ranges given that mountain snowpacks provide the primary water supply for the State. However, SWE estimation based solely on remote sensing, modeling, or ground observations does not meet contemporary operational requirements. In this context, this study develops a data-fusion framework that combines multi-source datasets including satellite-observed daily mean fractional snowcovered area (DMFSCA), snow pillow SWE measurements, physiographic data, and historical SWE patterns into a linear regression model (LRM) to improve SWE estimates in real-time. We test two LRMs: a baseline regression model (LRM-baseline) that uses physiographic data and historical SWE patterns as independent variables, and an FSCA-informed regression model (LRM-FSCA) that includes the DMFSCA from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery as an additional independent variable. By incorporating the satellite-observed DMFSCA, LRM-FSCA outperforms LRM-baseline with increased median R-2 from 0.54 to 0.60, and reduced median PBIAS of basin average SWE from 2.6% to 2.2% in the snow pillow SWE cross-validation. LRM-FSCA explains 87% of the variance in the snow course SWE measurements with 0.1% PBIAS, while LRM-baseline explains a lower 81% variance with 1.4% PBIAS, both of which show higher accuracy than SWE estimates from the two operational SWE datasets: the Snow Data Assimilation System (SNODAS, 73% and-2.4%, respectively) and Nationtional Water Model (NWM, 75% and-15.9%, respectively). Additionally, LRM-FSCA explains 85% of the median variance in the Airborne Snow Observatory SWE with-9.2% PBIAS, which is comparable to the LRM-baseline (86% and-11.3%, respectively) and considerably better than SNODAS (64% and 28.2%, respectively) and NWM (33% and-30.1%, respectively). This study shows a substantial model improvement by constraining the geographical and seasonal variation on snow-cover via satellite observation and highlights the values of using multi-source observations in real-time SWE estimation. The developed SWE estimation framework has crucial implications for effective water supply forecasting and management in California, where climate extremes (e.g., droughts and floods) require particularly skillful monitoring practices.

TI  - Hydrodynamic and sediment transport modelling in the Pearl River Estuary and adjacent Chinese coastal zone during Typhoon Mangkhut
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Typhoon Mangkhut, in 2018, was one of the worst typhoons in recent history that has made landfall in the Pearl River Estuary (PRE) China. It swept along the coast of Guangdong Province, causing severe damage to many areas and affecting more than one million people. To study the hydrodynamics and sediment dynamics in different sub-regions of the PRE during the typhoon, we implemented a 3D wave-current-sediment coupled ocean model based on the Semi-implicit Cross-scale Hydroscience Integrated System Model (SCHISM). A series of numerical experiments were conducted to study the variation in suspended sediment concentration (SSC) under different external forcing mechanisms, including tides, waves, river discharges and strong winds. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images, collected after the typhoon landed, were used to assess the simulation results. We found that in the area where the water depth was shallower than 20 m, the increased total suspended sediment concentration was dominated by the regional erosion of fine sediment which was caused by near-bottom wave orbital velocity and bottom shear stress, especially at the four western outlets and along the western coast of the PRE. For the deeper coastal zone, at depths between 20 and 30 m offshore of the western coast, the high total SSC resulted from the contribution of fine sediment transported from the upper and middle estuaries by southwestward advection. A small amount of sand eroded and migrated locally, owing to the corresponding increase in the bottom shear stress. The variation in SSC during the typhoon had a time lag compared with other dynamic conditions, resulting in a maximum 1 h delayed response after the typhoon made landfall. Based on the results of the sensitivity experiments under the same typhoon conditions, we found that, as a result of wave-enhanced bottom shear stress, the SSC values associated with wave-current interaction were significantly higher, by as much as 1.5 and 1.3 times those of simulations without the waves at the surface and near-bottom layers, respectively. This indicated that the sediment resuspension induced by waves was important during typhoon landfall. However, the strong wind-induced current was weakened owing to the joint effect of wave radiation stress and enhanced bottom stress; thus, considering wave effects, the magnitude of the resulting sediment transport rate was smaller than that without considering wave effects, especially in shallow waters. During the approach, landfall and retreat of Typhoon Mangkhut, Lingding Bay experienced two transitions from a slight state of sediment loss to a relatively high state of sediment gain, followed by an even greater state of sediment loss. During an M2 tidal cycle after Typhoon Mangkhut made landfall, the net seaward suspended load sediment transport in Lingding Bay reached 0.37 megatonnes. For the typhoon period covering three M2 tidal cycles, the overall state of suspended load sediment transport in Lingding Bay was sediment loss, with the magnitude of sediment loss on the west side being larger than that of sediment gain on the east side. The magnitude of the overall sediment loss in Lingding Bay would be enlarged unrealistically by approximately 73% if the wave effects were excluded. In each period, the extent of sediment transport between the two sides of the bay was strengthened by the wave-current interaction under typhoon conditions.We determined that the net effect of wave-current interaction and strong wind-induced currents under typhoon conditions was a key factor for erosion, which resulted in SSC-influenced areas being approximately 8.7 and 4.4 times as large as those under normal weather conditions for the surface and near-bottom layers, respectively. The turbidity maximum moved from the West Shoal of Lingding Bay under normal weather to the Modaomen Estuary, which was the most affected area during the typhoon when wave effects were considered. We also showed that the relative location of the typhoon path with respect to the estuary had a more significant effect on erosion than the intensity of the typhoon.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variations of wetland backscatter: The role of water depth and vegetation characteristics in Sentinel-1 dual-polarization SAR observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscatter observations are sensitive to hydrologic conditions and vegetation characteristics of land cover. This study conducted a high spatial-resolution investigation (30-m) on the response of dual-polarization C-band (5.6 cm wavelength) SAR backscatter coefficients (sigma degrees) to temporal changes of surface water depth (d(w)) and spatial variations of vegetation characteristics in the south Florida Everglades wetlands. We investigated (1) linear relationships between s. and dw values, and (2) the effects of vegetation density and morphology on sigma degrees-d(w) relationships. We developed a new method to classify pixels with significant linear relationships of multi-temporal sigma degrees and d(w) (R-2 > 0.5 and p-value <0.04), which were termed "Reliable Scatterer" (RS). RS included positive, negative, and a combination of both positive and negative relationships (corresponding to RS+, RS-, RS +/-, respectively). Our analysis revealed spatially varying vegetation densities and morphologies had a significant impact on RS types, where we found RS+ type pixels for woody vegetation, RS +/- for a mix of medium- and high-density herbaceous vegetation using C-band VV (C-VV) data, and RS for sparse herbaceous vegetation using C-VH data. Overall, our study indicates that C-band dual-polarization backscatter is sensitive to water-depth variations for some vegetation types, and this sensitivity has the potential to serve as a reliable indicator for monitoring water depth in wetland environments.

TI  - Emodin induces apoptosis and suppresses non-small-cell lung cancer growth via downregulation of sPLA2-IIa
T2  - PHYTOMEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Lung cancer has become the principal cause of cancer-related deaths. Emodin is a Chinese herb derived compound extracted from the roots of Rheum officinale that exhibits numerous pharmacological characteristics. Secretory phospholipase A2-IIa (sPLA2-IIa) is overexpressed in cancers and plays an important role in cancer development.Purpose: This study aims to investigate the anti-tumor mechanism of emodin in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Methods: MTT assay was applied to detect the sensitivity of emodin to NSCLC cell line. Flow cytometry was used to examine the effect of emodin on cell cycle distribution and evaluate ROS level and apoptosis. Western blot analysis was utilised to examine the expression levels of sPLA2-IIa, PKM2, and AMPK and its downstream pathways induced by emodin. Enzyme inhibition assay was applied to investigate the inhibitory effect of emodin on sPLA2-IIa. The anticancer effect of emodin was also detected using an in vivo model.Results: Emodin significantly inhibited NSCLC proliferation in vivo and in vitro and was relatively less cytotoxic to normal lung cell lines. Most importantly, emodin inhibited the proliferation of KRAS mutant cell lines by decreasing the expression of sPLA2-IIa and NF-kappa B pathways. Emodin also inhibited mTOR and AKT and activated the AMPK pathway. Furthermore, emodin induced apoptosis, increased the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, and arrested the cell cycle.Conclusion: Emodin exhibited a novel anti-tumor mechanism of inhibiting the proliferation of KRAS mutant cell lines by decreasing the expression levels of sPLA2-IIa and NF-kappa B pathways. Hence, emodin can potentially serve as a therapeutic target in NSCLC.

TI  - Hearing abnormalities in multiple sclerosis: clinical semiology and pathophysiologic mechanisms
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Auditory manifestations from multiple sclerosis (MS) are not as common as the well-recognized sentinel exacerbations of optic neuritis, partial myelitis, motor weakness, vertiginous episodes, heat intolerance, and eye movement abnormalities. This paper discusses four cases of auditory changes, secondary to MS, and describes the first case, to our knowledge, of palinacousis, the perseveration of hearing, despite cessation of the sound stimulus. For each we characterize the initial complaint, the diagnostic work up, and ultimately, underscore the individualized treatment interventions, that allowed us to achieve a remission in all four cases. Individually codifying the treatment regimens served to mitigate, if not to abolish, the clinical derangements in hearing. Special attention is focused upon examination of the clinical manifestations and the pathophysiologic mechanisms which are responsible for them. We further emphasize the differential diagnostic considerations, and physical exam findings, along with the results of laboratory testing, neuro-imaging sequences, and lesion localization. Taken together, such information is germane to organizing cogently coherent strategic treatment plan(s). We believe that this small case series represents a clinically pragmatic example of 'precision medicine'; a principal theme and goal throughout this paper, the achievement of such in MS, but also as an illustration for the assessment and management schema for neuroimmunologic disorders in general.

TI  - Shorter blooms expected with longer warm periods under climate change: an example from a shallow meso-eutrophic Mediterranean lake
T2  - HYDROBIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data from the Climate Change Initiative (CCI) lakes project were used to examine the influence of climate on chlorophyll-a (Chl-a). Nonparametric multiplicative regression and machine learning were used to explain Chl-a concentration trend and dynamics. The main parameters of importance were seasonality, interannual variation, lake level, water temperature, the North Atlantic Oscillation, and antecedent rainfall. No evidence was found for an earlier onset of the summer phytoplankton bloom related to the earlier onset of warmer temperatures. Instead, a curvilinear relationship between Chl-a and the temperature length of season above 20 degrees C (LOS) was found with longer periods of warmer temperature leading to blooms of shorter duration. We suggest that a longer period of warmer temperatures in the summer may result in earlier uptake of nutrients or increased calcite precipitation resulting in a shortening of the duration of phytoplankton blooms. The current scenario of increasing LOS of temperature with climate change may lead to an alteration of phytoplankton phenological cycles resulting in blooms of shorter duration in lakes where nutrients become limiting. Satellite-derived information on lake temperature and Chl-a concentration proved essential in detecting trends at appropriate resolution over time.

TI  - Detection of alteration zones using the Dirichlet process Stick-Breaking model-based clustering algorithm to hyperion data: the case study of Kuh-Panj porphyry copper deposits, Southern Iran
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Detection of hydrothermal alteration zones (HAZs) associated with porphyry copper systems using remote sensing imagery is a crucial stage for discovering high potential zone of ore mineralization. Statistical model-based clustering methods have great potential for automatic and accurate detection of hydrothermal alteration minerals using hyperspectral remote sensing imagery. In this research, the Dirichlet Process based on Stick-Breaking (DPSB) model-based clustering algorithm was implemented to hyperion remote sensing imagery to discriminate HAZs associated with the Kuh-Panj porphyry copper deposit, south, Iran. The DPSB clustering algorithm was implemented and subsequently compared with the k-means algorithm, CLARA clustering, hierarchical clustering, Gaussian finite mixture model (GFMM), Gaussian model for high-dimensional (GMHD) and spectral clustering as well as spectral angle mapping (SAM). Results derived from the DPSB model-based clustering algorithm show 88.6% accuracy in distinguishing propylitic, argillic, advanced argillic, propylitic-argillic and phyllic alteration zones. The DPSB algorithm can be broadly implemented to hyperspectral remote sensing imagery for detecting alteration zones associated with porphyry systems.

TI  - Non-accidental Trauma in Infants: a Review of Evidence-Based Strategies for Diagnosis, Management, and Prevention
T2  - CURRENT TRAUMA REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of Review To provide a resource for providers that may be involved in the diagnosis and management of infant non-accidental trauma (NAT). Recent Findings Infants are more likely to both suffer from physical abuse and die from their subsequent injuries. There are missed opportunities among providers for recognizing sentinel injuries. Minority children are overrepresented in the reporting of child maltreatment, and there is systemic bias in the evaluation and treatment of minority victims of child abuse. Unfortunately, no single, primary preventative intervention has been conclusively shown to reduce the incidence of child maltreatment. Standardized algorithms for NAT screening have been shown to increase the bias-free utilization of NAT evaluations. Every healthcare provider that interacts with children has a responsibility to recognize warning signs of NAT, be able to initiate the evaluation for suspected NAT, and understand their role as a mandatory reporter.

TI  - Automatic calving front extraction from digital elevation model-derived data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Calving Front (CF) is an important parameter to analyse ice sheet dynamics and to measure glacier mass balance. DEM products covering polar regions are critical remote sensing data sources to provide fundamental terrain information for glaciological studies. It is necessary to provide accurate CFs for DEM specific applications, such as mass balance calculation or the substitution of water values with geoid values in the DEM editing process. However, much less attention is paid to automatically delineate CFs from DEM data. In this study, we propose a DEM-based Automatic CF Extraction method (DACE) to efficiently extract the CFs from DEM data. In DACE, a height-sensitive terrain feature is designed to enhance the contrast between the ice sheet and the ocean by combining elevation and roughness information. To improve the CF extraction performance, a two-category image classification based on game theory is proposed that considers the spatial consistency of the feature image created. For validation, DACE was applied to DEM products generated from the single-pass SAR interferometry mission TanDEM-X (TDM) at different posting sizes (12 and 90 m) and to the optical photogrammetrybased Reference Elevation Model of Antarctica (REMA) with a 2 m posting. The proposed algorithm can achieve a CF extraction accuracy of better than 14, 20, and 70 m for the 2-m REMA, 12-and 90-m TDM DEMs, respectively, when compared with the manually delineated CFs. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively extract the CFs from DEM data. DACE can be used to replace water values and edit the DEMs themselves. The CFs extracted from the DEM data can also be used for glacier mass balance calculation with the DEM-based geodetic method and for the temporal analysis of CF changes when multi temporal DEM data are available.

TI  - A Prospective Study Evaluating the Accuracy of Indocyanine Green (ICG) Fluorescence Compared with Radioisotope for Sentinel Lymph Node (SLN) Detection in Early Breast Cancer
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Dual localization methods with blue dye and radioisotope represents the standard method for SLN identification. Side effects of blue dye and problems with access to radioisotope has prompted assessment of alternative tracers. This study has evaluated a combination of indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence with radioisotope for SLN biopsy in early breast cancer.Methods. In a prospective observational study 79 patients scheduled for SLN biopsy underwent dual localization with radioisotope nanocolloid and ICG (0.5%). The primary goal was to assess noninferiority of ICG compared with standard radioisotopic localization. Statistical analysis was performed using Stata (version 15.1).Results. A total of 162 nodes were retrieved from 79 patients with an average nodal count of 2.04 (range 1-4) and an overall identification rate of 98.7% (78/79). Nodal detection rates for ICG alone or combined with radioisotope were 98.1% (151/154) and 73.4% (113/154) respectively. Metastasis were present in 13 nodes, all of which were both fluorescent and radioactive and distributed amongst 13 patients each with a single positive node containing macrometastases (n = 5), micrometastases (n = 6), or isolated tumor cells (n = 2). ICG was noninferior to radioisotope with the lower confidence interval not crossing within the predefined limit. No serious adverse reactions were recorded.Conclusions. These results confirm comparable performance parameters for ICG to the "gold standard" using radioisotope. ICG can reliably be employed as a sole tracer that avoids potential drawbacks of standard tracer agents, including availability and costs of radioisotope.

TI  - World Settlement Footprint 3D-A first three-dimensional survey of the global building stock
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Settlements, and in particular cities, are at the center of key future challenges related to global change and sustainable development. Widely used indicators to assess the efficiency and sustainability of settlement development are the compactness and density of the built-up area. However, at global scale, a temporally consistent and spatially detailed survey of the distribution and concentration of the building stock - meaning the total area and volume of buildings within a defined spatial unit or settlement, commonly referred to as building density - does not yet exist. To fill this data and knowledge gap, an approach was developed to map key characteristics of the world's building stock in a so far unprecedented level of spatial detail for every single settlement on our planet. The resulting World Settlement Footprint 3D dataset quantifies the fraction, total area, average height, and total volume of buildings for a measuring grid with 90 m cell size. The World Settlement Footprint 3D is generated using a modified version of the World Settlement Footprint human settlements mask derived from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery at 10 m spatial resolution, in combination with 12 m digital elevation data and radar imagery collected by the TanDEM-X mission. The underlying, automated processing framework includes three basic workflows: one estimating the mean building height based on an analysis of height differences along potential building edges, a second module determining the building fraction and total building area within each 90 m cell, and a third part combining the height information and building area in order to determine the average height and total built-up volume at 90 m gridding. Optionally, a simple 3D building model (level of detail 1) can be generated for regions where data on the building footprints is available. A comprehensive validation campaign based on 3D building models obtained for 19 regions (similar to 86,000 km(2)) and street-view samples indicating the number of floors for >130,000 individual buildings in 15 additional cities documents that the novel World Settlement Footprint 3D data provides valuable and, for the first time, globally consistent information on key characteristics of the building stock in both, large urban agglomerations as well as small-scale rural settlements. Thus, the new dataset represents a promising baseline dataset for a wide range of previously impossible environmental, socioeconomic, and climatological studies worldwide.

TI  - Gamma irradiation to induce beneficial mutants in proso millet (<i>Panicum miliaceum</i> L.): an underutilized food crop
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Proso millet is a potential crop for food, nutritional security, and sustainable agriculture, particularly in the context of climate change. It is one of the traditional millet crops in cultivation in Tamil Nadu and India. Self-pollinated nature of this crop makes evolutionary process a terminal one and creating variability to broaden the genetic base is important. The objective of the study was to optimize mutagenic dose of gamma mutagen, document types of mutations and identify mutants for high grain yield (GY) and fodder yield (FY), hence to determine the feasibility of gamma mutagenesis in proso millet crop improvement. Materials and methods A mutation breeding program with 10 doses of gamma irradiation, i.e. 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900 and 1000 Gy were imposed on seeds of variety ATL 1, a popular variety in India. Roll paper method, tray method and field evaluation were carried out to determine the LD50 and GR(50) doses. Based on viable mutation frequency in M-2 generation, mutagenic effectiveness and efficiency was estimated. Targeted selection for yield and yield contributing traits was carried out in M-2, M-3 and M-4 generation to identify high yielding mutants. Results The LD50 and GR(50) doses of gamma were estimated to be 418 Gy and 542 Gy, respectively. Based on results from probit analysis, mutagenic effectiveness, mutagenic efficiency and mutation spectrum, the optimum treatment dose of gamma was concluded to be 400 Gy. High frequency, i.e. 10.96% of phenotypic mutants was identified in the M-2 generation. The broad range of mutants identified in M-2 generation had mutations for plant height, plant habit, panicle shape, compactness, and length, days to 50% flowering (DFF), lodging resistance, tillering, leaf phenotype, apiculus color, culm branching, stem and leaf hairiness, sheath pigmentation, seed color and shape and seed coat attachment. Eight high yielding mutant families were isolated in M-4 generation. The mean single plant GY and FY of these mutants ranged between 25 to 51 g and 40 to 68 g respectively while in control it was 15 g and 30 g, respectively. Conclusions The wide spectrum and high frequency of mutations both for qualitative and quantitative traits suggest mutation induction as a promising method for creating novel variations in proso millet. The high yielding mutants identified can be utilized for varietal development both for grain and fodder purpose after further stability and quality evaluations in the advanced generations.

TI  - Potential of Multi-resolution Satellite Imagery Products for Scale Variant Topographic Mapping
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite imagery is an important source for mapping of inaccessible terrain where ground control points (GCPs) are not available. This paper attempts to arrive at a trade-off between spatial resolutions of satellite products versus desired mapping scale (1:250 K to 1:5 K) through a case study around Gadra, Rajasthan, India. The products considered for evaluation of geometric accuracy and topographic mapping capabilities are Worldview-2 (WV), Cartosat-1, ASTER (GDEM and corresponding Imagery) and SRTM DEM with Google Earth image (GE). The methodology developed for co-registration of DEMs based on corresponding imageries could bring all the DEMs to a common framework for further evaluation. The results indicated that WV products can be used for 1:10 K scale mapping. However, Cartosat-1 RPCs require a few GCPs to make it suitable for 1:25 K scale mapping, and GE images can be utilized as an aid for feature identification. Although the open-source ASTER and SRTM DEM has good accuracy, their utilization is questionable due to coarse spatial resolution. For inaccessible terrain, small blocks of high-precision WV products may be utilized to derive prospective/possible GCPs for bundle adjustment of Cartosat blocks. The strategy can be adopted for inaccessible terrain mapping of large area without compromising precision at a reasonable budget.

TI  - Stoneflies in the genus Lednia (Plecoptera: Nemouridae): sentinels of climate change impacts on mountain stream biodiversity
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Review
AB  - Rapid recession of glaciers and snowfields is threatening the habitats of cold-water biodiversity worldwide. In many ice-sourced headwaters of western North America, stoneflies in the genus Lednia (Plecoptera: Nemouridae) are a prominent member of the invertebrate community. With a broad distribution in mountain streams and close ties to declining glacier cover, Lednia has emerged as a sentinel of climate change threats to high-elevation aquatic biodiversity. Lednia tumana, which is endemic to Glacier National Park, USA and the surrounding mountains, is the most well-studied species in the genus and in 2019 became federally protected under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) due to climate-induced loss of meltwater habitats. Three other Lednia species have also been described, and like L. tumana, each is endemic to a mountain region of western North America: Lednia sierra in the Sierra Nevada, Lednia borealis in the Cascade Range, and Lednia tetonica in the Teton Range. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of Lednia ecology, genetics, and physiology, with an emphasis on the conservation outlook for the group and species with similar headwater distributions. We highlight substantial progress made in the last decade to better understand the ecology and evolution of Lednia, including the identification of 140 Lednia-containing streams (an increase from 12 streams in 2010), and a more complete understanding of the degree to which warming streams may imperil species in the genus. In light of the ESA listing of L. tumana, we show that similar conservation threats likely face all extant Lednia species. However, substantial gaps in our knowledge remain, primarily centering around their distributions (and the potential for as yet undescribed species), life history, ecophysiology, and trophic ecology. We conclude by describing pressing questions for Lednia that when addressed will expand knowledge of the genus and its conservation as well as broader understanding of climate risks to mountain stream biodiversity worldwide.

TI  - Estimating actual evapotranspiration at field-to-continent scales by calibrating the CMRSET algorithm with MODIS, VIIRS, Landsat and Sentinel-2 data
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Actual evapotranspiration (ETa) can be estimated using optical remote sensing and meteorological data. Herein we calibrated and applied the CMRSET (CSIRO MODIS Reflectance-based Scaling EvapoTranspiration) model at the continental scale in Australia using five remotely sensed data products with spatial resolutions ranging from 500 m (MODIS, VIIRS), 30 m (Landsat) to 20 m (Sentinel-2), and temporal frequencies ranging from daily (MODIS, VIIRS) to multi-days (Landsat and Sentinel-2). The five remotely sensed data products were used to compute a crop factor (k(c)) based on two vegetation indices which modify Priestley-Taylor potential evapotranspiration estimates (ETp; calculated from nation-wide daily meteorological grids) to obtain ETa. CMRSET was calibrated using daily latent heat observations from 30 eddy covariance flux towers located across Australia, representing a wide variety of land covers and climates. To ensure that CMRSET adequately estimated open water evaporation, daily ETp estimates at six water sites were also added in the calibration network. The calibrated CMRSET model was able to estimate daily ETa observed at the flux towers with a relative Root Mean Squared Error (rRMSE)/coefficient of determination (R-2) ranging between 0.15/0.96 (with Sentinel-2) to 0.26/ 0.93 (VIIRS). Additionally, we independently evaluated the performance of CMRSET by comparing the long-term (5 years or more) differences between mean annual precipitation and ETa with measured streamflow at 638 unimpaired catchments across Australia. The comparison showed a RMSE of 0.50 mm.d(-1) (rRMSE of 0.26) and a R-2 of 0.70. The CMRSET model performed better than or similarly when compared against two global ETa products based on MODIS optical and thermal data. Extending the suite of remotely sensed data products that CMRSET is calibrated with and using a network of sites located across vast climate and geographic ranges, means that CMRSET can now be used to estimate ETa at continental scales with multiple spatial resolutions and temporal frequencies. Compared to other available ETa products, CMRSET is more straightforward to operationalise, requires less data inputs, can capture ETa dynamics in areas with significant direct evaporation such as floodplains and lakes and does not require manual calibration to detect wet and dry pixels.

TI  - Analysis and research of absorbing aerosols in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region
T2  - AIR QUALITY ATMOSPHERE AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) urban agglomeration, the atmospheric particulate matter (PM) pollution has become exacerbated year by year. In an attempt to understand the current condition of aerosol particulate pollution in the BTH region, the temporal and spatial distribution, future trend changes, and potential source areas of absorbing aerosols in the BTH region from 2005 to 2019 were analyzed based on Ozone Monitoring Instrument/Aura Near UV Aerosol Optical Depth and Single Scattering Albedo 1-orbit L2 Swath 13 x 24 km V003 (OMAERUV) daily product data; besides, relevant influencing factors were explored in this study. As per the analysis of results, the ultraviolet aerosol index (UVAI) increased by 3.03% in the time series from 2005 to 2019. Spatially, the absorbing aerosol in the North China Plain was always maintained in a high-value area, and the15-year average annual UVAI value has been as high as 0.45. In the monthly time series, a "V" shape started from January. The peak value of seasonal characteristics reached the highest in winter, followed by autumn and spring, and the lowest in summer. The external potential sources in the BTH region are mainly sand and dust sources generated in the northwest, while those of absorbing aerosols are mainly carbon sources in spring, with the lowest external absorbing aerosols in summer. The potential sources of absorbing aerosols in autumn are relatively complicated. The potential sources of absorbing aerosols are mainly sand and dust sources in the north. The time series of absorbing aerosols mainly showed an anti-continuous rise, and 54.23% of absorbing aerosols indicated an upward trend that would occur in the future. The relationship between absorbing aerosols and PM2.5 is mutual conversion. According to the path coefficient, industrial production activities are important sources of atmospheric absorbing aerosols, and precipitation can reduce the content of absorbing aerosols in the atmosphere caused by industrial production.

TI  - Exploring the potential role of environmental and multi-source satellite data in crop yield prediction across Northeast China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Developing an accurate crop yield predicting system at a large scale is of paramount importance for agricultural resource management and global food security. Earth observation provides a unique source of information to monitor crops from a diversity of spectral ranges. However, the integrated use of these data and their values in crop yield prediction is still understudied. Here we proposed the combination of environmental data (climate, soil, geography, and topography) with multiple satellite data (optical-based vegetation indices, solar-induced fluorescence (SIF), land surface temperature (LST), and microwave vegetation optical depth (VOD)) into the framework to estimate crop yield for maize, rice, and soybean in northeast China, and their unique value and relative influence on yield prediction was assessed. Two linear regression methods, three machine learning (ML) methods, and one ML ensemble model were adopted to build yield prediction models. Results showed that the individual ML methods outperformed the linear regression methods, the ML ensemble model further improved the single ML models. Moreover, models with more inputs achieved better performance, the combination of satellite data with environmental data, which explained 72%, 69%, and 57% of maize, rice, and soybean yield variability, respectively, demonstrated higher yield prediction performance than individual inputs. While satellite data contributed to crop yield prediction mainly at the early-peak of the growing season, climate data offered extra information mainly at the peak-late season. We also found that the combined use of EVI, LST and SIF has improved the model accuracy compared to the benchmark EVI model. However, the optical-based vegetation indices shared similar information and did not provide much extra information beyond EVI. The within-season yield forecasting showed that crop yields can be satisfactorily forecasted at two to three months prior to harvest. Geography, topography, VOD, EVI, soil hydraulic and nutrient parameters are more important for crop yield prediction.

TI  - Toxicological effects of three different types of highly pure graphene oxide in the midge <i>Chironomus riparius</i>
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Graphene oxide (GO) is a carbon nanomaterial used in electronics, biomedicine, environmental remediation and biotechnology. The production of graphene will increase in the upcoming years. The carbon nanoparticles (NPs) are released into the environment and accumulated in aquatic ecosystems. Information on the effects of GO in aquatic environments and its impact on organisms is still lacking. The aim of this study was to synthesise and characterise label-free GO with controlled lateral dimensions and thickness - small GO (sGO), large GO (lGO) and monolayer GO (mlGO) - and determine their impact on Chironomus riparius, a sentinel species in the freshwater ecosystem. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) was evaluated after exposures for 24 h and 96 h to 50, 500, and 3000 mu g/L. GOs accumulated in the gut of C. riparius and disturbed its antioxidant metabolism. We suggest that all types of GO exposure can upregulate of SOD. Moreover, both lGO and mlGO treatments caused LPO damage in C. riparius in comparison to sGO, proving its favourable lateral size impact in this organism. Our results indicate that GOs could accumulate and induce significant oxidative stress on C. riparius. This work shows new information about the potential oxidative stress of these NMs in aquatic organisms.

TI  - Artificial intelligence and remote sensing for spatial prediction of daily air temperature: case study of Souss watershed of Morocco
T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Air temperature (Tair) is a fundamental variable in climate research and climate impact management. Conventional field observations do not accurately capture its spatial distribution due to the sparse and uneven distribution of weather stations, especially in remote areas where the local variability is high. To circumvent this problem, in this study, remote sensing and weather station data were used to estimate Tair in the Souss watershed in Morocco. Two statistical methods, including linear regression and partial least squares (PLS), and four machine learning algorithms, namely k-nearest neighbors, random forest (RF), extreme gradient boost, and Cubist, were used for modeling and predicting Tair and its performance were evaluated using random subsets and cross-validation. Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer predictors, including Terra band 32 emissivity, Terra nighttime land surface temperature, Terra local time of night observation, Aqua band 31 emissivity, Aqua daytime land surface temperature, and Aqua nighttime land surface temperature (ALSTN), and auxiliary inputs, including sky-view, elevation, slope, and hillshade, were used as inputs for modeling. The results showed that the Cubist and RF were the most accurate models (RMSE = 2.09 degrees C and 2.13 degrees C, R-2 = 0.91 and 0.90, respectively), while PLS had the lowest predictive power (RMSE = 2.71 degrees C; R-2 = 0.83). The overall performance of the models for estimating Tair in the study area was generally satisfactory, with RMSE limited to less than 3 degrees C for all models. Nevertheless, the station data reliability was still an issue, with only four of the seven stations marked by complete meteorological data.

TI  - The long-term spatial and temporal distribution of aerosol optical depth and its associated atmospheric circulation over Southeast Africa
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent studies have revealed significant impact of anthropogenic aerosols to both climate and human health. Even though significant efforts have been made across the globe, studies related to aerosols over Southeast Africa remain scanty, hence causing high uncertainty in predicting and understanding the impacts of these aerosols. The present study therefore analyzed long-term spatial and temporal distribution of aerosol optical depth at 550 nanometer wavelength (AOD(550)) over the entire Southeast Africa. Relatively low AOD(550) has been detected over the region in comparison to highly polluted regions across the globe. The highest annual average (>0.2) was observed over Lake Malawi, Zambezi valley, and the coastal areas of Central Mozambique while low annual values were recorded over northeast of Mozambique, and the eastern areas of Zimbabwe. In terms of seasonality, AOD(550) was observed to be high (>0.3) during the dry months of September-October-November (SON) while being low (<0.1) during March-April-May (MAM) and June-July-August (JJA) in most areas. The seasonality of AOD(550) was observed to be highly influenced by changes in seasonal biomass burning and seasonal atmospheric circulation. Statistical analyses revealed an insignificant change of AOD(550) between 2002 and 2020 in most areas of the study domain. Regional open burning of biomass like bush fires and burning of crop residues during the dry months are the main sources of aerosol concentration. Therefore, the present study advocates the regulation and institutionalization of proactive and strategic mechanisms that curtail open burning activities within the region.

TI  - Mahalanobis distance based accuracy prediction models for Sentinel-2 Image Scene Classification
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the years, due to the enrichment of paired-label datasets, supervised machine learning has become a prime component of any problem-solving. Examples include building classifiers for applications such as image/speech recognition, traffic prediction, product recommendation, virtual personal assistant (VPA), online fraud detection and many more. The performance of these developed classifiers is highly dependent upon the training dataset, and subsequently, without human intervention or true labels, the evaluation over unseen observations remains unknown. Using a statistical distance researchers did try to assess the model's goodness-of-fit and compared multiple independent models. Nonetheless, given a train-test split and different classifiers built over the training set, the question 'is it possible to find a prediction error using the relation between training and test set?' remains unsolved. In this article, we propose a generalized statistical distance-based method measuring the prediction uncertainty at a new query point. To be specific, we propose a Mahalanobis distance-based Evidence Function Model to measure the misclassification caused by K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Extra Trees (ET), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models when classifying Sentinel-2 image into six scene classes (Water, Shadow, Cirrus, Cloud, Snow, Other). The performance of the proposed method was assessed over two different datasets: (i) the test set, with an overall mean prediction uncertainty detection of 62.99%, 29.80% and 31.51%, leading to a mean micro-F1 performance of 67.89%, 39.30%, and 38.29% for KNN, ET, and CNN, respectively; (ii) a water-body set, with prediction uncertainty detection of 22.27%, 42.08%, and 27.67%, leading to a micro-F1 performance of 34.70%, 58.96%, and 43.32%, respectively.

TI  - Evaluation of wave retrieval for Chinese Gaofen-3 synthetic aperture radar
T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The goal of this study was to investigate the performance of a spectral-transformation wave retrieval algorithm and confirm the accuracy of wave retrieval from C-band Chinese Gaofen-3 (GF-3) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. More than 200 GF-3 SAR images of the coastal China Sea and the Japan Sea for dates from January to July 2020 were acquired in the Quad-Polarization Strip (QPS) mode. The images had a swath of 30 km and a spatial resolution of 8 m pixel size. They were processed to retrieve Significant Wave Height (SWH), which is simulated from a numerical wave model called Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN). The first-guess spectrum is essential to the accuracy of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) wave spectrum retrieval. Therefore, we proposed a wave retrieval scheme combining the theocratic-based Max Planck Institute Algorithm (MPI), a Semi-Parametric Retrieval Algorithm (SPRA), and the Parameterized First-guess Spectrum Method (PFSM), in which a full wave-number spectrum and a non-empirical ocean spectrum proposed by Elfouhaily are applied. The PFSM can be driven using the wind speed without calculating the dominant wave phase speed. Wind speeds were retrieved using a Vertical-Vertical (VV) polarized geophysical model function C-SARMOD2. The proposed algorithm was implemented for all collected SAR images. A comparison of SAR-derived wind speeds with European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA-5 data showed a 1.95 m/s Root-Mean-Squared Error (RMSE). The comparison of retrieved SWH with SWAN-simulated results demonstrated a 0.47 m RMSE, which is less than the 0.68 m RMSE of SWH when using the PFSM algorithm.

TI  - Exceptional landscape-wide cyanobacteria bloom in Okavango Delta, Botswana in 2020 coincided with a mass elephant die-off event
T2  - HARMFUL ALGAE
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2020, nearly 400 elephants died within the Okavango Delta region in Botswana, creating the worst-ever elephant mass die-off event in history. This catastrophic event was widely blamed on toxic cyanobacterial blooms after lab results showed the presence of toxin-forming cyanobacteria in inland waters of the Delta. However, it did not explain why we saw this mass die-off of elephants in 2020 and not in previous years. We conducted a landscape-wide time-series analysis using freely available European Space Agency's Sentinel-2 and NASA's Landsat-8 satellite data. We used existing bio-optical models, Normalized Difference Chlorophyll Index and Green Line Height, as proxies for chlorophyll-a and phycocyanin (cyanobacteria) concentrations. We found that 2020 was an exceptional year for cyanobacteria blooms in the Okavango Delta region compared to the past three years (2017-2019). Bloom phenology indicated that the cyanobacteria blooms initiated in SeptemberOctober 2019, experienced an exponential growth reaching peak in January-February 2020, and eventually senescing in June 2020. This being a notoriously data-scarce region of the world, we did not have any means to perform site-specific validation of the models. Although magnitude and timeline of the blooms coincided with the timeline of elephant death reports, our study do not confirm it to be the trigger. For the first time, we show the widespread nature of these blooms across the landscape, which may have increased the toxin exposure for elephants. We theorize that 2020 might have been the first year for such a mass die-off event, but it will certainly not be the last because warming trends under changing climate are creating increasingly suitable conditions for these blooms to be pervasive and ubiquitous. Through this preliminary study, we demonstrate the critical need for frequent and comprehensive monitoring of toxic cyanobacterial blooms in the Delta to avoid another such event in the future.

TI  - Wasteland Characterization and Fragmentation Analysis in Korba District (Chhattisgarh, India): A Study-Based Geospatial Data and Spatial Statistical Approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aims to identify the wastelands distribution, fragmentation pattern, and their clusters between 1991 and 2019 in the Korba district of Chhattisgarh. Multi-temporal Landsat satellite data were used to recognize the different classes of wastelands. The landscape fragmentation analysis of wasteland categories was performed through FRAGSTATS v.4.2 in patch analyst. Moran's I and Getis-Ord (G(i)*) statistics were used to identify wasteland clusters and outlier analyses. Most of the wastelands were distributed in the east and north of the district, and there was a decreasing trend observed during the study period. Hotspot and outlier analysis demonstrate the existence of homogeneous and heterogeneous wasteland groups based on their spatial proximity and fragmentation pattern. The present research using satellite-based analysis of wasteland fragments could play a major role in verbalizing strategies for safeguarding native forest areas and degraded wasteland in the Korba district.

TI  - Accelerated change in the glaciated environments of western Canada revealed through trend analysis of optical satellite imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The retreat of mountain glaciers affects mountain hazards and hydrology, and new methods are needed to rapidly map glacier retreat at planetary scales. We automatically map 14,329 glaciers (30,063 km(2)) in British Columbia and Alberta, Canada, from 1984 to 2020 using satellite image archives from the Landsat 4, 5, 7 and 8 missions and reveal an acceleration in area loss that commenced in 2011. Glacier fragmentation, disappearance, and proglacial lake development also accelerated, as did the retreat of glaciers to higher elevations. Our annually-resolved method relies on the existence of previously published and manually validated glacier inventories from the mid-1980s and mid-2000's. Our methods performed well for clean ice glaciers, had occasional errors when proglacial lakes were present, and consistently underestimated the area of debris-covered glaciers. Clean ice glacier area loss accelerated sevenfold between the early [1984-2010] and late [2011-2020] epochs. This acceleration yielded rates of area shrinkage of-49 +/- 7 km(2) a(-1) [early] and -340 +/- 40 km(2) a(-1) [late] with accelerated losses (32-fold increase) for small glaciers on Vancouver Island over the last decade. Glacier fragmentation accelerated from 26 +/- 5.6 fragments a(-1) to 88 +/- 39 fragments a(-1). About 1141 glaciers fell below our 0.05 km2 detection limit and so disappeared from our database, representing a loss of 8%. Proglacial lake area growth accelerated from 9.2 +/- 1.1 km(2) a(-1) to 49 +/- 4.5 km(2) a(-1). We also observed an acceleration in the upwards migration of median glacier elevations for clean ice glaciers from 0.31 +/- 0.08 m a(-1) to 4.7 +/- 0.7 m a(-1). Our workflow demonstrates the advantages of annual resolution glacier inventories and contributes towards the implementation of planetary mapping of glaciers and glacier attributes at annual resolution.

TI  - Aboveground biomass of salt-marsh vegetation in coastal wetlands: Sample expansion of in situ hyperspectral and Sentinel-2 data using a generative adversarial network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands are main components of the "blue carbon" ecosystems in coastal zones. Salt-marsh biomass is especially important regarding climate-change mitigation. Generating high precision biomass maps for evalu-ating the ecological functions of coastal wetlands is essential; however, conducting accurate biomass inversions with limited in situ observations from coastal wetlands is challenging. We propose a generative adversarial network with a constrained factor model (GAN-CF) for expanding limited in situ salt-marsh biomass observa-tions. We used Sentinel-2 images and a deep belief network based on the conjugate gradient method (CG-DBN) for obtaining land-cover maps and the salt-marsh distribution (species: Phragmites australis, Suaeda glauca, Spartina alterniflora, and mixed species dominated by Tamarix chinensis) in the study area. This study bridges in situ hyperspectral and Sentinel-2 multispectral data by a satellite-band equivalent conversion model. The biomass and multispectral data derived from Sentinel-2 were used as input for the proposed GAN-CF model, which produced and constrained the generated samples based on the features (i.e., spectra, vegetation index, and biomass) of the in situ observations. Aboveground biomass (AGB) maps at 10-m spatial resolution were produced by constructing multiple linear regression models (MLRMs) based on the generated samples of each salt-marsh type using Sentinel-2 images. The quantity and richness of the generated samples improved the AGB estimations in the study area. The inversion accuracy of S. alterniflora was significantly improved (RMSE = 3.71 Mg/ha); the estimated AGB was strongly related to the in situ observations (R = 0.923). The estimated AGB was validated using in situ observations. The total amount of salt-marsh AGB in the study area in 2019 was estimated at 2.36 x 10(5) Mg, with 7.95 Mg/ha average. The salt-marsh biomass in decreasing order was as follows: P. australis (12.7 Mg/ha) > S. alterniflora (11.5 Mg/ha) > mixed species (8.97 Mg/ha) > S. glauca (2.18 Mg/ha). The salt-marsh area in decreasing order was as follows: S. glauca (10,410 ha) > P. australis (7320 ha) > mixed species (6740 ha) > S. alterniflora (5240 ha). By a feasibility analysis we estimated the biomass based on the Sentinel-2 data covering the Yellow River delta wetland in May, July, and September 2019 and the Jiaozhou Bay wetland in September 2019 by using the generated samples. The generated samples based on the 2013-2019 in situ ob-servations constitute a salt-marsh biomass database, which can be useful for quantifying the regional carbon storage and ecological restoration monitoring.

TI  - Long-Term Exposure to Ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub>, Sunlight, and Obesity: A Nationwide Study in China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENDOCRINOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundAccumulated researches revealed that both fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and sunlight exposure may be a risk factor for obesity, while researches regarding the potential effect modification by sunlight exposure on the relationship between PM2.5 and obesity are limited. We aim to investigate whether the effect of PM2.5 on obesity is affected by sunlight exposure among the general population in China. MethodsA sample of 47,204 adults in China was included. Obesity and abdominal obesity were assessed based on body mass index, waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio, respectively. The five-year exposure to PM2.5 and sunlight were accessed using the multi-source satellite products and a geochemical transport model. The relationship between PM2.5, sunshine duration, and the obesity or abdominal obesity risk was evaluated using the general additive model. ResultsThe proportion of obesity and abdominal obesity was 12.6% and 26.8%, respectively. Levels of long-term PM2.5 ranged from 13.2 to 72.1 mu g/m(3) with the mean of 46.6 mu g/m(3). Each 10 mu g/m(3) rise in PM2.5 was related to a higher obesity risk [OR 1.12 (95% CI 1.09-1.14)] and abdominal obesity [OR 1.10 (95% CI 1.07-1.13)]. The association between PM2.5 and obesity varied according to sunshine duration, with the highest ORs of 1.56 (95% CI 1.28-1.91) for obesity and 1.66 (95% CI 1.34-2.07) for abdominal obesity in the bottom quartile of sunlight exposure (3.21-5.34 hours/day). ConclusionLong-term PM2.5 effect on obesity risk among the general Chinese population are influenced by sunlight exposure. More attention might be paid to reduce the adverse impacts of exposure to air pollution under short sunshine duration conditions.

TI  - Clinicopathological predictors of finding additional inguinal lymph node metastases in penile cancer patients after positive dynamic sentinel node biopsy: a European multicentre evaluation
T2  - BJU INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To develop a predictive model for additional inguinal lymph node metastases (LNM) at inguinal lymph node dissection (ILND) after positive dynamic sentinel node biopsy (DSNB) using DSNB characteristics to identify a patient group in which ILND might be omitted. Patients and Methods We conducted a retrospective study of 407 inguinal basins with a positive DSNB in penile cancer patients who underwent subsequent ILND from seven European centres. From the histopathology reports, the number of positive and negative lymph nodes, presence of extranodal extension and size of the metastasis were recorded. Using bootstrapped logistic regression, variables were selected for the clinical prediction model based on the optimization of Akaike's information criterion. The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver-operating characteristic curve was calculated for the resulting model. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to evaluate the clinical utility of the model. Results Of the positive DSNBs, 64 (16%) harboured additional LNM at ILND. Number of positive nodes at positive DSNB (odds ratio [OR] 2.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17-4.00; P = 0.01) and largest metastasis size in mm (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.03-1.10; P = 0.001) were selected for the clinical prediction model. The AUC was 0.67 (95% CI 0.60-0.74). The DCA showed no clinical benefit of using the clinical prediction model. Conclusion A small but clinically important group of basins harbour additional LNM at completion ILND after positive DSNB. While DSNB characteristics were associated with additional LNM, they did not improve the selection of basins in which ILND could be omitted. Thus, completion ILND remains necessary in all basins with a positive DSNB.

TI  - Surfactant Protein-A Function: Knowledge Gained From SP-A Knockout Mice
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PEDIATRICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Pulmonary surfactant proteins have many roles in surfactant- related functions and innate immunity. One of these proteins is the surfactant protein A (SP-A) that plays a role in both surfactant-related processes and host defense and is the focus in this review. SP-A interacts with the sentinel host defense cell in the alveolus, the alveolar macrophage (AM), to modulate its function and expression profile under various conditions, as well as other alveolar epithelial cells such as the Type II cell. Via these interactions, SP-A has an impact on the alveolar microenvironment. SP-A is also important for surfactant structure and function. Much of what is understood of the function of SP-A and its various roles in lung health has been learned from SP-A knockout (KO) mouse experiments, as reviewed here. A vast majority of this work has been done with infection models that are bacterial, viral, and fungal in nature. Other models have also been used, including those of bleomycin-induced lung injury and ozone-induced oxidative stress either alone or in combination with an infectious agent, bone marrow transplantation, and other. In addition, models investigating the effects of SP-A on surfactant components or surfactant structure have contributed important information. SP-A also appears to play a role in pathways involved in sex differences in response to infection and/or oxidative stress, as well as at baseline conditions. To date, this is the first review to provide a comprehensive report of the functions of SP-A as learned through KO mice.

T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sentinel lymph node biopsy is the gold standard for axillary assessment of patients with clinically node negative breast cancer. The current internationally accepted methods comprise of the usage of either a radioactive tracer, vital stains or the combination of both. However, in developing countries radioactive tracer is not widely used due to its high cost and limited availability. In addition, the classic retro-areolar blue dye injection has a high failure rate. Objective Our study aimed to assess the efficacy of patent blue dye injection in the upper outer quadrant of the breast after validation by concurrent usage of radioactive nanocolloid, in comparison with the classic retro-areolar injection in identifying the sentinel node. Methods A randomized control study involving 279 patients randomly divided into two groups. In group A lateral injection of 1% patent blue dye (validated by radioactive nanocolloid) was used, while subdermal patent blue dye injection in the retro-areolar space was performed in group B. Results The new technique showed the promising results with lower failure rate (3.4%) in comparison with the classic retro-areolar patent blue injection (13.7%). Conclusions The lateral injection technique can be result in comparable results to the combination technique with the added benefit of being widely available and a cheaper option especially in developing countries.

TI  - The Underlying Process of Prosocial Behavior Among Soldiers: A Terror Management Theory Perspective
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The mortality salience (MS) hypothesis postulates that anxiety elicited by mortality awareness leads people to develop negative emotions toward those who hold values inconsistent with their worldview faith. We explored this hypothesis in a sample of 76 Israeli combat soldiers, who were asked to reflect on either their mortality or dental pain. Subsequently, participants reported their motivation to help a father in need who was either an Arab (outgroup) or a Jewish Israeli (ingroup), as well as their perceptions of threat by Arab Israelis. Regression analysis indicated that mortality reminders intensified soldiers' perception of threat by the outgroup, leading to an increased desire to assist a Jewish-Israeli father, and a decreased motivation to help an Arab-Israeli one. The findings demonstrate the pronounced effects of MS on soldiers involved in frequent combat actions in terms of evoking negative emotions leading to reluctance to help unarmed civilian outgroup members. Recommendations for soldiers' pre-deployment psychoeducation sessions are provided.

T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, a significant amount of research is focused on detecting Marine Debris and assessing its spectral behaviour via remote sensing, ultimately aiming at new operational monitoring solutions. Here, we introduce a Marine Debris Archive (MARIDA), as a benchmark dataset for developing and evaluating Machine Learning (ML) algorithms capable of detecting Marine Debris. MARIDA is the first dataset based on the multispectral Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite data, which distinguishes Marine Debris from various marine features that co-exist, including Sargassum macroalgae, Ships, Natural Organic Material, Waves, Wakes, Foam, dissimilar water types (i.e., Clear, Turbid Water, Sediment-Laden Water, Shallow Water), and Clouds. We provide annotations (georeferenced polygons/ pixels) from verified plastic debris events in several geographical regions globally, during different seasons, years and sea state conditions. A detailed spectral and statistical analysis of the MARIDA dataset is presented along with well-established ML baselines for weakly supervised semantic segmentation and multi-label classification tasks. MARIDA is an open-access dataset which enables the research community to explore the spectral behaviour of certain floating materials, sea state features and water types, to develop and evaluate Marine Debris detection solutions based on artificial intelligence and deep learning architectures, as well as satellite pre-processing pipelines.

TI  - Significance of Lymph Node Metastasis in the Treatment of Gastric Cancer and Current Challenges in Determining the Extent of Metastasis
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The stomach exhibits abundant lymphatic flow, and metastasis to lymph nodes is common. In the case of gastric cancer, there is a regularity to the spread of lymph node metastasis, and it does not easily metastasize outside the regional nodes. Furthermore, when its extent is limited, nodal metastasis of gastric cancer can be cured by appropriate lymph node dissection. Therefore, identifying and determining the extent of lymph node metastasis is important for ensuring accurate diagnosis and appropriate surgical treatment in patients with gastric cancer. However, precise detection of lymph node metastasis remains difficult. Most nodal metastases in gastric cancer are microscopic metastases, which often occur in small-sized lymph nodes, and are thus difficult to diagnose both preoperatively and intraoperatively. Preoperative nodal diagnoses are mainly made using computed tomography, although the specificity of this method is low because it is mainly based on the size of the lymph node. Furthermore, peripheral nodal metastases cannot be palpated intraoperatively, nodal harvesting of resected specimens remains difficult, and the number of lymph nodes detected vary greatly depending on the skill of the technician. Based on these findings, gastrectomy with prophylactic lymph node dissection is considered the standard surgical procedure for gastric cancer. In contrast, several groups have examined the value of sentinel node biopsy for accurately evaluating nodal metastasis in patients with early gastric cancer, reporting high sensitivity and accuracy. Sentinel node biopsy is also important for individualizing and optimizing the extent of uniform prophylactic lymph node dissection and determining whether patients are indicated for function-preserving curative gastrectomy, which is superior in preventing post-gastrectomy symptoms and maintaining dietary habits. Notably, advancements in surgical treatment for early gastric cancer are expected to result in individualized surgical strategies with sentinel node biopsy. Chemotherapy for advanced gastric cancer has also progressed, and conversion gastrectomy can now be performed after downstaging, even in cases previously regarded as inoperable. In this review, we discuss the importance of determining lymph node metastasis in the treatment of gastric cancer, the associated difficulties, and the need to investigate strategies that can improve the diagnosis of lymph node metastasis.

TI  - Immense variability in the sea surface temperature near macro tidal flat revealed by high-resolution satellite data (Landsat 8)
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea surface temperature (SST) is crucial for understanding the physical characteristics and ecosystems of coastal seas. SST varies near the tidal flat, where exposure and flood recur according to the tidal cycle. However, the variability of SST near the tidal flat is poorly understood owing to difficulties in making in-situ observations. The high resolution of Landsat 8 enabled us to determine the variability of SST near the macro tidal flat. The spatial distribution of the SST extracted from Landsat 8 changed drastically. The seasonal SST range was higher near the tidal flat than in the open sea. The maximum seasonal range of coastal SST exceeded 23 degrees C, whereas the range in the open ocean was approximately 18 degrees C. The minimum and maximum horizontal SST gradients near the tidal flat were approximately-0.76 degrees C/10 km in December and 1.31 degrees C/10 km in June, respectively. The heating of sea water by tidal flats in spring and summer, and cooling in the fall and winter might result in a large horizontal SST gradient. The estimated heat flux from the tidal flat to the seawater based on the SST distribution shows seasonal change ranging from-4.85 to 6.72 W/m(2).

The ocean color satellite data with low spatial resolution and high spectral resolution is often used for red tide detection, but is insufficient for the fine-scale red tide detection due to its coarse spatial resolution. To address this problem, a new red tide detection method based on pseudo hue angle (PHA-RI) for high spatial resolution broad band satellite data is proposed in this paper. Different from the standard International Commission on Illumination (CIE) system, the false-color bands of near infrared (NIR), red and green are used to calculate the CIE tristimulus X, Y, Z, instead of the true-color bands of red, green and blue. With this method, the red tide can be easily differentiated from non-red tide water, and the distinction between red tide and non-red tide water is doubled compared to that of true-color bands composite. Experiment results show that the PHA-RI method can effectively detect red tide, with an averaged overall accuracy, F1-score and precision of 92%, 0.92 and 0.92 respectively. Compared with the traditional machine learning method support vector machine (SVM) and spectral index algorithm Gaofen-1 (GF-1) red tide detection index (GF-RI), the proposed algorithm has obvious advantages in red tide detection, especially for the strip distributed red tide. Besides, the proposed algorithm has good applicability, and it is proved to be suitable for the detection of red tides with different dominant species including Noctiluca scintillans, Skeletonema costatum and Heterosigma akashiide. Also, it is applicable to different broad band sensors, such as Chinese satellites GF-1 Wide Field of View (WFV), Haiyang 1D (HY-1D) Coastal Zone Imager (CZI), Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI). The application experiment indicates that the proposed algorithm is effective in red tide detection, and it can successfully detect fine-scale red tide events, which have not been detected by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua due to its coarse spatial resolution. The results also shows the advantages of high spatial resolution satellites in fine-scale red tide detection. This work provides a method for red tide detection using high spatial resolution broad band satellite data.

TI  - Can We Successfully De-Escalate Axillary Surgery in Women Aged ≥ 70 Years with Ductal Carcinoma in Situ or Early-Stage Breast Cancer Undergoing Mastectomy?
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Omission of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in older women with clinically node-negative, hormone receptor-positive (HR+) early-stage breast cancer undergoing lumpectomy is accepted, given established low rates of regional recurrence. The safety of omitting SLNB in women undergoing mastectomy is unknown and may differ depending on extent of breast disease and variation in radiotherapy use.Patients and Methods. From 2006 to 2018, 123 cTis and 328 cT1-2 HR+/HER2- tumors from 410 women aged >= 70 years who underwent mastectomy and SLNB were included (41 bilateral cases). The rate of nodal positivity and effect of nodal positivity on adjuvant therapy use were examined.Results. Median age was 74 years; 21% of patients had positive sentinel lymph nodes, 7% had micrometastases, and 14% had macrometastases. Of cases of cTis tumors, 31% were upstaged to invasive carcinoma; 1% had macrometastases. Fewer cases of cT1 than cT2 tumors had macrometastases [13% (26/200) versus 29% (37/128); p < 0.001]. Eight percent of patients with pT1 tumors (18/228) and 27% of patients with pT2 tumors (30/113) received chemotherapy. Most patients with pT1, pN1 disease (78%; 25/32) did not receive chemotherapy. Rates of locoregional recurrence were similar between patients with cT1 or cT2 tumors with and without nodal metastases (median followup, 4.5 years).Conclusions. Women aged >= 70 years with cTis and cT1N0 HR+/HER2- tumors who underwent mastectomy had low rates of nodal positivity, similar to rates reported for lumpectomy. Given this and the RxPONDER results, omission of SLNB may be considered, as findings are unlikely to alter adjuvant therapy recommendations.

TI  - Detecting White Pine Needle Damage through Satellite Remote Sensing
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Eastern white pines (Pinus strobus L.) of New England forests have been recently impacted by a fungal disease known as White Pine Needle Damage (WPND), causing widespread needle damage. To complement current WPND monitoring methods based on field and aerial detection surveys, we evaluated the potential of satellite remote sensing technology to detect WPND outbreaks. Using Sentinel-2 spectral vegetation indices (SVIs), we directly visualized change overlapping WPND outbreaks and ran Random Forest machine learning classifiers for feature selection and WPND detection and severity classification. Direct visualization of WPND associated change was most effective through the Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII), which captured decreases in vegetation health conditions coinciding with peak WPND symptoms. We obtained good accuracies in binary (WPND vs. Non-WPND) detection (70%) and two-class severity modeling of WPND (75%). The highest accuracies were achieved using imagery from early to late summer. The most selected SVIs for modeling were the Carotenoid Reflectance Index1 (CRI1), the Sentinel-2 Red-Edge Position (S2REP), and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Our results suggest detecting severe WPND through fine resolution remote sensing is feasible. However, more work is needed to determine the effects of spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution of remote sensing data for detecting WPND severity levels.

TI  - Serological evidence of <i>Anaplasma</i> spp., <i>Borrelia burgdorferi</i> and <i>Ehrlichia canis</i> in dogs from the Republic of Korea by rapid diagnostic test kits
T2  - JOURNAL OF VETERINARY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Emergent and re-emergent canine tick-borne infections are attracting increasing attention worldwide. The rise in pet ownership and the close relationship between dogs and their owners are the most concerning factors because dogs may act as competent reservoirs for human tick-transmitted infectious agents.Objectives: This study contributes to the epidemiological surveillance of canine tick transmitted infections with zoonotic risk in the Republic of Korea (ROK) by investigating the seroprevalence of the pathogens, Anaplasma spp., Borrelia burgdorferi, and Ehrlichia canis.Methods: Four hundred and thirty whole blood samples from domestic dogs were collected in seven metropolitan cities and nine provinces in the ROK and tested using SensPERT Ab test kits (VetAll Laboratories (R)) to detect seroreactive animals.Results: The seroprevalence rates identified were 9.8% (42/430) for Anaplasma spp., 2.8% (12/430) for B. burgdorferi, and 1.4% (6/430) for E. canis. The risk factors evaluated in this study that could be associated with the development of a humoral immune response, such as sex, age, and history of tick exposure, were similar. There was only one exception for dogs seroreactive to Anaplasma spp., where the risk factor "tick exposure" was statistically significant (p = 0.047).Conclusions: This serological survey exhibited the widespread presence of Anaplasma spp., B. burgdorferi, and E. canis throughout the ROK. Hence, dogs may play a key role as the sentinel animals of multiple zoonotic infectious agents in the country.

TI  - Passive sensing by Sentinel-1 SAR: Methods and applications
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the TOPSAR acquisition mode, Sentinel-1 sensors acquire some data in passive mode, with a periodicity of approximately one second. These data provide valuable information about scene brightness and Radio Frequency pollution. This paper reviews the method to extract these passively sensed data and identify Radio Frequency Interferences (RFI). Two sets of measurements are generated by back-projecting passively sensed data on the ground, generating Earth Brightness Temperature (BT) and RFI equivalent temperature. A proper calibration has been implemented thanks to AMSR-2 data. The paper shows the result of one year of data collection from Sentinel 1 A and B regarding RFI and BT. We discuss the stability of the systems and the accuracy of the measurements by cross-comparing results from the two sensors, and we show how this information can be exploited for precise SAR data denoising and RFI mitigation.

TI  - Histopathological growth distribution of ductal carcinoma in situ: tumor size is not "one size fits all"
T2  - GLAND SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a group of preinvasive breast neoplasms. Studies have shown excellent survival among patients with lumpectomy-amenable disease. Patients requiring mastectomy have been less well characterized. We aim to characterize this cohort and identify whether growth distribution pattern is associated with sentinel lymph node involvement at time of surgery or subsequent development of metastatic disease. Methods: Patients were identified using local cancer registry data and were chart reviewed using electronic medical records. Growth pattern was classified as unifocal, multifocal, or diffuse. Chi-squared, Analysis of variance (ANOVA), and Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed. Results: Two hundred and twenty-six patients were identified with median age at diagnosis 49 and follow up 7.1 years. 42 had unifocal, 51 had multifocal and 20 had diffuse lesions. 3/20 patients with diffuse type lesions developed subsequent distant metastatic disease, while none of the patients with unifocal or multifocal lesions did. 1/20 patients with diffuse and 2/51 with multifocal disease had sentinel lymph node involvement (SLNI) at surgery. Tumor extent was not associated with sentinel lymph node involvement or distant metastatic disease (P=0.2, Kaplan-Meier analysis) but growth pattern was (P=0.01). It was also associated on Kaplan-Meier with development of distant metastatic disease alone (P=0.01). Conclusions: Patients with diffuse growth pattern DCIS were more likely to have SLNI or development of distant metastatic disease. Our findings suggest that patients with diffuse type lesions are at greater risk of metastatic disease and therefore breast cancer death from DCIS. Optimal therapy for these patients will need further elucidation.

AB  - Minimum Quantity Lubrication is an appropriate choice for machining since it is cleaner and more sustainable compared to conventional coolants. In this study, the performance of different oils in the turning of aluminium 6061 with minimal quantity lubrication (MQL) is compared to machining under dry circumstances. The MQL condition was studied using vegetable oil and hydraulic oil. Cutting speed, feed rate, and depth of cut (D.O.C.) are all changed in the experiment, and two values of each parameter are utilised. For the study, authors evaluated cutting performance in terms of force component (Fx,Fy, Fz) and Surface Roughness (Rc) along with chip shapes. The results show that the MQL utilizing vegetable and hydraulic oils produces a higher surface finish. Based on the outcomes. The MQL condition outperformed the others. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

T2  - ICARUS
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral images collected by remote sensing have played a significant role in the discovery of aqueous alteration minerals, which in turn have important implications for our understanding of the changing habitability on Mars. Traditional spectral analyzes based on summary parameters have been helpful in converting hyperspectral cubes into readily visualizable three channel maps highlighting high-level mineral composition of the Martian terrain. These maps have been used as a starting point in the search for specific mineral phases in images. Although the amount of labor needed to verify the presence of a mineral phase in an image is quite limited for phases that emerge with high abundance, manual processing becomes laborious when the task involves determining the spatial extent of detected phases or identifying small outcrops of secondary phases that appear in only a few pixels within an image. Thanks to extensive use of remote sensing data and rover expeditions, significant domain knowledge has accumulated over the years about mineral composition of several regions of interest on Mars, which allow us to collect reliable labeled data required to train machine learning algorithms. In this study we demonstrate the utility of machine learning in two essential tasks for hyperspectral data analysis: nonlinear noise removal and mineral classification. We develop a simple yet effective hierarchical Bayesian model for estimating distributions of spectral patterns and extensively validate this model for mineral classification on several test images. Our results demonstrate that machine learning can be highly effective in exposing tiny outcrops of specific phases in orbital data that are not uncovered by traditional spectral analysis. We package implemented scripts, documentation illustrating use cases, and pixel-scale training data collected from dozens of well-characterized images into a new toolkit. We hope that this new toolkit will provide advanced and effective processing tools and improve community's ability to map compositional units in remote sensing data quickly, accurately, and at scale.

TI  - OClO as observed by TROPOMI: a comparison with meteorological parameters and polar stratospheric cloud observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorine dioxide (OClO) is a by-product of the ozone-depleting halogen chemistry in the stratosphere. Although it is rapidly photolysed at low solar zenith angles (SZAs), it plays an important role as an indicator of the chlorine activation in polar regions during polar winter and spring at twilight conditions because of the nearly linear dependence of its formation on chlorine oxide (ClO).Here, we compare slant column densities (SCDs) of chlorine dioxide (OClO) retrieved by means of differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) from spectra measured by the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) with meteorological data for both Antarctic and Arctic regions for the first three winters in each of the hemispheres (November 2017-October 2020). TROPOMI, a UV-Vis-NIR-SWIR instrument on board of the Sentinel-5P satellite, monitors the Earth's atmosphere in a near-polar orbit at an unprecedented spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio and provides daily global coverage at the Equator and thus even more frequent observations at polar regions.The observed OClO SCDs are generally well correlated with the meteorological conditions in the polar winter stratosphere; for example, the chlorine activation signal appears as a sharp gradient in the time series of the OClO SCDs once the temperature drops to values well below the nitric acid trihydrate (NAT) existence temperature (TNAT). Also a relation of enhanced OClO values at lee sides of mountains can be observed at the beginning of the winters, indicating a possible effect of lee waves on chlorine activation.The dataset is also compared with CALIPSO Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) polar stratospheric cloud (PSC) observations. In general, OClO SCDs coincide well with CALIOP measurements for which PSCs are detected.Very high OClO levels are observed for the northern hemispheric winter 2019/20, with an extraordinarily long period with a stable polar vortex being even close to the values found for southern hemispheric winters. An extraordinary winter in the Southern Hemisphere was also observed in 2019, with a minor sudden stratospheric warming at the beginning of September. In this winter, similar OClO values were measured in comparison to the previous (usual) winter till that event but with a OClO deactivation that was 1-2 weeks earlier.

TI  - A novel model to estimate sensible heat fluxes in urban areas using satellite-derived data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel model for estimating sensible heat flux in urban areas using satellite data is presented here. Sensible heat flux (Q(H)) is a primary component of the urban surface energy budget and is critical to regulating air temperature in cities. The model employs data from the NASA & NOAA GOES-16 geostationary satellite, ground-based observations from NOAA Automated Surface Observation Stations (ASOS), and land cover data from the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) as inputs for an iterative algorithm that is based on surface-layer similarity theory for turbulence parameterization. The application of this model specifically to urban areas is enabled by the spatial extent of the GOES-16 satellite and an element roughness height estimation method based on NLCD land cover data. Model results were independently validated using three flux towers located in different areas of New York City. Statistics generated over a year-long validation period from June 2019 to May 2020 show a root mean-square error (RMSE) of 47.32 W-m(-2), a mean bias error (MBE) of 16.58 W-m(-2), and an R-2 correlation value of 0.70. Model results were also compared to results from the urbanized Weather Research and Forecasting (uWRF) model relative to flux tower observational data to allow for a comparison between numerical models. The dedicated Q(H) model outperformed the uWRF model relative to observational data, with an RMSE reduction of 63.5 W-m(-2), an MBE reduction of 17.5 W-m(-2), and an R-2 increase of 0.08. Validation results show good agreement between model and observed values and performance comparison results show an improvement over a current numerical method for estimation of Q(H), suggesting the use of satellite data as a cost-effective and accessible option for estimating Q(H) in urban areas.

TI  - Developing pedotransfer functions using Sentinel-2 satellite spectral indices and Machine learning for estimating the surface soil moisture
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To estimate the surface soil moisture (SM) using a combination of new spectral indices and methods of Random Forrest (RF) and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), 11 pedotransfer functions (PTF1-11) were developed by combining basic soil properties (clay, silt/sand, and bulk density) and spectral indices of Sentinel-2 satellite. In this study, 124 surface soil samples were randomly taken from three regions including Telo in Tehran province, Ivaneki in Semnan province, and Borujerd in Lorestan province, Iran. The results showed that the accuracy of the RF method was considerably higher compared to the MLR method. The SM was better estimated using water spectral indices (such as Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and Surface Water Capacity Index (SWCI)), along with the basic properties of soil as inputs of PTF7. In the training and testing steps, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) decreased from 0.041 and 0.05 (cm3 cm-3) in PTF1 to 0.028 and 0.039 in PTF7, respectively. The average values of RMSE, Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), coefficient of determination (R2) and Relative Improvement (RI) of the RF method were 0.028 (cm3 cm-3), -559, 0.79 and 0.001, and 0.038 (cm3 cm-3), -279, 0.73 and -0.006 for the training and testing steps of all PTFs, respectively. While, these values for the MLR method were 0.032 (cm3 cm-3), -542, 0.69 and 0.0003, and 0.043 (cm3 cm-3), -269, 0.63 and 0.002 for the training and testing steps, respectively. Due to the low values of MBE, it was possible to disregard the overestimation of the results. The evaluation of results for predictor importance indicated that among the basic properties, clay percent has a significant effect on estimation of SM. These results show that spectral indices alone are not suitable estimators for SM estimation. It suggests using basic soil properties and spectral indices to estimate the SM.

TI  - Urban growth and quality of life: inter-district and intra-district analysis of housing in NCT-Delhi, 2001-2011-2020
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - One out of three people in India is urban. In 2011, there were about 53 urban agglomerations larger than 1 million population as against only 35 in 2001. Much of this urban expansion has been occurring in the country's largest metropolises including the National Capital Territory of Delhi which has expanded horizontally and vertically both. This has also added to overall decline in its already dilapidated housing stock and quality of life. Delhi, a historical hub for regional, national, and international commerce, and a place for the socio-political elites, has failed to provide basic life amenities to its average citizens. This research critiques the (un)sustainable elements of Delhi's urbanization and concomitant decline in basic amenities pertaining to quality-of-life by examining the growth and expansion of its urban-built-up areas during 2001-2011-2020 and provides nuanced insights into its 'livability' by examining select quality-of-life attributes. The LANDSAT imageries for 2010 and 2020 are used to measure NDB-Index that assesses its built-up area and change, which are later corroborated with Census household data to examine change in its 'livable' and 'dilapidated' housing structures. Significant sub-regional disparity exists in the availability of good and livable homes, with almost 20-30% of several districts still without drinking water source inside premises. However, significant progress is also noted for basic amenities like lighting, latrine and bathing facilities, and majority of Delhi's built-up area has expanded along newer developments and transportation corridors. This calls for goal-oriented strategic interventions by policymakers to help achieve the SDG-11 on Sustainable Cities.

TI  - Evaluating the utility of protected area status and conservation legislation in tropical forest conservation using satellite data: a case study of the great hornbill in Thailand
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Preserving wildlife and their environment from anthropogenic activities requires identification and establishment of protected areas, and monitoring of their long-term effects on wildlife and habitat. Tropical forests are one of the most at-risk habitats and many tropical species have become extinct recently due to human activity. It is imperative to monitor habitat in protected areas and without in order to identify strategies and legislative policies that optimize conservation outcomes. To this end, I quantified habitat fragmentation for the great hornbill (Buceros bicornis) in Om Koi Wildlife Sanctuary, Thailand, pre- and post-establishment, within and outside the protected area, from 1973, 1985, and 1992, to assess the effectiveness of the protected area status, established in 1978, and a national logging ban, established in 1989, in preserving and restoring hornbill habitat. The results demonstrate that the establishment of Om Koi Wildlife Sanctuary did not decrease the rate of hornbill habitat fragmentation relative to areas outside the protected area. While the protected area had less fragmentation to begin with, protection status did not affect the rate of loss. Fragmentation increased significantly both inside and outside the protected area between the first and second time points (p < 0.05), after the protected area was first established. However, the national logging ban policy implemented in 1985 seems to have successfully halted the fragmentation of habitat within the protected area and surrounding unprotected areas, with all areas showing no significant change (p > 0.05). While not significant, the rate of fragmentation outside the protected area was greater. This suggests that the establishment of a protected area alone may not be sufficient to stop or reverse anthropogenic damage to endangered habitat and the species that utilize these environments. The incorporation of multiple strategies for management is likely needed to increase the ability of protected areas to preserve tropical forest species and habitats. The assessment of protected areas via satellite and ground-level data is an essential tool for evaluating the effectiveness of conservation strategies and improving outcomes.

TI  - Long-term spatiotemporal trends in aerosol optical depth and its relationship with enhanced vegetation index and meteorological parameters over South Asia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based aerosol optical depth (AOD) is columnar light extinction by aerosol absorption and scattering and has become the most important variable for the assessment of the spatiotemporal distribution of aerosols at a regional and global level. In this paper, we have used AOD observations of multiangle imaging spectroradiometer (MISR) from September 2002 to May 2017, moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) from September 2002 to December 2020, and seaviewing wide field-of-view sensor (SeaWiFS) from September 2002 to December 2010 over South Asia. We have observed the association of AOD with enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and meteorological variables (temperature (TEMP), wind speed (WS), and relative humidity (RH)) acquired from Giovanni during the period September 2002-December 2020. The satellite observations of Terra-, MISR-, and SeaWiFS-AOD were also compared with Aqua-AOD. The findings show that AOD in eastern Pakistan is higher than in the western Pakistan due to increase in population density and biomass burning. Mean annual peak AOD ((>)0.7) has been observed over the IGB region because of the significant increase in economical, industrial, and agricultural activities while AOD of (>)0.6 is observed over Bangladesh. The lowest mean annual AOD of (<)0.3 is observed over northeastern Afghanistan, western Nepal, and Bhutan whereas the AOD of 0.3 is seen over Sri Lanka. The highest seasonal mean AOD of 0.8 has been seen over Bihar, India, and AOD of similar to 0.7 is observed over Bangladesh while the lowest AOD is observed over Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Bhutan during the winter season. However, the mean AOD over eastern Pakistan is maximum in both monsoon and post-monsoon season but relatively low in pre-monsoon and winter. The highest positive seasonal AOD anomalies were observed over South Asia in winter season followed by post-monsoon, pre-monsoon, and least being monsoon. The higher mean AOD anomaly value is found to be 0.2 over eastern Pakistan and western India. In northeastern Pakistan and central India, AOD and RH are positively correlated (r(>)0.54) while negatively correlated over Afghanistan, southwestern region of Pakistan, eastern India, Nepal, Bhutan, and Bangladesh. AOD is negatively correlated (r = similar to - 0.3) with EVI over eastern Pakistan and western India. The highest correlation coefficient (r) obtained among Terra and Aqua is 0.97, MISR and Aqua is 0.93, and SeaWiFS and Aqua is 0.58 over South Asia.

TI  - Immunohistochemical analysis of a hypoxia-associated signature in melanomas with positive and negative sentinel lymph nodes Hypoxia-associated signature of primary cutaneous melanomas
T2  - HAUTARZT
M3  - Article
AB  - Metabolic reprogramming mediated by hypoxia-inducible factors and its downstream targets plays a crucial role in many human malignancies. Excessive proliferation of tumor cells under hypoxic conditions leads to metabolic reprogramming and altered gene expression enabling tumors to adapt to their hypoxic environment. Here we analyzed the metabolic signatures of primary cutaneous melanomas with positive and negative sentinel node status in order to evaluate potential differences in their metabolic signature. We found a positive correlation of the expression of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1) with tumor thickness and ulceration in all melanomas with subgroup analyses as well as in the subgroup with a negative sentinel node. Furthermore, the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was positively correlated with the presence of ulceration in melanomas with positive sentinel node.

TI  - Exploratory Structural Equation Modeling: Practical Guidelines and Tutorial With a Convenient Online Tool for Mplus
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Critics of positive psychology have questioned the validity of positive psychological assessment measures (PPAMs), which negatively affects the credibility and public perception of the discipline. Psychometric evaluations of PPAMs have shown that various instruments produce inconsistent factor structures between groups/contexts/times frames, that their predictive validity is questionable, and that popular PPAMs are culturally biased. Further, it would seem positive psychological researchers prioritize date-model-fit over measurement quality. To address these analytical challenges, more innovative and robust approaches toward the validation and evaluation of PPAMs are required to enhance the discipline's credibility and to advance positive psychological science. Exploratory Structural Equation Modeling (ESEM) has recently emerged as a promising alternative to overcome some of these challenges by incorporating the best elements from exploratory- and confirmatory factor analyses. ESEM is still a relatively novel approach, and estimating these models in statistical software packages can be complex and tedious. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to provide novice researchers with a practical tutorial on how to estimate ESEM with a convenient online tool for Mplus. Specifically, we aim to demonstrate the use of ESEM through an illustrative example by using a popular positive psychological instrument: the Mental Health Continuum-SF. By using the MHC-SF as an example, we aim to provide (a) a brief overview of ESEM (and different ESEM models/approaches), (b) guidelines for novice researchers on how to estimate, compare, report, and interpret ESEM, and (c) a step-by-step tutorial on how to run ESEM analyses in Mplus with the De Beer and Van Zy ESEM syntax generator. The results of this study highlight the value of ESEM, over and above that of traditional confirmatory factor analytical approaches. The results also have practical implications for measuring mental health with the MHC-SF, illustrating that a bifactor ESEM Model fits the data significantly better than any other theoretical model.

TI  - Coupling Relationship of Human Activity and Geographical Environment in Stage-Specific Development of Urban Coastal Zone: A Case Study of Quanzhou Bay, China (1954-2020)
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Owing to the development of the social economy, the geographical environment and ocean utilization patterns of urban coastal zones have changed. This change, in turn, has influenced the socio-economic development of urban coastal zones. Based on the Geographic Information System technology, the area, coastline length, and shoreland use function of reclamation areas were obtained from the geographic charts (1954-2020) and remote sensing data (1988-2017) of Quanzhou Bay. In this study, we analyzed the geomorphologic change process and the relationship between land use patterns and economic development in Quanzhou Bay from the perspectives of hydrodynamics, sediments, and human activity. Our results indicated that over the past 70 years, the bay area has reduced by 21.5%. The length of the coastline decreased from 208.36 km in 1959 to 149.11 km in 1988, whereas the shape index of the bay (SIB) decreased from 3.09 to 2.41 during the same period. Between 1988 and 2017, the coastline increased to 162.91 km, causing the SIB to increase to 2.72. The artificial index of the bay increased from 0.28 in 1959 to 0.90 in 2017. The intensity of bay the development (IBD) first increased from 0.27 in 1959 to 0.77 in 2006. During the transition to a more modern society (2006 to present), the IBD slightly decreased to 0.73 in 2017. Affected by human activity, the transformation of the reclaimed land in Quanzhou Bay can be divided into four stages that are closely linked to the economic development in the region. In the early industrialization period, reclaimed land in the region was used for agricultural production, whereas in the mid-industrialization period, it was gradually transformed into a combination of industrial (29.8%) and agricultural (56.1%) lands. In the later period of industrialization, the reclaimed land was gradually converted into urban industrial and port lands. Finally, with further refinement and upgrading of economic and industrial structures, the socio-economic and environmental benefits from coastal reclamation projects have been increasing, whereas the proportion of economic benefits (in the total benefits) has been decreasing. The results of this study can provide decision-making references for the optimization of utilization patterns and the economic development of reclamation lands in coastal areas.

TI  - Modification of Land Use/Land Cover and Its Impact on Groundwater in Peshawar City, Pakistan
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover modifications have been undergoing at a hasty pace across the world. The dynamics of growth and change in land use in Peshawar City during the period 1991-2014 was studied utilizing GIS and remote sensing technologies. Using Landsat TM imageries, this study examined land use alterations in urban and peri-urban Peshawar and their impact on ground water. Beside this, the study used temporal and spatial dataset of water table for the year 1991 and 2014 that were gathered from Water and Works Department Peshawar, Pakistan. This study also used Cellular Automata-Markov (CA-Markov model) to predict the future change in built up area up to 2044 on the basis of past trend (1991-2014) and its impact on the encroachment or loss of agricultural land as well as the level of ground water. The past trend of fluctuation of groundwater (in feet) with the expansion in size of built-uses was also used to predict future trend in ground water depletion. The most severe impact in terms of groundwater depletion will take place in the southern parts of the city. The sharp decrease of groundwater table was observed in the central parts of the city compared to the peripheries. If this declining trend of groundwater level continues that might put an amplified stress on underground aquifers and may trigger to land subsidence or other environmental hazards.

TI  - Assessment of correlation amongst physico-chemical, topographical, geological, lithological and soil type parameters for measuring water quality of Rawal watershed using remote sensing
T2  - WATER SUPPLY
M3  - Article
AB  - The quality of water is traditionally assessed by the collection of physico-chemical parameters, i.e., pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen of the water bodies. However, the variations in environmental factors may have an impact on the quality of water, as changes in these attributes may affect the water bodies. These factors include the topographical, geological, lithological and soil type parameters of the watershed. In this study, the relationship amongst the physico-chemical, topographical, geological, lithological and soil type parameters of Rawal watershed was evaluated. The parameters included in the present study could be classified as follows: (a) water quality parameters (b) topographical parameters, (c) geological parameters, (d) lithological parameters, and (e) soil type parameters. Water quality parameters consisted of dissolved oxygen, pH, turbidity and temperature. The topographical parameters include the slope and aspect of the watershed while the lithological, geological and soil type parameters include the lithology, geology and soil type of the watershed. Pearson's correlation was used to determine the relationship amongst these different parameters. The results have revealed that the correlations of the topographical, lithological, geological parameters with the water quality parameters in the Rawal watershed for the monsoon seasons of June to August mostly have the same trend. Throughout the four year time period, turbidity and temperature parameters had positive correlations with soil type (ranging 0.03-0.24), however had weak correlation with geological and lithological parameters. Dissolved oxygen did not show any relationship with topographical and lithological parameters. The results for pH show that it has weak to fair positive correlations with topographical parameters. However, this analysis is based on the Landsat 8 images extracted for the monsoon seasons of the years of 2017-2020, and to examine a more prominent impact of geographical or environmental factors on the physico-chemical features, a large dataset should be considered.

TI  - UAV-based remote sensing in plant stress imagine using high-resolution thermal sensor for digital agriculture practices: a meta-review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Water management is becoming a critical issue for sustainable agriculture, especially in the semi-arid region, where problems with water scarcity are rising. More accurate water status recovery in crops is required for precise irrigation through remote sensing technologies. These technologies have a lot of potential in intelligent irrigation because they allow for real-time environmental data collection. Nowadays, digital practices have been used, such as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), which plays an essential role in various applications related to crop management. Drones offer an exciting opportunity to track crop fields with high spatial and temporal resolution remote sensing to enhance water stress management in irrigation. Farmers have historically depended on soil moisture measurements and weather conditions to detect crop water status for irrigation scheduling. This review paper summarizes the use of UAV remote sensing data in crops for estimating the water status and gives a detailed summary of the potential capacity of UAV remote sensing for water stress application. The remote sensing techniques help modify agricultural practices to meet this significant challenge by providing repeated information on crop status at different scales and various performances during the season. UAVs successful implementation in water stress estimations depends on UAV features, such as flexibility of use in flight planning, low cost, reliability, autonomy, and capability of timely provision of high-resolution data. UAV with a thermal sensor is considered the most effective technique for detecting water stress using specific indices. Thermal imaging can identify water status variations and crop water stress index (CWSI). This CWSI acquired through UAV thermal sensors imagery can be acceptable for managing real-time irrigation to achieve optimum crop water efficiency.

TI  - Comparison of field survey and remote sensing techniques for detection of bark beetle-infested trees
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Detection in the early phase of bark beetle infestation is a vital task for proactive management strategies, as practiced in most Central European forests, to minimize economic losses due to bark beetle infestation and to mitigate their further spreading. For this work, remote sensing methods are coming to be in great demand as an objective approach to enable monitoring bark beetle infestation even at individual tree level.This case study monitored bark beetle (Ips typographus) activity at local level in Norway spruce forest in the Czech Republic. The main aim of this study was to compare the remote sensing methods against classical field survey conducted by forest workers in detecting newly infested trees.To compare these two methods, an extensive field and aerial campaign was conducted in the southern part of the Czech Republic during 2020. Bark beetle infestation was monitored by traditional methods (i.e. field survey) on a weekly basis from mid-March to mid-September. During the same period, aerial scans were performed once per month (seven in total) using a CASI-1500 hyperspectral sensor (visible and near-infrared, 400-1000 nm) with spatial resolution of 0.5 m. This work mapped transition from healthy up to red attack of 75 Norway spruce trees that were infested during the same week. The same number of healthy trees were added to the data set for hyperspectral data analysis. Both groups were analysed by vegetation indices, with emphasis on effect caused in the canopy by bark beetles.The success rate for bark beetle detection is always associated with acquisition time. In order to define the optimal time for data acquisition, we employed a phenology model for I. typographus (RITY 2.0) to take into consideration bark beetle development.The results of the experiment showed that classic field survey detected infested trees earlier than did analysis using remote sensing data from the visible and near-infrared region. The difference was 23 days for the most successful indices (i.e. REIP, PRI, and ANCB(650-720)) in our test. Nevertheless, both methods detected the infested trees within 6 weeks after infestation, which is the recommended period for taking measures to prevent bark beetles from spreading further, and thus hyperspectral imagery can be used as a valid information source for bark beetle detection.

TI  - Evaluating performance of multiplex real time PCR for the diagnosis of malaria at elimination targeted low transmission settings of Ethiopia
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Malaria incidence has declined in Ethiopia in the past 10 years. Current malaria diagnostic tests, including light microscopy and rapid antigen-detecting diagnostic tests (RDTs) cannot reliably detect low-density infections. Studies have shown that nucleic acid amplification tests are highly sensitive and specific in detecting malaria infection. This study took place with the aim of evaluating the performance of multiplex real time PCR for the diagnosis of malaria using patient samples collected from health facilities located at malaria elimination targeted low transmission settings in Ethiopia. Methods A health facility-based, cross-sectional survey was conducted in selected malaria sentinel sites. Malaria-suspected febrile outpatients referred to laboratory for malaria testing between December 2019 and March 2020 was enrolled into this study. Sociodemographic information and capillary blood samples were collected from the study participants and tested at spot with RDTs. Additionally, five circles of dry blood spot (DBS) samples on Whatman filter paper and thick and thin smear were prepared for molecular testing and microscopic examination, respectively. Multiplex real time PCR assay was performed at Ethiopian Public Health Institute (EPHI) malaria laboratory. The performance of multiplex real time PCR assay, microscopy and RDT for the diagnosis of malaria was compared and evaluated against each other. Results Out of 271 blood samples, multiplex real time PCR identified 69 malaria cases as Plasmodium falciparum infection, 16 as Plasmodium vivax and 3 as mixed infections. Of the total samples, light microscopy detected 33 as P. falciparum, 18 as P. vivax, and RDT detected 43 as P. falciparum, 17 as P. vivax, and one mixed infection. Using light microscopy as reference test, the sensitivity and specificity of multiplex real time PCR were 100% (95% CI (93-100)) and 83.2% (95% CI (77.6-87.9)), respectively. Using multiplex real time PCR as a reference, light microscopy and RDT had sensitivity of 58% (95% CI 46.9-68.4) and 67% (95% CI 56.2-76.7); and 100% (95% CI 98-100) and 98.9% (95% CI 96-99.9), respectively. Substantial level of agreement was reported between microscopy and multiplex real time PCR results with kappa value of 0.65. Conclusions Multiplex real-time PCR had an advanced performance in parasite detection and species identification on febrile patients' samples than did microscopy and RDT in low malaria transmission settings. It is highly sensitive malaria diagnostic method that can be used in malaria elimination programme, particularly for community based epidemiological samples. Although microscopy and RDT had reduced performance when compared to multiplex real time PCR, still had an acceptable performance in diagnosis of malaria cases on patient samples at clinical facilities.

The aim of this survey was to assess the type and level of training in cervical cancer surgery and to investigate whether the Laparoscopic Approach to Cervical Cancer (LACC) trial results impacted training in radical surgery for gynecologic oncology fellows. Methods In June 2020, a 47-question electronic survey was shared with European Network of Young Gynaecologic Oncologists (ENYGO) members. Specialist fellows in obstetrics and gynecology, and gynecologic oncology, from high- and low-volume centers, who started training between January 1, 2017 and January 1, 2020 or started before January 1, 2017 but finished their training at least 6 months after the LACC trial publication (October 2018), were included. Results 81 of 125 (64.8%) respondents were included. The median time from the start of the fellowship to completion of the survey was 28 months (range 6-48). 56 (69.1%) respondents were still fellows-in-training. 6 of 56 (10.7%) and 14 of 25 (56.0%) respondents who were still in training and completed the fellowship, respectively, performed >= 10 radical hysterectomies during their training. Fellows trained in an ESGO accredited center had a higher chance to perform sentinel lymph node biopsy (60.4% vs 30.3%; p=0.027). There was no difference in the mean number of radical hysterectomies performed by fellows during fellowship before and after the LACC trial publication (8 +/- 12.0 vs 7 +/- 8.4, respectively; p=0.46). A significant reduction in number of minimally invasive radical hysterectomies was noted when comparing the period before and after the LACC trial (38.5% vs 13.8%, respectively; p<0.001). Conclusion Exposure to radical surgery for cervical cancer among gynecologic oncology fellows is low. Centralization of cervical cancer cases to high-volume centers may provide an increase in fellows' exposure to radical procedures. The LACC trial publication was associated with a decrease in minimally invasive radical hysterectomies performed by fellows.

T2  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Global warming is a threat to modern human civilization. There are different reasons for speed up the global average temperature. The consequences are catastrophic for human existence. Seafloor rise, drought, flood, wildfire, dry riverbed are some of the consequences. This paper analyzes the changes in boundaries of different water bodies such as fresh-water lakes and glacial lakes. Over time, the area covered by a water body has been varied due to human interventions or natural causes. Here, variants of Detectron2 instance segmentation architectures have been employed to detect a water-body and compute the changes in its area from the time-lapsed images captured over 32 years, that is, 1984 to 2016. The models are validated using water-bodies images taken by the Sentinel-2 Satellite and compared based on the average precision (AP), 99.95 and 94.51 at AP(50) and AP(75) metrics, respectively. In addition, an ensemble approach has also been introduced for the efficient identification of shrinkage or expansion of water bodies.

TI  - Analysis of the impact of multiscale green landscape on urban PM<sub>2.5</sub>
T2  - AIR QUALITY ATMOSPHERE AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - PM2.5 is a serious threat to human health. Greenspace landscape patterns, which have a major impact on urban air quality, have recently attracted much attention, but most recent studies have focused only on - area configurations or structures, and there is a lack of research on the factors that influence PM2.5 concentrations and their spatial differentiation characteristics at seasonal and spatial scales. Based on the data of air quality monitoring stations in Beijing and remote sensing data, this paper selects indicators and data on five kinds of landscape variables and explores the response characteristics of PM2.5 to surrounding environmental factors from multiple perspectives through the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), multiple regression, Spearman grade correlation, and geographical detector techniques. The results show that the response of PM2.5 to landscape patterns in autumn is more obvious than that in other seasons. The PM2.5 concentration is positively correlated with relative humidity in four seasons and temperature in summer and negatively correlated with wind speed in spring. The contribution of green landscape composite factors to PM2.5 concentration is higher than that of single factors. The research results can provide references for Beijing's urban planning and design.

TI  - Outcomes and technical modifications of vascularized lymph node transplantation from the lateral thoracic region for treatment of lymphedema
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objectives This study evaluates clinical outcomes of vascularized lymph node transplantation (VLNT) from the lateral thoracic region and technical modifications. Methods Consecutive patients that underwent lateral thoracic VLNT to treat extremity lymphedema were included. Demographic and treatment data were recorded, and outcomes data including limb volume, LDex score, and Lymphedema Life Impact Scale (LLIS), QuickDASH, and LEFS questionnaires, were collected prospectively. Consecutive patients that underwent single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT/CT) lymphoscintigraphy axillary reverse lymphatic mapping (RLM) were analyzed to characterize the physiological drainage of the normal upper extremity. Results A consecutive series of 32 flaps were included. At 24 months postoperatively mean reduction in limb volume excess was 47.2% (+/- 11.6; p = 0.0085), LDex score was 63.1% (+/- 8.5; p < 0.001), and LLIS score was 65.1% (+/- 7.4; p < 0.001). Preoperatively 14/31 patients (45.2%) reported cellulitis, and postoperatively there were no episodes at up to 24 months (p < 0.001). No patient developed donor extremity lymphedema at mean 18.6 (+/- 8.3) months follow-up. SPECT/CT-RLM of 182 normal axillae demonstrated that the sentinel lymph node(s) of the upper extremity was consistently anatomically located in the upper outer quadrant of the axilla (97%). Conclusions VLNT from the lateral thoracic region is effective and versatile for the treatment of lymphedema with a low donor site complication rate.

TI  - Drought assessment in paddy rice fields using remote sensing technology towards achieving food security and SDG2
T2  - BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose This research aims to monitor vegetation indices to assess drought in paddy rice fields in Mazandaran, Iran, and propose the best index to predict rice yield. Design/methodology/approach A three-step methodology is applied. First, the paddy rice fields are mapped by using three satellite-based datasets, namely SRTM DEM, Landsat8 TOA and MYD11A2. Second, the maps of indices are extracted using MODIS. And finally, the trend of indices over rice-growing seasons is extracted and compared with the rice yield data. Findings Rice paddies maps and vegetation indices maps are provided. Vegetation Health Index (VHI) combining average Temperature Condition Index (TCI) and minimum Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), and also VHI combining TCImin and VCImin are found to be the most proper indices to predict rice yield. Practical implications The results serve as a guideline for policy-makers and practitioners in the agro-food industry to (1) support sustainable agriculture and food safety in terms of rice production; (2) help balance the supply and demand sides of the rice market and move towards SDG2; (3) use yield prediction in the rice supply chain management, pricing and trade flows management; and (4) assess drought risk in index-based insurances. Originality/value This study, as one of the first research assessing and mapping vegetation indices for rice paddies in northern Iran, particularly contributes to (1) extracting the map of paddy rice fields in Mazandaran Province by using satellite-based data on cloud-computing technology in the Google Earth Engine platform; (2) providing the map of VCI and TCI for the period 2010-2019 based on MODIS data and (3) specifying the best index to describe rice yield through proposing different calculation methods for VHI.

TI  - Numerical Modeling the Flood and Pollutant Transport Processes in Residential Areas with Different Land Use Types
T2  - ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale flooding causes widespread disaster, and harmful pollutant concentration in water following flood affects public safety and the environment. In this study, a numerical model for solving the 2D shallow water equations and the solute transport equation is proposed to simulate overland flood and pollutant transport caused by floods. The present model is verified by comparing the predictions with the analytical solutions and simulation results; sufficiently high computational accuracy is achieved. The model is also used to simulate flood inundation and pollution spread in the area of Hun and Taizi Lane (HTL) in China due to river dike breaches; the results show that the coupling model has excellent performance for simulating the flooding process and the temporal and spatial distribution of pollutants in urban or rural areas. We use remote sensing techniques to acquire the land coverage in the area of HTL based on Landsat TM satellites. The impacts of changed land use on mitigation of flooding waves and pollutant spread are investigated; the results indicate that the land cover changes have an obvious influence on the evolution process of flood waves and pollutant transport in the study areas, where the transport of pollutants is very dynamic during flood inundation in HTL area. Furthermore, the motion of pollutants considering anisotropic diffusion is more reasonable than that due to isotropic dispersion in simulating pollutant transport associated with the flood in urban or farmland environments.

TI  - Modelling wave attenuation by saltmarsh using satellite-derived vegetation properties
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Saltmarshes are increasingly recognised an important asset in coastal management as they dissipate wave energy and thus reduce the potential for coastal flooding. The frontal surface area (FSA) and the drag coefficient (C-d) are parameters commonly used in wave attenuation models to express the resistance of vegetation structure to incident waves. The FSA of vegetation represents the vertical surface area facing incoming waves which is calculated as the product of height, diameter and density whereas C-d is often used as tunable parameter that represents the vegetation-wave interactions that relies on both vegetation properties and wave conditions. Despite their importance in numerical modelling, substantial uncertainty remains in obtaining these parameters in the field due to the time-intensive and relatively expensive nature of data collection. An alternative structural vegetation parameter that can be included in wave attenuation models is the leaf area index (LAI). The primary advantage of the LAI is that it can be readily derived from satellite imagery, and thus provides a low-cost, fast alternative to field data collection. However, to date, its incorporation in widely-used coastal engineering models is lacking. The aim of this paper is to verify the use of remote-sensed LAI in numerical wave models as an alternative to FSA. Here, the widely used XBeach model for simulating storm impacts on a range of coastal systems is applied to two open coast sites with extensive saltmarsh; Chesapeake Bay, USA, and Brancaster, UK. To assess the performance of wave attenuation modelling using both methods, we compared the use of remote-sensed LAI from satellite imagery and field-based FSA as inputs into the model. The LAI-based model provides similar levels of accuracy as the FSA-based model. Likewise, higher uncertainties related to plant height, diameter, and density were found in the FSA-based model than in the LAI-based model. Therefore, the LAI-based model provides the advantage of a low-cost and fast method to accurately estimate and predict wave attenuation by vegetation using numerical models such as XBeach. Our practical application in the Brancaster site exemplifies an easy and fast approach to obtaining structural parameters of saltmarsh vegetation and estimating wave attenuation between natural and artificial saltmarshes as well as between seasons.

TI  - Machine learning-based thermal anomalies detection from MODIS LST associated with the M<sub><i>w</i></sub> 7.7 Awaran, Pakistan earthquake
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite based thermal anomaly occurs as a substantial precursor for strong earthquakes, as the need for earthquake precursor detection has very important for impending main shock estimation. In this study, Land Surface Temperature (LST) for both day- and night-time from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite have been analyzed to monitor anomalous variation before and after the Awaran Pakistan earthquake on September 24, 2013 (M-w 7.7). We aim to find a common monitoring time window of pre-and post-seismic LST irregularities by different detecting techniques (e.g., Inter Quartile Range (IQR), wavelet transformation, Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and Neural Network (NN)). For this purpose, three months before and three months subsequent to main shock data are analyzed for Awaran earthquake. Interestingly, every method shows an irregular variation of LST within 4-7 days before the main shock. Similarly, this analysis also pointed out a rise in temperature within 2-4 days after the main shock as post-earthquake responses. This shows the capability of LST anomalies for possible earthquake anomalies and the importance of Machine Learning (ML) techniques for detecting earthquake anomalies to support lithosphere-atmosphere-ionosphere coupling (LAIC) hypothesis for future studies.

TI  - Sentinel surveillance for influenza A viruses in Lahore District Pakistan in flu season 2015-2016
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Influenza A virus (IAV) remains an important global public health threat with limited epidemiological information available from low-and-middle-income countries. The major objective of this study was to describe the proportions, temporal and spatial distribution, and demographic and clinical characteristics of IAV positive patients with influenza like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in Lahore, Pakistan. Methods Prospective surveillance was established in a sentinel hospital from October 2015 to May 2016. All eligible outpatients and inpatients with ILI or SARI were enrolled in the study. Nasal and/or throat swabs were collected along with clinico-epidemiological data. Samples were tested by real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) to identify IAV and subtype. The descriptive analysis of data was done in R software. Results Out of 311 enrolled patients, 284 (91.3%) were ILI and 27 (8.7%) were SARI cases. A distinct peak of ILI and SARI activity was observed in February. Fifty individuals (16%) were positive for IAV with peak positivity observed in December. Of 50 IAV, 15 were seasonal H3N2, 14 were H1N1pdm09 and 21 were unable to be typed. The majority of IAV positive cases (98%) presented with current or history of fever, 88% reported cough and 82% reported sore throat. The most common comorbidities in IAV positive cases were hepatitis C (4%), obesity (4%) and tuberculosis (6%). The highest incidence of patients reporting to the hospital was seen three days post symptoms onset (66/311) with 14 of these (14/66) positive for IAV. Conclusion Distinct trends of ILI, SARI and IAV positive cases were observed which can be used to inform public health interventions (vaccinations, hand and respiratory hygiene) at appropriate times among high-risk groups. We suggest sampling from both ILI and SARI patients in routine surveillance as recommended by WHO.

TI  - Surveillance, Epidemiology and Impact of EV-A71 Vaccination on Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease in Nanchang, China, 2010-2019
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - After the first national-scale outbreak of Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) in China, a national surveillance network was established. Here we described the epidemiology and pathogenic profile of HFMD and the impact of EV-A71 vaccination on pathogen spectrum of enteroviruses in the southeastern Chinese city of Nanchang during 2010-2019. A total of 7,951 HFMD cases from sentinel hospitals were included, of which 4,800 EV-positive cases (60.4%) were identified by real-time RT-PCR. During 2010-2012, enterovirus 71 (EV-A71) was the main causative agent of HFMD, causing 63.1% of cases, followed by 19.3% cases associated with coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16). Since 2013, the proportion of other enteroviruses has increased dramatically, with the sub genotype D3 strain of Coxsackievirus A6 (CV-A6) replacing the dominance of EV-A71. These genetically diverse native strains of CV-A6 have co-transmitted and co-evolved in Nanchang. Unlike EV-A71 and CV-A16, most CV-A6 infections were concentrated in autumn and winter. The incidence of EV-A71 infection negatively correlated with EV-A71 vaccination (r = -0.990, p = 0.01). And severe cases sharply declined as the promotion of EV-A71 vaccines. After 2-year implementation of EV-A71 vaccination, EV-A71 is no longer detected from the reported HFMD cases in Nanchang. In conclusion, EV-A71 vaccination changed the pattern of HFMD epidemic, and CV-A6 replaced the dominance of EV-A71 over time.

TI  - Empirical algorithm for detecting coccolithophore blooms through satellite observation in the Barents Sea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Coccolithophores are a key phytoplankton group with a major influence on the carbon cycle in global oceans. Understanding its phenological responses to climate change is vital, particularly in Arctic regions that are experiencing warming faster than the global average. Ocean color remote sensing is a powerful tool that provides the global distribution and spatial extent of coccolithophore blooms. However, remotely observing coccolithophore blooms in Arctic regions is challenged by severe conditions, such as heavy cloud cover. In this work, an ocean color index (CI)-based approach is developed to detect coccolithophore blooms in the Arctic Sea by using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images. The optical properties of clouds and coccolithophore blooms are characterized by employing the band difference of Rayleigh-corrected reflectance (rho R) at 412 and 469 nm (CI412-469) and 555 and 645 nm (CI555-645), respectively. A hybrid threshold is further determined to classify coccolithophore bloom and nonbloom waters. Results show that the algorithm can reduce the negative effects of heavy clouds and persistent fog on detecting coccolithophore blooms and increase the coverage of satellite observation. Compared with the traditional particulate inorganic carbon concentrationbased approach, the algorithm yields more coverage and frequency of coccolithophore blooms. Global evaluation reveals that the CI-based algorithm has great potential applications in global oceans and different ocean color sensors.

TI  - Paddy lands detection using Landsat-8 satellite images and object-based classification in Rasht city, Iran
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice is one of the most important food staples in many countries, particularly Iran. Because irrigated rice production differs from other agricultural fields, this study developed a paddy field mapping model based on phenological aspects, various satellite sensor data, and an object-based approach. This study uses the phonological features of rice plants as well as annual data on land surface temperature (LST) to produce the paddy map. The core remote sensing data consists of the yearly LST from MODIS and multi-temporal Landsat-8 satellite imagery. The detection of phenological characteristics and the selection of relevant Landsat images were made possible by analyzing the LST time series with Google Earth Engine. After that, object-based image classification and fuzzy functions are used to create flexible and comprehensible rules for discovering paddy fields in Rasht, Iran. Data such as the digital elevation model (DEM) and spectral indices including NDVI, EVI, and LSWI were employed to improve the object-based classification. Due to the unique properties of paddy lands, a DEM of 12.5 m obtained from the ALOS PALSAR sensor could help distinguish paddy lands from other vegetation. A comparison finally made between the object-based and pixel-based classification methods showed that the former is more accurate. Overall accuracy and kappa coefficient for the pixel-based classification approach were 92% and 0.89, respectively, whereas overall accuracy and kappa coefficient for the object-based classification method were 94% and 0.92, respectively. Eventually, the producer's accuracy of the paddy class has increased from 88% to 94%. (c) 2021 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Automated satellite remote sensing of giant kelp at the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas)
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Giant kelp populations that support productive and diverse coastal ecosystems at temperate and subpolar latitudes of both hemispheres are vulnerable to changing climate conditions as well as direct human impacts. Observations of giant kelp forests are spatially and temporally uneven, with disproportionate coverage in the northern hemisphere, despite the size and comparable density of southern hemisphere kelp forests. Satellite imagery enables the mapping of existing and historical giant kelp populations in understudied regions, but automating the detection of giant kelp using satellite imagery requires approaches that are robust to the optical complexity of the shallow, nearshore environment. We present and compare two approaches for automating the detection of giant kelp in satellite datasets: one based on crowd sourcing of satellite imagery classifications and another based on a decision tree paired with a spectral unmixing algorithm (automated using Google Earth Engine). Both approaches are applied to satellite imagery (Landsat) of the Falkland Islands or Islas Malvinas (FLK), an archipelago in the southern Atlantic Ocean that supports expansive giant kelp ecosystems. The performance of each method is evaluated by comparing the automated classifications with a subset of expert-annotated imagery (8 images spanning the majority of our continuous timeseries, cumulatively covering over 2,700 km of coastline, and including all relevant sensors). Using the remote sensing approaches evaluated herein, we present the first continuous timeseries of giant kelp observations in the FLK region using Landsat imagery spanning over three decades. We do not detect evidence of long-term change in the FLK region, although we observe a recent decline in total canopy area from 2017-2021. Using a nitrate model based on nearby ocean state measurements obtained from ships and incorporating satellite sea surface temperature products, we find that the area of giant kelp forests in the FLK region is positively correlated with the nitrate content observed during the prior year. Our results indicate that giant kelp classifications using citizen science are approximately consistent with classifications based on a state-of-the-art automated spectral approach. Despite differences in accuracy and sensitivity, both approaches find high interannual variability that impedes the detection of potential long-term changes in giant kelp canopy area, although recent canopy area declines are notable and should continue to be monitored carefully.

TI  - Spatio-temporal Variations of Temperature and Precipitation During 1951-2019 in Arid and Semiarid Region, China
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the spatio-temporal variations of temperature and precipitation in the arid and semiarid region of China (AS-RC) is of great significance for promoting regional eco-environmental protection and policy-making. In this study, the annual and seasonal spatio-temporal patterns of change in average temperature and precipitation and their influencing factors in the ASRC were analyzed using the Mann-Kendall test, linear tendency estimation, accumulative anomaly and the Pearson's correlation coefficient. The results showed that both annual average temperature and average annual precipitation increased in the ASRC during 1951-2019. The temperature rose by about 1.93 degrees C and precipitation increased by about 24 mm. The seasonal average temperature presented a significant increase trend, and the seasonal precipitation was conspicuous ascension in spring and winter. The spatio-temporal patterns of change in temperature and precipitation differed, with the southwest area showing the most obvious variation in each season. Abrupt changes in annual and seasonal average temperature and precipitation occurred mainly around the 1990s and after 2000, respectively. Atmospheric circulation had an important effect on the trends and abrupt changes in temperature and precipitation. The East Asian summer monsoon had the largest impact on the trend of average annual temperature, as well as on the abrupt changes of annual average temperature and precipitation. Temperature and precipitation changes in the ASRC were influenced by long-term and short-term as well as direct and indirect anthropogenic and natural factors. This study identifies the characteristics of spatio-temporal variations in temperature and precipitation in the ASRC and provides a scientific reference for the formulation of climate change responses.

TI  - Major Bloodstream Infection-Causing Bacterial Pathogens and Their Antimicrobial Resistance in South Korea, 2017-2019: Phase I Report From Kor-GLASS
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To monitor national antimicrobial resistance (AMR), the Korea Global AMR Surveillance System (Kor-GLASS) was established. This study analyzed bloodstream infection (BSI) cases from Kor-GLASS phase I from January 2017 to December 2019. Nine non-duplicated Kor-GLASS target pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp., and Salmonella spp., were isolated from blood specimens from eight sentinel hospitals. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing, AMR genotyping, and strain typing were carried out. Among the 20,041 BSI cases, 15,171 cases were caused by one of the target pathogens, and 12,578 blood isolates were collected for the study. Half (1,059/2,134) of S. aureus isolates were resistant to cefoxitin, and 38.1% (333/873) of E. faecium isolates were resistant to vancomycin. Beta-lactamase-non-producing ampicillin-resistant and penicillin-resistant E. faecalis isolates by disk diffusion method were identified, but the isolates were confirmed as ampicillin-susceptible by broth microdilution method. Among E. coli, an increasing number of isolates carried the bla(CTX-M-27) gene, and the ertapenem resistance in 1.4% (30/2,110) of K. pneumoniae isolates was mostly (23/30) conferred by K. pneumoniae carbapenemases. A quarter (108/488) of P. aeruginosa isolates were resistant to meropenem, and 30.5% (33/108) of those carried acquired carbapenemase genes. Over 90% (542/599) of A. baumannii isolates were imipenem-resistant, and all except one harbored the bla(OXA-23) gene. Kor-GLASS provided comprehensive AMR surveillance data, and the defined molecular mechanisms of resistance helped us to better understand AMR epidemiology. Comparative analysis with other GLASS-enrolled countries is possible owing to the harmonized system provided by GLASS.

TI  - An enhanced cross-layer solution for IFC applications using HTS systems at Q/V-band
T2  - ENGINEERING REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Q/V band communication systems open new avenues for next generation of high-throughput satellite (HTS) systems. More specifically, they are attractive due to their high bandwidth for user and gateway links. Having a wide bandwidth at Q/V band makes it permissible to offload the links between the satellite and its earth station hubs (gateway) from the Ka band to the Q/V band. This enables additional bandwidth available for HTS feeder links and user links of specific market verticals, which in turn results in reduction of cost per bit for in-flight connectivity applications to provide WiFi capability on the aircraft. This study provides a deep overview of network architecture at the ground gateway infrastructure with respect to the network management system (NMS) to optimize network traffic utilization. We have looked at a gateway constellation platform which optimizes the actual cost-efficient solution for deploying routing user traffic among the networks. In addition, the study discusses the elements involved in the NMS which interfaces with the gateway platform. The overall NMS platform design and capabilities are discussed as they provision the network service parameters throughout the entire operation. The proposed solution integrates the physical antenna, antenna control unit and the power supply into one bundle on the aircraft. This will result in approximately 10% throughput increase compared to conventional methods that do not deploy N+P gateway architecture. The proposed method has enhanced spectrum efficiency along with the NMS unit that has been discussed in detail. Finally, a wideband and multibeam antenna is introduced as an essential part of the solution followed up by simulation results.

TI  - Long-term prediction of sea surface chlorophyll-a concentration based on the combination of spatio-temporal features
T2  - WATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Harmful algal blooms (HABs) events have a serious impact on marine fisheries and marine management. They occur globally with high frequency and are characterized by a long duration and difficult governance. HABs incidents have occurred in the South China Sea (SCS), and the frequency of occurrence has been on the rise in recent decades. Predicting the long-term chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration has the potential to facilitate longterm monitoring and early warning of HABs events. Currently, long-term predictions of ocean circulation and temperature are common, while long-term predictions of marine biochemistry are still in their infancy. Traditional Chl-a prediction methods have problems, such as low accuracy and the inability to carry out long-term predictions. This research improved the CNN-LSTM model by combining spatio-temporal features to predict Chl-a concentrations. This model can extract both the temporal and spatial features of Chl-a, expand the dataset, and improve the prediction accuracy and training speed. The predictions were made using a Chl-a dataset for the Reed Tablemount in the SCS. The time series of Chl-a used was the satellite data of NASA's official website from January 2002 to June 2020. The results indicate that the predictions of the CNN-LSTM model are better than those of the LSTM and SARIMA models. The five-year long-term rolling prediction of Chl-a was carried out, and the three-year Pearson correlation coefficient reached 0.5. The novelty of this study is the realization of a threeyear long-term prediction of Chl-a concentrations. The Mann-Kendall trend test method and the least square method were used to fit the straight line to detect the trend of the five-year predicted value and the true value, respectively. The results indicated that the prediction value and true value of the sea surface Chl-a from 2015 to 2020 both exhibited an overall upward trend. In addition, the prediction performance of the model in large-scale prediction is better than that in small-scale prediction.

TI  - Cloud/shadow segmentation based on multi-level feature enhanced network for remote sensing imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the application of remote sensing, cloud blocking brings trouble to the analysis of surface parameters and atmospheric parameters. Due to the complexity of the background, the influence of some cloud-like interferences (such as ice, snow, buildings, etc.) and the complexity of the cloud shape, the traditional deep learning method is difficult to segment the edge information of cloud and cloud shadow accurately, resulting in misjudgement at the edge. In order to solve these problems, a multilevel feature enhanced network is proposed for cloud/shadow segmentation. In this work, ResNet-18 is used as the backbone to extract all levels of semantic information, and Feature Enhancement Module is proposed to strengthen the feature information to obtain more effective feature information. Multiscale Fusion module is constructed to fuses multiscale features of deep information to obtain global feature information while considering local feature information. Finally, through the Feature Guidance module, low-level features are used to guide the high-level features to guide the recovery of spatial information and improve the efficiency of upsampling. On the data collected by Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, and HRC_WHU data set, the experimental results show that this method is superior to the existing methods.

TI  - Investigating remote sensing indices to monitor drought impacts on a local scale (case study: Fars province, Iran)
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - As drought occurs in different climates, assessment of drought impacts on parameters such as vegetation cover is of utmost importance. Satellite remote sensing images with various spectral and spatial resolutions represent information about different land covers such as vegetation cover. Hence, the purpose of this study was to investigate the performance of satellite vegetation indices to monitor the agricultural drought on a local scale. In this regard, satellite images including Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data were used to evaluate vegetation cover and their gradual changes effects on agricultural drought. Fars province in Iran with relatively low precipitation values was selected as the study area. Modified Perpendicular Drought Index (MPDI), MPDI1, Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index Anomalies (NDVIA), and Standardized Vegetation Index (SVI), were evaluated to select the remote sensing based index with the best performance in drought monitoring. The performance of such indices were investigated during 13 years (2000-2013) for MODIS and 29 years (1985-2013) for AVHRR. To assess the efficiency of the satellite indices in drought investigation, Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) data of five selected stations were used for 3, 6, and 9 month periods on August. The results showed that NDVI-based vegetation indices had the highest correlation with SPI in cold climate and long-term timescale (6 and 9 month). The highest correlation values between remote sensing based indices and SPI were acquired, respectively, in 9-month and 6-month time-scales, with the values of 43.5% and 40%. Moreover, VCI showed the highest capability for agricultural drought investigating in different climate regions of the study area. Overall, the results proved that NDVI-based indices can be used for drought monitoring and assessment in a long-term timescale on a local time-scale.

T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Diversity and abundance of mosquito larvae have significant impact on the dynamics of disease transmission. In the present study, remote sensing (RS) technology integrated with field survey and spatial analyses were utilized to map mosquito breeding habitats and assess areas vulnerable to disease transmission in the Nile Valley of Giza governorate. An entomological survey was carried out to 20 accessible breeding sites at the study area during the period 6th-9th December 2019. Mosquito larvae were collected and transferred to the laboratory for density calculation and species identifications. A calibrated Landsat OLI image was processed to produce Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Built-Up Index (NDBI), Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Normalized Difference Salinity Index (NDSI), and Land Surface Temperature (LST). Results revealed that Culex pipiens was the most dominant species in the study region with a total percentage of 95.04%. High density of mosquito larvae was characterized by NDVI 0.12 to 0.39, NDBI 0.20 to 0.05, NDMI 0.05 to 0.20, NDWI 0.34 to 0.10, NDSI 0.39 to 0.12, and LST 19.30 to 24.82 celcius which represents the optimal conditions for mosquito breeding. It could be concluded that Giza region, particularly Agouza, Kerdasa, Dokki, Bulaq Dakror and Omrania, is highly affected by Cx. pipiens, with a high potentiality of filariasis disease transmission.(c) 2021 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science.

TI  - River levels from multi mission altimetry, a statistical approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite altimetry is a key technique to measure water level change in continental water bodies. Altimetry-based water level time series of rivers are typically constructed at locations where the satellite ground tracks intersect the rivers, the so-called virtual stations. The relatively low sampling frequency (10-27 days) of the repeat missions may result in an under-sampling of the hydrological regime in rivers with sub-monthly to weekly events. We are currently in a unique position with more than a handful satellite altimetry missions simultaneously mapping the surface elevation of the Earth. In combination, these missions contain an unexploited potential to obtain a more detailed picture of the hydrological regime of many of the Earth's rivers. The task of combining water levels measured at different locations and/or by satellites with different orbits is however, challenging due to e.g. topography, intermission biases, variation in river morphology, and other unidentified causes. In this work, we present a new method to combine multi-mission altimetry-based water levels from a river reach. This will also enable the use of geodetic missions like CryoSat-2 and SARAL/AltiKa (after June 2016) in water level time series. To combine the data we set up a state-space model where the process part is a first-order autoregressive process. The observations as a function of time and distance along the reach are described as a sum of the water level at a given time scaled by a distance-dependent factor, the mean water level at the given distance, and an error term. The scale factor and the mean water level are modeled with spline functions. We employ the model for the six rivers Lena, Solimo similar to es, Mississippi, Danube, Po, and Red, which range in width from 3 km to a few hundred meters. For each river, we consider a reach of 200-300 km and apply water levels from the satellite altimetry missions CryoSat-2, Sentinel-3A/3B, and SARAL/AltiKa. The selected reach must have a continuous elevation profile and preferable no major tributaries, which might alter the hydrological regime considerably. The length of the reach is a compromise of ensuring enough data but not violating the aforementioned criteria. When validated against in situ data we find a root mean square error ranging from 0.34 m (Solimo similar to es River) to 2.53 m (Lena River) and a correlation ranging from 0.83 (Danube River) to 0.99 (Solimo similar to es River). These summary statistics are based on approximately 2000-3000 pairs of in situ and modeled water levels. We find the largest increase in detail for the reconstructed water levels for the Danube, Po, and Red Rivers, where the water level variations are under-sampled at the virtual stations. For the Po River, we can detect sub-weekly events with the model and for the Lena River, the spring flood related to ice and snowmelt is better captured when combining the data. An additional advantage of the approach is that the water level time series can be reconstructed at all locations along the considered reach.

TI  - Improved representation of agricultural land use and crop management for large-scale hydrological impact simulation in Africa using SWAT
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - To date, most regional and global hydrological models either ignore the representation of cropland or consider crop cultivation in a simplistic way or in abstract terms without any management practices. Yet, the water balance of cultivated areas is strongly influenced by applied management practices (e.g. planting, irrigation, fertilization, and harvesting). The SWAT + (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model represents agricultural land by default in a generic way, where the start of the cropping season is driven by accumulated heat units. However, this approach does not work for tropical and subtropical regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, where crop growth dynamics are mainly controlled by rainfall rather than temperature. In this study, we present an approach on how to incorporate crop phenology using decision tables and global datasets of rainfed and irrigated croplands with the associated cropping calendar and fertilizer applications in a regional SWAT + model for northeastern Africa.We evaluate the influence of the crop phenology representation on simulations of leaf area index (LAI) and evapotranspiration (ET) using LAI remote sensing data from Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS) and WaPOR (Water Productivity through Open access of Remotely sensed derived data) ET data, respectively. Results show that a representation of crop phenology using global datasets leads to improved temporal patterns of LAI and ET simulations, especially for regions with a single cropping cycle. However, for regions with multiple cropping seasons, global phenology datasets need to be complemented with local data or remote sensing data to capture additional cropping seasons. In addition, the improvement of the cropping season also helps to improve soil erosion estimates, as the timing of crop cover controls erosion rates in the model. With more realistic growing seasons, soil erosion is largely reduced for most agricultural hydrologic response units (HRUs), which can be considered as a move towards substantial improvements over previous estimates. We conclude that regional and global hydrological models can benefit from improved representations of crop phenology and the associated management practices. Future work regarding the incorporation of multiple cropping seasons in global phenology data is needed to better represent cropping cycles in areas where they occur using regional to global hydrological models.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover classification of remote sensing data is a fundamental tool to study changes in the environment such as deforestation or wildfires. A current challenge is to quantify land cover changes with real-time, large-scale data from modern hyper- or multispectral sensors. A range of methods are available for this task, several of them being based on the k-means classification method which is efficient when classes of land cover are well separated. Here a new algorithm, called probabilistic k-means, is presented to solve some of the limitations of the standard k-means. It is shown that the new algorithm performs better than the standard k-means when the data are noisy. If the number of land cover classes is unknown, an entropy-based criterion can be used to select the best number of classes. The proposed new algorithm is implemented in a combination of R and C computer codes which is particularly efficient with large data sets: a whole image with more than 3 million pixels and covering more than 10,000 km2 can be analysed in a few minutes. Four applications with hyperspectral and multispectral data are presented. For the data sets with ground truth data, the overall accuracy of the probabilistic k-means was substantially improved compared to the standard k-means. One of these data sets includes more than 120 million pixels, demonstrating the scalability of the proposed approach. These developments open new perspectives for the large scale analysis of remote sensing data. All computer code are available in an open-source package called sentinel.

TI  - Impact of Flash Flood Events on the Coastal Waters Around Madeira Island: The "Land Mass Effect"
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Island Mass Effect has been primarily attributed to nutrient enhancement of waters surrounding oceanic islands due to physical processes, whereas the role of land runoff has seldom been considered. Land runoff can be particularly relevant in mountainous islands, highly susceptible to torrential rainfall that rapidly leads to flash floods. Madeira Island, located in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean, is historically known for its flash flood events, when steep streams transport high volumes of water and terrigenous material downstream. A 22-year analysis of satellite data revealed that a recent catastrophic flash flood (20 February 2010) was responsible for the most significant concentration of non-algal Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) and Chlorophyll-a at the coast. In this context, our study aims to understand the impact of the February 2010 flash flood events on coastal waters, by assessing the impact of spatial and temporal variability of wind, precipitation, and river discharges. Two specific flash floods events are investigated in detail (2 and 20 February 2010), which coincided with northeasterly and southwesterly winds, respectively. Given the lack of in situ data documenting these events, a coupled air-sea-land numerical framework was used, including hydrological modeling. The dynamics of the modeled river plumes induced by flash floods were strongly influenced by the wind regimes subsequently affecting coastal circulation, which may help to explain the differences between observed SPM and Chlorophyll-a distributions. Model simulations showed that during northeasterly winds, coastal confinement of the buoyant river plume persisted on the island's north coast, preventing offshore transport of SPM. This mechanism may have contributed to favorable conditions for phytoplankton growth, as captured by satellite-derived Chlorophyll-a in the northeastern coastal waters. On the island's south coast, strong ocean currents generated in the eastern island flank promoted strong vertical shear, contributing to vertical mixing. During southwesterly winds, coastal confinement of the plume with strong vertical density gradient was observed on the south side. The switch to eastward winds spread the south river plume offshore, forming a filament of high Chlorophyll-a extending 70 km offshore. Our framework demonstrates a novel methodology to investigate ocean productivity around remote islands with sparse or absent field observations.

TI  - I Knew It, the World is Falling Apart! Combatting a Confirmatory Negativity Bias in Audiences' News Selection Through News Media Literacy Interventions
T2  - DIGITAL JOURNALISM
M3  - Article
AB  - Do people with a more pessimistic worldview also select more like-minded news that confirms their negative-sometimes irrational-outlook on reality? This study theorizes that, based on the negativity and confirmation biases in audience digital news selection, a pessimistic outlook increases the likelihood of self-selection of more negative and episodic headlines over positive and thematic news. In a next step, news media literacy (NML) literature is consulted to explore how to counter this tendency to, via news selection, confirm an overly negative and distorted worldview. A selective-exposure experiment (N = 612) monitored participants' self-selection of crime news after exposure to NML interventions. Findings show that those participants who hold a more pessimistic outlook on crime in society tend to confirm this worldview by self-selecting into more negative crime news. Exposure to NML interventions concerning negativity bias or click-bait was found to mitigate this negativity bias in news selection, especially for those who already hold a pessimistic outlook This study is the first to document that NML interventions can potentially have merits as a tool to combat negativity bias in online news selection.

TI  - Estrogen receptor-positive adenocarcinoma of the cervix presenting during pregnancy: Two case reports and review of the literature
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - The incidence of adenocarcinoma of the cervix in pregnancy is exceptionally rare, and thus there is no consensus on its management. Here, we report two cases of adenocarcinoma of the cervix diagnosed in the context of pregnancy. In our first case, a patient referred to colposcopy for atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance was subsequently diagnosed with well differentiated endocervical adenocarcinoma on cone biopsy. Just prior to the cone biopsy, she was incidentally found to have a first trimester pregnancy loss. The patient subsequently underwent a radical hysterectomy and bilateral sentinel lymph node dissection. Final pathology revealed a stage 1B1 (FIGO 2009) well differentiated adenocarcinoma of the cervix. Interestingly, the tumour was positive for estrogen receptor, which is unusual for cervical adenocarcinoma.In our second case, a patient presented with a pedunculated, exophytic cervical neoplasm at 31 weeks GA with self-limiting antepartum hemorrhage. The primary lesion measured 52 mm in diameter on MRI and was amputated at the base during the patient's elective repeat cesarean section. Final pathology revealed a stage IB2 (FIGO 2009) mucinous adenocarcinoma of the cervix. The patient subsequently underwent a radical hysterectomy and bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection 17 weeks after initial presentation. The depth of invasion was 2.2 mm, restricted to the inner third of the cervical wall, and there was no lymphovascular space invasion in the surgical specimen. Surgical margins, parametria, and lymph nodes were all negative for adenocarcinoma. This tumour was also found to be estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor (ER/PR) positive, again unusual for cervical adenocarcinoma. P16 was strongly positive and HPV DNA studies were also positive for human papilloma virus 18. The patient received adjuvant external beam radiotherapy to the pelvis and currently remains in remission.

TI  - Monitoring irrigation dynamics in paddy fields using spatiotemporal fusion of Sentinel-2 and MODIS
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid and accurate monitoring of irrigation dynamics in paddy fields (the start, end, duration and irrigation peak, etc.) at field scales is crucial to the fine management of agricultural water resources, especially in typical areas with water shortages. However, there is still a lack of sufficient research to depict irrigation dynamics in paddy fields at high temporal and spatial levels. To this end, this study fused Sentinel-2 and MODIS images to map the spatio-temporal dynamics of irrigation events in paddy fields. A popular spatiotemporal fusion algorithm (enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model, ESTARFM) was used to generate 25 high-spatial resolution (10 m) remote sensing images based on 9 Sentinel-2 images and 24 MODIS images. Random forest algorithm was used to extract the spatial distribution of irrigated paddy fields. Water body index and vegetation index were employed to identify the start, end and duration of irrigation in paddy fields. PenmanMonteith model was used to estimate water surplus and deficit of irrigation during the critical irrigation period with daily observation data from meteorological stations. This study was carried out in rice-growing areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River in China. The results indicated that the spatial distribution difference of irrigation events in paddy fields with the shortest 3-day interval could be monitored in collaboration with Sentinel-2 and MODIS images. The start, end, and duration of irrigation in paddy fields presented significant spatial differences at field scales. A large amount of water from groundwater and Yellow River was needed, because the total water shortage of irrigation in paddy fields in the study area was about 80.79% of the total water demand. In addition, paddy fields with higher water demand were more concentrated spatially, as were paddy fields with lower water demand. The feasibility of spatiotemporal fusion of multi-source remote sensing data makes it possible to continuously monitor irrigation dynamics in paddy fields on high spatial resolution scales, which is conducive to the construction of spatiotemporal database and big data platform of agricultural irrigation information. This would not only help in promoting the high-quality development of agricultural water resources management but also alleviating the contradiction of regional water resources.

TI  - Long-term multidataset direct aerosol radiative forcing and its efficiencies: Intercomparisons and uncertainties
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Direct Aerosol Radiative Forcing (DARF) characterizes aerosol influences on the radiative energy budget due to scattering and absorption of solar radiation, while clear uncertainties remain in both global and regional DARF estimations due to differences in aerosol properties and time periods considered. Through a multidataset strategy, this study systematically investigates the DARFs over Beijing, China, between 2001 and 2020. Ground-based observations from AERONET are used as "references ", and two satellite-based datasets (MODIS and MISR), atmospheric reanalysis (MERRA-2) and numerical modeling (WRF-CMAQ) are considered. We unify the numerical simulations for DARF to ensure a fair intercomparison among different datasets. Fortunately, the aerosol amount at the AERONET locations in Beijing can well represent those over the entire city region, and the average DARF at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) in the past twenty years is found to be --36W/m(2) in Beijing. The relative differences in DARFs among different sources range between approximately-40% and 10%, and those in DARF efficiencies (DARFEs) are in a similar range (besides AERONET and MISR). The correlation coefficients on DARF between the AERONET and MERRA-2 results are found to be approximately -0.75, and both MODIS and MISR result in correlation coefficients with AERONET over 0.80. However, the agreement at the MISR TOA DARF is caused by smaller AOD and larger DARFE. The DARF uncertainties based on AERONET, MODIS and MISR range from approximately 10% to over 20%. For the numerical simulations, the WRF-CMAQ results agree reasonably with the observation-based results, while their DARF magnitudes are merely about one-third of those from observation-based results. Clear differences among DARFs given by different types of datasets indicate that the uncertainties in direct aerosol forcings cannot be neglected, and that more efforts are still needed to unify and to improve our understanding of them.

TI  - WOMBAT v1.0: a fully Bayesian global flux-inversion framework
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - WOMBAT (the WOllongong Methodology for Bayesian Assimilation of Trace-gases) is a fully Bayesian hierarchical statistical framework for flux inversion of trace gases from flask, in situ, and remotely sensed data. WOMBAT extends the conventional Bayesian synthesis framework through the consideration of a correlated error term, the capacity for online bias correction, and the provision of uncertainty quantification on all unknowns that appear in the Bayesian statistical model. We show, in an observing system simulation experiment (OSSE), that these extensions are crucial when the data are indeed biased and have errors that are spatio-temporally correlated. Using the GEOS-Chem atmospheric transport model, we show that WOMBAT is able to obtain posterior means and variances on non-fossil-fuel CO2 fluxes from Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) data that are comparable to those from the Model Intercomparison Project (MIP) reported in Crowell et al. (2019). We also find that WOMBAT's predictions of out-of-sample retrievals obtained from the Total Column Carbon Observing Network (TCCON) are, for the most part, more accurate than those made by the MIP participants.

TI  - Tracking spatiotemporal dynamics of irrigated croplands in China from 2000 to 2019 through the synergy of remote sensing, statistics, and historical irrigation datasets
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Irrigation is widely implemented in China to enhance grain production and ensure food security. Spatiotemporal information on irrigation is critically important, but the existing global and regional irrigation products have a coarse spatial resolution, low accuracy, and short temporal coverage, which is a knowledge gap to be filled. Generating explicit and accurate information on the spatial and temporal extent of irrigation is essential to underpin and facilitate water resource allocation and management, as well as to understand catchment hy-drology, and evaluate irrigation infrastructure investment. We proposed a two-step strategy to map annual irrigated areas at 500 m resolution in China from 2000 to 2019. We first generated initial irrigation maps using MODIS data and statistical data (MIrAD-GI). Then we combined MIrAD-GI, the existing irrigation maps, and land use/cover products with irrigation information, into an improved series of annual irrigation maps (IrriMap_Syn) with constrained statistics. Afterwards, pixel-wise accuracy assessment for IrriMap_Syn was conducted in four representative regions in three years. The resultant irrigation dataset performed well with a mean overall ac-curacy of 0.89 and a kappa coefficient of 0.82. According to our annual irrigation maps, the total irrigated area in China increased by 24.8%, from 52.8 million ha in 2000-65.9 million ha in 2019, at a rate of 690,000 ha per year. Spatially, irrigated croplands increased substantially in North China, especially in Xinjiang and Hei-longjiang. Land reclamation largely contributed to the increase in irrigation in North China. A growing popu-lation and improved irrigation infrastructure also promoted the increase in irrigated areas. As the first of its kind in the country, our spatially explicit maps of irrigated croplands advance our understanding of the spatiotem-poral pattern of irrigation dynamics in China and are expected to contribute to sustainable water resource management and irrigation strategies in the face of climate change.

TI  - Instability of remote sensing based ecological index (RSEI) and its improvement for time series analysis
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of remote sensing technology, the monitoring of land surface ecological status (LSES) based on remote sensing has made remarkable progress, which has a positive contribution on improving the regional ecological environment and promoting the realization of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Among them, the proposed Remote Sensing-based Ecological Index (RSEI) becomes the most widely used model in the current application of remote sensing-based LSES monitoring due to its complete derived from remote sensing images and no subjective intervention. RSEI is not flawless either, and it still suffers from some uncertainties in its application in multiple scenarios. However, compared to the extensive applied research, work on the instability assessment and improvement of RSEI is particularly scarce and urgently needed. Therefore, in this paper, we analyzed the possible instabilities in the RSEI calculation process and proposed various inversion models to evaluate their accuracy and stability in time-series LSES monitoring. The results indicated that the existing normalized RSEI is relatively stable for the characterization of single-phase LSES, however, there is a high risk in the time-series analysis or cross-regional comparison due to the interference of component extremes. The standard deviation discretized DRSEIs proposed in this paper perform better in both single-phase and long-term dynamics LSES assessments and are more consistent with the real land cover changes. Also, compared with the approach that measures LSES dynamics using time-series regional RSEI mean values, the DRSEIs change detection results can reveal the spatial heterogeneity of regional LSES dynamics more effectively and provide a finer reference for the formulation and implementation of ecological protection policies.

TI  - Estimating evapotranspiration using remotely sensed solar-induced fluorescence measurements
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET) is a critical component of the land surface and its accurate estimation is crucial in understanding the global water and energy budgets. Current large-scale ET estimation models depend on remotely sensed data products of meteorological conditions and vegetation phenology, but high uncertainty remains to correctly represent ecological factors, which are regulated by biochemistry. In recent years, solar-induced fluorescence (SIF), a proxy for photosynthesis, has been extensively used in different ecological research and is conceived to be of great potential for ET estimation to constrain the transpiration flux, which is the significant component of ET. So far, most SIF-based ET estimation methods are achieved via empirical methods, which lack a solid physical foundation. In this work, we estimated ET by combining SIF and meteorological variables with Fick's law and an optimal stomatal behavior model and validated the model across different eddy-covariance flux stations around the globe. The model showed overall good performance across different ecosystems and when compared with other remote sensing-based ET models, such as the Priestley Taylor-JPL (PT-JPL) model, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-ET products, and a simple empirical linear SIF-ET model, the RMSE of estimated ET of the model proposed in this paper demonstrated better performance. The model we proposed here can be potentially extended for a reliable ET estimation at a global scale.

TI  - Accelerated decline of snow cover in China from 1979 to 2018 observed from space
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover is an important indicator of climate change. Variations of snow integrate the competing effect of increasing temperature and precipitation. In this study, based on Theil-Sen Median (TSM) and Mann-Kendall (M-K) methods, observational evidence from space was used to investigate the variation of snow parameters in China from 1979 to 2018, and some meaningful conclusions were found. (1) The downward trend of snow depth (SD) with a median of -0.02 cm/year was generally found in the high altitude mountains, and the upward trend of SD with a median of 0.01 cm/year occurs in the plains. A widespread and accelerated decrease of SD was observed in the latest period (2009-2018) in NC and NX. (2) The mean annual areas with snow cover days (SCDs) greater than 150 days (d) accounted for 17.8%, 24.73% and 38.14% in NC, NX and QTP. SCDs in NC and Northern QTP were widely reduced, but the longest snow season with more than eight months is still maintained on QTP. (3) The downward trend of snow storage (SS) was found in all three snow areas. The difference of snow phenology is reflected in the slowest accumulation and melting rate of SS on QTP; the largest peak value of SS and the shortest snow season in NC; the slow accumulation and rapid melting of snow in the NX, and the peak value is achieved at the latest. The trend of maximum temperature was judged as the most important factor affecting the change of SD, while longitude and latitude are closely related to the change of SCD.

TI  - Detection and characterization of active landslides with multisource SAR data and remote sensing in western Guizhou, China
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The western part of Guizhou is located in the second step of East Asia. Although the area is stratigraphically continuous and the surface is dominated by hard limestone and sandstone, catastrophic landslides often occur, seriously threatening residents' lives and the safety of property. Accurate identification of landslides and analysis of their developmental patterns are vital to prevent and reduce the threat of geological disasters. No active landslide survey data cover this region, so this paper identifies the active landslides in the western part of Guizhou by combining surface deformation information, multitemporal optical remote sensing images, geological lithology, and geomorphic features to obtain deformation information from multisource synthetic aperture radar surface data. This process increases the accuracy and reliability of identifying unstable slopes in areas with dense vegetation and steep terrain. By processing 283 Sentinel-1 and PALSAR-2 synthetic aperture radar data, 578 active landslides, 18 of which are high-risk large-scale landslides (landslide groups), are delineated for the first time in a range of 4.64 x 10(4) km(2) in the study area. The active landslides mainly include natural landslides, reservoir landslides, and mining-induced landslides, accounting for 2.4%, 4.2 %, and 93.4%, respectively. The spatial distribution of landslides is banded along the cuesta at the edge of an outcrop of coal strata. Landslides are mainly distributed at elevations of 1800-2000 m, with an elevation difference of 50 similar to 100 m and a slope range of 35 degrees similar to 40 degrees. The landslides are characterized by steep slopes, small scales, mass occurrences, and no dominant slope direction, classifying them as cuesta landslides induced by mining disturbance. Furthermore, nuanced remote sensing interpretation of the disaster elements, such as cuesta cliff, tensile cracks, deep and sizeable tensile channels, isolated rock masses, and collapse debris, and their processes of change, reveals that coal mining-disturbed landslides in this region have experienced four primary stages: natural unloading, mining disturbance, displacement acceleration, and slope failure. This is of great significance for understanding the genetic mechanism and developmental patterns, as well as the risk assessment, of this region.

TI  - The potential of modeling <i>Prosopis Juliflora </i>invasion using Sentinel-2 satellite data and environmental variables in the dryland ecosystem of Ethiopia
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth observation data play a vital role for efficient modeling of invasive species. Particularly, optical Sentinel-2 (S2) data with its capability of providing high spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions creates ample opportunities. However, few studies so far evaluated the combined use of S2 derived variables and environmental variables for modeling the distribution of invasive species. This study aims to compare the performance of models using S2 derived variables with environmental variables and their integration for modeling invasive Prosopis juliflora in the lower Awash River basin of Ethiopia. A total of 680 field data were used to train and validate the Random Forest (RF) approach. Model performances were evaluated using True Skill Statistics (TSS), kappa index, correlation, area under the curve (ROC), sensitivity and specificity. Our results demonstrated that modeling using S2 vegetation indices and S2 spectral bands showed higher performance compared to topoclimatic based variables with TSS of 0.91, 0.89, and 0.74, respectively. The ROC also confirmed the higher accuracy of S2 vegetation indices, S2 spectral bands and combined models compared to a topo-climatic based modeling. Interestingly, models using the integration of S2 derived variables with topo-climatic variables showed even better performance than the individual models. Our study highlighted that S2 derived variables and their integration with topo-climatic variables are highly recommended for efficient monitoring of invasive species distribution.

TI  - Feminist theory, method, and praxis: Toward a critical consciousness for family and close relationship scholars
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOCIAL AND PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS
M3  - Review
AB  - Feminism provides a worldview with innovative possibilities for scholarship and activism on behalf of families and intimate relationships. As a flexible framework capable of engaging with contentious theoretical ideas and the urgency of social change, feminism offers a simultaneous way to express an epistemology (knowledge), a methodology (the production of knowledge), an ontology (one's subjective way of being in the world), and a praxis (the translation of knowledge into actions that produce beneficial social change). Feminist family science, in particular, advances critical, intersectional, and queer approaches to examine the uses and abuses of power and the multiple axes upon which individuals and families are privileged, marginalized, and oppressed in diverse social contexts. In this paper, I embrace feminism as a personal, professional (academic), and political project and use stories from my own life to illuminate broader social-historical structures, processes, and contexts associated with gender, race, class, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, nationality, and other systems of social stratification. I provide a brief history and reflections on contemporary feminist theory and activism, particularly from the perspective of my disciplinary affiliation of feminist family science. I address feminism as an intersectional perspective through three themes: (a) theory: defining a critical feminist approach, (b) method: critical feminist autoethnographic research, and (c) praxis: transforming feminist theory into action. I conclude with takeaway messages for incorporating reflexivity and critical consciousness raising to provoke thought and action in the areas of personal, professional, and political change.

TI  - A novel ensemble machine learning and time series approach for oil palm yield prediction using Landsat time series imagery based on NDVI
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate oil palm yield prediction is necessary to sustain oil palm production for food security and economic return. However, there are limited studies on comprehensive mapping and accurate oil palm yield prediction using advanced machine learning algorithms. Using multi-temporal remote sensing data, this paper proposed a new approach to predict oil palm yield based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and ensemble machine learning algorithm. ReliefF algorithm with linear projection was employed to select the best combination of spectral indices in oil palm discrimination. Oil palm land cover was classified using random forest (RF) and modified AdaBoost algorithms. A time-series approach known as walk-forward validation was firstly introduced to train the model using the 2016-2019 data and the one-step prediction was performed for 2020 using RF and AdaBoost. Result of the study revealed that the RF model (RMSE = 0.384; MSE = 0.148; MAE = 0.147) outperformed the AdaBoost model (RMSE = 0.410; MSE = 0.168; MAE = 0.176). Our research has demonstrated the value of detailed mapping and subsequent yield prediction by developing a novel approach utilising time-series satellite imagery, ensemble machine learning, and NDVI, which will assist decision-makers in managing their practices related to oil palm.

TI  - On the influence of acquisition geometry in backscatter time series over wheat
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Dense time series of Sentinel-1 imagery are an invaluable information source for agricultural applications. Multiple orbits can observe a specific area and their combination could improve the temporal resolution of the time series. However, the orbits have different acquisition geometries regarding incidence and azimuth angles that need to be considered. Furthermore, crops are dynamic canopies and the influence of incidence and azimuth angles might change during the agricultural season due to different phenological stages. The main objective of this letter is to evaluate the influence of different acquisition geometries in Sentinel-1 backscatter time series over wheat canopies, and to propose a strategy for their correction. A large dataset of wheat parcels (similar to 40,000) was used and 344 Sentinel-1 images from three relative orbits were processed during two agricultural seasons. The first analysis was a monthly evaluation of the influence of incidence angle on backscatter (sigma(0)) and terrain flattened backscatter (gamma(0)). It showed that terrain flattening significantly reduced the backscatter dependence on incidence angle, being negligible in VH polarization but not completely in VV polarization. Incidence angle influence in VV backscatter changed in time due to wheat growth dynamics. To further reduce it, an incidence angle normalization technique followed by an azimuthal anisotropy correction were applied. In conclusion, gamma(0) enabled a reasonable combination of different relative orbits, that may be sufficient for many applications. However, for detailed analyses, the correction techniques might be implemented to further reduce orbit differences, especially in bare soil periods or winter months.

TI  - Multi-decadal changes of mangrove forest and its response to the tidal dynamics of thane creek, Mumbai
T2  - JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves are one of the world threatened ecosystems, which is protected and categorised under CRZ-I according to the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) notification. The present study marked the decadal (1990-2017, Landsat series) change of mangroves and mapped the species distribution (2017, Sentinel-2) around Thane creek, Mumbai using SMLC with QGIS-SCP software. ADCIRC model was used to simulate the tidal flooding/ebbing towards mangroves, and the model was validated with the in-situ observation of tides and currents. From 1990 to 2017, the mangrove area increased from 79.14 km(2) to 154.5 km(2) and expanded towards landward and seaward regions. Between 2010 and 2017, there was a fluctuation in the mangrove area with ups and downs in their distribution caused by different climatic conditions and anthropogenic activities. The increase in built-up area was two times than mangrove area increase. The dominance of Avicennia marina species confirms the increased anthropogenic activity along the landward side. To understand the response of mangroves to the tidal dynamics, the model was simulated with two scenarios; with mangroves and without mangroves. In the absence of mangroves (without mangroves), Thane Creek demonstrated a perfect funnelling effect by increased tidal amplification with strong flood currents, resulting in severe coastal inundation and erosion. While with mangroves, tidal currents attenuated 80% of its magnitude and favoured the sediment deposition in mangrove areas, which further enhanced mangrove growth, thereby stabilising the coast. The present study has found that the mangroves in the Thane creek are in the saturation stage and reached the maximum growth towards the landward. The study envisages that the stakeholders should adopt a proper management plan for the restoration of mangroves. The highlight of the present study is the combination of satellite imagery and hydrodynamic modelling. Satellite imagery provides the estimated extent of the mangroves, and this information will be used when simulating the model, which provides maximum inundation and attenuation. The utilisation of LULC classification and ADCIRC model results would be helpful to examine the threatening built-up area due to the tidal inundation. The combination of satellite classification and hydrodynamic model findings will be decisive for management authorities towards the conservation and regeneration activities for a balanced mangrove-creek ecosystem.

TI  - Versatile and Targeted Validation of Space-Borne XCO<sub>2</sub>, XCH<sub>4</sub> and XCO Observations by Mobile Ground-Based Direct-Sun Spectrometers
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite measurements of the atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and carbon monoxide (CO) require careful validation. In particular for the greenhouse gases CO2 and CH4, concentration gradients are minute challenging the ultimate goal to quantify and monitor anthropogenic emissions and natural surfaceatmosphere fluxes. The upcoming European Copernicus Carbon Monitoring mission (CO2M) will focus on anthropogenic CO2 emissions, but it will also be able to measure CH4. There are other missions such as the Sentinel-5 Precursor and the Sentinel-5 series that target CO which helps attribute the CO2 and CH4 variations to specific processes. Here, we review the capabilities and use cases of a mobile ground-based sun-viewing spectrometer of the type EM27/SUN. We showcase the performance of the mobile system for measuring the column-average dry-air mole fractions of CO2 (XCO2), CH4 (XCH4) and CO (XCO) during a recent deployment (Feb./Mar. 2021) in the vicinity of Japan on research vessel Mirai which adds to our previous campaigns on ships and road vehicles. The mobile EM27/SUN has the potential to contribute to the validation of 1) continental-scale background gradients along major ship routes on the open ocean, 2) regional-scale gradients due to continental outflow across the coast line, 3) urban or other localized emissions as mobile part of a regional network and 4) emissions from point sources. Thus, operationalizing the mobile EM27/SUN along these use cases can be a valuable asset to the validation activities for CO2M, in particular, and for various upcoming satellite missions in general.

TI  - Highly divergent isolates of chrysanthemum virus B and chrysanthemum virus R infecting chrysanthemum in Russia
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Chrysanthemum is a popular ornamental and medicinal plant that suffers from many viruses and viroids. Among them, chrysanthemum virus B (CVB, genus Carlavirus, family Betaflexiviridae) is widespread in all chrysanthemum-growing regions. Another carlavirus, chrysanthemum virus R (CVR), has been recently discovered in China. Information about chrysanthemum viruses in Russia is very scarce. The objective of this work was to study the prevalence and genetic diversity of CVB and CVR in Russia.Methods: We surveyed the chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum morifolium Ramat.) germplasm collection in the Nikita Botanical Gardens, Yalta, Russia. To detect CVB and CVR, we used RT-PCR with virus-specific primers. To reveal the complete genome sequences of CVB and CVR isolates, metatransciptomic analysis of the cultivars Ribonette, Fiji Yellow, and Golden Standard plants, naturally co-infected with CVB and CVR, was performed using Illumina high-throughput sequencing. The recombination detection tool (RDP4) was employed to search for recombination in assembled genomes.Results: A total of 90 plants of 23 local and introduced chrysanthemum cultivars were surveyed. From these, 58 and 43% plants tested positive for CVB and CVR, respectively. RNA-Seq analysis confirmed the presence of CVB and CVR, and revealed tomato aspermy virus in each of the three transcriptomes. Six near complete genomes of CVB and CVR were assembled from the RNA-Seq reads. The CVR isolate X21 from the cultivar Golden Standard was 92% identical to the Chinese isolate BJ. In contrast, genomes of the CVR isolates X6 and X13 (from the cultivars Ribonette and Fiji Yellow, respectively), were only 76% to 77% identical to the X21 and BJ, and shared 95% identity to one another and appear to represent a divergent group of the CVR. Two distantly related CVB isolates, GS1 and GS2, were found in a plant of the cultivar Golden Standard. Their genomes shared from 82% to 87% identity to each other and the CVB genome from the cultivar Fiji Yellow (isolate FY), as well as to CVB isolates from Japan and China. A recombination event of 3,720 nucleotides long was predicted in the replicase gene of the FY genome. It was supported by seven algorithms implemented in RDP4 with statistically significant P-values. The inferred major parent was the Indian isolate Uttar Pradesh (AM765837), and minor parent was unknown.Conclusion: We found a wide distribution of CVB and CVR in the chrysanthemum germplasm collection of the Nikita Botanical Gardens, which is the largest in Russia. Six near complete genomes of CVR and CVB isolates from Russia were assembled and characterized for the first time. This is the first report of CVR in Russia and outside of China thus expanding the information on the geographical distribution of the virus. Highly divergent CVB and CVR isolates have been identified that contributes the better understanding the genetic diversity of these viruses.

TI  - Longitudinal effects of adjuvant chemotherapy and lymph node staging on patient-reported outcomes in endometrial cancer survivors: a prospective cohort study
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most patients with endometrial cancer with localized disease are effectively treated and survive for a long time. The primary treatment is hysterectomy, to which surgical staging procedures may be added to assess the need for adjuvant therapy. Longitudinal data on patient-reported outcomes comparing different levels of primary treatment are lacking, especially when adjuvant radiotherapy is omitted.OBJECTIVE: We assessed the impact of lymphadenectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy on patient-reported symptoms, function, and quality of life. We hypothesized that these treatment modalities would substantially affect patient-reported outcomes at follow-up.STUDY DESIGN: We prospectively included patients with endometrial cancer enrolled in the ongoing MoMaTEC2 study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02543710). Patients were asked to complete the patient-reported outcome questionnaires European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire EN24 preoperatively and at 1 and 2 years of follow-up. Functional domains and symptoms were analyzed for the whole cohort and by treatment received. To assess the effect of the individual treatment modifications, we used mixed regression models.RESULTS: Baseline data were available for 448 patients. Of these patients, 339 and 219 had reached 1-year follow-up and 2-year follow-up, respectively. Treatment included hysterectomy (plus bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy) alone (n=177), hysterectomy and lymph node staging without adjuvant therapy (n=133), or adjuvant chemotherapy irrespective of staging procedure (n=138). Overall, patients reported improved global health status and quality of life (+9 units; P<.001), increased emotional and social functioning, and increased sexual interest and activity (P<.001 for all) from baseline to year 1, and these outcomes remained stable at year 2. Means of functional scales and quality of life were similar to age- and sex-weighted reference cohorts. Mean tingling and numbness and lymphedema increased after treatment. The group who received adjuvant chemotherapy had a larger mean reduction in physical functioning (-6 vs +2; P=.002) at year 1, more neuropathy (+30 vs +5; P<.001; year 1) at years 1 and 2, and more lymphedema at year 1 (+11 vs +2; P=.007) than the group treated with hysterectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy only. In patients not receiving adjuvant chemotherapy, patient-reported outcomes were similar regardless of lymph node staging procedures. Adjuvant chemotherapy independently increased fatigue, lymphedema, and neuropathy in mixed regression models.CONCLUSION: Patients with endometrial cancer receiving adjuvant chemotherapy reported significantly reduced functioning and more symptoms up to 2 years after treatment. For patients treated by surgery alone, surgical staging did not seem to affect the quality of life or symptoms to a measurable degree at follow-up. Therefore, subjecting patients to lymph node removal to tailor adjuvant therapy seems justified from the patient's viewpoint; however, efforts should increase to find alternatives to traditional chemotherapy.

TI  - Remote sensing of transparency in the China seas from the ESA-OC-CCI data
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Water transparency, often measured by Secchi disk, is an intuitive indicator of water quality and plays an important role in aquatic environments. The European Space Agency (ESA) Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI) datasets provide daily and monthly remote-sensing reflectance over the period 1997-2019, which can be used to estimate Secchi disk depth (Z(sd)) with an innovative mechanistic model developed by Lee et al. (2015). In this study, the analytically-derived Z(sd) was validated by in situ Z(sd) measurements ranging from 0.1 to 38 m. The in situ Z(sd) measurements were collected in the first large-scale systematic survey on the marine environment in the China's offshore waters. Results indicated a good agreement between the in situ and satellite measurements. Based on the validated OC-CCI Z(sd) products, the spatio-temporal patterns and long-term changes of transparency in the China seas over the period 1997-2019 were studied. Regions with significant increase and decrease in Z(sd) on a long-term scale were also identified. Results of this work demonstrate the importance of both the OC-CCI Z(sd) products and remote sensing techniques in accessing water quality from long-term observations.

TI  - A Proposed Approach for NewSpace Industry Development in Taiwan
T2  - NEW SPACE-THE JOURNAL OF SPACE ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Space development in Taiwan is much later than that of many traditional space-fairing countries. Before the 1990s, Taiwan's space activities focused on satellite TV and receiving meteorological and remote sensing data from other countries. In 1990, space development in Taiwan was divided into 3 paths, the first was geosynchronous orbit communication satellites operated by Chunghwa Telecom and Singapore Telecom, the second was the FORMOSA Satellite developed by National Space Organization (NSPO), and the third was Cubesats developed by local universities. Except for Cubesates, all of Taiwan's satellites were acquired from foreign countries. Until 2017, the launch of Taiwan's first self-made high-resolution optical remote sensing satellite marked a new milestone in the history of space development in Taiwan. Based on this achievement, Taiwan government officially approved the "Third Phase National Space Plan" in 2019. One of the important goals of this plan is to promote the establishment of the Taiwan space industry. In addition to the traditional space sector, some entrepreneurs in Taiwan have also taken advantage of this "NewSpace" wave and have set up new space companies. Compared with the past, the Taiwan space industry has changed dramatically in recent years. To grasp the overall picture of the development of the Taiwan space industry, the NSPO also conducted the Taiwan space industry survey since 2017. The survey covers both traditional and NewSpace companies. The space industry is a high value-added industry, but it is also an industry with a high investment amount and high risks. Therefore, how to formulate related incentives and regulations and other supporting measures to effectively promote the space industry is a topic that many emerging space nations must face. Same situation has also occurred in Taiwan. This study aims to propose a model (or a group of strategies) for the development of Taiwan's NewSpace Industry. The main parts of this article are an introduction of Taiwan's space development and the challenges and opportunities faced by Taiwan's NewSpace industry, as well as a proposal of development strategies and measures for Taiwan's NewSpace industry. Throughout, this study puts forward suggestions to propose strategies for Taiwan's NewSpace industry, with a view to building a model for emerging space countries to establish a NewSpace industry.

TI  - Monitoring deformations of infrastructure networks: A fully automated GIS integration and analysis of InSAR time-series
T2  - STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Ageing stock and extreme weather events pose a threat to the safety of infrastructure networks. In most countries, funding allocated to infrastructure management is insufficient to perform systematic inspections over large transport networks. As a result, early signs of distress can develop unnoticed, potentially leading to catastrophic structural failures. Over the past 20 years, a wealth of literature has demonstrated the capability of satellite-based Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) to accurately detect surface deformations of different types of assets. Thanks to the high accuracy and spatial density of measurements, and a short revisit time, space-borne remote-sensing techniques have the potential to provide a cost-effective and near real-time monitoring tool. Whilst InSAR techniques offer an effective approach for structural health monitoring, they also provide a large amount of data. For civil engineering procedures, these need to be analysed in combination with large infrastructure inventories. Over a regional scale, the manual extraction of InSAR-derived displacements from individual assets is extremely time-consuming and an automated integration of the two datasets is essential to effectively assess infrastructure systems. This paper presents a new methodology based on the fully automated integration of InSAR-based measurements and Geographic Information System-infrastructure inventories to detect potential warnings over extensive transport networks. A Sentinel dataset from 2016 to 2019 is used to analyse the Los Angeles highway and freeway network, while the Italian motorway network is evaluated by using open access ERS/Envisat datasets between 1992 and 2010, COSMO-SkyMed datasets between 2008 and 2014 and Sentinel datasets between 2014 and 2020. To demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed methodology to different SAR sensors and infrastructure classes, the analysis of bridges and viaducts in the two test areas is also performed. The outcomes highlight the potential of the proposed methodology to be integrated into structural health monitoring systems and improve current procedures for transport network management.

TI  - Advancements in the satellite sensing of the impacts of climate and variability on bush encroachment in savannah rangelands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - An increase in shrubs or woody species is likely, directly or indirectly, to significantly affect rural livelihoods, wildlife/livestock productivity and conservation efforts. Poor and inappropriate land use management practices have resulted in rangeland degradation, particularly in semi-arid regions, and this has amplified the bush encroachment rate in many African countries, particularly in key savannah rangelands. The rate of encroachment is also perceived to be connected to other environmental factors, such as climate change, fire and rainfall variability, which may influence the structure and density of the shrubs (woody plants), when compared to uncontrolled grazing. Remote sensing has provided robust data for global studies on both bush encroachment and climate variability over multiple decades, and these data have complemented the local and regional evidence and process studies. This paper thus provides a detailed review of the advancements in the use of remote sensing for the monitoring of bush encroachment on the African continent, which is fuelled by climate variability in the rangeland areas. An understanding of how bush encroachment is fuelled by climate variability and change, as well as its impact on rangelands in the semi-arid areas, is still limited due to the scanty and, at times, fragmented research, especially when it comes to using remote sensing technology. This study also highlights the scientific knowledge gap that exists regarding the impact of climate variability on rangelands, which has yet to be explored by using remotely-sensed data. From a remote sensing viewpoint, rangeland monitoring is challenging when it comes to discriminating between the different herbaceous layers and implementing management practices. Overall, this review emphasizes the increasing role and potential of remote sensing in tracking the impact of climate change on savannah rangelands.

M3  - Article
AB  - In agricultural production, nitrogen (N) deficiency reduces yield, while overapplication may have an unwanted impact on the natural environment and farm finances. Frequent field N monitoring is impractical due to the time and cost required for traditional laboratory analysis. However, remotely sensed data are an alternative to evaluate and monitor crop nutrition status throughout the growing season. This study evaluates the spatial distribution of N in pasture fields cultivated under an integrated crop-livestock system (ICLS) using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and satellites data. We assessed the performance of UAV, PlanetScope, and Sentinel-2A platforms to predict the N parameters: plant N content (PNC), aboveground biomass (AGB), and nutritional nitrogen index (NNI). Moreover, we also simulated a UAV device with a visible light sensor (i.e., red-green-blue (RGB)) as a costly alternative to near-infrared (NIR) sensors to monitor N status. Finally, we assessed whether combining the information from these platforms would improve the N predictions in our study area. The UAV, PlanetScope, and Sentinel-2A data were able to estimate N parameters in the studied pasture fields using the random forest regression algorithm. The UAV multispectral data resulted in the best prediction accuracies (R2: 0.84-PNC, 0.70-AGB, and 0.84-NNI). The combination of UAV_RGB with either PlanetScope (R2: 0.79-PNC, 0.67AGB, 0.77-NNI) or Sentinel-2A (R2: 0.76-PNC, 0.57-AGB, 0.69-NNI) improved the performance of the three platforms individually (UAV_RGB, PlanetScope or Sentinel-2A). The association between high spatial and spectral resolutions contributes to the highest prediction accuracy in estimating N variability in pasture fields using remote sensing data. Our results suggest that remote sensing techniques are a reliable approach for N monitoring in commercial pasture fields under ICLS.

TI  - Open vs minimally invasive radical trachelectomy in early-stage cervical cancer: International Radical Trachelectomy Assessment Study
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive radical trachelectomy has emerged as an alternative to open radical hysterectomy for patients with early-stage cervical cancer desiring future fertility. Recent data suggest worse oncologic outcomes after minimally invasive radical hysterectomy than after open radical hysterectomy in stage I cervical cancer.OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare 4.5-year disease-free survival after open vs minimally invasive radical trachelectomy.STUDY DESIGN: This was a collaborative, international retrospective study (International Radical Trachelectomy Assessment Study) of patients treated during 2005-2017 at 18 centers in 12 countries. Eligible patients had squamous carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, or adenosquamous carcinoma; had a preoperative tumor size of <= 2 cm; and underwent open or minimally invasive (robotic or laparoscopic) radical trachelectomy with nodal assessment (pelvic lymphadenectomy and/or sentinel lymph node biopsy). The exclusion criteria included neoadjuvant chemotherapy or preoperative pelvic radiotherapy, previous lymphadenectomy or pelvic retroperitoneal surgery, pregnancy, stage IA1 disease with lymphovascular space invasion, aborted trachelectomy (conversion to radical hysterectomy), or vaginal approach. Surgical approach, indication, and adjuvant therapy regimen were at the discretion of the treating institution. A total of 715 patients were entered into the study database. However, 69 patients were excluded, leaving 646 in the analysis. Endpoints were the 4.5-year disease-free survival rate (primary), 4.5-year overall survival rate (secondary), and recurrence rate (secondary). Kaplan-Meier methods were used to estimate disease-free survival and overall survival. A post hoc weighted analysis was performed, comparing the recurrence rates between surgical approaches, with open surgery being considered as standard and minimally invasive surgery as experimental.RESULTS: Of 646 patients, 358 underwent open surgery, and 288 underwent minimally invasive surgery. The median (range) patient age was 32 (20-42) years for open surgery vs 31 (18-45) years for minimally invasive surgery (P=.11). Median (range) pathologic tumor size was 15 (0-31) mm for open surgery and 12 (0.8-40) mm for minimally invasive surgery (P=.33). The rates of pelvic nodal involvement were 5.3% (19 of 358 patients) for open surgery and 4.9% (14 of 288 patients) for minimally invasive surgery (P=.81). Median (range) follow-up time was 5.5 (0.20-16.70) years for open surgery and 3.1 years (0.02-11.10) years for minimally invasive surgery (P<.001). At 4.5 years, 17 of 358 patients (4.7%) with open surgery and 18 of 288 patients (6.2%) with minimally invasive surgery had recurrence (P=.40). The 4.5-year disease-free survival rates were 94.3% (95% confidence interval, 91.6-97.0) for open surgery and 91.5% (95% confidence interval, 87.6-95.6) for minimally invasive surgery (log-rank P=.37). Post hoc propensity score analysis of recurrence risk showed no difference between surgical approaches (P=.42). At 4.5 years, there were 6 disease-related deaths (open surgery, 3; minimally invasive surgery, 3) (log-rank P=.49). The 4.5-year overall survival rates were 99.2% (95% confidence interval, 97.6-99.7) for open surgery and 99.0% (95% confidence interval, 79.0-99.8) for minimally invasive surgery.CONCLUSION: The 4.5-year disease-free survival rates did not differ between open radical trachelectomy and minimally invasive radical trachelectomy. However, recurrence rates in each group were low. Ongoing prospective studies of conservative management of early-stage cervical cancer may help guide future management.

TI  - ICYMI: RT and Youth-Oriented International Broadcasting as (Geo)Political Culture Jamming
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRESS-POLITICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Research in political communication has recently begun to explore the role of non-Western English-language state-funded international broadcasters (NEIBs) in influencing international audiences. Despite this, there has been little attention given to understanding how NEIBs engage and influence young people in 'Western' democracies. Our article addresses this gap by providing a detailed analysis of RT's English-language, youth-orientated news product ICYMI. Launched in 2018, ICYMI is a social media-based news brand that consists of a series of 2-3-min videos that deliver satirical takes on recent global events including military conflict, financial scandals, and culture clashes. Our findings, which examine the first year of the platform's activity, show that ICYMI is a novel form of engagement, one that is not easily categorised as either public diplomacy or propaganda, nor can it be described as traditional journalism. Instead, we label this approach as geopolitical culture jamming. In this article, we conduct a discourse analysis of 45 videos published on YouTube by ICYMI over its first year to examine how the platform attempts to influence how young people relate to traditional foreign policy discourses. Our empirical analysis centres on how viewers engage with and interpret ICYMI's videos with the aim of addressing how RT may be influencing younger audiences, particularly its core demographic of Anglophone white males whose comments reflect an attachment to ICYMI's populist, anti-elite worldview.

TI  - Prevalence and Implications of Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) in Settled Dust
T2  - CURRENT ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose of Review Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a family of more than 7,000 fluorinated compounds. The carbon-fluorine bond of PFAS provides desirable hydrophobic and oleophobic properties and stability that has led to widespread usage in consumer products and industrial applications. The strength of the carbon-fluorine bond also prevents appreciable degradation once released into the environment. Consequently, various household products can release volatile and nonvolatile PFAS into the indoor environment that often concentrate in dust. We discuss the diversity of PFAS in settled dust, emission sources of these chemicals, changes in PFAS profiles in dust over the past century, and the implications for human health. Recent Findings Sources of PFAS found in dust include building materials and furnishings and consumer products used in typical indoor spaces. Daycares and workplaces are emphasized as locations with widespread exposure due to the presence of treated carpeting and industrial-strength cleaners. Comparison and interpretation of findings across studies are complicated by the different ways in which PFAS are screened across studies. We further discuss recent developments in non-targeted software for the comprehensive annotation of PFAS in indoor dust and emphasize the need for comprehensive and harmonized analytical workflows. We highlight the detection and diversity of PFAS in settled dust collected from various indoor spaces, including locations with vulnerable subpopulations. There are opportunities for future research to leverage settled dust as a sentinel environmental matrix to evaluate the link between inhalation and ingestion routes of PFAS exposure to adverse health.

TI  - Prediction of rapid intensification for land-falling extremely severe cyclonic storms in the Bay of Bengal
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - During the past 30 years (1990-2020), all extremely severe cyclonic storms (ESCS) that formed over the Bay of Bengal (BoB) region had undergone rapid intensification (RI) attributed due to climate change. A detailed evaluation is therefore necessary to forecast and ascertain the rapid changes in intensity especially the RI over BoB that has direct socio-economic consequences in coastal regions. This study performed a detailed evaluation on the intensity and RI of ESCS over the BoB region using Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Observations were assimilated using conventional and satellite radiances to improve the initial conditions of four ESCSs (Mala, 2006; Sidr, 2007; Phailin, 2013 and Hudhud, 2014). Numerical experiments used a double-nested domain of 27 and 9 km horizontal resolution with 73 vertical levels. The forecasted intensity, structure, and storm tracks were in good agreement with the available observations. Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of Maximum Surface Winds (MSW) were 5 m s(-1), 6 m s(-1), 5 m s(-1), and 5 m s(-1) from Day 1 to Day 4, respectively, with mean initial intensity error of about 4.5 m s(-1). Results indicate that RI of ESCS was well apprehended in WRF model showing significant differences in the forecast for different cases. In most of the cases, the RI was under-predicted. The overall performance of WRF model was reasonably good in forecasting RI, and the estimated statistics for Probability of Detection (POD) and False Alarm Rate (FAR) was about 68% and 21%, respectively, based on the four cases considered in this study. Forecasted reflectivity and vertical profiles of heating rate, divergence, hydrometeors, vertical winds, and temperature anomaly are also presented in this study. Mean track error of storms varied between 75 and 135 km, at 24 to 96 h, respectively, while the mean landfall time and positional errors were about 3 h and 69 km, respectively. This research has also highlighted the need for a re-evaluation of the WRF model's performance in forecasting the track, structure, and intensity of ESCS over BOB during the RI.

TI  - GSCCTL: a general semi-supervised scene classification method for remote sensing images based on clustering and transfer learning
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, much research has shown that deep learning methods are superior in scene classification for remote sensing images (HSIs). However, the lack of labelled samples and computational resources present serious obstacles for HSI scene classification. To address these problems, we consider the pragmatic deep learning problem with only a few or no labelled samples. A general semi-supervised scene classification method based on clustering and transfer learning named GSCCTL is proposed to transfer outstanding supervised learning models to semi-supervised scene classification. Specifically, the GSCCTL model iterates between (1) scene clustering and (2) transfer learning to improve scene classification performance for the HSI data set. Since the clustering results may contain noise, we propose a new method to calculate the distance between the samples and the clustering center and add a reliable sample selection operation to the data after clustering. Initially, the model's scene classification performance is weak, and transfer learning is carried out on a few samples close to the clustering center. In subsequent iterations, the model is constantly optimized, more and more samples are selected as reliable samples for training, and the model's scene classification performance is strengthened. Through iterative clustering and transfer learning, the model is progressively optimized and gradually converged until the end condition is reached. Extensive experiments on the UCMerced, AID, and NWPU-RESISC45 remote sensing data sets demonstrate that the GSCCTL model based on clustering and transfer learning improved scene classification accuracy with only a few labelled samples and is suitable for semi-supervised scene classification.

TI  - Determination of land restoration potentials in the semi-arid areas of Chad using systematic monitoring and mapping techniques
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The restoration of degraded lands has received increased attention in recent years and many commitments have been made as part of global and regional restoration initiatives. Well-informed policy decisions that support land restoration, require spatially explicit information on restoration potentials to guide the design and implementation of restoration interventions in the context of limited resources. This study assessed ecosystems indicators of land degradation using a systematic approach that combines field surveys and remote sensing data into a set of multi-criteria analyses to map restoration potentials in the semi-arid areas. The indicators considered were soil organic carbon, erosion prevalence, enhanced vegetation index, Normalized differences water index and the Net Primary productivity. Three classes of restoration potential were established: (1) areas not in need of immediate restoration due low degradation status, (2) areas with high potential for restoration with moderate efforts required and (3) areas in critical need of restoration and require high level of efforts. Of the total area of the study site estimated at 88,344 km(2), 59,146.12 km(2), or 66.94% of the theoretically recoverable area, was considered suitable for restoration, of which 38% required moderate efforts while 28% require less efforts. The recoverable areas suitable for restoration could be restored through tree planting, soil and water conservation practices, farmers managed natural regeneration, and integrated soil fertility management. These results can help to spatially identify suitable multifunctional restoration and regeneration hotspots as an efficient way to prioritize restoration interventions in the context of limited resources.

TI  - More than surface temperature: mitigating thermal exposure in hyper-local land system
T2  - JOURNAL OF LAND USE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Regional land surface temperature (LST) maps derived from remote sensing data are most available to cities to assess and respond to heat. Yet, LST only captures one dimension of urban climate. This study investigates the extent to which remote sensing derived estimates of LST are a proxy for multiple climate variables at hyper-local scales (<10s of meters). We compare remotely sensed estimates of LST (RS-LST) to field and simulated LST, MRT, and air temperature (AT), in a neighborhood in Tucson, Arizona, USA. We find that LST, MRT, and ST follow different diurnal trends masked by RS-LST. We also find that three-dimensional urban design is a better predictor of MRT than two-dimensional land cover and albedo - a known determinant of RS-LST. Shade is a better predictor of both simulated LST and MRT than RS-LST. We conclude that RS-LST is not adequate for guiding heat mitigation at hyper-local scales in cities.

TI  - Stability evaluation of tidal flats based on time-series satellite images: A case study of the Jiangsu central coast, China
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Systematic evaluation of tidal-flat stability is vital for coastal protection and management. However, due to the complex geomorphology and variable sediment dynamics of tidal flats, there are few studies on this topic. In this study, the stability of tidal flats along the Jiangsu Province's central coast in China was analyzed using a cumulative change frequency (CCF) method. Tidal creeks were extracted from 131 images at low tidal levels registered by Landsat-8 OLI, Sentinel-2 MSI, GF-1 WFV, and HJ-1 CCD satellites between 2009 and 2019. The results indicated that MSI images could identify five levels of tidal creeks, and the number of tidal creeks extracted was the greatest. The extraction results from OLI and WFV images were similar, and they can identify four, whereas only large-scale and medium-scale tidal creeks can be identified from CCD images. The area of stable tidal flats was estimated to be-202 km(2), mainly near-shore and the inner part of several major tidal channels, representing-23.0% of the total area. In comparison, the unstable tidal flats were estimated to be 75 km(2), accounting for-8.5% of the total area, mainly located in the middle and lower sections with frequent migration in tidal creeks. The tidal-creek system oscillation period increases from land to sea, roughly two years for the salt-marsh zone and three years for the lower intertidal zone. These findings are essential to promote the understanding of tidal-flat evolution and support the practical guidelines for coastal and offshore management.

TI  - Results of Locoregional Radiotherapy or Axillary Dissection in Early Breast Cancer with pN0(is +) and pN1mi Nodal Disease
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Clinical significance of isolated tumor cells (pN0(i +)) or micrometastasis (pN1mi) in sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in early-stage breast cancer is still controversial. Randomized studies have shown that advanced axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) need not be performed. However, radiotherapy (RT) fields to be irradiated were not clear. In our study, advanced axillary treatments (dissection or RT) were evaluated retrospectively in patients with pN1mi and pN0(i +) detected by SLNB, and the effects of local/regional recurrence (LRR) and survival were analyzed. We identified early breast cancer patients with pN1mi/pN0(i +) treated with surgery only or surgery with RT from January 2009 to December 2018. The primary outcome of interest was LRR. A total of 116 patients (23% with pN0(i +) and 77% with micrometastases) were identified. Ninety-five patients had SLNB alone and ALND was added in 21 (18%) patients. Sixty-nine (59%) patients underwent breast conservation (BCS) and 47 (41%) simple or skin/nipple-sparing mastectomy. All BCS patients were irradiated. Twelve (26%) of mastectomy and SLNB patients received RT. Of the 81 patients who underwent RT, 46 (57%) were irradiated only at breast or chest wall (WBI/CW), 35 (43%) patients were irradiated WBI/CW with any lymphatics. LRR was not observed in any group of patients. Systemic metastasis developed in 2 (2%) of 116 patients. Disease-free survival rate was 98%. LRR rates are very low in cases with pN1mi and pN0(i +) detected in early-stage breast cancer. ALND or addition of lymphatics to the radiotherapy area after SLNB does not affect LRR results.

TI  - Declines in canopy greenness and tree growth are caused by combined climate extremes during drought-induced dieback
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Several dieback episodes triggered by droughts are revealing the high vulnerability of Mediterranean forests, manifested as declines in growth, increased defoliation, and rising mortality rates. Understanding forest responses to such climate extreme events is of high priority for predicting their future vegetation dynamics. We examined how remotely sensed measures of vegetation activity (NDVI, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and radial growth (BAI, basal area increment) responded to climate extreme events. We considered tree (Pinus sylvestris, Quercus pubescens, Quercus frainetto) and shrub (Juniperus phoenicea) populations from Italy and Spain showing recent dieback phenomena. Two components of drought, namely elevated atmospheric demand (VPD, vapor pressure deficit) and low soil moisture were analyzed in nearby stands showing or not showing dieback symptoms. Dieback stands exhibited lower NDVI values than non-dieback stands. NDVI and BAI were positively related in all sites except for the dieback stand of Q. frainetto that was negatively related. Such NDVI-BAI linkages were related to specific time windows, which could be useful for identifying when climatic conditions have the greatest influence on vegetation. Growth decline occurred in response to increasing VPD, but responses differed among species. J. phoenicea was the most negatively impacted by higher VPD, whereas oaks responded to soil moisture. A high VPD was related to stronger growth reduction in dieback P. sylvestris trees regardless of soil moisture changes. We highlighted that coupling between proxies of forest productivity (NDVI, BAI) allows better understanding and forecasting of drought-induced dieback phenomena in forests and shrublands. Scaling up from tree to stand levels might be feasible when using the maximum growing season NDVI, which can be applied for retrospective modeling of the impact of drought stress on forest productivity and tree growth.

T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization is considered an environmental threat as high salt content hinders plant growth. Soil salinity is usually associated with climate aridity at a regional scale, while topography, subsurface hydrology, and land use combine with climate to produce salinization patterns at landscape scale. In this study, the first such assessment for the study area, we investigated the relationship between climate, groundwater level (GWL) changes, and soil salinity. For comparison, two adjacent vegetation units used as marginal grazing lands were selected: thickets of Allenrolfea patagonica (Ap thicket), located at the base of a scarp, and bushes of Cyclolepis genistoides (Cg bush), located away from the topographic discontinuity. Electrical conductivity (ECrs) maps derived from LANDSAT-8/OLI were used to analyze salinity patterns. The results showed that GWL rose in coincidence with precipitation events and fell during dryer and warmer periods. GWL was always closer to the surface in the Ap thicket, and level changes were more likely to occur there. ECrs showed a seasonal pattern with significantly higher (p < 0.05) values in the Ap thicket during summer. Within the Cg bush, relatively higher ECrs appeared around a permanent water trough. Within this zone, ECrs values during summer were significantly higher (p < 0.05). Coupled evaluation of GWL dynamics and soil salinization patterns showed that GWL changes interact with land use practices to produce local-scale patterns of salinization. Topography played an important role in controlling soil surface properties through its influence on groundwater dynamics and small topographic changes produced largely different conditions for vegetation growth.

TI  - Influences of Shifted Vegetation Phenology on Runoff Across a Hydroclimatic Gradient
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate warming has changed vegetation phenology, and the phenology-associated impacts on terrestrial water fluxes remain largely unquantified. The impacts are linked to plant adjustments and responses to climate change and can be different in different hydroclimatic regions. Based on remote sensing data and observed river runoff of hydrological station from six river basins across a hydroclimatic gradient from northeast to southwest in China, the relative contributions of the vegetation (including spring and autumn phenology, growing season length (GSL), and gross primary productivity) and climatic factors affecting the river runoffs over 1982-2015 were investigated by applying gray relational analysis (GRA). We found that the average GSLs in humid regions (190-241 days) were longer than that in semi-humid regions (186-192 days), and the average GSLs were consistently extended by 4.8-13.9 days in 1982-2015 period in six river basins. The extensions were mainly linked to the delayed autumn phenology in the humid regions and to advanced spring phenology in the semi-humid regions. Across all river basins, the GRA results showed that precipitation (r = 0.74) and soil moisture (r = 0.73) determine the river runoffs, and the vegetation factors (VFs) especially the vegetation phenology also affected the river runoffs (spring phenology: r = 0.66; GSL: r = 0.61; autumn phenology: r = 0.59), even larger than the contribution from temperature (r = 0.57), but its relative importance is climatic region-dependent. Interestingly, the spring phenology is the main VF in the humid region for runoffs reduction, while both spring and autumn growth phenology are the main VFs in the semi-humid region, because large autumn phenology delay and less water supply capacity in spring amplify the effect of advanced spring phenology. This article reveals diverse linkages between climatic and VFs, and runoff in different hydroclimatic regions, and provides insights that vegetation phenology influences the ecohydrology process largely depending on the local hydroclimatic conditions, which improve our understanding of terrestrial hydrological responses to climate change.

TI  - A novel morphological phenotype does not ensure reduced biotic resistance on an oceanic island
T2  - BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Biotic resistance by the local community is a prominent theory seeking to explain invasion success or failure. Oceanic island communities might be prone to invasions because of their assumed low biotic resistance, due to low species richness and ecological naivety towards invaders. Biotic resistance, however, has rarely been quantified. We attempted such quantification on Terceira Island (Azores, Portugal) using the sentinel prey method. Vanessa virginiensis, a widely distributed Nearctic butterfly, has not been recorded on Terceira, and their caterpillars have characteristic green-black stripes that make it dissimilar to other Azorean caterpillars. We examined whether predation rate (PR) on plasticine caterpillars mimicking the unfamiliar V. virginiensis pattern were lower than on familiar green ones. We exposed a total of 4479 caterpillars in native forests and five non-native habitats, the agroecosystems orchards, vineyards, low and high elevation maize fields, and intensively managed pastures. Overall PR was higher on caterpillars with the unfamiliar than with the familiar pattern (6.4%d(-1) vs. 3.7%d(-1)). Invertebrate PR was also significantly higher on the unfamiliar than on the familiar pattern in the native forest (5.9%d(-1) vs. 1.0%d(-1)), as well as vertebrate PR in orchards (4.8%d(-1) vs. 2.3%d(-1)) and low elevation maize fields (7.4%d(-1) vs. 2.2%d(-1)). Our results suggest the existence of biotic resistance even on a species-poor, remote island, and that a novel morphological phenotype in itself does not guarantee reduced predation pressure.

TI  - Evaluating quality of surface water resources by ANN and ANFIS networks using Sentinel-2 satellite data
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Using low-cost and fast technology with high accuracy to study the quality of surface water resources is one of the important goals in remote sensing studies. The main purpose of this research was to relate the Sentinel -2 A satellite images, 11 water quality parameters and a suitable model for the study area of Karun and Dez River. In this study, the Sentinel-2 satellite data were used to evaluate its capability for monitoring the quality of surface water. Also, the ground-based samples were collected from water quality sampling stations located on the Karun and Dez rivers at the same time as Sentinel-2 satellite images, and 11 water quality parameters of these samples were analyzed. After pre-processing of the used satellite images, the appropriate spectral bands and indicators were extracted by using sensitivity analysis. ANN and ANFIS neural networks were used to model the quality of water resources. In both models, remote sensing data were introduced as inputs and ground-based data as outputs. Accuracy of the modeling was estimated by calculation of the relative error and RMSE comparing the actual values and the values obtained from the modeling process. Finally, the zoning map of each water quality parameter for the Karun River was prepared using models with higher accuracy. The results of this research indicated a proper accuracy for estimating water quality parameters. According to numeral results, relative error of estimated parameters was varied from 0.049 for the concentration of Potassium (K) to with 0.152 for the concentration of Chlorine (Cl). On the other hand, ANN and ANFIS Model has shown different efficiencies regarding different parameters. The results of this study showed that ANN model performed modeling process with higher accuracy for Mg, HCO3, pH, EC, Turbidity, TDS and K parameters, and ANFIS model for Ca, Na, Cl, SO4 parameters. To be more precise, ANN model accounted for the highest modeling accuracy for K parameter and lowest accuracy for Ca. In contrast, ANFIS model formed the highest modeling accuracy for the SO4 and the lowest accuracy for the EC parameter. The results of this research indicated a capability of the remote sensing for monitoring quality of surface water resources.

TI  - Kidney VISTA prevents IFN-γ/IL-9 axis-mediated tubulointerstitial fibrosis after acute glomerular injury
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL INVESTIGATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Severe glomerular injury ultimately leads to tubulointerstitial fibrosis that determines patient outcome, but the immunological molecules connecting these processes remain undetermined. The present study addressed whether V-domain Ig suppressor of T cell activation (VISTA), constitutively expressed in kidney macrophages, plays a protective role in tubulointerstitial fibrotic transformation after acute antibody-mediated glomerulonephritis. After acute glomerular injury using nephrotoxic serum, tubules in the VISTA-deficient (Vsir(-/-)) kidney suffered more damage than those in WT kidneys. When interstitial immune cells were examined, the contact frequency of macrophages with infiltrated T cells increased and the immunometabolic features of T cells changed to showing high oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid metabolism and overproduction of IFN-gamma. The Vsir(-/-) parenchymal tissue cells responded to this altered milieu of interstitial immune cells as more IL-9 was produced, which augmented tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Blocking antibodies against IFN-gamma and IL-9 protected the above pathological process in VISTA-depleted conditions. In human samples with acute glomerular injury (e.g., antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody vasculitis), high VISTA expression in tubulointerstitial immune cells was associated with low tubulointerstitial fibrosis and good prognosis. Therefore, VISTA is a sentinel protein expressed in kidney macrophages that prevents tubulointerstitial fibrosis via the IFN-gamma/IL-9 axis after acute antibody-mediated glomerular injury.

TI  - Deriving hourly full-coverage PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations across China's Sichuan Basin by fusing multisource satellite retrievals: A machine-learning approach
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - High ambient concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) increase the hazardousness of air pollution. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieved by sun-synchronous or geostationary satellites is valuable for monitoring large-scale air quality. This study sought to combine the AOD of the Himawari-8 and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) to derive the spatiotemporal distributions of hourly PM2.5 concentrations at-1 km resolution for China's Sichuan Basin by using a machine-learning approach. Two random forest submodels were developed to fill the daytime gaps in these two AOD datasets, which were then used as predictors in another random-forest submodel predicting the hourly PM2.5 concentrations in daytime. One more random-forest sub model was developed to predict the hourly PM2.5 in nighttime based on the auxiliary variables excluding the AOD data. Leveraging the complementary information of Himawari-8 and VIIRS, this approach demonstrated heightened predictive performance, with cross-validation R-2 of 0.840 and RMSE of 15.9 mu g/m(3). The ability to predict nighttime PM2.5 (R-2 from 0.826 to 0.858) was comparable to daytime PM2.5 (R-2 from 0.831 to 0.853). In the Sichuan Basin, the sustained high concentrations of PM2.5 were mainly attributed to the stagnant meteorological conditions associated with the basin topography. Based on this full-coverage dataset, we acterized the spatiotemporal distributions of PM2.5 across the basin while demonstrating the regional patterns and the "weekend effect " for a central urban area. Provisioning comprehensive datasets of hourly as demonstrated in this study is essential for air quality management and environmental epidemiological analyses.

TI  - Improving generalisation capability of artificial intelligence-based solar radiation estimator models using a bio-inspired optimisation algorithm and multi-model approach
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - One way of reducing environmental pollution is to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels by replacing them with solar radiation (Rs), which is one of the main sources of clean and renewable energy. In this study, daily Rs values at seven meteorological stations in Iran (Ahvaz, Isfahan, Kermanshah, Mashhad, Bandar Abbas, Kerman and Tabriz) over 2010-2019 were estimated using empirical models, support vector machine (SVM), SVM coupled with cuckoo search algorithm (SVM-CSA) and multi-model approach in the form of two structures. In structure 1, data from each station were divided into training and testing sets. In structure 2, data from the former four stations were used for model training, and those from the latter three stations were used to test the models. The results showed that using meteorological parameters improved estimation accuracy compared with the use of geographical parameters for both SVM and SVM-CSA models. Coupling the CSA to SVM did improve the accuracy of radiation estimates, reducing RMSE by up to 38% (Kermanshah station) and 36% (Tabriz station) for the first structure and about 42.4% (Tabriz station) for the second. Performance analysis of the models over three intervals including, the first, middle and last third of measured radiation values at each station showed that for both structures (except at Tabriz station), the best model performance in under- and over-estimation sets of radiation values was obtained, respectively, in the first third interval (first structure, Mashhad station, RMSE = 28.39 J.cm(-2).day(-1)) and the last third interval (first structure, Bandar Abbas station, RMSE = 12.23 J.cm(-2).day(-1)). Determining the effects of climate change on Rs estimation and using remotely sensed data as inputs of the models could be considered as future works.

TI  - Assessment of forest cover changes using multi-temporal Landsat observation
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the changes in forest cover has become an important tool for forest management due to its impact on climate change, desertification, soil erosion, and flooding. The Zagros Mountains forest-steppe is a temperate broadleaf and mixed forest ecoregion in Western Asia, and the present study analyzes the changes in Zagros forests from 1986 to 2019 using remote sensing techniques. Three Landsat images, acquired in 1986, 2002, and 2019, were used to map land cover classification in the study area. Classification kappa coefficients were 85.2, 94.1, and 94.7 for three images, respectively. Focusing on the class level, the results show that between 1986 and 2002, the primary cause of forest loss in the study area was the conversion of 7.8 thousand ha of oak forests to agricultural land. Since 2002, 0.8 thousand ha of oak forest cover have been changed to barrenlands. The decrease of Zagros forests is a main threat to the rich biodiversity found in the West of Iran. To avoid worsening soil erosion, restoration programs should prioritize planting patterns on rainfall and hill slopes, texturally dissimilar soils, and regeneration in forest gaps, particularly at high elevations and steep slopes. It is recommended that future research should use higher resolution datasets and encompass more expansive landscape units, such as the whole Zagros Mountain forests.

TI  - Simultaneous retrieval of selected optical water quality indicators from Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, and Sentinel-3
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Constructing multi-source satellite-derived water quality (WQ) products in inland and nearshore coastal waters from the past, present, and future missions is a long-standing challenge. Despite inherent differences in sensors' spectral capability, spatial sampling, and radiometric performance, research efforts focused on formulating, implementing, and validating universal WQ algorithms continue to evolve. This research extends a recently developed machine-learning (ML) model, i.e., Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) (Pahlevan et al., 2020; Smith et al., 2021), to the inverse problem of simultaneously retrieving WQ indicators, including chlorophyll-a (Chla), Total Suspended Solids (TSS), and the absorption by Colored Dissolved Organic Matter at 440 nm (acdom(440)), across a wide array of aquatic ecosystems. We use a database of in situ measurements to train and optimize MDN models developed for the relevant spectral measurements (400-800 nm) of the Operational Land Imager (OLI), MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI), and Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) aboard the Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, and Sentinel-3 missions, respectively. Our two performance assessment approaches, namely hold-out and leaveone-out, suggest significant, albeit varying degrees of improvements with respect to second-best algorithms, depending on the sensor and WQ indicator (e.g., 68%, 75%, 117% improvements based on the hold-out method for Chla, TSS, and acdom(440), respectively from MSI-like spectra). Using these two assessment methods, we provide theoretical upper and lower bounds on model performance when evaluating similar and/or out-ofsample datasets. To evaluate multi-mission product consistency across broad spatial scales, map products are demonstrated for three near-concurrent OLI, MSI, and OLCI acquisitions. Overall, estimated TSS and acdom(440) from these three missions are consistent within the uncertainty of the model, but Chla maps from MSI and OLCI achieve greater accuracy than those from OLI. By applying two different atmospheric correction processors to OLI and MSI images, we also conduct matchup analyses to quantify the sensitivity of the MDN model and best -practice algorithms to uncertainties in reflectance products. Our model is less or equally sensitive to these un-certainties compared to other algorithms. Recognizing their uncertainties, MDN models can be applied as a global algorithm to enable harmonized retrievals of Chla, TSS, and acdom(440) in various aquatic ecosystems from multi-source satellite imagery. Local and/or regional ML models tuned with an apt data distribution (e.g., a subset of our dataset) should nevertheless be expected to outperform our global model.

TI  - Methane emissions only negligibly reduce the ecosystem service value of wetlands and rice paddies in the mature Ganges Delta
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland provides a wide range of ecosystem services with immense value. However, methane (CH4) emissions adversely affect ecosystem services, and it requires fixation cost. The objective of the present study was to estimate CH4 emissions and ecosystem services value (ESV) and how much the fixation cost of CH4 reduces the ESV. Since rice cultivation is a very common practice here, the paddy fields were also incorporated in this study. CH4 flux and satellite data were employed for estimating the emissions with the help of two-factor (temperature and water availability) model. Global coefficients of ecosystem service value (ESV) that is defined as the monetary valuation of materialistic and non-materialistic services were adapted for estimating the ecosystem service of the CH4 emitting sources. Results show that during the boro season (pre-monsoon summer paddy cultivation season), average monthly emissions of paddy fields are equal to the wetlands which are 0.16 t/km(2). During amon season (monsoon paddy cultivation season), this emissions is 0.7 t/km(2) and 0.53 t/km(2), respectively, from wetlands and paddy fields. Both wetlands and paddy fields emit a greater amount of CH4 during amon season than boro season. Behind this seasonal variation, water availability in terms of precipitation-evaporation ratio plays a more vital role than temperature. Total estimated ESV is 928.51 million US$, and CH4 fixation cost is 6.64 million US$ which is only 0.71% to total ESV. So, considering such huge net ESV, emphasis on wetland conservation and restoration are necessary.

TI  - Global Assimilation of Remotely Sensed Leaf Area Index: The Impact of Updating More State Variables Within a Land Surface Model
T2  - FRONTIERS IN WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - As vegetation regulates water, carbon, and energy cycles from the local to the global scale, its accurate representation in land surface models is crucial. The assimilation of satellite-based vegetation observations in a land surface model has the potential to improve the estimation of global carbon and energy cycles, which in turn can enhance our ability to monitor and forecast extreme hydroclimatic events, ecosystem dynamics, and crop production. This work proposes the assimilation of a remotely sensed vegetation product (Leaf Area Index, LAI) within the Noah Multi-Parameterization land surface model using an Ensemble Kalman Filter technique. The impact of updating leaf mass along with LAI is also investigated. Results show that assimilating LAI data improves the estimation of transpiration and net ecosystem exchange, which is further enhanced by also updating the leaf mass. Specifically, transpiration anomaly correlation coefficients improve in about 77 and 66% of the global land area thanks to the assimilation of leaf area index with and without updating leaf mass, respectively. Random errors in transpiration are also reduced, with an improvement of the unbiased root mean square error in 70% (74%) of the total area without the update of leaf mass (with the update of leaf mass). Similarly, net ecosystem exchange anomaly correlation coefficients improve from 52 to 75% and random errors improve from 49 to 62% of the total pixels after the update of leaf mass. Better performances for both transpiration and net ecosystem exchange are observed across croplands, but the largest improvement is shown over forests and woodland. The global scope of this work makes it particularly important in data poor regions (e.g., Africa, South Asia), where ground observations are sparse or not available altogether but where an accurate estimation of carbon and energy variables can be critical to improve ecosystem and crop management.

TI  - FAIR1M: A benchmark dataset for fine-grained object recognition in high-resolution remote sensing imagery
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - With the rapid development of deep learning, many deep learning-based approaches have made great achievements in object detection tasks. It is generally known that deep learning is a data-driven approach. Data directly impact the performance of object detectors to some extent. Although existing datasets include common objects in remote sensing images, they still have some scale, category, and image limitations. Therefore, there is a strong requirement for establishing a large-scale object detection benchmark for high-resolution remote sensing images. In this paper, we propose a novel benchmark dataset with more than 1 million instances and more than 40,000 images for Fine-grAined object recognItion in high-Resolution remote sensing imagery which is named as FAIR1M. We collected remote sensing images with a resolution of 0.3 m to 0.8 m from different platforms, which are spread across many countries and regions. All objects in the FAIR1M dataset are annotated with respect to 5 categories and 37 subcategories by oriented bounding boxes. Compared with existing detection datasets that are dedicated to object detection, the FAIR1M dataset has 4 particular characteristics: (1) it is much larger than other existing object detection datasets both in terms of the number of instances and the number of images, (2) it provides richer fine-grained category information for objects in remote sensing images, (3) it contains geographic information such as latitude, longitude and resolution attributes, and (4) it provides better image quality due to the use of a careful data cleaning procedure. Based on the FAIR1M dataset, we propose three fine-grained object detection and recognition tasks. Moreover, we evaluate several state-of-the-art approaches to establish baselines for future research. Experimental results indicate that the FAIR1M dataset effectively represents real remote sensing applications and is quite challenging for existing methods. Considering the fine-grained characteristics, we improve the evaluation metric and introduce the idea of hierarchy detection into the algorithms. We believe that the FAIR1M dataset will contribute to the earth observation community via fine-grained object detection in large-scale real-world scenes. FAIR1M Website: http://gaofen-challenge.com/.

TI  - Estimation of crop residue cover in rice paddies by a dynamic-quadripartite pixel model based on Sentinel-2A data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop residues left on the field after harvest increase soil organic matter content and improve soil quality. Linear spectral mixture analysis (LSMA) is an important technique for calculating crop residue cover. Traditionally, farmland has been considered to be composed solely of soil and crop residue endmembers. But rice paddy fields are often more complex than other fields. In the decomposition of pixels reflectance, leaving out potential endmembers greatly increases the variability of existing endmember reflectance. The error is then transferred to the rice residue endmember. In this paper, a dynamic-quadripartite pixel model (DQPM) is proposed to adapt LSMA to calculate rice residue cover (RRC) in complex paddy fields. This method considers that pixels in paddy fields are composed of four endmembers: soil, rice residues, green moss and white moss. With the approach, soil moisture can be calculated to automatically correct the reflectance of the soil endmembers of each pixel. The calculation results of our model were verified with field data and compared with those from the static-quadripartite pixel model (SQPM) without considering soil moisture (SM) content and with the dynamic-dimidiate pixel model (DDPM). Results confirm the feasibility of DQPM. The results show that with four end-members, RRC has a large range of improved computational accuracy with DQPM compared with SQPM and DDPM. DDPM has a large error under 1% < SM < 3% (gravimetric water content) and 60% < RRC < 70%. Only when SM is near 0.3, SQPM can achieve good accuracy. Among the three models, DQPM has the best robustness under different soil moisture and RRC scenarios. Therefore, our proposed method is useful for calculating RRC in complex paddy field scenarios.

TI  - Percutaneous extraction of a large device-related thrombus on a Watchman™ device: a case report
T2  - EUROPEAN HEART JOURNAL-CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Left atrial appendage occlusion devices are commonly used to prevent stroke in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation who are unable to tolerate anticoagulation. However, certain patient- and device-related characteristics increase the risk for the development of a device-related thrombus (DRT). The presence of a DRT increases the risk of stroke and should be treated. Management of DRT lacks consensus but is mostly focused on anticoagulation. In patients with large thrombi that need to be managed urgently, percutaneous extraction may be a viable option.Case summary In this report, we describe the successful management of a DRT via percutaneous thrombus extraction technology in an 81-year-old woman with a large thrombus attached to a WATCHMAN (TM) device. The patient initially presented with shortness of breath, and on imaging a pedunculated thrombus was detected. The thrombus was extracted using a Penumbra Lightning 12 (TM) (Penumbra Inc., Alameda, CA, USA) catheter with a Sentinel (TM) ( Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA, USA) cerebral embolic protection device. The patient had no neurologic sequelae and was started on anticoagulation.Discussion Percutaneous thrombectomy can be safely performed to extract large left atrial occlusion DRT that require urgent management, without any neurologic sequelae. We believe this can be used in patients with a large DRT who would not be adequately managed with anticoagulation and in whom surgery is not feasible.

TI  - Analysis of the MODIS above-cloud aerosol retrieval algorithm using MCARS
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Multi-sensor Cloud and Aerosol Retrieval Simulator (MCARS) presently produces synthetic radiance data from Goddard Earth Observing System version 5 (GEOS-5) model output as if the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were viewing a combination of atmospheric column inclusive of clouds, aerosols, and a variety of gases and land-ocean surface at a specific location. In this paper we use MCARS to study the MODIS Above-Cloud AEROsol retrieval algorithm (MOD06ACAERO). MOD06ACAERO is presently a regional research algorithm able to retrieve aerosol optical thickness over clouds, in particular absorbing biomass-burning aerosols overlying marine boundary layer clouds in the southeastern Atlantic Ocean. The algorithm's ability to provide aerosol information in cloudy conditions makes it a valuable source of information for modeling and climate studies in an area where current clear-sky-only operational MODIS aerosol retrievals effectively have a data gap between the months of June and October. We use MCARS for a verification and closure study of the MOD06ACAERO algorithm. The purpose of this study is to develop a set of constraints a model developer might use during assimilation of MOD06ACAERO data.Our simulations indicate that the MOD06ACAERO algorithm performs well for marine boundary layer clouds in the SE Atlantic provided some specific screening rules are observed. For the present study, a combination of five simulated MODIS data granules were used for a dataset of 13.5 million samples with known input conditions. When pixel retrieval uncertainty was less than 30 %, optical thickness of the underlying cloud layer was greater than 4, and scattering angle range within the cloud bow was excluded, MOD06ACAERO retrievals agreed with the underlying ground truth (GEOS-5 cloud and aerosol profiles used to generate the synthetic radiances) with a slope of 0.913, offset of 0.06, and RMSE = 0.107. When only near-nadir pixels were considered (view zenith angle within +/- 20 degrees) the agreement with source data further improved (0.977, 0.051, and 0.096 respectively). Algorithm closure was examined using a single case out of the five used for verification. For closure, the MOD06ACAERO code was modified to use GEOS-5 temperature and moisture profiles as an ancillary. Agreement of MOD06ACAERO retrievals with source data for the closure study had a slope of 0.996 with an offset of -0.007 and RMSE of 0.097 at a pixel uncertainty level of less than 40 %, illustrating the benefits of high-quality ancillary atmospheric data for such retrievals.

TI  - Characteristics of landslides triggered by the 2013 <i>M</i><sub>L</sub>6.5 Nantou, Taiwan, earthquake
T2  - EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Earthquake-triggered landslides are common disasters of active mountain belts. Due to the lack of earthquake triggered landslide inventory in Taiwan, it is not intuitive to observe spatial relationships and discover unique patterns between landslides and essential triggers. We examined strong earthquake events in Taiwan after the 1999 M(W)7.6 Chi-Chi earthquake and targeted the 2013 M(L)6.5 Nantou earthquake to create the landslide inventory. We adopted two Landsat-8 satellite images before and after the event to detect landslides, and incorporated a 20-m DEM and rock type data of Taiwan to represent key factors triggering earthquake-induced landslides such as peak ground acceleration (PGA), lithology, slope roughness, slope, and aspect. Based on the analysis of the density of landslides, there are strong correlations between the landslide occurrence and seismic and geomorphic factors. Furthermore, we noticed that the landslide aspects have a systematic tendency towards the northeast, which is not correlated with the dip directions and wave propagation directions. Instead, we found that the northeastward landslide aspect is more associated with the westward-southwestward surface movement at the landslides. We found that the included angles between the landslide aspects and the displacement directions for all the landslides are similar to 100 degrees-180 degrees. The relationship indicated that the coseismic deformation of the Nantou earthquake may play a role in the landslide distribution.

TI  - Delicate crystallinity control enables high-efficiency P3HT organic photovoltaic cells
T2  - JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
M3  - Article
AB  - As a benchmark semiconducting polymer, poly(3-hexyl-thiophene) (P3HT) has been broadly used to construct a wide range of organic electronic devices such as photovoltaic cells, photodetectors, thermoelectrics, and transistors. In the last two decades, numerous studies have concentrated on modulating the morphology and performance of organic solar cells based on P3HT and fullerene derivatives. In comparison with P3HT:fullerene systems, the blends of P3HT with emerging nonfullerene acceptors remain significantly less explored and the structure-performance relationships are not well established. In this work, time-dependent grazing incidence X-ray scattering and real-space microscopy experiments were carried out to monitor the microstructure change of the high-efficiency blend of P3HT and a Y6-type nonfullerene acceptor (i.e., ZY-4Cl) over the duration of thermal annealing. By precisely manipulating the crystalline order of both the donor and acceptor, we found that simply shortening the annealing time can cause a remarkable 19-fold increase in the solar cell efficiency. We observed profound changes in all the photovoltaic parameters (open-circuit voltage, current density, fill factor, and power conversion efficiency) within the first 1 minute, while a slight variation emerged in the later stage. Attractively, the P3HT:ZY-4Cl blend film subject to thermal annealing for merely 30 seconds gave rise to a remarkable power conversion efficiency of similar to 10.7%, which is the best efficiency of P3HT-based organic photovoltaic cells at present. The research shed light on the morphological optimization and cost-effective processing of polythiophene:nonfullerene blends for optoelectronic applications.

TI  - Urban growth and its impact on land surface temperature in an industrial city in Aceh, Indonesia
T2  - LETTERS IN SPATIAL AND RESOURCE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article describes the pattern of changes in land use and land cover (LUC) and changes in land surface temperature (LST) in Lhokseumawe, an industrial city in Indonesia. Besides being a center of national activity in the industrial domain, this city was also named a special economic zone (SEZ). LUC is classified from satellite imagery from Landsat 5 (1998 and 2009) and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS (2018), with six LUC categories: built-up area, vegetation, agriculture, bareland, wetland, and waterbody. There are three LUC maps produced. LSTs were also identified using the same imagery, resulting in 1998, 2009 and 2018 LST maps. The classification results show that the built-up area increased significantly. Monte Carlo Simulation was carried out to investigate the relationship between LUC and LST changes. From 1998 to 2009, the built-up area increased from 2025 ha to 3060.85 ha, while from 2009 to 2018, it increased from 3060.85 to 3783.63 ha. The LST in 1998 ranged from 23.28 to 33.21 degrees C, in 2009 from 23.28 to 35.48 degrees C, while in 2018 it ranged between 28.51 and 35.05 degrees C. The authors recommend that the LST variables be taken into account in sustainable urban planning. Policy makers and planners need to consider the importance of mitigating urban heat island (UHI), by suggesting a clustered greening concept at the urban and green material level in buildings and their environment.

TI  - Assessing volumetric change distributions and scaling relations of retrogressive thaw slumps across the Arctic
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Arctic ice-rich permafrost is becoming increasingly vulnerable to terrain-altering thermokarst, and among the most rapid and dramatic of these changes are retrogressive thaw slumps (RTSs). They initiate when ice-rich soils are exposed and thaw, leading to the formation of a steep headwall which retreats during the summer months. The impacts and the distribution and scaling laws governing RTS changes within and between regions are unknown. Using TanDEM-X-derived digital elevation models, we estimated RTS volume and area changes over a 5-year time period from winter 2011/12 to winter 2016/17 and used for the first time probability density functions to describe their distributions. We found that over this time period all 1853 RTSs mobilized a combined volume of 17 x 10(6) m(3) yr(-1), corresponding to a volumetric change density of 77 m(3) yr(-1) km(-2). Our remote sensing data reveal inter-regional differences in mobilized volumes, scaling laws, and terrain controls. The distributions of RTS area and volumetric change rates follow an inverse gamma function with a distinct peak and an exponential decrease for the largest RTSs. We found that the distributions in the high Arctic are shifted towards larger values than at other study sites We observed that the area-to-volume scaling was well described by a power law with an exponent of 1.15 across all study sites; however the individual sites had scaling exponents ranging from 1.05 to 1.37, indicating that regional characteristics need to be taken into account when estimating RTS volumetric changes from area changes. Among the terrain controls on RTS distributions that we examined, which included slope, adjacency to waterbodies, and aspect, the latter showed the greatest but regionally variable association with RTS occurrence. Accounting for the observed regional differences in volumetric change distributions, scaling relations, and terrain controls may enhance the modelling and monitoring of Arctic carbon, nutrient, and sediment cycles.

TI  - Refining slip distribution in moderate earthquakes using Sentinel-1 burst overlap interferometry: a case study over 2020 May 15 <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> 6.5 Monte Cristo Range Earthquake
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Azimuth and range measurements from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images are commonly used to depict the coseismic deformation of large earthquakes. Azimuth measurements associated with moderate-sized earthquakes are hardly applicable due to their limited accuracy. In this paper, we first explored the capability of Sentinel-1 azimuth measurements to map the coseismic deformation of a moderate earthquake. We used both range and azimuth offset measurements to map the coseismic deformation of the 2020 M-w 6.5 Monte Cristo Range earthquake in Nevada. Optimal dip angles of the two main faults and the slip model were obtained. By adding azimuth displacements as constraints, the inverted slip model reveals shallower and more refined slip than models only constrained by InSAR and GPS data, highlighting the importance of introducing the azimuth measurements to the moderate earthquake. The preferred fault model shows a mixture of left-lateral and normal faulting on the western segment and a left-lateral slip on the eastern segment. We found that the inferred faults might verify the clockwise rotation block model, which has been proposed to accommodate fault slip across the Mina deflection. Moreover, a shallow alluvial basin and the young left-lateral fault within the left bend can potentially be responsible for the orientation and normal slip components in the western fault segment, respectively.

TI  - Assessing agricultural and hydrological drought vulnerability in a savanna ecological zone of Sub-Saharan Africa
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite measures to mitigate drought, study on the extent of agricultural and hydrological drought vulnerability is still neglected in the savanna ecological zone of Nigeria. This study assessed agricultural and hydrological drought vulnerability in Kaduna River Basin (KRB). To achieve this, monthly rainfall, temperature, and soil moisture data were downloaded from the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data (CHIRPS) and ERA5 Copernicus data archive. Streamflow data were obtained from ten hydrometeorological stations (1990-2018) while Landsat imageries 4, 5, 7, and 8 of 30 m resolutions were used to generate vegetation condition index (VCI), modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI), and landuse/landcover (LULC). The two drought types were assessed for 1990, 1997, 2004, 2011, and 2018. The result of high and moderate severity of VCI revealed upward trends of r(2) = 0.3026 and r(2) = 0.3779, respectively. Analysis showed that within ranges of 50 to 80% and 58 to 82% of the basin area were, respectively, mapped as moderate agricultural and hydrological drought hazards zones. The study reveals that most parts of the basin are moderately vulnerable to both agricultural and hydrological drought events at 62.15 and 72.44%, respectively, while high agricultural and hydrological drought vulnerability areas accounted for 18.29 and 17.42%, respectively.

TI  - Landsat historical records reveal large-scale dynamics and enduring recovery of seagrasses in an impacted seascape
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Seagrasses are considered indicators of anthropogenic impact but surprisingly little is known about their temporal and spatial dynamics in impacted seascapes. In this study, we used three decades of Landsat imagery (1988-2018) off the coast of Adelaide, South Australia, to investigate how seagrass cover over 501 km2 responds to changes in land-based inputs, including breakpoints in system trajectory and associated timelags, and the identification of vulnerable meadows. Field data was used to help train benthic classification of summer imagery and define its accuracy. Temporal dynamics of seagrass cover were investigated in relation to annual and multi-year nitrogen and suspended solids loads. Spatial dynamics were inferred from maps of benthic cover persistence and trajectory for each decade. The region experienced a net regrowth of some 11,000 ha of seagrasses since the early 2000s, with the initial large-scale recruitment visible in the imagery 6 years after the closure of sludge outfalls. Seagrass expansion occurred primarily in deeper waters (>10 m) of the central coast and at the seaward edge of the distribution. Recovery continued until 2011 assisted by a window of opportunity created by a decade-long drought and further reductions in nitrogen loads from wastewater treatment plants and industry. Localized seagrass losses however continued to be observed as a result of either permanent or transient increases in suspended solids loads. Seagrass area in the central coast was well correlated (r2 = 0.88) with 5-year running averages of nitrogen and suspended solids loads. Meadows particularly vulnerable to changes in land-based discharges were located at the edges of the distribution, along erosional scarps and at depths >10 m south of the Torrens River. These areas were identified as useful indicators of seagrass status. Overall, seagrass persistence expanded from 48 to 69% of the mapped area, with the region now mostly covered by stable seagrasses.

AB  - Due to the combined effects of global warming and human activities, the ecological environment of the Yellow River source area has undergone profound changes and desertification has become increasingly prominent. In this study, an optimal desertification monitoring index based on feature space was proposed for the Yellow River source area, and constructed using Landsat images. Then, the spatial and temporal variation of desertification in the Yellow River source area and its driving mechanism were studied using Geodetector. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) The newly proposed feature space-based desertification monitoring index has good applicability in the study area. The best inversion accuracy of the point-to-point Albedo-NDVI feature space model was 88.4%. (2) Desertification in the eastern and southern regions of the Yellow River source area has a tendency to increase, while the desertification situation in the central region is relatively stable. (3) From 1995 to 2015, there was a significant improvement in desertification in the study area, as evidenced by a decrease in desertification intensity. (4) As the intensity of human disturbance increases, the influence of natural factors on desertification gradually diminishes. The interaction of natural and anthropogenic factors has greater explanatory power for desertification than that of individual natural or anthropogenic factors. The research results can be used as a reference for decision-making on desertification control in the Three-River Source Region.

TI  - Use of Hyper-Spectral Visible and Near-Infrared Satellite Data for Timely Estimates of the Earth's Surface Reflectance in Cloudy and Aerosol Loaded Conditions: Part 1-Application to RGB Image Restoration Over Land With GOME-2
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Space-based quantitative passive optical remote sensing of the Earth's surface typically involves the detection and elimination of cloud-contaminated pixels as an initial processing step. We explore a fundamentally different approach; we use machine learning with cloud contaminated satellite hyper-spectral data to estimate underlying terrestrial surface reflectances at red, green, and blue (RGB) wavelengths. An artificial neural network (NN) reproduces land RGB reflectances with high fidelity, even in scenes with moderate to high cloud optical thicknesses. This implies that spectral features of the Earth's surface can be detected and distinguished in the presence of clouds, even when they are partially and visibly obscured by clouds; the NN is able to separate the spectral fingerprint of the Earth's surface from that of the clouds, aerosols, gaseous absorption, and Rayleigh scattering, provided that there are adequately different spectral features and that the clouds are not completely opaque. Once trained, the NN enables rapid estimates of RGB reflectances with little computational cost. Aside from the training data, there is no requirement of prior information regarding the land surface spectral reflectance, nor is there need for radiative transfer calculations. We test different wavelength windows and instrument configurations for reconstruction of surface reflectances. This work provides an initial example of a general approach that has many potential applications in land and ocean remote sensing as well as other practical uses such as in search and rescue, precision agriculture, and change detection.

TI  - Validation of diagnosis codes to identify hospitalized COVID-19 patients in health care claims data
T2  - PHARMACOEPIDEMIOLOGY AND DRUG SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Health plan claims may provide complete longitudinal data for timely, real-world population-level COVID-19 assessment. However, these data often lack laboratory results, the standard for COVID-19 diagnosis. Methods We assessed the validity of ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes for identifying patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in U.S. claims databases, compared to linked laboratory results, among six Food and Drug Administration Sentinel System data partners (two large national insurers, four integrated delivery systems) from February 20-October 17, 2020. We identified patients hospitalized with COVID-19 according to five ICD-10-CM diagnosis code-based algorithms, which included combinations of codes U07.1, B97.29, general coronavirus codes, and diagnosis codes for severe symptoms. We calculated the positive predictive value (PPV) and sensitivity of each algorithm relative to laboratory test results. We stratified results by data source type and across three time periods: February 20-March 31 (Time A), April 1-30 (Time B), May 1-October 17 (Time C). Results The five algorithms identified between 34 806 and 47 293 patients across the study periods; 23% with known laboratory results contributed to PPV calculations. PPVs were high and similar across algorithms. PPV of U07.1 alone was stable around 93% for integrated delivery systems, but declined over time from 93% to 70% among national insurers. Overall PPV of U07.1 across all data partners was 94.1% (95% CI, 92.3%-95.5%) in Time A and 81.2% (95% CI, 80.1%-82.2%) in Time C. Sensitivity was consistent across algorithms and over time, at 94.9% (95% CI, 94.2%-95.5%). Conclusion Our results support the use of code U07.1 to identify hospitalized COVID-19 patients in U.S. claims data.

TI  - Phantom study of SPECT/CT augmented reality for intraoperative localization of sentinel lymph nodes in head and neck melanoma
T2  - ORAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To show that augmented reality (AR) visualization of single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/computed tomography (CT) data in 3D can be used to accurately localize targets in the head and neck region.Materials and methods: Eight head and neck styrofoam phantoms were painted with a mixture of radioactive solution (Tc-99m) detectable with a handheld gamma probe and fluorescent ink visible only under ultraviolet (UV) light to create 10-20 simulated lymph nodes on their surface. After obtaining SPECT/CT images of these phantoms, virtual renderings of the nodes were generated from the SPECT/CT data and displayed using a commercially available AR headset. For each of three physician evaluators, the time required to localize lymph node targets was recorded (1) using the gamma probe alone and (2) using the gamma probe while wearing the AR headset. In addition, the surface localization accuracy when using the AR headset was evaluated by measuring the misalignment between the locations visually marked by the evaluators and the ground truth locations identified using UV stimulation of the ink at the site of the nodes.Results: For all three evaluators, using the AR headset significantly reduced the time to detect targets (P = 0.012, respectively) compared to using the gamma probe alone. The average misalignment between the location marked by the evaluators and the ground truth location was 8.6 mm.Conclusion: AR visualization of SPECT/CT data in 3D allows for accurate localization of targets in the head and neck region, and may reduce the localization time of targets.

TI  - Single center experiences in merkel cell carcinoma and unprecedented presentation
T2  - ANNALS OF CLINICAL AND ANALYTICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare skin tumor with an aggressive course. If there is no distant metastasis in its treatment, excision with negative surgical margins is the primary method. Since it is usually detected in incidental postoperative pathology reports, negative surgical margins must be observed during the removal of lesions on the skin.Material and Methods: In our study, we analyzed eleven patients diagnosed with MCC in our hospital between January 2010 and January 2020. Patients with perineural or vascular invasion, borderline microscopic positive findings, residual disease, and/or regional lymph node involvement among patients with tumors larger than 1.5 cm in pathology reports were referred to adjuvant treatment.Results: The tumors were most frequently located in the thigh (25%), head-neck (25%), forearm (16.6%). inguinal (16.6%), and gluteal region (16.6%), respectively. The patients were followed up for an average of 38 months postoperatively (11-62 months). Complete cure was achieved in five (45.4%) of the cases. The average survival duration was 36 months (11-62 months). Recurrence was observed in two of our cases. Despite metastases occurring at different times in different abdominal organs abdomen, the surveillance was longer than expected, with an excellent response to multidisciplinary treatments.Discussion: The features of the lesion should be carefully examined in the preoperative period. If in doubt, a sentinel biopsy should be performed during surgery by performing systemic screening. A multidisciplinary approach should be preferred in metastatic lesions. If intra-abdominal metastases are resectable, surgical treatment may prolong the surveillance.

TI  - Relationships between religious-spiritual and professional-ethical beliefs of schoolteachers
T2  - ZEITSCHRIFT FUR ERZIEHUNGSWISSENSCHAFT
M3  - Article
AB  - The question of whether personal religious or worldview beliefs of teachers (should) influence their professional thinking and acting has repeatedly been the subject of public controversies. In view of an unsatisfactory state of research on this question, especially in the European context, a project funded by the German Research Association (DFG) investigated correlations between the religiosity or spirituality and professional ethical beliefs of N = 1441 teachers at German schools. Contrary to our preregistered hypotheses, neither religious beliefs nor religious tolerance showed significant variance explanations for aspects of professional ethics in the structural equation models. The spiritual beliefs controlling for religious tolerance explained more variance in all four professional ethics criteria than did the religious beliefs, with the spiritual dimension of "connectedness with others" being particularly salient here. Apparently, it is not so much the religious or transcendent-spiritual beliefs of the teachers that have an effect on their professional ethical beliefs, but rather a general altruistic attitude.

TI  - Morphology impact of the dike of the autonomous port of Kribi on the Cameroonian coast
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents an assessment of the impact of the Kribi autonomous port dike (Cameroon) on the morphological evolution of the coastaline. The methodological approach consisted in the diachronic analysis of shorelines positions extracted from Landsat 7/8 satellite image archives acquired between November 2003 and May 2020, i.e. a total of 8 images acquired before and after the construction of the dike. In addition, GPS surveys were conducted in the study area to recalibrate the satellite images. Atmospheric, radiometric and geometric corrections were performed on these images using ENVI 5.2 software. DSAS (digital Shoreline Analysis system) version 5.2, an extension of ESRI ArcGIS software, was used to digitize the shoreline and calculate their rate of change. The results obtained show that before the establishment of the port (2003-2012) we observe overall on 9.5 km of portion of the shorelines studied a stability on 64.39% of the coast; 24.14% is in accretion followed by some notches of erosion observed on 11.47% of the coast. The average speed of overall change of the shorelines is +0.34 +/- 0.24 m/year. After the implementation of the port (2014-2020), accretion is observed on 26.42% of the shoreline located upstream of the transit and a permanent erosive trend downstream of the structure (dike) and located on 29.97% of the shoreline. The overall average speed of change of the shoreline is -1.90 +/- 0.12 m/year. A prediction of the shorelines by the Kalman filter method estimates a maximum accretion of 20.4 m in upstream transit and a maximum retreat in downstream transit of 13.7 m in 2040, which could endanger the fishing camps of the village Nlende during episodes of high tides and cause the loss of habitats (residential areas and nesting beaches of marine turtles).

TI  - Terrestrial ecosystem response to flash droughts over India
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid onset droughts, termed as "flash droughts", cause short-term but serious threats to terrestrial ecosystems and influence carbon dynamics due to insufficient warning. To date, how the regional terrestrial carbon dynamics respond to flash droughts in India remains unknown. Since, India is highly dependent on its cropland and vegetation, identifying the influence of flash droughts on terrestrial ecosystem is important. Here we use MODIS remote sensing satellite sensor based gross primary productivity (GPP) and remote sensing-based soil moisture data to compute the response of ecosystems to flash droughts in India. From the investigation, it was observed that GPP responds to more than 95% of the flash droughts across India, with the highest response frequency occurring over Ganga basin and southern India while the lowest response across northeastern India. The discrepancies in the response frequencies are mainly attributed to different vegetation resilience conditions across different parts of the country. Moreover, the mean response time is about 10 to 19 days averaged over India, with the lowest and highest response time over Indus-Ganga basins and northeastern Indian river basins (including the Brahmaputra, Minor rivers draining into Myanmar basin (MRMB), and Barak basins), respectively. Severe reduction in water use efficiency (WUE) was observed for the Ganga river basin and some parts of southern India, which highlighted the non-resilient nature of ecosystem towards rapid soil moisture variations. The study facilitates the identification of flash drought hotspots in the country including the Indus basin, Southern river basins (Cauveri, EFRPCP, and EFRSCB basins), some parts of the Ganga basin, and the ability of an ecosystem to withstand such drastic conditions. These findings highlight the need to adopt essential drought mitigation measures to safeguard the sustainability of ecosystems.

TI  - Detecting fire disturbances in forests by using GNSS reflectometry and machine learning: A case study in Angola
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper aims at exploiting the potential of Global Navigation Satellite System Reflectometry (GNSS-R) for the detection of forest disturbances due to fires. The study focuses on the forested part of Angola that was largely affected by fires during summer 2019. The data collected in the area by the NASA Cyclone GNSS (CyGNSS) constellation have been downloaded and processed. As reference data for developing and testing the retrieval algorithms, the ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI) decadal burned areas maps have been considered. After evaluating the sensitivity of the GNSS-R observables, namely Signal to Noise Ratio and Equivalent Reflectivity, to the forest disturbances, some retrieval algorithms based on different machine learning techniques have been implemented, tested, and compared with a simple approach based on the temporal gradient of the GNSS-R observables. In details, classifiers based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests (RF) have been implemented for discriminating burned/not burned pixels of the images and regressors based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), RF and Support Vector Regressors (SVR) have been implemented for estimating the fraction of burned areas within a pixel. All these algorithms allowed a satisfactory identification of the burned areas with respect to the reference data, enabling the generation of maps every ten days. These results represent the first observations of forest disturbances due to fires using spaceborne GNSS-Reflectometry.

TI  - Calibration of a hydrologic model in data-scarce Alaska using satellite and other gridded products
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Study Region: Alaska and hydrologically connected portions of Canada Study Focus: Rugged terrain and harsh conditions make observational hydroclimatic data, espe-cially runoff data, extremely limited across most of Alaska. Consequently, many previous hy-drologic studies in Alaska have focused on smaller-domain trends, where pockets of hydroclimatic observations are clustered. Using a combination of reanalysis and remotely sensed gridded products, we develop a calibration framework for a monthly resolution water budget model, over the entire Alaskan domain, that does not rely on runoff. The domain is comprised of distributed model response units (MRUs), each representing a Hydrologic Unit Code 12 basin. We use a Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (FAST) to inform a two-step calibration process; first cali-brating to actual evapotranspiration and then to fractional snow-covered area (fSCA), resulting in a range of parameter solutions for each MRU. New Hydrological Insights for the Region: Using this framework, the model performs best in the moderate to dry Alaskan interior; in the absence of glaciation and where permafrost is generally not continuous. Modelled runoff for recent decades shows increased runoff trends at lower lati-tudes and slightly decreased runoff trends at higher latitudes within the Alaskan domain. These findings reveal that reliance upon non-runoff fluxes for model calibration is viable in this cold region and that better characterization of hydroclimatic data is necessary to improve confidence in cold region modeling studies.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of radical resection compared with non-radical resection for vaginal or cervical melanoma.Methods: We retrospectively analysed the clinical data of post-operative patients with primary lower genital tract melanoma hospitalised at Peking University Cancer Hospital between Jan 2014 and Dec 2020. The study endpoints were recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). Kaplan-Meier method-plotted survival curves and univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to identify the factors associated with RFS and OS, and to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and associated 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).Results: A total of 80 patients were included. Thirty-one patients had received non-radical resection, and 49 patients had received radical resection. The median patient age was 55.5 (IQR 45.3-60.0) years. Sixty-two (77.5%) patients had vaginal melanoma. Sixty-four patients (80.0%) had received post-operative adjuvant therapy. The median follow-up time was 36.0 months (95% CI 10.1-62.1 months). Sixty-four patients developed recurrence, and 44 patients died. The median RFS (mRFS) was 6.0 months (95% CI 3.4-8.6 m), and the RFS for the radical resection group was longer than that for the non-radical resection group (9.5 vs. 5.3 m), with no significant difference (P > 0.05). The median OS (mOS) was 25.9 months (95% CI 14.4-37.4 m). The mOS was 24.6 months (95% CI 10.3-38.9 m) and 25.9 months (95% CI 10.9-40.9 m) in the non-radical resection group and the radical resection group, respectively. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that surgical approach, infiltration depth of the tumour, lymph node metastasis, and post-operative adjuvant therapy were independent risk factors for RFS and that post-operative adjuvant therapy was an independent risk factor for OS.Conclusion: By performing multivariate analysis, which corrected for potential confounding factors, we identified surgical procedures that were associated with RFS, and we found that RFS and OS in patients with vaginal melanoma and cervical melanoma benefitted from post-operative adjuvant therapy.

T2  - LANCET REGIONAL HEALTH-WESTERN PACIFIC
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Acute meningitis or encephalitis (AME) results from a neurological infection causing high case fatality and severe sequelae. AME lacked comprehensive surveillance in China.Methods Nation-wide surveillance of all-age patients with AME syndromes was conducted in 144 sentinel hospitals of 29 provinces in China. Eleven AME-causative viral and bacterial pathogens were tested with multiple diagnostic methods.Findings Between 2009 and 2018, 20,454 AME patients were recruited for tests. Based on 9,079 patients with all-four-virus tested, 28.43% (95% CI: 27.50%-29.36%) of them had at least one virus-positive detection. Enterovirus was the most frequently determined virus in children <18 years, herpes simplex virus and Japanese encephalitis virus were the most frequently determined in 18-59 and >= 60 years age groups, respectively. Based on 6,802 patients with all-seven-bacteria tested, 4.43% (95% CI: 3.94%-4.91%) had at least one bacteria-positive detection, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis were the leading bacterium in children aged <5 years and 5-17 years, respectively. Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently detected in adults aged 18-59 and >= 60 years. The pathogen spectrum also differed statistically significantly between northern and southern China. Joinpoint analysis revealed age-specific positive rates, with enterovirus, herpes simplex virus and mumps virus peaking at 3-6 years old, while Japanese encephalitis virus peaked in the >= 60 years old. As age increased, the positive rate for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Escherichia coli statistically significantly decreased, while for Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus suis it increased.Interpretation The current findings allow enhanced identification of the predominant AME-related pathogen candidates for diagnosis in clinical practice and more targeted application of prevention and control measures in China, and a possible reassessment of vaccination strategy.

TI  - Increasing shrinkage risk of endorheic lakes in the middle of farming-pastoral ecotone of Northern China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes are an important water resource and provide a variety of important ecosystem services for humans. Effective monitoring of lake surface area (LSA) dynamics is critical for sustainable management of water re-sources, particularly in arid and semi-arid areas. The interannual and intraannual variations of lakes and their impact factors in the middle of the farming-pastoral ecotone of Northern China (M-FPENC) were analyzed. The results showed that a total of 1192 lakes have appeared during the last 20 years, with a total area of approxi-mately 1145.6 km(2), with most of them having seasonal and ephemeral water. The LSA in the M-FPENC decreased rapidly during 2000-2019. The annual maximum LSA and number of lakes greater than 1 km(2) decreased by 30.04% and 33.00%, respectively. At the intraannual scale, the LSA continued to shrink from April to July, with the lowest value observed in the middle of July, and then gradually recovered. It was found that interannual variations in the lake area mainly depended on the interannual fluctuation in precipitation. The shrinkage of lakes was mainly attributed to the significant increase of land surface evapotranspiration.

TI  - Classification of Zambian grasslands using random forest feature importance selection during the optimal phenological period
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - It is important to conduct grassland resource surveys for the scientific management of grassland resources. Currently, remote sensing technology is widely used to classify land cover. The fine classification datasets of grasslands with high spatial and temporal resolutions are very necessary for scientific research. In order to use remote sensing data conveniently, this study selected the Google Earth Engine platform to select 100-m resolution PROBA-V remote sensing images from 2018 of Zambia, in central Africa. The differences in the normalized vegetation index time-series curves of the different types of grasslands were combined, and June to October was identified as the best phenological classification period. Using the random forest feature importance selection algorithm, the original feature indices and identification of the different grass types were optimized. The results indicate that using the optimal feature combination selected by the random forest feature importance selection algorithm to refine the classification of grasslands improves computational efficiency with an overall accuracy of 83%, which is 3% higher than that of the original feature combination. Among the optimal feature combinations, elevation contributes the most to the improvement classification accuracy. The most significant improvement in the producer's accuracy was found for grassland (30% increase) and savanna (22% increase). Adjustment of the appropriate phenological periods according to the seasonal characteristics of different regions, the methodology established in this study can be easily applied to other areas for the fine classification of grasslands and the subsequent calculation of grassland biomass and carbon storage.

TI  - Endothelial ARHGEF26 is an angiogenic factor promoting VEGF signalling
T2  - CARDIOVASCULAR RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims Genetic studies have implicated the ARHGEF26 locus in the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the causal pathways by which DNA variants at the ARHGEF26 locus confer risk for CAD are incompletely understood. We sought to elucidate the mechanism responsible for the enhanced risk of CAD associated with the ARHGEF26 locus. Methods and results In a conditional analysis of the ARHGEF26 locus, we show that the sentinel CAD-risk signal is significantly associated with various non-lipid vascular phenotypes. In human endothelial cell (EC), ARHGEF26 promotes the angiogenic capacity, and interacts with known angiogenic factors and pathways. Quantitative mass spectrometry showed that one CAD-risk coding variant, rs12493885 (p.Val29Leu), resulted in a gain-of-function ARHGEF26 that enhances proangiogenic signalling and displays enhanced interactions with several proteins partially related to the angiogenic pathway. ARHGEF26 is required for endothelial angiogenesis by promoting macropinocytosis of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 2 (VEGFR2) on cell membrane and is crucial to Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF)-dependent murine vessel sprouting ex vivo. In vivo, global or tissue-specific deletion of ARHGEF26 in EC, but not in vascular smooth muscle cells, significantly reduced atherosclerosis in mice, with enhanced plaque stability. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that ARHGEF26 is involved in angiogenesis signaling, and that DNA variants within ARHGEF26 that are associated with CAD risk could affect angiogenic processes by potentiating VEGF-dependent angiogenesis.

TI  - Effectiveness of community forests for forest conservation in Nan province, Thailand
T2  - JOURNAL OF LAND USE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2019, government of Thailand recognized community-based forest management and gave rights to communities to manage their forests. We evaluated the effectiveness of long-established community managed forests in conserving tree cover in Nan province, Thailand. We mapped boundaries of all community managed forests patches to understand their spatial distribution and their overlap with national parks and national forests. We analysed Landsat images between 2000-2019 to map forest-cover changes. Using genetic matching, we compared the effectiveness of various management categories in conserving forests, controlling for covariates. We found that, despite high rates of deforestation in the province, community managed forests are well conserved. Moreover, forests patches in national parks and national forests are better conserved when they overlap with community managed forests. Community forests, as a bottom-up land use institution, are effective in forest conservation. They provide an extra layer of forest protection along with national forests and national parks.

TI  - Memories of the dictatorship resonate in the murgas of Montevideo and Rosario
T2  - JOURNAL OF IBERIAN AND LATIN AMERICAN RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Murgas are artistic groups of the South American carnival that present a critical and satirical worldview around the experience of the main themes, problems and social traumas in countries historically exposed to dictatorship. Their repertoires are fruitful spaces to rethink the construction of collective memories in relation to the Uruguayan (1973-85) and Argentine (1976-83) dictatorial past. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, the Uruguayan murga was revitalized with the impulse of the phenomenon of Murga Joven, which was appropriated as a carnival genre in many Argentine cities such as Rosario. The article then compares the first repertoires of the young murgas of Montevideo (La Mojigata and Agarrate Catalina) and Rosario (Mugasurga, La Cotorra and Aguantando la Pelusa). The approach to dictatorial traumatic experiences is analyzed to observe the intergenerational transmission of a memory that these young people did not experience, but that they appropriate, criticize and defend as such.

TI  - Coupling remote sensing and crop growth model to estimate national wheat yield in Ethiopia
T2  - BIG EARTH DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of crop yield at a regional level is essential for making agricultural planning and addressing food security issues in Ethiopia. Remote sensing observations, particularly the leaf area index (LAI), have a strong relationship with crop yield. This study has proposed an approach to estimate wheat yield at field level and regional scale in Ethiopia by assimilating the retrieved MODIS time-series LAI data into the WOrld FOod STudies (WOFOST) model. To improve the estimation of crop yield in the region, the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) was used to incorporate the LAI into the WOFOST model. The estimation accuracy of wheat crop yield was validated using field-measured yields collected during the 2018 growing season. Our findings indicated that wheat yield was more precisely estimated by WOFOST (at water-limited mode) with EnKF algorithm (R (2) = 0.80 and RMSE = 413 kg ha(-1)) compared to that of without assimilating remotely sensed LAI (R (2) = 0.58, RMSE = 592 kg ha(-1)). These results demonstrated that assimilating MODIS-LAI into WOFOST has high potential and practicality to give a reference for wheat yield estimation. The findings from this study can provide information to policy, decision-makers, and other similar sectors to implement an appropriate and timely yield estimation measure.

TI  - Water use efficiency data from 2000 to 2019 in measuring progress towards SDGs in Central Asia
T2  - BIG EARTH DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Central Asia, located in the hinterland of the Eurasian continent, is characterized with sparse rainfall, frequent droughts and low water use efficiency. Limited water resources have become a key factor restricting the sustainable development of this region. Accurately assessing the efficiency of water resources utilization is the first step to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Central Asia. However, since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the evaluation of water use efficiency is difficult due to low data availability and poor consistency. To fill this gap, this paper developed a Water Use Efficiency dataset (WUE) based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Gross Primary Production (GPP) data and the MODIS evapotranspiration (ET) data. The WUE dataset ranges from 2000 to 2019 with a spatial resolution of 500 m. The agricultural WUE was then extracted based on the Global map of irrigated areas and MODIS land use map. As a complementary, the water use amount per GDP was estimated for each country. The present dataset could reflect changes in water use efficiency of agriculture and other sectors. The published data are available at http://www.dx.doi.org/10.11922/sciencedb.j00076.00012.

TI  - Protected areas slow clown tropical rainforest disturbance in the Leuser Ecosystem, Indonesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF LAND USE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical rainforest ecosystems that function as biodiversity pools had been undermined because of anthropogenic activities. Research has shown that protected areas (PAs) have become the first safeguard for biodiversity. However, how to measure the effectiveness of PAs remains unclear. We present spatiotemporal changes within the PAs and non-PAs in the Leuser Ecosystem, which is one of the significant global landscapes, using intensity analysis during two time periods and propensity score matching to investigate the effectiveness of PAs. We classified land cover using machine learning based on remotely sensed data. Our results revealed the effectiveness of PAs compared with non-PAs. The new conservation intervention after 2008 resulted in the deacceleration of deforestation from 2000-2010 to 2010-2020. In addition, PAs can reduce deforestation two times more effectively than non-PAs. Therefore, PAs and good governance within the Leuser Ecosystem are crucial in maintaining the natural ecosystem to address global conservation targets.

TI  - Ignorance or sovereignty: the de-territorialization of Jihad in Sayyid Qutb's theo-political vision
T2  - JOURNAL OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The burgeoning interest and research in the ideology of the Islamist thinker Sayyid Qutb (d. 1966), since the attacks of 11 September, have been driven by one of the two goals: to demonstrate the crucial role of Qutb's verdict upon all modern societies as ungodly (jahili) in shaping the worldview of militant Islamists, or, more specifically, to explore the extent of Qutb's influence in shaping the takfiri rhetoric of late 20th century jihadists. Yet one aspect of Qutb's verdict against modern societies that might explain the continuing appeal of his ideology to jihadists has received less attention in the literature: how the arguments Qutb employs in formulating this condemnation of modern societies as ungodly leads to a de-territorialization of jihad that explains his refusal to accept the traditional division of the world into 'land of Islam' and 'land of disbelief.' To drive this argument home, the article revisits Qutb's theo-political vision of Islam and explores his conception of divine sovereignty (hakimiyya) as a counter-term to jahiliyya to explicate the implications of that vision for his view of jihad. I argue that Qutb's call for the restoration and submission to divine authority encompasses both a transnational and a national concept of jihad.

TI  - Bayesian maximum entropy interpolation of sea surface temperature data: A comparative assessment
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea surface temperature (SST) is an important oceanography attribute that has been used to study ocean climatic conditions, ocean dynamics and air-sea interactions. In the present work, the Bayesian maximum entropy (BME) method was used to interpolate a FY-3 C /VIRR satellite dataset in the region with coordinates 120 degrees-150 degrees W and 45 degrees-60 degrees S and during January 2020. A novel approach of constructing valuable soft data was developed by combining BME interpolation with highly correlated SST day and night data differences. The BME interpolation accuracy was assessed by cross-validation, and the results showed that the average RMSE (root mean squared error) was 0.700 and the average bias was 0.441 degrees C. Furthermore, using the Argo data as a basis of comparison, the coverage and accuracy of the BME interpolation of the FY-3 C/VIRR satellite SST dataset were compared numerically with those of the Ordinary Kriging (OK) interpolation of the FY-3 C/VIRR satellite SST dataset and the Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature (OISST) of the AVHRR satellite SST dataset. It was found that BME had the best SST interpolation performance among the three methods with the lowest average bias and the largest correlation coefficient. Although OISST had a full product coverage rate overall (due to its use of more perfect treatment means), BME's coverage rate (97.5%) considerably improved that of the FY-3 C/VIRR SST data. Also, both the BME and OK products maintained a 12hrs temporal resolution and a 0.05 decimal degrees longitude/latitude spatial resolution, which is an improvement over OISST data with a 24hrs time resolution and a 0.25 decimal degrees longitude/latitude spatial resolution. Another advantage of BME is that because of its broad theoretical support its performance in practice can be improved further as more knowledge sources become available (which can only be incorporated by BME).

TI  - Assessing spatial variability and estimating mean crown diameter in boreal forests using variograms and amplitude spectra of very-high-resolution remote sensing data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The retrieval of forest variables from optical remote sensing data using physically-based models is an ill-posed problem and does not make full use of the high spatial resolution imagery that is becoming available globally. A possible solution to this is to use prior information about the retrieved variables, which constrains the possible solutions and reduces uncertainty in forest variable estimation. Therefore, we tried to quantify physically-based parameters that could be retrieved using the second-order statistics of measured and simulated very-high-resolution (pixel size less than 1 m) images of Finnish boreal forests. These forests have a well-defined structure and are usually not closed, i.e. the reflected signal has a considerable contribution from a green forest floor. We retrieved the second-order statistics using variograms and Fourier amplitude spectra. We found, in line with previous studies, that the range of variograms correlates well (r = 0.83) with the mean crown diameter for spatially homogeneous forest patches, and it can be used to estimate crown diameters with reasonable accuracy (RMSE = 0.42 m). We present a novel approach, which uses the Fourier amplitude spectrum to study the spatial structure of a forest. The approach provided encouraging results with the measured data: despite the lower accuracy (RMSE = 0.67 m) compared with variograms, we found that it could also be used to estimate mean crown diameters for heterogeneous forest areas. The Fourier amplitude spectrum approach did not work with the simulated images. Our results highlight the possibility to obtain further information from very-high-resolution images of forests to solve the ill-posed problem of forest variable estimation from optical remote sensing data using physically-based models.

TI  - A Portrait of a Contemporary Chinese Exile From Spiritual Warrior to Hermit
T2  - CHINESE LITERATURE AND THOUGHT TODAY
M3  - Article
AB  - Liu Zaifu was a leading Chinese intellectual in the 1980s whose theories challenged the dominant Marxist paradigms in Chinese literature by defending the aesthetic complexity of the human character and literary creation. These aesthetic positions, his popularity among students and writers, and involvement during the Tiananmen movement led to his political blacklisting and subsequent exile toward the United States. This exile began his second phase of life that was primarily characterized by acclimating, wandering, and cultivating in cultural peripheries. His life can be divided into three distinct phases, the first being a Chinese intellectual enthusiastically engaged in social reform and steadfastly loyal to his home country. In contrast, the second phase was moving from a nostalgic attachment to the homeland into a simultaneously eremitic and cosmopolitan worldview which epitomized his third phase. Despite constant loneliness in a foreign country, Liu Zaifu turned his solitude into a personal renaissance to prolifically publish richer cultural reflections. Within exile, Liu Zaifu used his newfound political freedom to emphasize the transcendental value of literature, publishing dozens of books, articles, essays, and prose poems that include his most acclaimed and emblematic writings.

TI  - Geography as a science of the earth's surface founded on the third view of space
T2  - ANNALS OF GIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The third or organismic view of space states that space is neither lifeless nor neutral, but a living structure capable of being more living or less living, thus different fundamentally from the first two mechanistic views of space: Newtonian absolute space and Leibnizian relational space. The living structure is defined as a physical and mathematical structure or simply characterized by the recurring notion (or inherent hierarchy) of far more small substructures than large ones. This paper seeks to lay out a new geography as a science of the Earth's surface founded on the third view of space. The new geography aims not only to better understand geographic forms and processes but also - maybe more importantly - to make geographic space or the Earth's surface to be living or more living. After introducing two fundamental laws of geography: Tobler's law on spatial dependence (or homogeneity) and scaling law on spatial heterogeneity, we argue that these two laws are fundamental laws of living structure that favour statistics over exactitude, because the former (or statistics) tends to make a structure more living than the latter (or exactitude). We present the concept of living structure through some working examples and make it clear how a living structure differs from a non-living structure, under the organismic worldview that was first conceived by the British philosopher Alfred Whitehead (1861-1947). In order to make a structure or space living or more living, we illustrate two design principles - differentiation and adaptation - using two paintings and two city plans. The new geography is a science of living structure, dealing with a wide range of scales, from the smallest scale of ornaments on walls to the scale of the entire Earth's surface.

In remote sensing studies, vegetation indices are widely used to examine the relationship between Land Surface Temperature (LST) and vegetation cover. The vegetation cover can be measured using the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). In this study, the LST-NDVI relationship was assessed in each of the seven city-regions (A-G) in Johannesburg using Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) datasets to provide a basis for urban ecological planning and environmental protection. This study's specific objective was to determine the intraurban differences in vegetation coverage and LST in the seven city-regions over 19 years. The relationship between LST and NDVI was also examined over the years of study. The results showed a significant intraurban difference in LST and NDVI values in the city-regions with a negative correlation between them, ranging from -0.03 to -0.76. The LST values increased in all the city-regions with the highest value of 20.1 degrees C in city-region G, followed by 19.6 degrees C in city-region E. The vegetation cover decreased over the years, with the lowest NDVI value in city-region G (0.39), followed by city-regions F (0.43) and D (0.48). The city-regions with high LST and low vegetation cover include the city-centre and highly populated suburbs. This indicates that areas with greater vegetation cover have low LSTs and vice versa. These findings provide useful information for municipal authorities and other stakeholders to undertake appropriate decisions to tackle Urban Heat Island (UHI) effects by adopting effective urban planning and management interventions.

TI  - Losing the Remote: Exploring the Thai Social Order with the Early and Late Hanks
T2  - ANTHROPOLOGICAL FORUM
M3  - Article
AB  - This article challenges the common understanding of Thailand's ethnic divide as marked by unfamiliarity and an absolute difference between Thai society and the hill tribes in the country's north. Much scholarship has overlooked how the negotiation of diversity and complexity has been foundational to Thai and other Southeast Asian societies and cultures for millennia. An ideology of ethnically singular and exclusive Thai identity framed the historical context in which Lucien Hanks initially wrote about Thai social life and its logics. I draw on his later work, particularly the research he conducted with Jane R. Hanks in the northern hills, to revisit diversity in Thai society and history. Hanks identified merit and power as the key principles of the Thai social order. A third notion, parity, enables inclusive and diverse social networks. It offers an indigenous challenge to any association of Thai identity, worldview, or social organisation with intolerance and ethnic chauvinism.

TI  - What does 'buying local' mean to wine consumers?
T2  - Journal of Wine Research
M3  - Article
AB  - This study sought to understand what buying 'local' means to Ontario wine consumers and determine how local wine purchase behaviour varies with select demographic and environmental belief factors. Few studies concerning the perception of and reasons for purchasing local wine have been conducted, and none in the context of Ontario wine consumers. An online survey of Ontario wine consumers (N = 521) was carried out and results showed that perceptions of localness differed between food products ('coming from within a 100 km radius of home') and wine ('coming from anyway in North America and Canada'). The most important motivational factors reported for purchasing local wine were directly linked to economic and hedonic factors, specifically; 'support local vineyards and wineries', 'build the local economy' and 'taste and flavour'. High frequency purchasers of local wines also bought local foods more often and were more likely to seek information about the origin of their food than were lower frequency purchasers. A pro-ecological worldview is associated with higher purchasing frequency of Ontario wine. These results can assist Ontario wineries with respect to market segmentation and development of campaigns focused on local wine.

TI  - Spaces of Collective Memory in Contemporary Russian Women's Historical Fiction
T2  - SCANDO-SLAVICA
M3  - Article
AB  - This article focuses on the connection between collective memory and fictional spatiality in three novels by contemporary Russian female authors: Ljudmila Ulickaja's Zelenyj sater, Elena Cizova's Vremja zenscin, and Guzel' Jachina's Zulejcha otkryvaet glaza. These fictionalized versions of the Soviet past aim at overturning the idea of a unitary historical narrative, instead offering multiple ways of looking at the past, often from a female perspective that highlights the role of women in taking on responsibility for the maintaining of history and culture. Moreover, the novels represent an alternative cultural consciousness as a microhistorical fictional space, loaded with cultural and literary-historical meanings. Zelenyj sater focuses on the literary geography of Moscow as an alternative to the everyday Breznev-era reality; the alternative city is the locus for the transmission of an earlier cultural heritage in Moscow dissident communities. Vremja zenscin represents the transmission of an Orthodox worldview in post-war Leningrad in a female community and reflects on the cultural mythology associated with St. Petersburg/Leningrad. Zulejcha otkryvaet glaza focuses on a multicultural Soviet labor settlement in the Siberian forest, which echoes both old Tatar myths and the Central-European cultural heritage of the White Leningrad intelligentsia. In exploring alternative ways of looking at historical narratives and constructing possible fictional spaces, these novels aim at making sense of recent history from the perspective of the twenty-first century.

TI  - Evaluation of ACOLITE atmospheric correction methods for Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 in the Rio de la Plata turbid coastal waters
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat-8 (L8) and Sentinel-2 (S2) terrestrial satellite missions have shown to contain useful information for aquatic applications. However, quantitative retrieval of water quality parameters, such as turbidity, strongly depend on the performance of atmospheric correction algorithms. Among available processors, ACOLITE (https://odnature.naturalsciences.be/remsem/soft ware-and-data/acolite) is simple to incorporate in imagery processing routines and has shown to have better performance than other processors for sediment-rich waters. Recently (in 2018), it incorporated a new default atmospheric correction approach, the dark spectrum fit (DSF), which remains to be tested in most of the Southern hemisphere coastal areas. In this work, we present new in-situ radiometric measurements collected in the northern coast of the Rio de la Plata estuary, South America, during field campaigns along a 2-year period. The data set was used to evaluate the performance of ACOLITE's DSF and exponential extrapolation (EXP) methods with L8 and S2 imagery, and to recalibrate a turbidity algorithm. The DSF did not perform very well, giving particularly poor results in the near infrared (NIR) bands. However, its performance was greatly improved with an optional sun glint correction (DSF+GC), although some positive bias was still present in the NIR bands. A GC seemed to be most important in dates with higher sun elevation (austral spring and summer), and should be strongly considered for other water bodies in the region and in similar or lower latitudes (35 degrees S). Additionally, the EXP method gave good results in the green-NIR spectral region when a low (5th) percentile aerosol type was selected. Finally, the effect of the atmospheric correction on turbidity retrieval from satellite imagery was assessed: if the red and a NIR band were combined, the effect of the bias in the NIR region was negligible for the DSF+GC method; however, some impact was noticed for the lowest turbidity levels if a single NIR band was used.

TI  - Monitoring of a landmark bridge using SAR interferometry coupled with engineering data and forensics
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Infrastructure monitoring can facilitate the evaluation of capacity and functionality loss and therefore provide valuable data and evidence for reliable, lifetime and automated risk assessments. Terrestrial monitoring systems can provide information about assets and their condition. Yet, they fall short of engineering requirements related to the history of the asset loading, deterioration and potential damage, which is of paramount importance in risk-based decision-making by infrastructure operators. This capability gap can be filled by Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) Monitoring in conjunction with engineering forensics and judgment. This paper puts forward this hybrid approach to assess the structural condition of a landmark bridge by coupling advanced Differential SAR Tomography (D-TomoSAR) techniques with an adaptive deformation model, environmental measurements and engineering evidence and evaluations. A dataset of 360 Sentinel A &B images covering the period between 10/2014 and 2/2020 and temperature records to account for seasonal deformation were deployed. Displacement products, such as the development of annual displacement and time series were calculated demonstrating a strong correlation with temperature variation and resulting deformations of the asset. The spatiotemporally evolving deformation trends of the bridge superstructure were derived, and vulnerable deck locations were identified on the basis of engineering forensics, judgment and progressive displacements calculated from the D-TomoSAR technique. The vertical displacement profile at the critical deck location was developed reaching a displacement velocity of 1.8 mm/year and potential deterioration issues are manifested as potential causes of the observed geometric alterations. Based on the D-TomoSAR results matched with engineering evidence and on-site visual inspections and judgment, this study contributed to the decision-making process. This research is a pilot showcase of D-TomoSAR for the bridge monitoring, not only providing mm-level quantitative measurements of the bridge in a 6-year observation span using medium resolution Sentinel-1 SAR images alone but also indirectly identifying potential structural defects in the north section of the bridge. This research is a primer example of how we can deploy diverse evidence to facilitate targeted adaptation measures and prioritize restoration strategies to facilitate asset owners in better decision making.

TI  - Gradient convolutional neural network for classification of agricultural fields with contour levee
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To better understand how contour-levee irrigation practice impacts water resources for formulating effective water management policies, it is important to obtain its application on large-scale data sets, e.g. state-wide. Automatic classification of contour levee croplands from high-resolution aerial images is of great potential given the success of deep neural networks and the availability of high-resolution remote sensing imagery. This paper proposes a gradient CNN model to classify fields with contour levees from remote sensing images. Our model produces high-quality segmentation masks that are refined with superpixel-based segmentation post-processing. Our method is evaluated using images by the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) for the counties in Arkansas. A comparison with the state-of-the-art methods demonstrates the improved performance of our proposed method. Our method demonstrates superior performance in the classification of challenging cases and achieves an overall 3.08% of accuracy improvement and 28.57% BER error reduction, compared to the second-best method. The p-value with respect to the second-best method is 0.005, which indicates great statistical significance. In addition, the results for data of different counties demonstrate the exceptional generalization ability of our method.

TI  - Machine learning modelling of crop structure within the Maize Triangle of South Africa
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Maize has been identified as a strategic commodity for the reduction of poverty and enhancement of food security in the African continent. Climate variability and difficult economic conditions are pressuring farmers to produce higher (maize) yields with fewer inputs, per hectare. The remote sensing of crop specific structural parameters are essential in identifying the particular growth stages of the maize crop which require specific tasks from the farmer (e.g. weed control, top dressing, pesticide application for disease and borer control and critical moisture phase). This study sought to assess the performance of multiple linear regression (LR), Random Forest (RF) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) in the estimation of four maize crop structural parameters in a study area in the Vereeniging region of the Maize Triangle of South Africa. These parameters were leaf area index (LAI), stem height (HT), stem diameter (DIA) and stem density (SD). An additional aim was to investigate whether the combination of selected spectral vegetation indices (red-edge, chlorophyll, senescence and greenness) with Sentinel-2 reflectance bands as modelling predictors yielded improved results over the individual spectral bands alone. Combining reflectance bands and vegetation indices as modelling predictors yielded the highest validation accuracy, over other scenarios, for only one out of the four crop structural parameters (DAI). The reflectance bands only scenario yielded the highest validation accuracies for two crop structural parameters (HT and SD). The use of spectral vegetation indices alone as modelling predictors yielded the highest modelling accuracies for the LAI crop parameter than the other scenarios. These trends indicate that the combination of Sentinel-2 reflectance bands and derived vegetation indices do not always yield improved modelling results for the four crop structural parameters under investigation. As a result, reflectance bands (mostly) or indices alone could suffice for nearly all of the parameters. With respect to the modelling algorithms, LR yielded the highest accuracies for DIA and SD (Standard Error of Prediction or SEP values of 22.40%+/- 4.65 and 34.15%+/- 2.72 respectively). GPR yielded the highest accuracies for LAI and HT (SEP values of 28.69%+/- 3.84 and 23.19%+/- 2.27 respectively) while RF did not yield the highest validation accuracy for any of the crop structural parameters.

TI  - Molecular characterization and pathogenicity of novel Malaysian chicken astrovirus isolates
T2  - AVIAN PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Chicken astrovirus (CAstV) has for over a decade been associated with runting stunting syndrome, severe kidney disease and visceral gout, and white chick syndrome. However, knowledge of the molecular characteristics and pathogenicity of the virus in day-old specific pathogen-free (SPF) chicks is scarce. This study focused on the characterization of near-complete genome of three Malaysian CAstV isolates following virus propagation in SPF embryonated chicken eggs and pathogenicity in day-old SPF chicks. The three isolates demonstrated unique features including a point mutation in their intergenic regions and an additional stem-loop II-like motif (s2m) in ORF-2. Pairwise sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis of the ORF-2 amino acid sequence of the three isolates revealed an identity share of 86-91% with group B CAstVs while forming a new subgroup in addition to the known four subgroups (Bi, Bii, Biii and Biv) that exhibit high identity of between 95% and 100% within the subgroups. In the pathogenicity study, birds in the infected and exposed sentinel groups exhibited lethargy and diarrhoea 3 days post-inoculation (dpi) that declined by 6 dpi, and 20% growth retardation by 9 dpi. Mild lymphocytic aggregates in the duodenum, tubular degeneration and interstitial nephritis were observed in the intestines and kidneys, respectively, in both groups. In addition, the mean virus copy numbers of the cloacal swabs were log(10) 13.23 at 3 dpi and log(10) 9.04 at 6 dpi for the infected and exposed sentinels, respectively. The study suggests that the Malaysian isolates should be assigned to a new subgroup, Bv within group B CAstV.

TI  - A two-step approach to the processing of high-resolution SAR satellite data based on the chirp <i>z</i>-transform
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The processing of high resolution spotlight synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data suffers from Doppler spectrum aliasing because of the limited pulse repetition frequency (PRF). A modified two-step approach (TSA) based on the chirp z-transform (CZT) to high resolution spaceborne SAR data processing is proposed to deal with the spectral aliasing problem in this paper. The range frequency dependent quadratic phase function applied in modified TSA, which can remove the Doppler modulation of the signal completely, gives rise to the effect that the Doppler bin size varies with the range frequency. Thus, the extra spectrum resampling procedure is required to obtain a uniformly sampled signal spectrum. A spectrum resampling approach based on the chirp z-transform is proposed, which can overcome the range frequency dependent distortion. Experiments are performed on simulated point and experimental SAR data to validate the presented approach.

AB  - The lack of systematic measurements of socioeconomic factors on a worldwide scale remains a significant challenge to our understanding of human well-being. A growing body of literature suggests that some of these measurement gaps can be filled using remote sensing, imputing human conditions on the ground based on the ways in which social groups have modified - or, not - their physical environment. In this article, we contribute to this growing body of literature by presenting a case study estimating school test scores based solely on publicly available imagery in both the Philippines (2010, 2014) and Brazil (2016). We contrast single image convolutional neural network (CNN) approaches to multi-source ensembles and find predictive accuracy for individual schools across years and regions ranging from 76% to 80%. Finally, we discuss broader considerations related to the operational use of CNN-based approaches for measuring socioeconomic factors, and provide open source computer code for community use.

TI  - A basin-scale inventory and hydrodynamics of floodplain wetlands based on time-series of remote sensing data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The world is rapidly losing its wetlands. To contain the loss, the first and foremost requirement is to prepare an inventory of wetlands based on historical datasets. Individual wetlands in a catchment system are not standalone entitites, and together, they control the hydrological processes of the catchment. Therefore, it is essential to map the wetlands at the catchment scale to understand their relationship with the adjoining water bodies. This will further help to develop sustainable strategies for their revival and management. In the present work, we have formulated a simple yet robust method to (a) map the wetlands and (b) document surface dynamics of wetlands by applying pixel-scale binary logic (wet/not-wet) to the time-series Landsat dataset. We have applied this method to a large basin in the Ganga Plains and mapped a total of 3226 wetlands in the basin. The method can also be applied to map wetlands at a pixel scale to a basin scale.

TI  - Can sustainability certification enhance the climate resilience of smallholder farmers? The case of Ghanaian cocoa
T2  - JOURNAL OF LAND USE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainability certification has been posited as a key governance mechanism to enhance the climate resilience of smallholder farmers. Whilst many certifications now include climate resilience in their standards, their ability to deliver this for smallholders remains untested. We take the case of the 2015-16 drought-shock to cocoa production in Ghana to examine whether certification can enhance smallholder climate resilience. We used a novel transdisciplinary methodology combining participatory outcome definition with household surveys, biophysical measurements, satellite data and counterfactual analysis. Utilising our climate resilience framework, we find that certification has a strong effect on the adoption of basic management, e.g. fertilization, but a weak influence on more complex resilience strategies, e.g. agroforest diversification. Beyond certification, we identify strong regional patterns in resilience. These findings suggest that certification has some potential to enhance climate resilience but greater focus on facilitating diversification and adapting to subnational contexts is required for improved effectiveness.

TI  - Public perception of religion and worldviews education
T2  - JOURNAL FOR THE STUDY OF SPIRITUALITY
M3  - Review
AB  - This article is based on work undertaken by Culham St Gabriel's Trust, a charitable organisation in the UK which is committed to the development of 'a broad-based, critical and reflective education in religion and worldviews contributing to a well-informed, respectful and open society.' The article highlights the results of a survey by the Trust in June 2021 which aimed to establish a baseline regarding the public perception of religious education (RE) in schools, and wider views around religious-, spirituality-, belief- and worldview-literacy. The Trust plans to use this baseline to measure the impact of interventions and campaigns through its own programmes and grant-funded projects over the coming years. Previous surveys have suggested that the UK population has negative perceptions of religious education; however, these new results indicate that the majority of those surveyed have a positive view of the subject and value the importance of religious and belief literacy in a range of contexts. The article sets out the key findings of the survey; it also includes some personal reflections and analysis, as well as reference to media engagement. Alignment of the results with pupil perspectives is considered, and finally conclusions are drawn about potential next steps and use of the findings in programme and policy development.

TI  - Characteristics and trends of hillside urbanization in China from 2007 to 2017
T2  - HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - China's rapid urbanization has resulted in a dramatic loss in cultivated land that threatens future food security. Local and central government have successively launched a series of Low-slope Hilly Regions Comprehensive Development and Utilization (LHRCDU) pilot projects (i.e., the rudiment of China's hillside urbanization) since 2006 to balance the contradiction between urban growth and flat farmland protection. However, the process, quantity and effect of hillside urbanization over China remain unknown. In this study, we conducted an investigation of hillside urbanization (mainly refers to the urban land expansion on hillsides) over China from 2007 to 2017 by combining earth observation satellite data with spatial analysis techniques. Our results revealed that 12.32% of China's urban expansion area came from hillside urbanization, in which Guizhou, Yunnan, Shanxi and Fujian had large areas of hillside urbanization area (accounting for 25.63% of the total hillside urbanization area in China), while Guizhou, Tibet, Yunnan, Chongqing, Hong Kong and Shanxi had higher hillside urbanization rates (>30%). China's hillside urbanization rate also showed a steady upward trend, and 20% of hillside urbanization was high environmental cost (HEC), occupying 1535.94 km2 of hillside forest. Our findings provide timely and transparent monitoring on China's hillside urbanization, and indicate that hillside urbanization can relieve the pressure of urban development on flat farmland but needs to be regulated for ecological safety.

TI  - Religious Diversity and Religious Governance in South Korea: From Nominal to Covenantal Pluralism
T2  - REVIEW OF FAITH & INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
M3  - Article
AB  - Historically the paradigm of religious governance in South Korea focused on controlling and regulation, with a constrained conception of "diversity" and a thin veneer of tolerance. The traditional pattern of religious governance in Korea reflects a merely nominal pluralism and problematic oligopolistic assumptions. Religious and worldview diversity is increasing in numerous ways. The mismatch between religious governance and religious diversity can be seen in the government's treatment of unconventional religious groups. There is a need in Korea for the kind of robust, relational, and non-relativistic model represented by covenantal pluralism. Fortunately, there are emerging signs of potential progress toward this model.

TI  - Removing cloud cover interference from Sentinel-2 imagery in Google Earth Engine by fusing Sentinel-1 SAR data with a CNN model
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Google Earth Engine (GEE) provides a convenient platform that enables the use of a diverse array of applications based on optical satellite images covering long time periods and large areas. However, cloud contamination often causes optical satellite images to lose land surface information, which can greatly affect their spatial and temporal availability in areas with frequent cloud cover. Reconstructing the missing values is very important when researchers attempt to improve the potential for using optical satellite images. Recently, convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods have shown great potential in cloud removal. Unfortunately, current CNN-based cloud removal methods can only be applied locally, which would result in inefficient data downloading and storage problems. To address these problems, this paper proposes a method that integrates GEE data and a multi-level feature connected CNN (DeepGEE-S2CR) to remove clouds in Sentinel-2 imagery using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery as auxiliary data. Specifically, the training process of the multi-level feature connected CNN was conducted locally, so that cloud removal could then be performed on the client of GEE using online data with the trained CNN model. An experiment using a set of globally distributed Sentinel-2 images was conducted to validate the proposed method; the results showed the process could generate results comparable to a classic deep Sentinel-2 cloud removal method (DSen2-CR) that should be run locally (the average root mean square errors of DeepGEE-S2CR and DSen2-CR were 0.045 and 0.042, respectively). The proposed method is especially convenient for removing clouds in Sentinel-2 imagery covering a large area.

TI  - The Philosophy and Drama of Life: The Theatrical Understanding of Dostoevsky
T2  - RUSSIAN STUDIES IN PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article discusses the little-studied issue of the dramatic content of philosophical issues in Fyodor M. Dostoevsky's works. The polyphonic quality, the dialogism combined with the markers of the genre of tragedy, has served as the basis for numerous theatrical incarnations of Dostoevsky's novels and stories. We note the markers of a carnivalesque worldview, the combination of the grotesque with subtle psychology in stage productions of the author's work. The complex of existential issues correlates with social significant ones, and the choice of characters is made at different levels of life. We discuss the most notable productions during the late twentieth and early twenty-first century: Georgy Tovstonogov's The Idiot, Yuri Zavadsky's St. Petersburg Dreams, Valery Fokin's I Shall Go, I Shall Go, and Konstantin Bogomolov's The Karamazovs.

TI  - Risk factors and navigation accidents: A historical analysis comparing accident-free and accident-prone vessels using indicators from AIS data and vessel databases
T2  - MARITIME TRANSPORT RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the results of an explorative analysis aiming to identify indicators and factors associated with navigation accidents (groundings and collisions). The analysis compares cargo vessels with at least one registered navigation accident (grounding or collision) within Norwegian waters with those that have none, in the period 2010-2019. The comparison is made using data based on automatic identification system (AIS) satellite data in combination with information from IHS Fairplay, to construct indicators that reflect different characteristics of the vessels. Hallmarks of vessels involved in navigation accidents have been identified using bivariate and multivariate statistical analysis. The multivariate model was a strong predictor of vessels' accident involvement with 44% of the variance explained. Indicators that predicted reported navigation accidents included: (1) vessel type, (2) higher age, (3) smaller size, (4) longer distance sailed, (5) higher average speed, (6) flying Norwegian flag, (7) gray or black Tokyo MoU rating, and 8) not on US Coast Guard target list. The results are discussed relative to their potential causes as well as limits and practical applications. The study shows the promising potential of utilizing AIS data combined with various data sets to obtain knowledge on risk factors and risk indicators.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Algorithms, Technologies, and Applications for Multispectral and Hyperspectral Imaging XXVIII
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Mucilage also called sea snot or sea saliva is a collection of mucus-like organic matter found in the sea. Although not harmful in the beginning, when mucilage increases over time, it covers the sea creatures and forms thick layers in the sea. Its existence and long duration change the oxygen balance in the seas, reduce biodiversity, fisheries, and tourism. Since April 2021, mucilage has emerged as both an ecological and economical problem in Turkey, spreading over an area of kilometers, clogging the fishing nets, causing problems in marine vessels, and disrupting the industry. These findings indicate that mucilage monitoring, early detection, and intervention before the economic and ecological damages grow out of proportion is quite necessary. Through the analysis of satellite data, it is possible to observe the existence of mucilage as thin, extended layers of white substance. Therefore, in this work, we analyze the Sentinel-2 multispectral data and PRISMA hyperspectral data to detect the mucilage in the early stages through the use of both traditional as well as deep learning algorithms. Our results indicate that it is possible to detect mucilage from satellite data with high accuracy, saving time and money for the cleaning efforts.

TI  - An Overview on the Generation and Detection of Synthetic and Manipulated Satellite Images
T2  - APSIPA TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL AND INFORMATION PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the reduction of technological costs and the increase of satellite launches, satellite images are becoming more popular and easier to obtain. Besides serving benevolent purposes, satellite data can also be used for malicious reasons such as misinformation. As a matter of fact, satellite images can be easily manipulated relying on general image editing tools. Moreover, with the surge of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) that can generate realistic synthetic imagery belonging to various domains, additional threats related to the diffusion of synthetically generated satellite images are emerging. In this paper, we review the State of the Art (SOTA) on the generation and manipulation of satellite images. In particular, we focus on both the generation of synthetic satellite imagery from scratch, and the semantic manipulation of satellite images by means of image-transfer technologies, including the transformation of images obtained from one type of sensor to another one. We also describe forensic detection techniques that have been researched so far to classify and detect synthetic image forgeries. While we focus mostly on forensic techniques explicitly tailored to the detection of AI-generated synthetic contents, we also review some methods designed for general splicing detection, which can in principle also be used to spot AI manipulate images.

TI  - Nutrient management may reduce global warming potential of rice cultivation in subtropical India
T2  - CURRENT RESEARCH IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural practices contribute to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; therefore, it is essential to modify the production technologies. We analyzed decadal variation in CO2 and CH4 over a major rice cultivating area in subtropical India using GOSAT satellite data, which shows a sturdy increase. Furthermore, we carried out long-term field experiments with different nutrients management in the research farm to validate CERES-Rice (Crop Environment Resource Synthesis) and DNDC (De-nitrification and Decomposition model) models. The variations in Global warming potential per kg rice grain production over 90 years (2005-2095) are also projected. This study used a simulation technique to predict the rice yield using CERES-Rice and GWP using the DNDC model for three varied nutrient management treatments: chemical fertilizer (CF) at full (100%) recommended level (CF100), organic fertilizer using vermicompost at full recommendation (VC100), and integration of organic and chemical fertilizer (VC50 + CF50). The CF100 treatment showed the highest rate of increase in GWP as 0.014 and 0.021 kg CO(2)eq kg-grain season(-1) in RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, respectively. Integrating organic fertilizers with chemical fertilizers may give a nearly similar yield in later decades of the century in both RCP 4.5 and 8.5 climate scenarios with substantial reductions (77% in RCP 4.5 and 66% in RCP 8.5) in the rate of change in GWP as compared to sole chemical fertilizer application. This study recommends integrated nutrient management using organic fertilizers as a feasible way to limit the GHG emission from rice fields and minimize global warming in future climate scenarios.

M3  - Article
AB  - Seismology is among the intrinsic sciences that strictly affect human lives. Many research efforts are presented in the literature aiming at achieving risk mitigation and disaster management. More particularly, modern technologies have been employed in such a pivot. However, the day-to-day challenges and complexities of such natural science that face the stack holders still need more reliable and intelligent solutions. The solution can depend on a partial or integrated system of modern technologies. In this article, we extensively survey the corelated modern technologies aiming to gather the major efforts exerted in this regard. It also outlines the desirability of seismology to modern technologies. Then, we present a detailed analysis of remote sensing and data communication networks (DCNs), which are considered the backend of seismic networks. Furthermore, for seismology, we depict both classical and nonclassical approaches based on DCN principles, such as optical fiber-based acoustic sensors, social media, and the Internet of things (IoT). Following that, a comprehensive description of the various optimization techniques utilized for seismic wave analysis and for prolonging network lifetime is offered. A description of the important functions that artificial intelligence (AI) can play in different fields of seismology is also included. Finally, we present some recommendations for stack holders to prevent natural calamities and preserve human lives.

T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In the current study the processes of soil deterioration over the past five decades was evaluated. Land degradation risk, status, and rate were assessed in Kafr El-Sheikh Governorate, Egypt, in 2016 using OLI and ETM (2002) remote sensing data, and soil data from 1961.A quantitative deterioration was produced based on the comparative study approach in the integrated weighted sum, weighted overlay, and fuzzy model. The parameters used were soil depth, texture, pH, EC, OM, SAR, ESP, CEC, CaCO3, BD, N, P, K. The variables were based on the measurements derived from the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE). The results of the implemented USLE in the GIS model-builder revealed the prevalence of severe soil deterioration processes in the region, and include four main deterioration risks: water-logging, soil compaction, salinization, and alkalization. During 2002-2016, soil sealing took place on 36,297.87 ha of the study area (9.7% of the total area). Urban sprawl was one of the most noticed problems that became apparent during the fieldwork during the inventory of land resources in the investigation area. Soil sealing is one of the hidden manifestations of desertification, and it is the implicit explanation for the lost land for the agricultural production process. The study showed that the investigated soil, as a part of north Nile Delta, is a very fragile system that needs to be protected, especially under the effect of climate change in areas overloaded with population, and because of their negative effects on soil properties. According to the results of this study, it is recommended that the same approach be applied to similar agricultural semi-arid regions to help in building a database of land resources for agricultural use that will be very useful for the decision-maker to monitor changes on agricultural lands.

TI  - SC-RoadDeepNet: A New Shape and Connectivity-Preserving Road Extraction Deep Learning-Based Network From Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Existing automated road extraction approaches concentrate on regional accuracy rather than road shape and connectivity quality. Most of these techniques produce discontinuous outputs caused by obstacles, such as shadows, buildings, and vehicles. This study proposes a shape and connectivity-preserving road identification deep learning-based architecture called SC-RoadDeepNet to overcome the discontinuous results and the quality of road shape and connectivity. The proposed model comprises a state-of-the-art deep learning-based network, namely, the recurrent residual convolutional neural network, boundary learning (BL), and a new measure based on the intersection of segmentation masks and their (morphological) skeleton called connectivity-preserving centerline Dice (CP_clDice). The recurrent residual convolutional layers accumulate low-level features for segmentation tasks, thus allowing for better feature representation. Such representation enables us to construct a UNet network with the same number of network parameters but improved segmentation effectiveness. BL also aids the model in improving the road's boundaries by penalizing boundary misclassification and fine-tuning the road form. Furthermore, the CP_clDice method aids the model in maintaining road connectivity and obtaining accurate segmentations. We demonstrate that CP_clDice ensures connection preservation for binary segmentation, thereby allowing for efficient road network extraction at the end. The proposed model improves F1 score accuracy to 5.49%, 4.03%, 3.42%, and 2.27% compared with other comparative models, such as LinkNet, ResUNet, UNet, and VNet, respectively. Furthermore, qualitative and quantitative assessments demonstrate that the proposed SC-RoadDeepNet can improve road extraction by tackling shadow and occlusion-related interruptions. These assessments can also produce high-resolution results, particularly in the area of road network completeness.

AB  - The article describes the views of Turkestan's Jadid enlighteners on the education of women in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was emphasized that the role of women in the life of society is directly determined by their worldview, knowledge, culture, and it is important to educate them in this way. It is written that women should also be educated in raising children in the family. Along with the idea that Jadid enlighteners should educate girls, we can see that they taught them in schools along with boys. This is especially true of the schools of AbdukodirShakuri in Samarkand, EshonkhojaKhankhojaev and Sobirkhon Rakhimov in Tashkent, and MuhammadjonKhaliqi in Kokand. Especially Sofizoda's "Read Mothers", Tavallo's "What Nurses Say", Rauf Muzaffarzoda's "Old Wishes from the New Year", SoraMuzaffaria's "The fault is in ourselves", SalimaYakubova and MahfuzaMaksudova's "Teacher's Problem" give different views on women's education. On the basis of various sources and archival documents, general conclusions are given.

TI  - THE ASSESSMENT OF SALINITY-AFFECTED LANDS IN SOUTHERN IRAQ USING SATELLITE IMAGERY
T2  - SCIENTIFIC PAPERS-SERIES A-AGRONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to monitor, map and assess the salinity of land in southern Iraq. Where the country suffers greatly from land degradation and desertification problems, especially in the central and southern parts. This study was conducted to monitor the manifestations of salinity in the Najmi area located within the administrative boundaries of the Muthanna Governorate, which has an area of (2066 hectares) and lies between longitudes 44 degrees 21'0 '' to 44 degrees 31'0 '' East and latitude circles 30 degrees 11'0 '' to 32 degrees 27'0 '' North with the help of remote sensing technology through the use of satellite images from the Landsat 8 satellite with field observations. A map of soil units was prepared using Erdas software, Arc GIS for processing, management and analysis of raster and subject data sets. Soil samples were taken from each site for physical and chemical analysis, and the study is summarized as follows: the results indicated when using the spectral index represented by the standard difference index of vegetation cover (NDVI), whose value ranged between (0.47-0.30). It was found that the study area suffers from a lack of vegetation cover by (64%); as for the salinity index values, they ranged between (-0.30-0.49) and therefore the study area suffers from a chemical deterioration represented in the salinity of the soil estimated at (69%); where the values of the dry lands index ranged between (1.37-0.73), and the desertified lands within the study area by (45%); as for the land degradation index, its value ranged from (0.00 to 99.60), and the percentage of degraded lands was estimated at (60%) of the total study lands.

TI  - Analysing land use/land cover changes and its dynamics using remote sensing and GIS in Gubalafito district, Northeastern Ethiopia
T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping and quantifying the status of Land use/Land cover (LULC) changes and drivers of change are important for identifying vulnerable areas for change and designing sustainable ecosystem services. This study analyzed the status of LULC changes and key drivers of change for the last 30 years through a combination of remote sensing and GIS with the surveying of the local community understanding of LULC patterns and drivers in the Gubalafto district, Northeastern Ethiopia. Five major LULC types (cultivated and settlement, forest cover, grazing land, bush land and bare land) from Landsat images of 1986, 2000, and 2016 were mapped. The results demonstrated that cultivated and settlement constituted the most extensive type of LULC in the study area and increased by 9% extent. It also revealed that a substantial expansion of bush land and bare land areas during the past 30 years. On the other hand, LULC classes that has high environmental importance such as grazing land and forest cover have reduced drastically through time with expanding cultivated and settlement during the same period. The grazing land in 1986 was about 11.1% of the total study area, and it had decreased to 5.7% in 2016. In contrast, cultivated and settlement increased from 45.6% in 1986 to 49.5% in 2016. Bush land increased from 14.8 to 21% in the same period, while forest cover declined from 8.9 to 2% in the same period. The root causes for LULC changes in this particular area include population growth, land tenure insecurity, and common property rights, persistent poverty, climate change, and lack of public awareness. Therefore, the causes for LULC changes have to be controlled, and sustainable resources use is essential; else, these scarce natural resource bases will soon be lost and will no longer be able to play their contribution in sustainable ecosystem services.

TI  - Valve-in-Valve Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in a High-Risk Patient with a Biocor Bioprosthesis and a Flail Prosthetic Valve Leaflet
T2  - CARDIOVASCULAR INNOVATIONS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - An 80-year-old woman with a history of surgical aortic valve replacement with a 21 mm St. Jude Medical Biocor porcine aortic valve 14 years prior presented with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III symptoms, severe aortic insufficiency from a degenerated prosthesis, and a large echocardiographic mobile mass representing a highly mobile prosthetic leaflet. The patient worsened to NYHA class IV symptoms despite medical management. The Society of Thoracic Surgery mortality risk score was extremely high. However, a valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) was found to be a reasonable option. We used a 20 mm SAPIEN 3 Ultra valve (Edwards Lifesciences Inc., Irvine, CA, USA) with a SENTINEL embolic protection device (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA, USA). During valve deployment, the echocardiographic mobile mass was visually pinned between the new TAVR valve and the surgical bioprosthetic valve. No large embolic debris was noted within the embolic protection device, and the patient remained without any new focal neurologic deficits in the perioperative period and at the 30-day follow-up. The severe aortic insufficiency resolved, and the patient clinically improved to NYHA class II symptoms.

TI  - Anthropogenic threats to wetland resources and its implication on carbon sequestration in Southwestern Ethiopia
T2  - EQA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Even though wetlands have been valued for their numerous ecosystem services and hydrological, ecological and habitat functions, its services have been threatened by its sudden losses. Nevertheless, the losses along its driving factors and the effects brought due to the loss have not been scientifically investigated. The study is geared to scrutinize anthropogenic threats to wetland resorces and its implication on carbon sequestration in southwestern Ethiopia. A combination of geospatial and socioeconomic data were utilized to attain the intended objectives. A total of 384 households were selected using simple random sampling technique from sample kebeles to assess the drivers of wetland degradations. Besides, to address the experimental work, the wetland was stratified, and soil samples were taken from three classes of wetlands viz., permanent wetlands (intact wetlands), semi disturbed wetlands and wetlands converted to agricultural land. From the total category of wetlands, 24 composite soil samples in five replications at a depth of 0-20 cm were collected. The result of Landsat imageries revealed that Wichi wetland area has been shrinking. It was 17.4% of the area in 2001, while it declined to 3.1% in 2021. The results of One-Way ANOVA indicated that there is a significant mean difference in soil organic carbon and sequestration capacities between different classes of wetlands at p<0.01 significance level.The organic carbon content of soils converted to agricultural land is very low. In intact/undisturbed wetlands, there is better carbon content than other states of wetlands. This triggers the wetlands to lack their pristine nature. To reverse these problems, integrated problem-solving approach through collaboration of stakeholdfrom policy level down to grassroots community is found to be essential for sustainable wetland management in the area.

AB  - Radiometers aboard satellites provide an essentialsea surface temperature (SST) data archive, which is one ofthe key indicators of climate change. Since new radiometersare planned to fill the gap in the temporal data coverage,it is important to quantify the retrieval accuracy to utilizethe data and seamlessly merge it into an existing SST dataarchive. In this regard, we validate the SST product from Seaand Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR)/Sentinel-3A with in situ measurements to create a reference frame for eval-uating the new sensors products. We used the National Oceanicand Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)iQuam SST datasetfor validating satellite retrievals, since it is easily obtainableunlike skin-SST measurements. Several criteria have yielded atotal of 30 353 high-quality cloud-free collocated data pointsbetween SLSTR andiQuam SST datasets for 2017. Detailedevaluation of biases globally under different wind speeds andprecipitable water vapor (PWV) conditions indicates the fun-damental difference between the satellite and in situ SST, andrecommendations are made for how datasets should be handled.SLSTR-retrieved skin-SST agrees with theiQuam subsurface-SST, irrespective of region and time of measurement, within-0.17 +/- 0.04 K for all-day,-0.11 +/- 0.06 K for daytime, and-0.21 +/- 0.05 K for nighttime datasets, with respective rootmean square error (RMSE) values of 0.62 +/- 0.10, 0.58 +/- 0.09,and 0.65 +/- 0.13 K. These small differences are partly due tothe difference between ocean skin-temperature and subsurface-temperature, measurement uncertainties and sampling mismatch.Comprehensive validation carried out for SLSTR-retrieved SSThas direct implications for future validation studies and futureblended infrared, microwave, and in situ SST products.

TI  - PRISMA Spatial Resolution Enhancement by Fusion With Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article deals with the problem of improving the spatial resolution of hyperspectral (HS) data from the PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa (PRISMA) mission. For this purpose, higher spatial resolution data from the Sentinel-2 (S2) mission are exploited. Particularly, 10 S2 bands at 10 and 20 m spatial resolution are used to accomplish the PRISMA super-resolution (SR) task. The article presents a new end-to-end procedure, called PRISMA-SR, that starting from the S2 data and the low-resolution PRISMA image, provides a super-resolved image with a spatial resolution of 10 m and the same spectral resolution as the PRISMA HS sensor. The first step of the PRISMA-SR procedure consists in fusing S2 data at different spatial resolutions to obtain a synthetic MS image with 10 m spatial resolution and 10 spectral bands. Then, an unsupervised procedure is applied to coregister the fused S2 image and the PRISMA image. Finally, the two images at different spatial resolutions are properly combined in order to obtain the super-resolved HS image. Solutions for each step of the PRISMA-SR processing chain are proposed and discussed. Simulated data are used to show the effectiveness of the PRISMA-SR scheme and to investigate the impact on its performance of each step of the processing chain. Real S2 and PRISMA images are finally considered to provide an example of the application of the PRISMA-SR.

AB  - Efficient deforestation detection techniques are essential to monitor and control illegal logging, thus reducing forest loss and carbon emissions in the Amazon rainforest. Recent works based on Deep Learning (DL) models have been proposed for that purpose. DL-based methods, however, are known to require large amounts of training data to be properly trained. Moreover, the deforestation detection application is characterized by a high class imbalance, as recent deforestation areas usually represent a small fraction of the geographic extents being monitored. In order to produce a lightweight architecture in terms of the number of learnable parameters and address the high class imbalance of the deforestation detection application, we propose a DL model based on the GhostNet architecture, which combines Ghost modules in a fully convolutional architecture. The proposed architecture also includes Spatial Attention Mechanisms attached to the skip connections of the GhostNet in order to better capture the spatial relationships among class features. Experiments were carried out using Sentinel-2 images of a region in the Para ' state, Brazil, in the Amazon rainforest. The results obtained show that the proposed model achieves accuracy levels that are superior to those delivered by state-of-the-art DL architectures, with a lower computational cost due to the smaller number of learnable parameters.

TI  - A DEEP LEARNING APPROACH FOR CROP TYPE MAPPING BASED ON COMBINED TIME SERIES OF SATELLITE AND WEATHER DATA
T2  - XXIV ISPRS CONGRESS: IMAGING TODAY, FORESEEING TOMORROW, COMMISSION III
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 24th ISPRS Congress on Imaging Today, Foreseeing Tomorrow
CL  - Nice, FRANCE
AB  - Global Earth Monitor (GEM, Horizon 2020) takes advantage of the large volumes of available Earth Observation (EO), weather, climate and other non-EO data to establish economically viable continuous monitoring of the Earth. Within the GEM framework, the development of scalable and cost-effective solutions is being tested on several use-cases, with crop identification being one of them. Crop identification uses a combination of EO and weather data to enable automatic identification of crops. The use case supports operational decisions when managing crops and the monitoring of actual vs. planned or reported agricultural land use (e.g., Common Agricultural Policy monitoring). Satellite data and weather data come at very different temporal and spatial resolutions: Sentinel-2 constellation nominally provides an observation of a field every 5 days at 10 m spatial resolution, while weather data has continuous hourly time series at multi-km spatial resolution. We have designed ad-hoc routines to spatially aggregate satellite data at field level and to systematically compose layers of different time discretization series, so that each EO is associated with a complete time series (of opportune length) of weather variables at daily resolution. For each field, we extract the time series of the median over field pixels of Sentinel-2 L1C bands, cloud mask and cloud probability. For doing this we take advantage of Sentinel Hub's Statistical API (Sinergise, 2020), that enables the retrieval of statistics of band values and derived indices over a specified geographic area and time range. Using meteoblue dataset API (meteoblue, 2017), complete time series of daily weather data (NEMS4 model, meteoblue, 2008) are then associated to each field observation, following the systematic layer composition approach mentioned above. An opportune time series length is defined for each of the 17 weather variables we considered. To handle this kind of multi-dimensional layered data, we use a flexible encoding-decoding framework (FlexMod, designed by TUM as part of GEM project): multiple encoders are designed for features of different time length (namely EO data and weather variables) and are then passed to the decoder via a mediator Thanks to the flexible design of FlexMod framework, different models and architectures can be easily tested by simply defining new encoders and/or decoders. We present results obtained on a dataset in Slovenia, where crop fields are labelled according to a Hierarchical Crop and Agriculture Taxonomy (HCAT). This taxonomy, based on the EAGLE-Matrix and EU regulations, is the one adopted in the EuroCrops project (Schneider et al. 2021). The classification of field crops takes advantage of Sentinel-2 satellite data and Numerical Weather Prediction model output data. We exploit the potential of FlexMod to test different feature extractors, temporal encoding frameworks and decoders and we present a comparison between results obtained training a long-short term memory (LSTM) implementation (Breizhcrops, RuBwurm et al. 2020) and a Self-attention transformer model (Vaswani et al. 2017), the latter showing the best performances with accuracy 0.904 and Cohen's kappa 0.824.We moreover investigate the role of weather data by benchmarking results against those obtained with just satellite imagery. To better appraise the influence of the weather data we analyse how perturbing weather data in the testing dataset affects the final results. So far, we obtain in both cases very similar accuracies and Cohen's kappa. A deeper analysis of crop-specific scores (precision, recall, Fl) suggests that the training and testing datasets are too limited in terms of size and crop variability to draw any general conclusion over the role of weather. As future developments, once the EuroCrops datasets are ready, we plan to expand the training and testing dataset to cover a higher variability of climatological areas and increase the numerosity of the so far under-represented crops, in the attempt to draw more general conclusions around the influence of weather and the predictability of specific crop classes. Moreover, given the encouraging scores, we aim to perform crop type mapping at least at European scale, thanks to the availability of the EuroCrops data and the cost-effective big data solutions developed during GEM project.

TI  - Is the residual ash method applicable to tropical peatlands? A case study from Brunei Darussalam
T2  - MIRES AND PEAT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical peatlands in Southeast Asia are a significant carbon sink, but are under major threat of fire resulting in significant carbon emissions. This study focused on the residual ash method, which has not been applied before for a tropical peatland, to determine the amount of carbon lost due to fire along two transects. To evaluate the method in a tropical peatland, we sampled peat cores to a depth of 150 cm along two transects in a drainage-affected peatland in Brunei Darussalam and analysed Landsat images to determine burn count at individual sampling locations between 1988 and 2020. The ash residue method indicated that the carbon release from the two transects was 3.61 +/- 1.08 kg m(-2) and 3.77 +/- 0.80 kg m(-2) respectively due to peat decomposition and fire. However, our results show that although some locations burned up to five times, the expected ash content (of at least 4 %) was not found in the surface peat. Therefore, the majority of the resulting ash from these fires must have been transported out of the peatland, possibly in smoke or washed away via ground and surface water transport. We conclude that the residual ash method to determine carbon loss is not a reliable method to determine carbon loss in degraded tropical peatlands.

T2  - BULLETIN OF GEOGRAPHY-PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The drastic vegetation loss of about 22% in 12 years across agro-ecological zones (AEZs) in Nigeria, which can be attributed to the impact of climate and anthropogenic activities on vegetation dynamics within the context of socio-economics, calls for concern. In this study, remotely sensed data from the European Space Agency Land Use/Land Cover dataset, TAMSAT rainfall data, and MODIS NDVI dataset were used to examine changes in vegetation dynamics and monitor vegetation health in the AEZs based on the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The study showed that vegetation cover has been decreasing tremendously at an alarming rate in most of the zones, while different drivers (change agents) have been responsible for the losses. The analysis shows that, between 2003 and 2018, the forestland cover gained 9,768.88 km(2) and lost 40,891.6 km(2), with a total net decrease of 31,122.73 km(2). Contribution to the net change in forestland is usually converted to wetland, urban, cropland and grassland, across the varied ecosystem. The need for upto-date and accurate land-cover information is key to developing an appropriate mitigation strategy within the context of socio-economic sustainability across AEZs in Nigeria.

AB  - Night-time light (NTL) data has become widely used in different studies, including urbanization and light pollution subjects. Some sources of NTL data have made the data freely available on online platforms, making it easy to study subjects that relate to the use of artificial light at night. African countries have not published much on the use of NTL data. Still, there has been a development in different countries in the continent, such as economic growth and the provision of new and improved infrastructure. These developments can be considered primary contributors to the increase in light pollution worldwide. This study aimed at using NTL data together with familiar daytime data to assess how light pollution has been changing in eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality and again assess the changes in the sources of light pollution through the assessment of Land-use Land-cover (LULC) change of the study area. NTL images were reclassified into five different classes of light pollution using the reclassification tool in ArcMap 10.7. Supervised classification was performed to assess the changes in LULC. The confusion/error matrix was done to verify the accuracy of these classifications. These showed that light pollution is increasing in eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality, with the increased built-up area also being witnessed. NTL data is becoming useful worldwide, and it is highly recommended for African countries also to do research using this data in their studies

AB  - Seasonal variations result in hydrophytes and undrained hydric soil changes in wetland areas, which lead to a dynamic environment that makes wetland classification challenging. This study aims to explore the applicability of multi-seasonal Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) texture-derived features for object-based wetland classification over large-extent for the first time. We attempted to enhance the performance of the random forest classifier by incorporating multi-source remote sensing data, including Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1, Alos-Palsar, and topographic features. A total of 47 features were extracted from multi-source remote sensing data. In this context, we assessed the applicability of multi- versus mono-seasonal derived features for the wetland's classes with low within-class separability. We investigated the mean decrease in the Gini impurity index for each GLCM feature. We observed that including GLCM features enhanced overall accuracy by 7.38% when using imagery from one season and 4.21% for multi-season imagery. The multi-season scenario that included GLCM measures (93.49%) attained the highest overall accuracy. For this scenario, the means of decrease in Gini impurity index suggested that Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index, Modified Normalized Difference Water Index, slope, correlation in summer (GLCM feature), and Sentinel-1 VH are the most important features in increasing the random forest's classifier performance. In looking at the GLCM features, the separability analysis suggested that Entropy, Sum of Average, and Variance calculated from the summer imagery improve the classifier's performance while other textural features from spring imagery better contributed to classifier accuracy.

AB  - Satellite data fusion involves images with different spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution. These images are taken under different illumination conditions, with different sensors and atmospheric noise. We use classic super-resolution algorithms to synthesize commercial satellite images (Pleiades) from a public satellite source (Sentinel-2). Each super-resolution method is then further improved by adaptive sharpening to the location by use of matrix completion (regression with missing pixels). Finally, we consider ensemble systems and a residual channel attention dual network with stochastic dropout. The resulting systems are visibly less blurry with higher fidelity and yield improved performance.

AB  - This paper compared multi-temporal composite products of FY-3C VIRR and MODIS for regional land cover (LC) mapping of a part of Africa. LC classification was conducted using a random forest algorithm in the Scikit-Learn library of Python after the model was trained using reference data that were collected by combining three techniques and employed simultaneously i.e. Landsat 8 image interpretation, referring exiting maps, and crosschecking on Google Earth pro/ maps. Based on the overall accuracy (OA) and kappa value (k) the two instruments showed insignificant performance variation although FY-3C VIRR achieved slightly higher OA (.82) and k (.79) which are 1% higher than MODIS. However, the two instruments exhibited notable performance differences in discerning individual classes. The FY-3C data are generally better for vegetation classification; MODIS, whereas, classified built-up, bare/sparse-vegetation, and water bodies with better accuracy. Moreover, the incorporation of FY-3C thermal bands improved its accuracy significantly, by 3%.

AB  - In the present study relationship between shrimp catch per unit effort (CPUE) and satellite-based environmental parameters, chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and sea surface temperature (SST), was investigated in 27 stations in Bushehr provincial waters in the geographical position from E 50 degrees 44 ' and N 28 degrees 59 ' to E 51 degrees 40 ' and N 27 degrees 33 ', in July 2017 and July 2018. SST and Chl-a data were extracted from +ETM Landsat 7 sensor and Modis Aqua (EOS PM) satellites images. Four research surveys were conducted using a traditional vessel to record local physico-chemical parameters of water and estimate shrimp catch per unit effort (CPUE) in studied stations. The results of linear regression analysis and correlation coefficient showed a negative and strong relationship between SST-Chl-a overlap value and shrimp CPUE in waters of Bushehr province (r =-0.84), while weak negative and positive relationships were observed between SST and chlorophyll-a with shrimp CPUE with r =-0.34 and 0.03, respectively.

AB  - This study explores the potential use of integrated radar and optical freely and open access distributed satellite images, namely the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, respectively, to detect areas with archaeological interest. The Google Earth Engine platform was used to extract the backscattering signal from the Sentinel-1 sensor and the reflectance values from the spectral bands of Sentinel-2. A new image composite was produced over the Thessalian plain in central Greece and then imported into the ArcGIS Pro environment. The Support Vector Machine, Random Forest and Maximum Likelihood classifiers have been applied to identify areas that share similar radar and spectral profiles as other known sites. The overall findings indicate that despite the limited training sample used, the combined signal from both Sentinel sensors could detect up to 60% of the known sites.

AB  - This paper deals with the identification of BIFs and associated sulphide mineralisation. An integrated approach, including the use of Landsat ETM-plus and Cartosat DEM data, GIS analysis, and geological data, is adopted for this purpose in the Nagavi area of Gadag Schist Belt (GSB), India. This integrated approach has enabled in identifying BIFs and structures. Band-7 of the ETMplus sensor of Landsat-7 is used to identify BIFs and Band-5 for lineaments and shear zones. As a result of this study, the presence of gold mineralisation in sheared zones is noticed. BIFs are the economically prominent litho-units in the GSB hosting high-grade iron ore deposits along with sulphide mineralised shear zones. The strata bound ore is hosted primarily by BIF, consisting of chlorite, alternating chert and magnetite, sulphides and carbonate bands of a millimetre to centimetre scale.

TI  - COMPUTER SIMULATIONS AS FICTION IN SCIENCE
T2  - BALKAN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The present paper intends to show that computer simulations used in science are akin to fiction. Starting from the problem of defining computer simulation, the paper discusses the uses and disadvantages of simulations in science. Computer simulations have a representational function, but they do not resemble the phenomena that they purport to represent. Computer simulations do not preserve the content of the models, input data, and theories from which they proceed, since the content is modified by computational processes. Because of the complexities of these processes, we cannot control or test the methods used to process the content of computer simulations. Still, simulations may help to explain the behaviour of a possible aspect of the phenomenon under examination. Although their role in doing so may be limited, by conforming to and immersing us in the worldview of science, simulations, thus reinforce the intuitions of the existing body of scientific knowledge, and similarly to the "believable fiction" described by John Woods, provide genuine understanding.

AB  - The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a useful index for vegetation monitoring. However, due to cloud cover the observations of NDVI are discrete and vary in the intensity. Therefore, there is a need to estimate the NDVI during cloud cover using alternative sources of satellite observations. The main objective of this study is to estimate NDVI during cloudy conditions using moderate resolution multi-spectral and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations. Two approaches were identified: 1) pixel replacement and 2) machine learning based regression analysis to estimate cloud free NDVI. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 8-day NDVI composite, Sentinel-1 SAR and cloud masked Sentinel-2 multi-spectral observations were collected for entire cropping season. The satellite observations were selected only for agricultural areas by applying the agriculture, non-agriculture land use land cover mask. Machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression (LR), Random Forest Regression (RFR), and Support Vector Regression (SVR) were used for NDVI estimation. Regression analysis was performed using Sentinel-2 NDVI as an independent variable and VV, VH, Cross Ratio (i.e., VV/VH), and MODIS NDVI as dependent variables. NDVI of the cloudy pixel was estimated using the trained regression models over the agriculture areas. A regression model was trained and applied to each Sentinel-2 tile that covers an area of 100 km x 100 km. The RFR and SVR showed the highest R-2 of 0.73 and a RMSE of 0.12. A visual comparison of time series graphs showed good alignment between actual (Sentinel-2) and predicted NDVI and usual crop growth trend.

AB  - WorldView-3's 0.31m resolution in panchromatic mode, makes it one of the highest resolution commercial satellite in the world. This fact, together with its excellent stereo capabilities, make this satellite ideal for digital surface model (DSM) extraction working on very complex morphologies where a higher level of detail is required. In this communication we assess the quality (both completeness and vertical accuracy) of DSM extracted from WorldView-3 stereo pairs depending on the image geometry and sun position. Three different land covers (bare soil, urban areas and agricultural plastic greenhouses) have been tested in the Southeast of Spain (Almeria). The well-known semiglobal matching (SGM) algorithm was used for all the extracted DSM. A clear relationship between DSM completeness and the WorldView-3 stereo pair imaging geometry measured as convergence angle was found. The completeness values decreased as convergence angles increased, especially in complex reliefs. In fact, convergence angles lower than 16 degrees is recommended when working on urban or greenhouse land covers. Moreover, sun light can cause glint effect in greenhouse areas. In this land cover, the attained results suggest to use stereo pairs taken when the sun presented a very low elevation. In Almeria, the last happens in winter. The best results in all the tested land covers can be obtained by fusing DSM extracted from more than one stereo pair.

AB  - The legend of Kitezh directly influenced Russian culture for over 100 years from the mid 19th century to the mid 20th century, and has survived in the consciousness of Russian people to this day. The question that naturally arises here is following: What kind of content and form did the currently remaining text of the legend of Kitezh have. The analysis of this text will not only show the prototype of the legend of Kitezh, but will also serve as a basis for tracking the changes in the legend. The <Legend of Kitezh> that we analyze was born from a folk oral legend, in which prince Georgii Psevolodovich plays as a main character, who was killed in the battle against the Mongol army.  Prince Georigii, the founder of cities, churches, and monasteries, who fought for the people, remained a local cult in the areas, including lake Svetloyar.  The legend of Kitezh went through revisions by the old believers and became the present <Legend of Kitezh>, and undergoing this process, the old believers’ eschatological worldview and religious view were reflected in the text.

Therefore, teaching-learning methods should also be operated in a way that can improve competency. This study is a case study that developed a competency-based teaching and learning model for core competency-based curriculum operation at K University. In particular, in this study, previous studies were analyzed according to the 「Biblical Worldview」 competency and 「Transformational Leadership」 competency among the core competencies of K University, and And, after deriving appropriate teaching and learning methods, a teaching and learning model that can improve the relevant competency was derived through Delphi research.

TI  - Detectability and impact of repetitive surveys on threatened West African crocodylians: Data M1
T2  - Zenodo
M3  - Software
AB  - West African crocodylians are among the most threatened and least studied crocodylian species globally. Assessing population status and establishing a basis for population monitoring is the highest priority action for this region. Monitoring of crocodiles is influenced by many factors that affect detectability, including environmental variables and individual or population-level wariness. We investigated how these factors affect detectability and counts of the Critically Endangered Mecistops cataphractus and the newly recognized Crocodylus suchus. We implemented 195 repetitive surveys at 38 sites across Cote d'Ivoire between 2014 and 2019. We used an occupancy-based approach and a count-based GLMM analysis to determine the effect of environmental and anthropogenic variables on detection, and modeled crocodile wariness over repetitive surveys. Despite their rarity and level of threat, detection probability of both species was relatively high (0.75 for M. cataphractus and 0.81 for C. suchus), but a minimum of two surveys was required to infer absence of either species with 90% confidence. We found that detection of M. cataphractus was significantly negatively influenced by fishing net encounter rate, while high temperature for the previous 48h of the day of the survey increased C. suchus detection. Precipitation and aquatic vegetation had significant negative and positive influence, respectively, on M. cataphractus counts and showed the opposite effect for C. suchus counts. We also found that fishing encounter rate had a significant negative effect on C. suchus counts. Interestingly, survey repetition did not generally affect wariness for either species, though there was some indication that at least C. suchus was more wary by the fourth replicate. These results are informative for designing future survey and monitoring protocols for these threatened crocodylians in West Africa, and for other endangered crocodylians globally. There are misssing values on the dataset and I included the code used for imputed them.

We sampled 38 sites across the major ecoregions of the country, which are representative of those of West Africa: Guinean forest (50% of the country), the Sudano-Guinean zone (19% of the country), and the Sudanian region (31% of the country). We surveyed crocodiles predominantly during the dry season to increase detection rates (Fukuda et al., 2013). We conducted standard nocturnal spotlight surveys (Chabreck 1966) from an inflatable, outboard-powered boat with 15 hp engine at a cruising speed of about 5.0 - 6.0 km/h, by inflatable kayak, and/or on foot. A single observer conducted all surveys, who located crocodiles by their eyeshine using either a 78 lumen LED headlamp (80% of observations) or a 550 lumen LED spotlight (20% of observations), depending on the habitat , and approached individuals as close as possible to visually determine species and demographic class (i.e., by total length, TL). We classified crocodiles that submerged before species and total length could be determined as eyes only (EO). We tracked all survey routes and took waypoints for each crocodile sighting using a handheld GPS. we surveyed each site on three (from 2014 to middle 2016) or five (end of 2016 to 2019) consecutive nights. We surveyed a minimum survey distance of 10 km at each site on each occasion. Environmental variables_We examined the influence of 10 environmental and anthropogenic variables that were previously shown to have significant influence on crocodile detection probability and are relevant to our study species and habitat. We measured six of these variables in the field before or during each survey: moon phase (0 - 4), wave height and wind speed (0 - 3), precipitation the day prior to the survey (0, 1), the amount of vegetation present along the shoreline and fishing net encounter rate. We used a binary index of low or high vegetation where low vegetation denotes a visible shoreline with little to no overhanging vegetation and high aquatic vegetation denotes a shoreline completely covered by overhanging or aquatic vegetation (Gardner et al., 2016). We counted the number of fishing nets seen on the survey as an index of the subsistence fishing threat (Shirley et al., 2009). We assessed mean night air temperature and mean daily precipitation both on the day of the survey and for the previous 48 h from remote sensed data accessed through MODIS (Wan et al., 2015) and CHIRPS (Funk et al., 2015), respectively. Prior to further analysis, we standardized all continuous covariates and tested for multi-collinearity among independent variables using the VIF function in the R package car (John et al., 2020). We found evidence of collinearity for wind speed with wave height, and mean night air temperature the day of the survey with mean night temperature for the previous 48h. Wave height is often correlated with wind speed (Woodward and Marion, 1978) and generally not significant in the small river systems where we surveyed, so we removed wave height from subsequent models. Likewise, we retained mean night temperature for the previous 48h over mean night air temperature the day of the survey because of its more significant individual effect in subsequent models (Couturier et al., 2013). We conducted all subsequent analyses for each species independently. Influence of environmental and anthropogenic variables on detection probability.We assessed the influence of environmental and anthropogenic variables on crocodile detection probability using both an occupancy framework and with linear mixed models. For both model types we included all data from all surveys in all years, though treated missing data for repetitions four and five in years 2014 to mid 2016 differently. We categorized missing values as NA in occupancy models, but used imputation methods to infer missing values in GLMM analyses (see below; Nakagawa and Freckleton, 2008). Within the occupancy framework, we used a single season occupancy model to estimate detection probabilities (p) (MacKenzie et al., 2006). To do this, we created a detection history (0 = non detection, 1 = detection) for each site across all the survey repetitions. For this analysis, we hypothesized that the populations were closed during the survey period, no heterogeneity in detection occurred, and the detection process was independent at each site (MacKenzie et al., 2002). We used the method of "plausible combination" (Bromaghin et al., 2013) for model selection and covariate evaluation, which is increasingly recognized as a robust multi-stage strategy to assess the fit of single season occupancy models (Morin et al., 2020). To derive detection probability, and better understand the influence of covariates on detection, we paired the most general sub-model for occupancy (psi) with all candidate sub-models for detection probability (p) using the dredge function in the package MuMin (Barton, 2020) and returned the best model (i.e., ∆AIC threshold of 0) (Morin et al., 2020). Ultimately, we assessed all combinations of the best detection covariates. Because our focus was exclusively on detection probability, we held occupancy constant in the final analysis (i.e., (psi.)p[covariate]) (Kroll et al., 2008; Moreira et al., 2016; Phumanee et al., 2020), a standard practice when focused on one component, or the other, in occupancy-based analyses (Cook et al., 2011; Jeffress et al., 2011; Wagner et al., 2019). We ranked models using Akaike's Information Criterion corrected for small sample size (AICc) and considered all models with ∆AICc ≤ 2 to be competitive models (Burnham and Anderson, 2002). We considered a covariate significant if the 95% CI did not include zero (Bauder et al., 2017). We conducted all analyses using the packages unmarked (Fiske et al., 2017) and AlCcmodavg (Mazerolle, 2015) in R v4.0.2 (R Development core team, 2020). For GLMM analysis, as our surveys varied from three to five replicates, we replaced missing values (8.57% of the total dataset) in all sites with less than five replicates using a multiple imputation procedure (Nakagawa and Freckleton, 2008). Specifically, we used multiple imputation to fill in 18 (of 210; 8.6%) missing values for each of crocodile encounter rate, moon phase, wind speed, amount of aquatic vegetation, fishing net encounter rate, and precipitation the day prior to the survey. We generated and combined 100 imputed datasets (Graham et al., 2007) using the R package mice (Buuren and Groothuis-Oudshoorn, 2011). After imputation, we determined whether the MICE algorithm has converged by plotting parameters against the iteration number and found no definite trends, indicating good convergence in the dataset including imputed values (Buuren and Groothuis-Oudshoorn, 2011). We modeled crocodile counts using the lmer function in the lme4 package (Bates et al., 2015). We tested the same eight covariates included in the occupancy analysis as fixed effects with site as a random effect. We fit 256 combinations for each species, including the null and global models, without interaction terms and ranked models by AICc. We considered all models with ∆AICc ≤ 2 to be competitive models (Burnham and Anderson, 2002). We obtained model-averaged coefficients using the Model.avg function in MuMin. For each coefficient, we report associate 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and the coefficient estimate with shrinkage (also called "zero method"). We considered a covariate significant if the 95% CI did not include zero (Bauder et al., 2017). Effect of repetitive surveys on crocodile wariness.-We used proportion of "EO" and zero detections across repeated surveys as indexes to examine the effect of repetitive surveys on crocodile wariness. We considered that a progressive reduction in the number of individuals seen or formally identified (i.e., increase in the number of "EO") during surveys to be a reflection of an increase in wariness. For each site where the presence of each crocodile species was confirmed, we determined the proportion of observations that were EO (EO/number of all observations) for each survey, where 0.0 represented no wariness and 1.0 (represented by either 100% EO observations or zero detections) represented complete wariness. For sites where the two studied species were sympatric, we partitioned the EO observations by the ratio of the number of individuals actually attributable to either species. Because our surveys varied from three to five replicates, we used multiple imputation as described above to estimate missing values for the following covariates: index of wariness, aquatic vegetation, fishing net encounter rate, and crocodile abundance for both species, resulting in 10.9% and 7.14% values derived from MI for M. cataphractus and C. suchus, respectively. We assessed crocodile wariness as a function of the survey replicate, the most important covariates for each species identified in both occupancy and count-based GLMM analyses above, and crocodile encounter rate as an index of abundance. We included encounter rate because we hypothesized that population abundance may represent unmeasured disturbance effects on individual wariness (i.e., for rare species, higher abundance sites likely have less impacted or threatened population histories, which may capture unmeasured/unmeasurable histories of disturbance or harassment of individuals). The M. cataphractus model included survey repetition, abundance, fishing net encounter rate, moon phase, precipitation the day of the survey and for the previous 48h, and aquatic vegetation as fixed factors. The model for C. suchus included survey repetition, abundance, and temperature for the previous 48h of the day of the survey and aquatic vegetation as fixed factors. Both species models included site as a random effect. We used generalized linear mixed effects modelling, fit by restricted maximum likelihood, using the package lme4 (Bates et al., 2015) and Satterthawaite's approximation from package lmerTest (Kuznetsova et al., 2017) to assess each factor's significance in R v4.0.2 (R Development core team, 2020).

TI  - Detectability and impact of repetitive surveys on threatened West African crocodylians: Data M1
T2  - Zenodo
M3  - Software
AB  - West African crocodylians are among the most threatened and least studied crocodylian species globally. Assessing population status and establishing a basis for population monitoring is the highest priority action for this region. Monitoring of crocodiles is influenced by many factors that affect detectability, including environmental variables and individual or population-level wariness. We investigated how these factors affect detectability and counts of the Critically Endangered Mecistops cataphractus and the newly recognized Crocodylus suchus. We implemented 195 repetitive surveys at 38 sites across Cote d'Ivoire between 2014 and 2019. We used an occupancy-based approach and a count-based GLMM analysis to determine the effect of environmental and anthropogenic variables on detection, and modeled crocodile wariness over repetitive surveys. Despite their rarity and level of threat, detection probability of both species was relatively high (0.75 for M. cataphractus and 0.81 for C. suchus), but a minimum of two surveys was required to infer absence of either species with 90% confidence. We found that detection of M. cataphractus was significantly negatively influenced by fishing net encounter rate, while high temperature for the previous 48h of the day of the survey increased C. suchus detection. Precipitation and aquatic vegetation had significant negative and positive influence, respectively, on M. cataphractus counts and showed the opposite effect for C. suchus counts. We also found that fishing encounter rate had a significant negative effect on C. suchus counts. Interestingly, survey repetition did not generally affect wariness for either species, though there was some indication that at least C. suchus was more wary by the fourth replicate. These results are informative for designing future survey and monitoring protocols for these threatened crocodylians in West Africa, and for other endangered crocodylians globally. There are misssing values on the dataset and I included the code used for imputed them.

We sampled 38 sites across the major ecoregions of the country, which are representative of those of West Africa: Guinean forest (50% of the country), the Sudano-Guinean zone (19% of the country), and the Sudanian region (31% of the country). We surveyed crocodiles predominantly during the dry season to increase detection rates (Fukuda et al., 2013). We conducted standard nocturnal spotlight surveys (Chabreck 1966) from an inflatable, outboard-powered boat with 15 hp engine at a cruising speed of about 5.0 - 6.0 km/h, by inflatable kayak, and/or on foot. A single observer conducted all surveys, who located crocodiles by their eyeshine using either a 78 lumen LED headlamp (80% of observations) or a 550 lumen LED spotlight (20% of observations), depending on the habitat , and approached individuals as close as possible to visually determine species and demographic class (i.e., by total length, TL). We classified crocodiles that submerged before species and total length could be determined as eyes only (EO). We tracked all survey routes and took waypoints for each crocodile sighting using a handheld GPS. we surveyed each site on three (from 2014 to middle 2016) or five (end of 2016 to 2019) consecutive nights. We surveyed a minimum survey distance of 10 km at each site on each occasion. Environmental variables_We examined the influence of 10 environmental and anthropogenic variables that were previously shown to have significant influence on crocodile detection probability and are relevant to our study species and habitat. We measured six of these variables in the field before or during each survey: moon phase (0 - 4), wave height and wind speed (0 - 3), precipitation the day prior to the survey (0, 1), the amount of vegetation present along the shoreline and fishing net encounter rate. We used a binary index of low or high vegetation where low vegetation denotes a visible shoreline with little to no overhanging vegetation and high aquatic vegetation denotes a shoreline completely covered by overhanging or aquatic vegetation (Gardner et al., 2016). We counted the number of fishing nets seen on the survey as an index of the subsistence fishing threat (Shirley et al., 2009). We assessed mean night air temperature and mean daily precipitation both on the day of the survey and for the previous 48 h from remote sensed data accessed through MODIS (Wan et al., 2015) and CHIRPS (Funk et al., 2015), respectively. Prior to further analysis, we standardized all continuous covariates and tested for multi-collinearity among independent variables using the VIF function in the R package car (John et al., 2020). We found evidence of collinearity for wind speed with wave height, and mean night air temperature the day of the survey with mean night temperature for the previous 48h. Wave height is often correlated with wind speed (Woodward and Marion, 1978) and generally not significant in the small river systems where we surveyed, so we removed wave height from subsequent models. Likewise, we retained mean night temperature for the previous 48h over mean night air temperature the day of the survey because of its more significant individual effect in subsequent models (Couturier et al., 2013). We conducted all subsequent analyses for each species independently. Influence of environmental and anthropogenic variables on detection probability.We assessed the influence of environmental and anthropogenic variables on crocodile detection probability using both an occupancy framework and with linear mixed models. For both model types we included all data from all surveys in all years, though treated missing data for repetitions four and five in years 2014 to mid 2016 differently. We categorized missing values as NA in occupancy models, but used imputation methods to infer missing values in GLMM analyses (see below; Nakagawa and Freckleton, 2008). Within the occupancy framework, we used a single season occupancy model to estimate detection probabilities (p) (MacKenzie et al., 2006). To do this, we created a detection history (0 = non detection, 1 = detection) for each site across all the survey repetitions. For this analysis, we hypothesized that the populations were closed during the survey period, no heterogeneity in detection occurred, and the detection process was independent at each site (MacKenzie et al., 2002). We used the method of "plausible combination" (Bromaghin et al., 2013) for model selection and covariate evaluation, which is increasingly recognized as a robust multi-stage strategy to assess the fit of single season occupancy models (Morin et al., 2020). To derive detection probability, and better understand the influence of covariates on detection, we paired the most general sub-model for occupancy (psi) with all candidate sub-models for detection probability (p) using the dredge function in the package MuMin (Barton, 2020) and returned the best model (i.e., ∆AIC threshold of 0) (Morin et al., 2020). Ultimately, we assessed all combinations of the best detection covariates. Because our focus was exclusively on detection probability, we held occupancy constant in the final analysis (i.e., (psi.)p[covariate]) (Kroll et al., 2008; Moreira et al., 2016; Phumanee et al., 2020), a standard practice when focused on one component, or the other, in occupancy-based analyses (Cook et al., 2011; Jeffress et al., 2011; Wagner et al., 2019). We ranked models using Akaike's Information Criterion corrected for small sample size (AICc) and considered all models with ∆AICc ≤ 2 to be competitive models (Burnham and Anderson, 2002).

TI  - COMPARISON OF DEEP LEARNING MODELS FOR CORN DISEASE REGION LOCATION, IDENTIFICATION OF DISEASE TYPE, AND SEVERITY ESTIMATION USING IMAGES ACQUIRED FROM UAS-MOUNTED AND HANDHELD SENSORS
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ASABE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately locating diseased regions, identifying disease types, and estimating disease severity in corn fields are all connected steps for developing an effective disease management system. Traditional disease management that relied on a manual scouting approach was inefficient. Therefore, the research community is working on developing advanced disease management systems using deep learning. However, most of the past studies used public datasets consisting of images with uniform backgrounds acquired under lab conditions to train deep learning models, thus, limiting their use under field conditions. In addition, limited studies have been conducted for in-field corn disease analysis using Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) imagery. Therefore, UAS and handheld imagery sensors were used in this study to acquire corn disease images from fields located at Purdue University's Agronomy Center for Research and Education (ACRE) in the summer of 2020. A total of 55 UAS flights were conducted over three different corn fields from June 20 through September 29, resulting in a collection of approximately 59,000 images. A novel three-stage approach was proposed by independently training a total of nine image classification models using three neural network architectures, namely: VGG16, ResNet50, and Incep-tionV3, for locating diseased regions, identifying disease types, and estimating disease severity under field conditions. Dis-eased regions were first identified accurately in UAS-acquired corn field imagery by a sliding window and deep learning -based image classification, with testing accuracies of up to 97.23%. Diseased region identification was followed by accu-rately identifying three common corn diseases, namely Northern Leaf Blight (NLB), Gray Leaf Spot (GLS), and Northern Leaf Spot (NLS), within the diseased regions with testing accuracies of up to 98.85%. Finally, the severity of the NLS disease on leaves was estimated with a testing accuracy of up to 94.20%. The VGG16 model achieved the highest testing accuracies for identifying diseased regions in corn fields, identifying corn disease types, and estimating NLS's severity. This study presents promising results for three main elements of a disease management system and could advance traditional scouting by integrating deep learning with UAS imagery.

T2  - REIDOCREA-REVISTA EECTRONICA DE INVESTIGACION Y DOCENCIA CREATIVA
M3  - Article
AB  - Agriculture is facing several challenges such as climate change, drought, and loss of fertile land, which could compromise global food safety and security. In this scenario, integration of novel technologies into agriculture could be the possible solution to address these concerns. There are several modern technology tools that can be integrated into agriculture for this purpose. Agricultural remote sensing (RS) technology, being one of the promising tools, has long been used for agriculture, but its potential has not been explored fully. RS involves monitoring and analysis of various crop growth parameters generating huge datasets. But management and interpretation of RS generated data is a complex and costly process. Therefore, artificial intelligence (AI), another promising tool of 5th industrial era, could be used to complement agricultural RS technology to improve data processing and generating visualizing results. Machine learning, a subset of AI, methods have been efficiently employed for disease detection, yield predictions, and biomass estimations. Yet, there remains a huge possibility to develop crop growth and yield simulations, and machine training models from the freely available satellite data. Hence, indicating and instilling this knowledge into young students would result in the novel initiatives in agricultural plant physiology, since most of the parameters analyzed through RS are physiological.

TI  - Effect of Locust Invasion and Mitigation Using Remote Sensing Techniques: A Case Study of North Sindh Pakistan
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study comprises the identification of the locust outbreak that happened in February 2020. It is not possible to conduct ground-based surveys to monitor such huge disasters in a timely and adequate manner. Therefore, we used a combination of automatic and manual remote sensing data processing techniques to find out the aftereffects of locust attack effectively. We processed MODIS-normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) manually on ENVI and Landsat 8 NDVI using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. We found from the results that, (a) NDVI computation on GEE is more effective, prompt, and reliable compared with the results of manual NDVI computations; (b) there is a high effect of locust disasters in the northern part of Sindh, Thul, Ghari Khairo, Garhi Yaseen, facobabad, and Mauro, which are more vulnerable; and (c) NDVI value suddenly decreased to 0.68 from 0.92 in 2020 using Landsat NDVI and from 0.81 to 0.65 using MODIS satellite imagery. Results clearly indicate an abrupt decrease in vegetation in 2020 due to a locust disaster. That is a big threat to crop yield and food production because it provides a major portion of food chain and gross domestic product for Sindh, Pakistan.

Due to low incidence rate, there is a current lack of established diagnostic and management practices. Here, we provide a review of the current epidemiology, classification, diagnosis, and treatment of male breast cancer. We present a rare case of mucinous breast cancer in a 74-year-old male patient detected after he presented with a retroareolar mass. The patient underwent mammography, targeted ultrasound, and ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy, which established the diagnosis. He was treated surgically with left mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy with axillary lymph node dissection, followed by post-adjuvant tamoxifen and has remained free of recurrence and metastasis since.

AB  - AIM: To evaluate the local dermo-glandular flap as a new reconstructive oncoplastic technique after removal of central malignant tumors of the breast, in terms of patient satisfaction and local recurrence.PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included 60 females with centrally located breast cancer who underwent central quadrantectomy and local dermo-glandular flap with either sentinel lymph node biopsy or axillary clearance.RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 49.68 ± 8.52 years. The duration of the operation ranged from 68-105 minutes, with a mean of 79.77 ± 9.41 minutes. Local recurrence was observed in three patients (5.00%) with no distant metastasis. Forty-seven patients (78.33%) reported satisfaction after the operation. Ugly scarring and the existence of tissue defects were the main factors affecting patient satisfaction. Correction of these complications increased overall satisfaction to 88.33%.CONCLUSIONS: For small- and medium-sized breasts, the use of a local dermo-glandular flap for the management of centrally located malignant tumors seems to be a simple and easy technique with good oncological outcomes and acceptable few minor complications. This technique offers an immediate reconstruction of a new areola with fewer scars that will be hidden later after areola tattooing. Most of the patients reported satisfaction three months after areola reconstruction.

AB  - Forests can be affected by wildfire in the form of primary damage (direct burn) and secondary damage(indirect withering). The distribution of the primary and secondary damages can change according to the elapsed time after a wildfire. This paper examined the method to analyze the temporal change of the damaged areas by wildfire. We proposed a time-series cluster analysis to categorize the wildfire-damaged areas in terms of the temporal change characteristics. A case study of the Kangwon fire in March 2022 shows that the damaged areas were divided into several categories, and three out of the nine groups were affected by the secondary damage. The time-series cluster map can provide information about the areas of the severe damage right after the wildfire and the subsequent damage one or more months later.

AB  - This thesis is the analysis and translation of two Chinese drifting records in Jiyoungnok(1696) written by Iktae Lee(1633-1704), a pastor of Jeju in the 17th century. Jiyoungnok, National Treasure No. 2002, is evaluated as the first comprehensive humanities geography of Jeju. The structure of Jiyoungnok is largely divided into two parts; the first half contains Lee's journey from May, 1694, to November, 1695, to become a pastor of Jeju, the creation and reconstruction of major institutions and facilities during his tenure, and his selection of ten scenic views of Jeju, and his achievements. In the second half contains 14 major drifting related records occurred in Jeju from the era of King Hyojong to King Sukjong(1652-1693), before Lee took office.There are a total of eight Chinese drifting records in the second half, and the second and sixth are translated. These two records, respectively represented by Yinguan Lin and Ziyuan Yang, provide three interesting contrasts. First, in conjunction with the situation in China’s politics at the time, we can see the changed self-consciousness as a Chinese. The former who embarked Jeju in 1652, claimed to be refugees from Southern Ming, sparked a debate over the Pro-Ming and Anti-Qing thought in Joseon. On the other hand, the latter of 1688 claimed that he was a merchant with official permission from the Qing Dynasty. Second, it is possible to see the change in the repatriation procedure of drifting people due to the reorganization of political order in East Asia. Lin and his colleagues were transported to Beijing via land, while Yang’s merchant group was released to the sea. Third, if the former provides information on the typical style of interrogation system and procedure regarding drifting people, East Asian political situations, and trade materials, the latter informs of rituals and folk marine culture customs through three long essays submitted by drifting people.

M3  - research-article
AB  - 21st century missions should focus on transforming worldviews.However, the question still arises, “What kind of Christian worldview should be presented in the mission fields?” Is the Christian worldview that we present in the mission fields culture-free, unaffected by cultural or social contexts? The Christian worldview that reflects the order-centered thinking of Westerners has its own persuasive power to Westerners.However, the “Christian worldview” formed in the West is not free from the Western culture. From a missional point of view, the Christian worldview cannot succeed in transforming culture and bringing about spiritual maturity unless it is culturally contextualized. Therefore, I would like to explain the Christian worldview anew from the point of view of honor-shame and relationship-centered culture.All creatures in the universe were supposed to worship, praise, give thanks, and glorify God in the right relationship as clients of God, the Supreme Patron. God created human beings in His image and gave them honor accordingly. Man was supposed to honor God by faithfully fulfilling his mission to rule the earth in a right relationship with God. However, human beings have committed the sin of ungrateful treason to have glory on an equal footing with God, and thus have guilt and shame, and have been reduced to beings following the worldly system of false shame and vain honor. He was unable to establish a right relationship with God and with fellow humans and other creatures. Through the atonement and resurrection of Jesus Christ, God re-opened the way for us to restore our relationship with God and restore the honorable image of God. Humans who have restored their relationship with God must now abandon the worldly view of honor and shame and establish a view of them from the kingdom of God in order to live a life that honors God by giving thanks for the grace of God, the Patron.

TI  - Comparison of Classification Algorithms for Detecting Typical Coastal Reclamation in Guangdong Province with Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal reclamation in Guangdong Province is highly concentrated and is growing rapidly. However, intensive reclamation use has resulted in serious influence on the coastal ecosystem, directly and indirectly. The current conditions and spatial distribution of reclamations must be detected for coastal preservation and management using efficient technology. This study aims to find a suitable method and data to map reclamations accurately at a large scale. Pixel-based and object-oriented classification methods were applied in extracting the three typical types of coastal reclamation, namely, ports, aquaculture ponds, and salt pans, in Guangdong Province from Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 images. The algorithms of a support vector machine, random forest, decision tree, and rule-based algorithm were performed. Classification results were compared with statistical measures to assess the performance of different algorithms. The results indicated that all of the algorithms could obtain classification results with high accuracy, whereas the object-oriented algorithm showed less efficiency than other algorithms in classifying ports with complicated features. High-resolution data were not always superior to lower-resolution data in the reclamation classification. Generally speaking, applying the rule-based object-oriented algorithm in Sentinel 2A MSI images is relatively efficient at detecting the reclamation use in coastal Guangdong considering its actual situation. The mapping of reclamations in the whole of coastal Guangdong shows that they present obvious agglomeration characteristics in the space. The aquaculture ponds are mainly distributed in the coastal zones of western Guangdong and eastern Guangdong, with the largest area of 77,963 ha. The other types of ports are mainly distributed in the coastal zones of the Pearl River Delta, with an area of 8146 ha, while salt pans are mainly distributed in the coastal zones of Jiangmen, Zhuhai, and Zhongshan, with a total area of 4072 ha. The results can provide key supporting data for decision making in coastal management and preservation.

TI  - Dynamic Landscape Fragmentation and the Driving Forces on Haitan Island, China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Island ecosystems have distinct and unique vulnerabilities that place them at risk from threats to their ecology and socioeconomics. Spatially exhibiting the fragmentation process of island landscapes and identifying their driving factors are the fundamental prerequisites for the maintenance of island ecosystems and the rational utilization of islands. Haitan Island was chosen as a case study for understanding landscape fragmentation on urbanizing Islands. Based on remote sensing technology, three Landsat images from 2000 to 2020, landscape pattern index, transect gradient analysis, and moving window method were used in this study. The results showed that from 2000 to 2020, impervious land increased by 462.57%. In 2000, the predominant landscape was cropland (46.34%), which shifted to impervious land (35.20%) and forest (32.90%) in 2020. Combining the moving window method and Semivariogram, 1050 m was considered to be the best scale to reflect the landscape fragmentation of Haitan Island. Under this scale, it was found that the landscape fragmentation of Haitan Island generally increased with time and had obvious spatial heterogeneity. We set up sampling bands along the coastline and found that the degree of landscape fragmentation, advancing from the coast inland, was decreasing. Transects analysis showed the fragmentation intensity of the coastal zone: the north-western and southern wooded zones decreased, while the concentration of urban farmland in the north-central and southern areas increased. The implementation of a comprehensive experimental area plan on Haitan Island has disturbed the landscape considerably. In 2000, landscape fragmentation was mainly influenced by topography and agricultural production. The critical infrastructure construction, reclamation and development of landscape resources have greatly contributed to the urbanisation and tourism of Haitan Island, and landscape fragmentation in 2013 was at its highest. Due to China's "Grain for Green Project" and the Comprehensive Territorial Spatial Planning policy (especially the protection of ecological control lines), the fragmentation of Haitan Island was slowing. This study investigated the optimal spatial scale for analyzing spatiotemporal changes in landscape fragmentation on Haitan Island from 2000 to 2020, and the essential influencing factors in urban islands from the perspective of natural environment and social development, which could provide a basis for land use management and ecological planning on the island.

TI  - The sensitivity and specificity of methylene blue dye as a single agent in sentinel lymph node biopsy for early breast cancer.
T2  - The Medical journal of Malaysia
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), although associated with significant morbidity, has been the standard procedure for axillary staging for breast cancer in many hospitals in Malaysia. The limited resources for radioisotope tracer and nuclear medicine service, coupled with insufficient number of trained surgeons, have been the major obstacles to perform sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB).MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study looks into the application of 1% methylene blue dye (MBD) as a single agent for SLNB and observes the outcome and any associated complication. Thirty-four patients with early breast cancer were enrolled. Two millilitres (ml) of 1% MBD was diluted with saline to a total volume of 5 ml. After induction of general anaesthesia, 3 ml of the diluted 1% MBD is injected subdermally at the upper outer quadrant of the breast followed by 5 minutes of massage. Sentinel nodes are identified as blue nodes or lymph nodes with a blue-stained lymphatic channel and were surgically removed. All patients then underwent tumour excision, either mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery, and ALND. The sentinel nodes were categorized to positive or negative for metastases and were compared with axillary lymph nodes for diagnostic value assessment.RESULTS: Identification rate of sentinel nodes was 91.2%. The mean number of removed sentinel nodes was 2 (SD=1) and the mean number of axillary nodes was 16 (SD=6). Sentinel node metastasis was found in 13 (41.9%) cases. There were two false-negative cases, resulting in a sensitivity of 86.7% (95%CI: 62.1-96.3). The negative predictive value of sentinel nodes to predict axillary metastasis was 88.9% (95%CI: 67.2- 96.9). There were no complications observed.CONCLUSION: Although inferior to the standard dual-tracer technique, the usage of MBD as a single agent in SLNB for early breast cancer still offers favourable accuracy and identification rate. With continuous training and improved surgeons experience, performing SLNB with blue dye alone is feasible in order to reduce the risks and morbidities associated with ALND.

TI  - Comprehension of Human Existence by Philosophical Anthropology in the Theoretical Space of Modern Historical-Anthropological Concepts
T2  - ANTHROPOLOGICAL MEASUREMENTS OF PHILOSOPHICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. The paper seeks to prove the thesis of the significance and importance of the theories and methodological approaches of historical anthropology, which are aimed at understanding the meanings, essence and value systems of human existence in the past for philosophical anthropology. The study of this problem is relevant for understanding the evolution of human identity with philosophical and anthropological concepts, understanding the essence of one's own existence and attitude to the world. Theoretical basis. The author conducts research in the analysis of the reflexive field of philosophical anthropology and related disciplines, in particular historical anthropology, implemented in the philosophical literature of recent centuries, that is, in the space of non-classical and modern philosophical thought. Originality. I raise and substantiate the theoretical question of the scientific significance of the analysis of human existence in the past thanks to the involvement of theoretical approaches and concepts formed in the reflexive field of modern historical and anthropological research. This forms the prerequisites for understanding complex and interdisciplinary explorations of the essence and cultural and spiritual values of human existence. I analyse the problems of the work in the context of the concept of the incompleteness of the project of philosophical anthropology without its involvement in the theoretical achievements of historical-anthropological investigations. Conclusions. In my opinion, modern historical and anthropological studies of the essence and meanings of being a person of the past form an extensive theoretical system. It is realized through such theoretical aspects of comprehension of human existence by historical and anthropological studies as "history of mentalities", "microhistory", "history of women", "new cultural history", "history of identity", "history of memory", history of mental aspects of political processes. Methodological approaches and concepts of modern historical anthropology form the basis of mental reconstruction and understanding of the mental and cultural causes and factors of human existence, thanks to the analysis of the evolution of the worldview, behaviour, outlook, various forms of individual and social activity of the individual.

AB  - Introduction: The aim of our work was to analyse the trends of HIV infection and syphilis among pregnant women in prenatal consultation (PNC) in healthcare facilities in Togo.Methods: This was an analytical retrospective study, covering the period from 2008 to 2016 and focusing on pregnant women aged 15 to 49 seen in PNC for the first time in maternal and child health services in Togo.Results: During the study period, 41,536 pregnant women were registered in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2014 and 2016, respectively 8079, 8572, 8430, 7920 and 8535.The mean age of the patients was 26 ± 6 year in 2008, 2009 and 2010. The overall HIV prevalence decreased from 3.4% in 2008 to 2.9% in 2016 (p = 0.0145). It fell from 1% in 2008 to 0.5% in 2016 and from 3.6% in 2008 to 1.4% in 2016 (p < 0.0001) among 15-19 year-old and 20-24 year-old respectively. HIV prevalence in rural areas is two times lower than in urban areas between 2008 and 2016 with a statistically significant difference. The prevalence of syphilis decreased significantly from 2008 (1.3%) to 2016 (0.6%), (p < 0.0001). It is low and not associated with age in 2008; 0.2% and 0.4% in 2016 respectively in the 15 to 19 and 20 to 24 age groups. This prevalence is significantly low between 2008 and 2016 in both urban and rural areas.Conclusion: Our study documents a relatively low prevalence of syphilis and HIV among pregnant women in Togo, with a significant decrease among adolescents and young women, attesting to the effectiveness of the increased screening and comprehensive prevention of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV, including the antiretroviral treatment as prevention (TASP) approach, and the neonatal syphilis elimination programme in the country.

T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest clear-cut detection would be valuable for forest management, if it could be done routinely in near-real-time with a spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system, which provides data all year and all-weather. In Sentinel-1 (S-1) time-series data, a forest clearing will lead to reduced backscatter intensity and increased interferometric SAR (InSAR) coherence magnitude. A time-series of 108 interferomtric wide (IW) Single look complex (SLC) S-1 images collected in 2016, 2017, and 2018 are used to study the potential for mapping clear-cut areas in eastern Ireland. We combined multitemporal InSAR coherence and backscatter intensity for the detection. This is an extension of previous studies that used either backscatter intensity or InSAR coherence magnitude, while we show the added value of both together. Coherence magnitude was the strongest predictor of the two.

AB  - Since the commissioning phase of Sentinel-1A, several calibration studies have improved the geolocation and geometric modeling of the data. The implementation of the corrections presented in these studies is left to the user. The issues found might be confusing when working with bursts in the interferometric wide swath mode, because the geometric shifts present in the data are not usually the same at the burst boundaries. This might introduce small inconsistencies in a mosaic product if not properly handled, which is especially inconvenient in high precision applications. This paper proposes a method to account for this effect by resampling the bursts before stitching. The method is validated with experiments on real Sentinel-1 data.

TI  - DAILY BURNED AREA MAPPING FOR PRESCRIBED RANGELAND BURNING IN THE FLINT HILLS REGION USING MODIS DATA
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ASABE
M3  - Article
AB  - Smoke from prescribed burning in the Flint Hills region impacts air quality and contributes to the exceedances of ozone (O-3). The objectives of this study were 1) to map the daily burned area in this region from 2003 to 2019 using the combination of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) highest resolution imagery and standard active fire data from satellite, and 2) to identify the spatial and temporal distributions and patterns of daily fire activities. Red and near-infrared images were combined, and supervised minimum distance classification of the bi-spectral images was applied to map the daily burned area. Results showed that fire activities were highly concentrated in a few days in mid-April. The annual burned percentage (ranged from 11% to 52%) and the average fire size (ranged from 160 to 400 ha) were larger in the central part of the Flint Hills region than in the Southern part and at the edge. On average, the preferred weather conditions by landowners only occurred in around 10 days in one spring burning season. The maximum daily burned area in the Flint Hills study region was as high as 0.2 million ha, about 1/6 of the total burned area in the whole spring burning season. Based on analysis of historical daily burned area and weather data, most fires occurred on days with high solar radiation, favoring O-3 production. Changing this pattern or more evenly distributed fires can reduce the smoke impact on daily O-3. The results of this study provided a solid foundation for the ongoing development of O-3 regression models using daily burned area and meteorological factors as predictor variables.

TI  - Diagnostic Value of Axillary Ultrasound, MRI, and <SUP>18</SUP>F-FDG- PET/CT in Determining Axillary Lymph Node Status in Breast Cancer Patients
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF BREAST HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Knowing axillary lymph node (ALN) status before surgery affects decisions about treatment modalities. Therefore, reliable, noninvasive diagnostic methods are important for determining ALN metastases. We aimed to accurately evaluate the patient's ALN status with noninvasive imaging modalities while making treatment decisions.Materials and Methods: Patients who received the axillary ultrasound (AUS), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (F-18-FDG-PET/CT) imaging modalities and whose ALNs were confirmed histopathologically by fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC), sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), or ALN dissection (ALND) were included in the study.Results: The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy of AUS for the detection of ALN metastases were 83%, 62%, 59.2%, 54.8%, and 79.1%, respectively. For MRI they were 86.1%, 75%, 68.5%, 51.6%, and 85.3%, respectively, and for F-18-FDG-PET/CT they were 78%, 53%, 56.2%, 51.4%, and 72.5%, respectively. ALNs were found to be metastatic in all patients who were reported positive in all three imaging modalities. ALN metastases were detected in 19 of 132 patients (false negativity, 14.3%) in whom AUS, MRI, and F-18-FDGPET/CT images were all reported as negative.Conclusion: In our study, we found that the diagnostic performance of MRI was slightly better than AUS and F-18-FDG-PET/CT. When we used imaging modalities together, our accuracy rate was better than when we used them alone. For accurate evaluation of axillary lymph nodes, imaging modalities should be complementary rather than competitive.

AB  - The mapping of southern yellow pines (loblolly, shortleaf, and Virginia pines) is important to supporting forest inventory and the management of forest resources. The overall aim of this study was to examine the integration of Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) optical data with Sentinel-1 microwave C-band satellite data and vegetation indices in mapping the canopy cover of southern yellow pines. Specifically, this study assessed the overall mapping accuracies of the canopy cover classification of southern yellow pines derived using four data-integration scenarios: Landsat OLI alone; Landsat OLI and Sentinel-1; Landsat OLI with vegetation indices derived from satellite data-normalized difference vegetation index, soil-adjusted vegetation index, modified soil-adjusted vegetation index, transformed soil-adjusted vegetation index, and infrared percentage vegetation index; and 4) Landsat OLI with Sentinel-1 and vegetation indices. The results showed that the integration of Landsat OLI reflectance bands with Sentinel-1 backscattering coefficients and vegetation indices yielded the best overall classification accuracy, about 77%, and standalone Landsat OLI the weakest accuracy, approximately 67%. The findings in this study demonstrate that the addition of backscattering coefficients from Sentinel-1 and vegetation indices positively contributed to the mapping of southern yellow pines.

AB  - Determination of agricultural fields carbon budget is needed to devise the best sustainable agriculture strategies, and quantify future subsidies in the agricultural sector. One major sustainable practice is cover crops that are planted in between main crops cycles, enabling storage of carbon and reduction of reflected heat. Assimilation of Earth Observation data is crucial for such exercise due to the sheer heterogeneity and complexity of crop modeling in the real environment. In this paper, we present the impact of cover crops on Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) and Biomass over a large area in the south-west of France using the AgriCarbon-EO. This tool is an end-to-end solution that enables a Bayesian assimilation of multi-temporal and entire tiles (100x100 km) Sentinel-2 reflectance data into a radiative model and a crop model. Our results show an increase of NEE of about due to cover crops over maize fields.

AB  - Flood disasters can be reliably monitored using remote sensing photos with great spatiotemporal resolution. However, satellite revisit periods and extreme weather limit the use of high spatial resolution images. As a result, this research provides a method for combining Landsat and MODIS pictures to produce high spatiotemporal imagery for flood disaster monitoring. Using the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM), the spatial and temporal reflectance unmixing model (STRUM), and three prominent algorithms of flexible spatiotemporal data fusion (FSDAF), Landsat fusion images are created by fusing MODIS and Landsat images. Then, to extract flood information, utilize a support vector machine (SVM) to classify the fusion images. Assess the accuracy of your work. Experimental results suggest that the three spatio-temporal fusion algorithms may be used to effectively monitor floods, with FSDAF's fusion results outperforming STARFM and STRUM in both study areas. The overall flood classification accuracy of the three STARFM, STRUM, and FSDAF algorithms in the Gwydir research region is 0.89, 0.90, and 0.91, respectively, with Kappa coefficients of 0.63, 0.64, and 0.67. The flood classification accuracy of the three fusion algorithms in the New Orleans research region is 0.90, 0.89, and 0.91, with Kappa values of 0.77, 0.76, and 0.81, respectively. The spatio-temporal fusion technique can be used to successfully monitor floods, according to this study.

AB  - Knowledge of the evolution of the littoral zone over time is paramount for coastal science and coastal zone management. However, traditional bathymetric surveys using echo-sounding techniques are unsuitable for large-scale applications due to a variety of constraints. On the other hand, remote sensing data such as satellite imagery allow for the development and application of bathymetry inversion models on a large scale. Deep learning is a growing field of artificial intelligence that allows for the automatic construction of models from data and has been successfully used for various Earth Observation and model inversion applications. In this work, we develop and apply a deep learning-based depth inversion model combining wave kinematics and water color information from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. We present two different satellite image processing methods to augment wave kinematics and color information as inputs to the proposed deep learning-based models. We show competitive results with a state-of-the-art physical inversion method for satellite derived bathymetry, Satellite to Shores (S2Shores), demonstrating a promising direction for the use of deep learning models in Satellite Derived Bathymetry (SDB) and Earth observation in general.

T2  - JOURNAL OF FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this research is the identification of burned forest areas that occurred in Syria from September 2nd to October 15th, 2020. Forest fire risk classes were determined using Sentinel-2 images. Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), Differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR), and Burned Area Index for Sentinel-2 (BAIS2), and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were used for the identification how much the forests have been destroyed and to establish fire risk classes. According to the study results, the size of the vegetation area that was destroyed due to fire was determined, and the probability of the forest fire exposure of these areas was established. The fires also altered some chemical properties in the soil during the combustion process. Thus, this study was focused on the impact of fire on the availability of soil nutrients. Soil samples were collected from three depths (0-10 cm, 10-20 cm and 20-30 cm) under the forest land a month after the fire in three locations: Al-Fazeen, Sawda and Gard Al-rihan. Pine (Pinus brutia) trees cover these areas. The results of this study indicated that the fire increased pH, EC and sand, the fire also led to an increase in the solubility of the available major soil elements N, P and K. There was an increase in the solubility of the soil microelements Zn, Cu, Mn and Fe while the content of organic material and silt and day ratio decreased at the three sites in comparison with unburned soil.

AB  - Along with sea-level rise, one of the most detrimental effects of climate change, is salinity leakage, which signifi-cantly affects agricultural activities throughout most of the world. This occurrence is becoming increasingly danger-ous. The purpose of this study was to use Geographical Information Systems (GIS) to assess the current situation of agricultural lands in the province of Al-Diwaniyah, by employing GIS to document the salt-affected sites and arrive at the most important criteria affecting those lands as well as build an application model for suitability to clarify the affected sites and come up with paper and digital maps. To accomplish this, the study relied on the available data by extrapolating and analyzing remote sensing images using salt equations to analyze the Landsat 8 satellite images, after which these data were subjected to spatial statistical treatment in ArcGIS software. Moreover, 20 samples were taken from ground sampling points and subjected to laboratory analysis to compare and document the results. The research resulted in the creation of an up-to-date database for the locations of salt ratio growth or decrease in the province of Al-Diwaniyah, which can be relied on, starting from and expanding in the future. Land maps, both paper and digital, have been created and can be used and inferred. The findings demonstrated the model's ability to steadily discriminate among all salinity groups while maintaining consistency with the ground truth data. Each of the four major salinity categories was highlighted. The best-performing indicators were used to build the MLR model, which was then used to anticipate soil salinity. The salt levels may be determined by the MLR combining NDVI and SI-5 with a high correlation value (R2 = 75.29%). Finally, it is shown that by combining spectral indica-tors with field measurements, it is possible to chart and forecast soil salinity on a large scale.

AB  - The variation of air temperature (T-air)( )over a spatial area is usually hard to detect. This is because it requires a high-spatial network of weather stations distributed over the study area which might be impractical to implement in large studies. Nevertheless, remotely sensed images could provide a low-scale land surface temperature (LST) map for large areas where one of the renowned satellites that provide LST is Landsat. This research tries to understand the accuracy of these LST maps using records from weather stations as well as thermal camera images. To do so, remotely sensed images between April 2021 and June 2022 were retrieved from Landsat 8 to estimate the LST over the University City of Sharjah in the UAE to validate them using 14 weather stations distributed on different land uses. The weather stations recorded T-air every 30 minutes at 0.5 meters and 1.5 meters above the ground. In addition, thermal images from the thermal camera were taken at the same time as Landsat 8. The correlation analysis shows that the relationship between LST and the thermal camera is weaker during higher temperatures, while strong at lower temperatures (R-2 of 0.878) with an absolute difference of about 8 degrees C. On the other hand, the relationship between LST and T-air at 0.5 meters is slightly stronger than the one at 1.5 meters (R-2 of 0.877) and (R-2 of 0.870) respectively.

T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global-scale canopy height mapping is an important tool for ecosystem monitoring and sustainable forest management. Various studies have demonstrated the ability to estimate canopy height from a single spaceborne multispectral image using end-to-end learning techniques. In addition to texture information of a single-shot image, our study exploits multitemporal information of image sequences to improve estimation accuracy. We adopt a convolutional variant of a long shortterm memory (LSTM) model for canopy height estimation from multitemporal instances of Sentinel-2 products. Furthermore, we utilize the deep ensembles technique for meaningful uncertainty estimation on the predictions and postprocessing isotonic regression model for calibrating them. Our lightweight model (similar to 320k trainable parameters) achieves the mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.29 m in a European test area of 79 km(2). It outperforms the state-of-the-art methods based on single-shot spaceborne images as well as costly airborne images while providing additional confidence maps that are shown to he well calibrated. Moreover, the trained model is shown to be transferable in a different country of Europe using a fine-tuning area of as low as similar to 2 km(2) with MAE = 1.94 m.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY AND ECOTOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The elevated concentration of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) due to natural and anthropogenic causes is a significant bane to marine and coastal organisms, as it has a prolonged half-life and can inject across lipid bilayers and interfere with aquatic redox processes. The present assessment aimed to determine the acute effect of H2O2 on larval development of the Mediterranean musselMytilus galloprovincialis and to observe the oxidative stress (OS) responses, including genotoxicity and neurotoxicity in the clam Ruditapes philippinarum. Two experiments were performed, in which (a) mussel embryos were exposed to the consecutive dilution (0.0, 0.05, 0.5, 5.0, 50.0 and 500.00 mu M) of H2O2 for 48 h and (b) adult clams were exposed to similar concentrations - of this reactive oxygen species (ROS) for 21 days. Incremental H2O2 significantly retarded the growth of mussel larvae; the percentage of malformed larvae increased with increasing toxicant concentration (p < 0.01, and r= 0.884). H2O2 also induced oxidative stress (OS) in clams, indicated by the activation/inactivation of antioxidant enzymes (GST, GPx, and GR) with a significant rise in lipid peroxidation (LPO) in the digestive gland tissues of the clams (p < 0.05). No genotoxicity or neurotoxicity on R. philippinarum were evident after chronic exposure. The battery of responses (organismal and cellular parameters) showed embryotoxicity and sublethal effects on bivalves, which confirmed their suitability for assessing the effect of H2O2 mediated OS responses in the marine environment.

TI  - Accuracy assessment for Landsat 8 thermal bands in measuring sea surface temperature over Kuwait and North West Arabian Gulf
T2  - KUWAIT JOURNAL OF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Studying physical oceanography is one of the important fields of remote sensing applications. Previously, the thermal mapping of seas and oceans relied on primitive methods, such as the use of sensors installed on buoys, extracting contour lines, and deriving the values from the confluence of contour lines. Today's remote sensing provides more advanced methods for extracting sea surface temperature (SST) values for all bodies of water as a continuous raster model, through thermal sensors installed on satellites designated to monitor and observe the Earth. The Landsat program has facilitated a quantum leap by providing its data free for the public. What has become increasingly important is the inclusion, in Landsat 8, of a thermal band on the TIRS sensor through which SST can be extracted with a spatial resolution of 100 m(2). In this article, the accuracy of the two thermal bands (band 10 and 11) of Landsat 8 was validated in estimating the SST of Kuwaiti and Northwest Arabian Gulf waters, through the use of 62 thermal images and 66 ground-truthing points (GTPs) taken from the field in the period from July 2013 to March 2020. This was achieved through a function provided by the ENVI 5.3 software - "brightness temperature" - to derive the surface temperature. The accuracy of Landsat 8 to monitor the SST of Kuwait and north-west Arabian Gulf waters was validated by calculating the root mean square error (RMSE) and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The accuracy of the thermal band 10 was +/- 2.03 degrees (7.9%), while the accuracy of the thermal band 11 was +/- 3.13 degrees (13.7%). Therefore, this study demonstrated that the thermal band 10 of Landsat 8 is more accurate than the thermal band 11 in monitoring the SST of Kuwaiti and north-west Arabian Gulf waters, with a difference of +/- 1.1 degrees (5.8%).

AB  - Recently, deep learning methods that integrate image features gradually became a hot development trend in fusion of multispectral and hyperspectral remote sensing images, aka multi-sharpening. Fusion of a low spatial resolution hyperspectral image (LR-HSI datacube) with its corresponding high spatial resolution multispectral image (HR-MSI datacube) to reconstruct a high spatial resolution hyperspectral image (HR-HSI) has been a significant subject in recent years. Nevertheless, it is still difficult to achieve a high quality of spatial and spectral information fusion. In this paper, we propose a Deep Multi-Scale Learning Model (called DeepSen3) of spatial-spectral information fusion based on multi-scale inception residual convolutional neural network (CNN) for more efficient hyperspectral and multispectral image fusion from ESA remote sensing satellite missions (Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 images). The proposed DeepSen3 fusion network was applied to Sentinel-2 MSI (13 spectral bands with a spatial resolution ranging from 10, 20 to 60 m) and Sentinel-3 OLCI (21 spectral bands with a spatial resolution of 300 m) images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DeepSen3 network achieves the best performance (both qualitatively and quantitatively) compared with recent stateof-the-art deep learning approaches.

AB  - We present and evaluate a weakly-supervised methodology to quantify the spatio-temporal distribution of urban forests based on remotely sensed data with close-to-zero human interaction. Successfully training machine learning models for semantic segmentation typically depends on the availability of high-quality labels. We evaluate the benefit of high-resolution, three-dimensional point cloud data (LiDAR) as source of noisy labels in order to train models for the localization of trees in orthophotos. As proof of concept we sense Hurricane Sandy's impact on urban forests in Coney Island, New York City (NYC) and reference it to less impacted urban space in Brooklyn, NYC.

AB  - The eruption of the Hunga Tonga - Hunga Ha'apai volcano, which began on January 14, 2022, is so far the largest eruption of the twenty-first century. The strong explosion it generated was able to change the physiognomy of the island, leaving only two islets. Thanks to Sentinel-2 satellite mission, it was possible to acquire images showing the island before and after the eruption. The aim of this work is to detect the changes that occurred on the island by comparing Sentinel-2 images acquired on different data (before and after the eruption). The work is developed over four basic phases: the first concerns the application of different indices to delineate the territorial boundaries of the island; next the Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC) is applied to the indices to distinguish water and no-water classes; then the post-classification change detection technique is applied to measure the areas and the amount of soil sunk under water as a result of the eruption; finally, tests are carried out to evaluate the accuracy of the resulting coastlines as a marker of classification accuracy. The results show that the only effective index for determining the two aforementioned classes is the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI). That is due to the presence of lava soil which limits the effectiveness of the other indices available in the literature and normally adopted for the extraction of the coastline, e.g. the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI).

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXVII
CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments on-board the Aqua and Terra spacecraft have provided valuable Earth data to the science community for the last 20 and 22 years, respectively. The Spectro-Radiometric Calibration Assembly (SRCA) is an on-board calibrator (OBC) that can characterize the radiometric, spatial, and spectral properties of the MODIS reflective solar bands (RSBs). In radiometric mode, the SRCA is able to monitor the gain trends of the RSBs on a detector level. Nominal radiometric mode measurements are collected during a 10-minute period during spacecraft night using a combination of SRCA halogen lamps. These measurements are intended for deriving on-orbit gains, however due to several 10-watt lamp failures on-orbit, the frequency of SRCA calibrations has been reduced and no longer used in the official L1B LUT algorithm. Once per calendar year the SRCA is operated in radiometric mode over several consecutive orbits using a backup lamp, monitoring the gain changes of the RSBs under unique conditions. This paper will provide insight into the 1W short-term stability of the MODIS RSBs using these calibrations over both the Aqua and Terra missions, along with the long-term trends of these multi-orbit gain observations.

T2  - NAUCHNYI DIALOG
M3  - Article
AB  - Observations are presented on the features of the documentary and artistic organization of the book by V. M. Golovnin "Journey of Russian Imperial Sloop "Diana" from Kronstadt to Kamchatka..." (1819). Such issues as the thematic content of "Journey...", the role of the author's worldview in creating a single artistic whole, and the features of the aesthetic organization of documentary material are considered. The significance of the study is seen in the need to update the memory of the personality and literary work of V. M. Golovnin, an outstanding figure of Russian culture at the beginning of the 19th century. The presented material will allow supplementing with new facts the picture of the genre and style genesis of documentary and artistic genres in the Russian historical and literary process of the early 19th century. The relevance of the study is determined by the attention of modern literary criticism to the poetics of documentary and artistic genres. The novelty of the research is seen in the appeal to a little-known work of Russian literature of the first third of the 19th century. It is reported that the author showed the maritime way of life with its regulations, traditions, experience of intercultural communication. The work is considered in the main thematic lines: everyday life of a round-the-world sea expedition, seascape, battle studies, ethnographic sketches. It is noted that a value-semantic principle is revealed behind the empirical material, which gives the narrative artistic completeness and deeply brings Golovnin's "Journey..." with the tradition of Russian classical literature.

TI  - THE HORSE AS A CELESTIAL BEING IN THE RELIGIOUS AND MYTHOLOGICAL REPRESENTATIONS OF THE KHAKAS (LATE XIX - XX CENTURY)
T2  - TOMSKII ZHURNAL LINGVISTICHESKIKH I ANTROPOLOGICHESKIKH ISSLEDOVANII-TOMSK JOURNAL OF LINGUISTICS AND ANTHROPOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The veneration of the horse is one of the bright and widespread phenomena represented in the traditional culture of many peoples engaged in horse breeding. Khakas are no exception. In their minds, this animal was endowed with a positive characteristic, which was due to the involvement of the horse in almost all spheres of human activity. The horse was an indispensable assistant in economic activity and the military sphere, the fastest and most reliable means of transportation, a source of meat and dairy products and various raw materials, etc. At the same time, the respectful attitude was not limited to a purely utilitarian value. The sacralization of the image of. horse was also influenced by the people's faith in its heavenly nature, which contributed to the formation of a special ritual associated with it. The purpose of this work will be to characterize the horse / horse as a religious and mythological character in the traditional worldview of the Khakas associated with the sky. The chronological framework of the work is limited to the framework of the late XIX - XX centuries. The choice of such time limits is determined by the state of the source base on the research topic. Ethnographic and folklore materials, both published and introduced into scientific circulation, served as a source base. Among folklore sources, heroic tales (alyptyg nymakhtar) are widely used, excerpts from which are presented for the first time in the author's translation in Russian. Leading in the study is the principle of historicism, when any cultural phenomenon is considered in development taking into account a specific situation. The research methodology is based on historical and ethnographic methods: remnants (relic) and semantic analysis. As a result of the research, the author comes to the conclusion that in the Khakas culture, the horse has a wide semantic field. One of the most striking facets of his image is the perception as a celestial being and the endowment of a high semiotic status. This animal was included in the mytho-ritual complex associated with the idea of heaven and the celestials. Among the diverse manifestations of this phenomenon, one should distinguish such as: the dedication of a horse - yzyh, solar-lunar and astral symbolism of a horse and its fiery nature, identification of images of a horse and a bird, etc.

TI  - Improvement in Estimation of Phytoplankton Size Class in Arabian Sea Using Remote Sensing Measurements
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Phytoplankton is the principal component of the ocean ecosystem, whose biomass (represented as total chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration) and size structure are the key ecological indicators. With an aim to retrieve phytoplankton size class (PSC) in Arabian Sea (AS) (a region with limited measurements), this study focuses on modification of two existing algorithms, one for measuring Chl-a and the other for size fraction. PSC is estimated using a regionally tuned three-component model with Chl-a concentration taken as input. Parameters of the model are modified for AS using in situ data to estimate three size classes, namely, micro-, nano-, and pico-plankton (model is referred as AS-PSC-2021). Accuracy of PSC retrieval depends on Chl-a concentration, which is estimated from spectral remote sensing reflectance [R-rs(lambda)] using quasi-analytical algorithm (QAA) along with nonlinear optimization. This hybrid approach for Chl-a estimation is named the "QAA-optimized model." In situ measurements of Chl-a concentration, R-rs(lambda), and PSC fractions collected during April-May 2017 (intermonsoon period) from AS are used along with the previous measurements from the winter-monsoon periods of the years 2009, 2010, and 2011 for model development and validation. The PSCs were estimated using pigment concentrations obtained from high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The Chl-a concentration obtained from the QAA-optimized model was verified with the in situ data (N = 44) and found to perform well (slope = 0.95, bias = 0.04, rms = 0.13, and R-2 = 0.90). Also, the regionally tuned (Also, the regionally tuned PSC model (AS-PSC-2021) showed a significant improvement in retrieving the size fraction when compared with previous PSC algorithm proposed for the region. The AS-PSC-2021 model was able to reproduce the variability in all the three size classes showing the dominance of pico- and micro-plankton at lower and higher Chl-a concentrations, respectively, but more importantly the dominance of nano-plankton at mid Chl-a range. It is important to have a regionally tuned algorithm for key ecological parameters such as Chl-a and PSCs to assess the ecosystem in a perspective of ocean warming and climate change.

AB  - Monitoring water bodies using satellite radar altimetry is an advanced and cost-effective technique with high accuracy. The method is effective for monitoring water level changes in lakes, rivers, and reservoirs. This study selected two locations near Vientiane over the Mekong River in Laos. Two sentinel 3-B (S-3B) tracks are selected for this study-the first one crosses the Mekong River 17km upstream while the second track passes 35km downstream of the Vientiane gauge station. The root mean square error between satellite-driven and in-situ water levels for upstream and downstream stations were 0.43m and 2.62m, respectively, while the correlation coefficient (R) values for these stations were 0.9 and 0.5, respectively. The water levels from the in-situ gauge and sentinel 3-B (S-3B) show a significant correlation between upstream virtual station (VSs) than the downstream virtual station (VSs). The downstream sentinel 3-3B virtual station (S3B-VSs) are crossing the river after a meander at around 35km distance from the gauge located in Vientiane. The possible reason for the difference in validation may be due to the difference in location of virtual stations and in-situ gauge station.

AB  - Modern technologies for satellite monitoring of the Earth's surface provide agricultural producers with useful information about the health status of crops. The remote sensor's ability to detect subtle differences in vegetation makes it a useful tool for quantifying variability within a given field, estimating crop growth, and managing land based on current conditions. Remote sensing data, collected on a regular basis, allows producers and agronomists to draw up a current vegetation map that reflects the condition and strength of crops, analyze the dynamics of changes in plant condition, and predict yields in a particular area under crops. To interpret these data, the most effective means are various vegetation indices calculated empirically, that is, by operations with different spectral ranges of satellite monitoring multispectral data. Based on the time series of one of these vegetation indices, the paper considers the annual dynamics of the development of a plant culture in a particular field. The possibility of predicting the yield of the given crop is considered based on fuzzy modeling of time series for the corresponding spectral ranges of vegetation reflection obtained from satellite monitoring images. The proposed fuzzy models of time series are investigated for adequacy and suitability in terms of analyzing the features of the intra-annual of average long-term dynamics of the vegetation index, typical for the given area under crop.

AB  - Drinkable water is very limited on Earth, and groundwater is considered as one of its main sources, especially in the arid and semi-arid countries where there is scarcity in surface water sources, and the distribution of rainfall is not consistent all seasons. Mostly, groundwater is impacted by human activities. Changes in Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) are commonly human-induced activities that affect the groundwater system. Continuous growth in population rate forces governments to expand urban areas, which leads to negative consequences for groundwater storage. This study examines this issue extensively in Jebel Ali - Dubai. Recently, Jebel Ali continuously growing region, it is considered one of the most significant urban development areas in Dubai. This paper aims to map groundwater potential areas by applying 6 hydrological and topological factors to Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). As well as creating Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classification of 2002 and 2020 in order to detect the changes in urban classes of the city in the last two decades. Afterwards, Dubai expansion can be evaluated by calculating the given presence of a high groundwater potential zone in areas that have become urban. To achieve these objectives, there are two types of data were used, DEM data provided from SRTM with 30 meters spatial resolution and multispectral image delivered from Landsat 7 and 8 with 30 meters spatial resolution. The result was found to be 496.7 sq KM in Dubai has High Groundwater Potential (HGP), with only 0.7% located in Jebel Ali. Considering the changes that occurred in this area, only 0.028 sq KM of the HGP has become urban since 2002.

CL  - Polytech Nice Sophia, Sophia Antipolis, FRANCE
AB  - A fully distributed, physics-based hydrologic modelling system, MIKE SHE, is used in several studies to simulate surface flow as runoff in case of flooding. The requirement for such model came from the necessity to simulate the hydrological processes and manage the flood risk for a stream network. The modelling tool is used to study new scenarios with modifications of structures, land use evolution and climate change. MIKE SHE, Systeme Hydrologique Europeen, is a model within MIKE suite developed by DHI. It covers the major processes in the hydrologic cycle and includes process models for evapotranspiration, overland flow, unsaturated flow, groundwater flow, and channel flow and their interactions. MIKE SHE models are based on available spatial data such as land use, vegetation distribution and development, topography, pedology and hydraulic structures. The models are coupled with a fully dynamic one-dimensional river network modelling to ensure a good comprehension of the hydraulic dynamics inside the river. The models are calibrated based on remote sensing data and high-water marks from historical flooding events. For the Brivet river watershed, near to the Atlantic Ocean in France, the calibration of the model successfully reproduced the observed water levels at various gauging stations from rainfall measurements located inside the catchments. Once calibrated the model can be used to simulate scenarios to anticipate the evolution of the watershed such as urbanization or sea level rise in modifying the spatial data or structure regulation. In another case study located on a tributary of the Seine river, the model is applied to evaluate the benefits of stream renaturation and use of crop lands as flood expansion areas.

TI  - Assimilation of Multisensor Optical and Multiorbital SAR Satellite Data in a Simplified Agrometeorological Model for Rapeseed Crops Monitoring
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article investigates the potential of the assimilation of both synthetic aperture radar (SAR)-derived dry mass (DM) and optically derived green area index (GAI) in an agro-meteorological model (i.e., SAFY) for a better rapeseed crops modeling. The GAI was derived from both 566 Sentinel-2 and 149 Landsat-8 images, whereas DM was derived from 884 Sentinel-1 images acquired from six different orbits. The ground data were collected during 3 agricultural years on 43 rapeseed fields located in three study areas in France with contrasted pedoclimatic conditions. Results show that the temporal evolutions of both DM and GAI can be accurately simulated over the 43 monitored rapeseed fields (R-2 = 0.84 and 0.92, respectively, and relative root mean square error, RMSEr = 41% and 28%, respectively) for the best satellite configuration. Tested assimilation scenarios reveal that the concomitant assimilation of SAR and optical data allows a significant better control of the model than the assimilation of SAR or optical data alone. Small differences in the simulations of the model are observed when it is controlled by either multisensor optical and/or multiorbital SAR data or monosensor optical and/or mono-orbital SAR data. The discrepancies of performance between fields push toward the strengthening of this study by considering other rapeseed fields with ground observations acquired worldwide for the calibration of SAR-derived DM. These results are however promising in view of the development of a near-real time assimilation scheme as a decision support tool for farmers and decision makers.

AB  - The increasing pressure from agriculture and pasture activities over non-forest vegetation areas revealed the need of INPE to extend forest regular monitoring to non-forested areas. Non-forest vegetation consists of savannahs, shrub lands, grasslands or seasonal floodplains that occupy 279 thousand km(2) (6,63 %) of Brazilian Amazon biome extension. Addressed ecosystem services of nonforest vegetation vary from climate, soil, carbon storage, biodiversity, water and fire regulation to cultural benefits and living of the population. The challenge in monitoring non-forest removal lies in climatic seasonality, high variability of phytophysiognomies and cloud coverage. In this work we developed a method to map non-forest vegetation from 2000 to 2021 in a pilot area enclosing five municipalities in Roraima and Amapa states. Considering the total area of 47 thousand km(2) , 58 % was originally forest and 37 % was non-forest vegetation. In 2020, soybean planted areas occupied 60 thousands hectares in these municipalities. We adapted PRODES protocol to non-forest features using visual interpretation of Landsat and SENTINEL-2 satellite images. Regional expertise supported the interpretation keys to distinguish non-forest removal from seasonal changes or other land use changes. A baseline map for 2000 is provided together with biannual and annual increments for 2002-2018 and 2019-2021, respectively. Results show removal of non-forested areas even overpassing deforestation in some municipalities. Accumulated non-forest removal was 3.133,06 km(2) or 17,44 % of the non-forest area enclosed. This work consolidated the method to be applied in the Brazilian Amazon biome allowing a uniform historical mapping series of deforestation and non-forest removal.

TI  - Distributed Computing in a Pandemic: A Review of Technologies Available for Tackling COVID-19
T2  - ADCAIJ-ADVANCES IN DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE JOURNAL
M3  - Review
AB  - The current COVID-19 global pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 betacoronavirus has resulted in over a million deaths and is having a grave socio-economic impact, hence there is an urgency to find solutions to key research challenges. Some important areas of focus are: vaccine development, designing or repurposing existing pharmacological agents for treatment by identifying druggable targets, predicting and diagnosing the disease, and tracking and reducing the spread. Much of this COVID-19 research depends on distributed computing.In this article, I review distributed architectures - various types of clusters, grids and clouds - that can be leveraged to perform these tasks at scale, at high-throughput, with a high degree of parallelism, and which can also be used to work collaboratively. High-performance computing (HPC) clusters, which aggregate their compute nodes using high-bandwidth networking and support a high-degree of inter-process communication, are ubiquitous across scientific research - they will be used to carry out much of this work. Several bigdata processing tasks used in reducing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 require highthroughput approaches, and a variety of tools, which Hadoop and Spark offer, even using commodity hardware.Extremely large-scale COVID-19 research has also utilised some of the world's fastest supercomputers, such as IBM's SUMMIT - for ensemble docking high-throughput screening against SARS-CoV-2 targets for drug-repurposing, and high-throughput gene analysis - and Sentinel, an XPE-Cray based system used to explore natural products. Likewise, RSC's TORNADO has been employed in aptamer design. Grid computing has facilitated the formation of the world's first Exascale grid computer. This has accelerated COVID-19 research in molecular dynamics simulations of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interactions through massively-parallel computation and was performed with over 1 million volunteer computing devices using the Folding@home platform. Grids and clouds both can also be used for international collaboration by enabling access to important datasets and providing services that allow researchers to focus on research rather than on time-consuming data-management tasks.

AB  - Recent advances in remote sensing technologies have allowed the development of new innovative methodologies to obtain geo spatial information about Eucalyptus genus distribution. This is an important task for forest stakeholders due to the high presence of this genus in forest plantations worldwide. Therefore, the next step in research should focus on exploring remote sensing possibilities to discern between Eucalytpus species. It would be an important step forward in forest management since different Eucalyptus species present different characteristics and properties that imply different management plans and industrial usages. This study accomplish the classification of E. nitens and E. globulus, the most common Eucalyptus species in the Iberian Peninsula. Worldview-3 images and random forest are used in a forest area placed in Galicia (Northwest of Spain). The differentiation of Eucalyptus species resulted in a producer's accuracy of 84% and a users' accuracy of 70% for E. nitens, while for E. globulus accuracy metrics did not reach 70%. The most important bands in the classification were the coastal blue and the blue, followed by the red related ones. The resulting unequal accuracy metrics might be caused by an imbalanced presence of both species in the selected study area. Therefore, further studies might be developed in different locations.

CP  - Conference on Image and Signal Processing for Remote Sensing XXVIII
CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - In this paper, we propose a processing chain jointly employing Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data aimed at monitoring changes in the status of the vegetation cover by integrating the four visible and near infrared (VNIR) bands with the three rededge (RE) bands of Sentinel-2, approximately spanning the gap between Red and NIR bands (700 nm - 800 nm) with bandwidths of 15/20 nm and 20 m pixel spacing. The RE bands will be sharpened to 10 m and the resulting 7-bands, 10 m fusion product will be integrated with polarimetric features calculated from the Interferometric Wide (IW) Ground Range Detected (GRD) product of Sentinel-1, available at 10 m pixel spacing. Key point of the fusion of optical bands is the correction of atmospheric path radiance before fusion is accomplished through modulation of the interpolated band by a sharpening term achieved through the hyper-sharpening paradigm. Whenever surface reflectance data are available, haze estimation and correction can be skipped. Hyper-sharpening of Sentinel-2 multispectral (MS) bands and modulation-based integration of Sentinel-1 polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) features are applied on a multitemporal dataset acquired before and after a recent fire event.

TI  - RGB-BASED DEEP SURFACE WATER CONTOUR DETECTION
T2  - XXIV ISPRS CONGRESS: IMAGING TODAY, FORESEEING TOMORROW, COMMISSION III
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 24th ISPRS Congress on Imaging Today, Foreseeing Tomorrow
CL  - Nice, FRANCE
AB  - The application of remote monitoring of surface water has focused primarily on the detection of water bodies using expensive multispectral IR sensors. However, critical information about surface water bodies, particularly the dynamic behavior, is better derived from water contours. We show that water body detection is inadequate in accurately capturing the contours. Furthermore, we argue that RGB-based detection should be sufficient for accurate water detection. We present a new global dataset of remote sensing images obtained from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 missions and contour labeled to assist in this effort. We propose a unique UNet-style contour detection system that utilizes multiscale filters to detect contours accurately. Comparisons between our proposed system, existing water detection, and other segmentation and contour detection systems show the system's effectiveness in detecting water.

TI  - SELF-TRAINING FOR SEMI-SUPERVISED DEEP CONTOUR DETECTION OF SURFACE WATER
T2  - XXIV ISPRS CONGRESS: IMAGING TODAY, FORESEEING TOMORROW, COMMISSION III
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 24th ISPRS Congress on Imaging Today, Foreseeing Tomorrow
CL  - Nice, FRANCE
AB  - Contour detection is better for monitoring dynamic and long-term changes to surface water bodies. For that purpose, we present a semi-automated method for collecting and labeling water contours from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 images. Due to the need for human inspection, the method has thus far generated 14K labeled images from more than 1.5M images. Given the cost of data labeling, we propose a deep semi-supervised self-learning system performed in two training stages, known as teacher-student. The teacher is trained on the accurate human-labeled data, then used to pseudo label the remaining unlabeled data. The student is trained on both human-labeled and machine pseudo-labeled data. For both teacher and student, we use a uniquely designed multiscale UNet classifier that uses fewer parameters and is more accurate than other state-of-the-art classifiers. Random augmentations are used to "noise" the student model and improve its generalization, and normalization schemes are used to blend the human-labeled loss with the machine-labeled loss. Comparisons to existing water body detection classifiers and segmentation classifiers show the superiority of our proposed system in detecting water contours.

TI  - Factors Predicting Positive Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Clinically Node-Negative Breast Cancer
T2  - BREAST CANCER-TARGETS AND THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy (SLNB) is the standard tool to stage the axilla of breast cancer patients. This study aimed to identify the predictors of positive SLNB in patients with clinically node-negative breast cancer.Patients and Methods: A retrospective, single-institution cohort of patients with early-stage breast cancer without clinically identifiable axillary lymphadenopathy was chosen from January 2010 to December 2018. Logistic regression was used to identify possible predictors of positive SLNB.Results: Four hundred and seventy patients were identified; their mean age was 50 +/- 11 years. Most patients had the following characteristics: invasive ductal carcinoma (n=382, 81.3%), unilateral tumor (n=461, 98.1%), unifocal disease (n=351, 74.7%), intermediate grade (n=276, 59.0%), and estrogen and progesterone receptor positivity with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negativity (n=305, 64.9%). The mean size of the breast mass was 2.3 +/- 1.5 cm. SLNB was positive in 128 (27.2%) cases. The mean number of SLNs was 2 +/- 1.2. Axillary lymph node dissection was performed in 109 patients. The mean number of lymph nodes removed was 15 +/- 6. In 66 (60.6%) of the 109 patients with metastatic axillary nodes, only the SLNs were found to be positive. The number of SLNs, tumor size, tumor grade, receptor status, prominent axillary lymph nodes, and lymphovascular invasion predicted positive SLNB (P = 0.01, 0.03, 0.03, and 0.04 and <0.001 and <0.001, respectively).Conclusion : Our results suggest that a number of histopathological and radiological characteristics of breast cancer can predict SLNB positivity in clinically node-negative breast cancer patients.

AB  - [Objective] The aim of this study was to analyze which role remote sensing technologies can play to study multidimensional factors influencing the Food and Nutrition Security (FNS), in Cordoba Argentina. [Methodology] The study area includes the city of Cordoba, Argentina. Epidemiological data on the prevalence of underweight, overweight, and obesity (malnutrition) in 2013 were obtained from 23 primary health care centers in the city. The environmental conditions of the surroundings of the health centers were explored within a radius of 1000m. SPOT 5 images were classified using spectral and spatial features and we show how a non-supervised classification can give information to describe the social dimension and economic access to food. In addition, a multivariate stepwise linear regression was performed to examine the relation between the prevalence of malnutrition and the environmental and spatial variables, derived from the SPOT image, proposed. [Results] The results of the unsupervised image classification show the difference in the spectral-spatial pattern of neighborhoods showing how a simple satellite image classification can become a useful discrimination tool. Multiple regression analyses with adjusted R2 of 0.70 and 0.6435 respectively are obtained for undernutrition, and overweight, and obesity. On the basis of the obtained models, continuous maps of prevalence are built. [Conclusions] The method proposed in this work can discriminate socially different areas related to FNS. It is innovative and necessary to take advantage of remote sensing tools and geospatial technologies, in our region, applied to FNS.

CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing for Agriculture, Ecosystems, and Hydrology XXIV Part of SPIE Remote Sensing Conferene
CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - This study analyses the influence of climate change on the melting of snow on the Chimborazo Mountain peak using remote sensing and a simpler mathematical model. Climate change is undoubtedly real, and one of its leading causes is increased carbon dioxide emissions caused by industrial activities. This climate change phenomenon manifests itself in several ways, such as temperature increase and precipitation variation. We studied the influence of these variables on a mountain peak in Ecuador called Chimborazo. Since Chimborazo Mountain has a considerable size, the area of its ice glacier is sufficiently large enough to be measured and studied. Estimating the glacier area on Chimborazo's peak was carried out using photointerpretation over Satellite Remote Sensing in a GIS software, applying the best images without cloud per year of Landsat images from 1979 to 2020 because Ecuador has a high cloud density all year. The climate change data are collected from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), matching the years of Remote Sensing data to construct an input dataset for the mathematical model. Then, in the RStudio, the Partial Least Square (PLS) model was executed, where it was determined how many of the combined variables (Climate change data) in the independent vector components could be used in the modelling. Thus, concluding that using the seven components explains 93% of the variation of the results of the area (Remote Sensing extracted area data). The results indicate that the maximum provincial temperature and CO2 country emissions are the variables with the most significant influence on the melting of snow on Chimborazo. Therefore, this melting is influenced by climate change. Additionally, a simulation based on the PLS model is used to compute the Chimborazo snow area until 2050. Thus, a PLS model and Remote Sensing variables can explain the climate change in the snow-capped Ecuadorian mountains in a first approach.

TI  - DEFORESTATION DYNAMICS IN THE APYTEREWA INDIGENOUS (PAR?-BRAZIL) LAND THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF REMOTE SENSING TECHNIQUES
T2  - BOLETIM PARANAENSE DE GEOCIENCIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - -The Indigenous Lands in the brazilian legal Amazon were created with the objective of enabling indigenous communities to enjoy the biodiversity of the territory according to their customs, as well as protect and conserve natural resources. However, as cattle activity increases, the demand for new areas has increased, putting at risk the indigenous lands that are close to the agricultural frontier, as is the case of the Apyterewa Indigenous Land. The objective of this work is to map the dynamics of deforestation, quantifying its rates and variables in the IL Apyterewa, Sao Felix do Xingu -PA, through remote sensing techniques applied in satellite images between 2000 and 2018. Images from the Landsat 5 satellite sensor and Landsat 8 OLI sensor from 2000, 2005, 2010, 2014 and 2018 were used using the segmentation tool and an interpretation key to classify deforestation. It can be observed that in the Apyterewa Indigenous Land it is found with 12% of its deforested territory due to the expansion of cattle ranching and more than 80% of its territory occupied by non-indigenous people.

TI  - Prediction of Solar Irradiance over the Arabian Peninsula: Satellite Data, Radiative Transfer Model, and Machine Learning Integration Approach
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Data from a moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer instrument onboard the Terra satellite along with a radiative transfer model and a machine learning technique were integrated to predict direct solar irradiance on a horizontal surface over the Arabian Peninsula (AP). In preparation for building appropriate residual network (ResNet) prediction models, we conducted some exploratory data analysis (EDA) and came to some conclusions. We noted that aerosols in the atmosphere correlate with solar irradiance in the eastern region of the AP, especially near the coastlines of the Arabian Gulf and the Sea of Oman. We also found low solar irradiance during March 2016 and March 2017 in the central (~20% less) and eastern regions (~15% less) of the AP, which could be attributed to the high frequency of dust events during those months. Compared to other locations in the AP, high solar irradiance was recorded in the Rub Al Khali desert during winter and spring. The effect of major dust outbreaks over the AP during March 2009 and March 2012 was also noted. The EDA indicated a correlation between high aerosol loading and a decrease in solar irradiance. The analysis showed that the Rub Al Khali desert is one of the best locations in the AP to harvest solar radiation. The analysis also showed the ResNet prediction model achieves high test accuracy scores, indicated by a mean absolute error of ~0.02, a mean squared error of ~0.005, and an R-2 of 0.99.

TI  - Estimation of Groundwater Recharge in Kumamoto Area, Japan in 2016 by Mapping Land Cover Using GIS Data and SPOT 6/7 Satellite Images
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural fields, grasslands, and forests are very important areas for groundwater recharge. However, these types of land cover in the Kumamoto area, Japan, were damaged by the Kumamoto earthquake and heavy rains in 2016. In this region, where groundwater provides almost 100% of the domestic water supply for a population of about 1 million, quantitative evaluation of changes in groundwater recharge due to land cover changes induced by natural disasters is important for the sustainable use of groundwater in the future. The objective of this study was to create a land cover map and estimate the groundwater recharge in 2016. Geographic information system (GIS) data and SPOT 6/7 satellite images were used to classify the Kumamoto area into nine categories. The maximum likelihood classifier of supervised classification was applied in ENVI 5.6. Eventually, the map was cleaned up with a 21 x 21 kernel filter, which is larger than the common size of 3 x 3. The created land cover map showed good performance of the larger filter size and sufficient validity, with overall accuracy of 91.7% and a kappa coefficient of 0.88. The estimated total groundwater recharge amount reached 757.56 million m(3). However, if areas of paddy field, grassland, and forest had not been reduced due to the natural disasters, it is estimated that the total groundwater recharge amount would have been 759.86 million m(3), meaning a decrease of 2.30 million m(3) in total. The decrease of 2.13 million m(3) in the paddy fields is temporary, because the paddy fields and irrigation channels have been improved and the recharge amount will recover. On the other hand, since the topsoil on the landslide scars will not recover easily in natural conditions, it is expected to take at least 100 years for the groundwater recharge to return to its original state. The recharge amount was estimated to decrease by 0.17 million m(3) due to landslides. This amount is quite small compared to the total recharge amount. However, since the reduced recharge amount accounts for the annual water consumption for 1362 people, and 12.1% of the recharge decrease of 1.41 million m(3) each year to fiscal year 2024 is expected by municipalities, we conclude that efforts should be made to compensate for the reduced amount due to the disasters.

AB  - The objective of this study is the modelling of the root zone soil moisture (RZSM). A model was developed to simulate RZSM at 0-30 or 0-50 cm deep from various components of the surface water budget: irrigation, precipitation, capillarity, evapotranspiration, vapour diffusion and deep percolation. These water fluxes were derived from direct field measurement. In particular, we compared two in situ measurement techniques for estimating surface water fluxes, which determine the RZSM. With these data sets, we achieved to simulate the RZSM with an acceptable accuracy at the station scale (RMSE=0.025 m(3) m(-3) for wheat and 0.019 m(3) m(-3) for raspberry). Temporally, the dynamics of the RZSM is consistent with meteorological and anthropogenic forcing, and precisely follow in situ data during dry periods.

AB  - Generative adversarial network (GAN) models are becoming popular in the field of remote sensing for generating high spatial resolution images from their low resolution versions. In this study, four models including two basic Super-resolution GAN models and two non-GAN Deep Learning models were trained and tested to achieve 2.5m, and 5m spatial resolution from their 10m spatial resolution satellite data. The comparison of results showed that the SRGAN model performed better than the other deep learning models. The performance metrics were also found to be consistent with available literature.

AB  - Geographic Information Systems (GIS) allow analysis based on geo-referenced data. Currently only simple geo-referenced information is available, such as road networks or types of terrain, but there are other geo-referenced data thatwould be very useful to facilitate decision-making. These data are not collected as they are very hard to generate manually, but remote sensing data and artificial intelligence can be used to accomplish it. This work aims to develop an automatic framework for the extraction of geo-referenced trees, through the union Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) point clouds, aerial imagery, and existing GIS environment context. The results of the process are satisfactory, improving in some several areas the LiDAR-based detections using only imagery. However, issues such as false positives need to be corrected in the future. Merging both data sources would allow better results to be achieved.

AB  - Object detection is one of the most important research topics in remote sensing field. To further improve object detection accuracy in remote sensing data, in this paper, Mask R-CNN is employed for plastic greenhouses detection from Alsat-2A multispectral satellite images. The proposed model is based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) with the aim to solve object detection and instance segmentation for plastic greenhouses recognition. In addition, Mask RCNN can return in output both the bounding box and mask for each object instance. The proposed approach is applied to the publicly available Alsat-2A datasets and experimental results are evaluated with established criteria.

TI  - Statistical Destriping of Pushbroom-Type Images Based on an Affine Detector Response
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing pushbroom-type imaging systems acquire entire columns of an image with a single detector. As a consequence, the miss-calibration of the detectors produces stripes on the image. In this context, this article introduces a new self-calibration destriping method based on an affine response model for the detectors, called statistical affine destriping (SAD). In contrast, some previous contributions were limited to a purely linear model, while many others only considered an additive structured noise model. It is based on the maximum a posteriori estimation of the gain and offset parameters attached to each detector given the observed image. Simple statistical prior assumptions are adopted: respectively, a Gaussian white noise model for the gains and offsets, and a first-order, homogeneous Markov model for the observed scene. Based on a simplification of the posterior likelihood, we propose a very efficient optimization scheme based on a constrained majorize-minimize principle, allowing us to process large dimension images. Moreover, simple empirical rules are given to tune the hyperparameters of the destriping method for high-resolution satellite images. Compared to the performance of a destriping method limited to gain correction, we observe that the new version provides reliable results in a wider range of situations. We also extend the method in two directions. On the one hand, we consider that some detectors may be atypical, with very high or very low gains or offsets. On the other hand, we extend the method to multispectral image destriping.

AB  - The Koryak Highlands are a poorly explored area in terms of glaciation and its connection to climate. The purpose of this work is, using Sentinel-2 images (2019), to assess the state of glaciers at present against the background of climatic trends. Spatial patterns of trends of mean summer and annual temperatures, total precipitation and precipitation for the cold period from 1966 to 2019 were compiled: the temperature trends increase towards the Kamchatka Peninsula, and the mean summer temperature trends increase from 2 to 3 degrees C. Precipitation trends increase from the continent to the coastal zone, with cold season trends changing from 0 to minus 50 mm. As a result, 212 glaciers and 279 rock glaciers were discovered in the Highlands, whereas 112 objects that had previously been recognised were not identified: either there is no glacier, or its area is less than 0.001 km(2). The reduction in glacier areas compared to the USSR Glacier Inventory (1960s) varies widely by river basin, from 35 to 74%. The mean present glacier area varies from basin to basin from 0.4 to 0.11 km(2). The glaciers are mainly corrie type of the N, NE and NW aspects. The change of average glacier firn line is from several tens of metres to 400-500 m.

M3  - Article
AB  - Philosophical and worldview studies of the person's influence on nature, carried out based on analyzing the development of modern science and technological achievements, are a significant factor in the nature and specificity of changes in the ecological situation in the future. Optimal management of the current ecological situation is possible based on the formation of new worldview fundamentals of a person's scientific and technical attitude towards nature. The goal and result of optimal management lies in ensuring an ecological situation that will enable the effective co-existence of people and the natural environment. It is necessary to search for new approaches to overcome the destructive consequences of the widespread consumer-pragmatic attitude of a person to the natural environment that requires a critical revision of the consumption culture, which causes a violation of the technical and humanitarian balance in the world. The nature of the interrelationship between human interests and natural resources in Ukraine has been developing inconsistently with the requirements of unhindered development and conservation of the natural environment. Using the natural resource sphere leads to the gradual destruction of nature and the entire environment by a person. The connection between the development of society and the consumption of natural resources, the contradictions and problems arising from this have been and remain the focus of attention of numerous scientists, politicians, entrepreneurs, practitioners, philosophers and scientists. This is understandable, forasmuch as human activity is closely related to the sphere of natural resources and natural potential. The purpose of the academic paper is to characterize the features of the interaction between a person and nature from the viewpoint of revealing the philosophical and methodological problems of this issue. Methodology. In the course of the research, an analytical and bibliographic method was used to study the scientific literature on the interdependence of nature and a person, as well as a questionnaire survey for the practical clarification of certain aspects of the philosophical and methodological problems of the interaction of the society and nature. Results. Based on the research results, the features of human activity from the viewpoint of his impact on the natural environment were studied, and separate philosophical and methodological standpoints on this issue were investigated.

AB  - In this paper, a joint analysis of multi-frequency SAR data has been performed to assess their sensitivity to soil moisture variations over an agricultural area. The main objective was evaluating the performances offered by C and L bands in terms of sensitivity to soil moisture. We used L-band quad-polarimetric data acquired by SAOCOM-1A and C-band dual-polarimetric data collected by Sentinel-1A over an agricultural area located in the Cordoba Province, Argentina. We analyzed the temporal evolution of the backscattering coefficient at different polarizations with respect to in-situ soil moisture measurements collected during a field campaign conducted by the Argentinian Space Agency as well as data recorded by a permanent network of ground stations. Sensitivity to other variables, such as the NDVI, is also discussed and analyzed.

TI  - Connectivity Approach for Detecting Unreliable DInSAR Ice Velocity Measurements
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (DInSAR) allows for retrieval of ice velocity measurements of high resolution and accuracy. One of the main error sources in DInSAR is the phase unwrapping procedure. Unwrapping errors may be caused by several processes, including shear stresses associated with large motion gradients, which lead to loss of interferometric coherence. In many cases, unwrapping errors reach magnitudes corresponding to velocities of tens or even hundreds of meters per year. Traditional DInSAR implementations include pixel masking based on coherence thresholding; however, such a masking is not always sufficient. Consequently, the state-of-the-art for ice velocity retrievals involves either manual inspection of individual measurements or simply discarding measurements in regions where ice flow exceeds a predefined threshold. Here, we instead apply a masking based on thresholding of a pixel connectivity estimate with respect to a reference point, which aims to detect unwrapping errors based only on the estimated coherence pattern. The method is tested on both simulated and real data Sentinel-1 data from the Greenland Ice Sheet and effectively detects the majority of unwrapping errors (recall of 0.84 for the best performing threshold), although with a relatively low precision (0.52 for the best performing threshold). Importantly, higher magnitude unwrapping errors are associated with lower connectivity values, meaning that undetected errors have a significantly lower magnitude (median of 1.7 m/y, corresponding to a single phase cycle, compared with 40.5 m/y with no masking).

AB  - Recent researches have shown promising results for the use of orbital data using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to monitor and predict soybean grain yield. The objective of this work was to evaluate propositions of multiple linear regression models to predict soybean grain yield using NDVI. The research was carried out at the Celeiro Farm, in Monte Alegre do Piaui, PI, Brazil, in an area of 200 ha. Five images were collected during the soybean crop cycle: one from the Landsat 8 and four from the Sentinel 2. Regression analyses were carried out between grain yield data (predicted variable) extracted from harvest maps and spectral data (predictor variables) from NDVI of soybean crops at different developmental stages. The promising models were selected by the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The models were validated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Normalized Root Mean Square Error (nRMSE), considering the mean of soybean yield of the plot. The linear regression models developed with NDVI for the V5-V6 and R2 developmental stages showed promising results for the prediction of soybean grain yield, with mean error of predictions of 153.9 kg ha(-1), representing 4.2% when compared to the data from field measures.

TI  - Evaluation of Multiscale SMAP Soil Moisture Products in Forested Environments
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying the availability of soil moisture in forested environments has many implications for their ecosystem, and therefore the ability to map its dynamics accurately becomes important. Remote sensing offers the only viable strategy for cost-effective, global measurements of soil moisture, and the launch of satellites with L-band microwave sensors such as the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) has extended those capabilities to forested areas. A number of retrieval algorithms have been developed by the SMAP mission that have generated multiscale data products at 9 km, 3 km, and 1 km with the two finer-scale datasets derived by combining SMAP and Sentinel-1 C-band observations. In this study, we evaluated the ability of the three SMAP products to estimate the magnitude and dynamics of soil moisture in a relatively challenging environment of dense forest cover and topographic complexity using ground measurements from seven sites in New Zealand. We found that the finer-scale products had an overall smaller error and higher correlations when compared with the ground measurements, but did exhibit noise especially as canopy closure increased. On the other hand, the 9-km product had larger errors but was still able to capture the temporal dynamics of soil moisture. Our results are consistent with recent studies evaluating SMAP in forested environments, and the improved performance of the finer-scale products suggests a pathway toward accurate estimates of forested soil moisture using multiscale data fusion.

M3  - Article
AB  - General belief in the justice, in well-ordered and balanced social relations, the system where people get what they deserve is described in the concept of M. Lerner as "belief in the just world" (BJW). BJW helps to justify existing inequalities, to cope with unjust life situations, to keep optimistic view, but can also be a barrier for questioning and changing of unfair social relations. The research based on data of 9th round of Russian social survey (RSS) and European social survey (ESS) conducted in 30 countries revealed the prevalence of rational-skeptical view of Europeans on the chances of general justice. The average level of BJM appeared to be relatively low in Russia and in most other countries included in the analysis. To confirm the methodological rigor of these conclusions, the evaluation of statistical cross-national equivalency of BJM scale was conducted. The empirical validity of the BJW scale in Russia was assessed using cognitive interviews on randomly selected follow- up sample among RSS respondents. It showed the interpretative and motivational multidimensionality of the concept, but also the consistency of empirical semantic space of the concept to theoretical construct and general validity of the scale. Factors influencing the formation of BJW have two-fold structure. The impact of value-cultural factor leads to the similarity of views on BJW in Russia and in Europe on aggregate level. Personal situation and socio-demographic factors plays on individual level have differential impact. BJW as general worldview attitude has strong impact on framing particular socio-political attitudes and evaluations. High level of BJW is related to loyalty toward existing political system, trust to governing institutions and positive evaluation of incumbent's performance which is consistent with findings from previous research. In opposite, the hypothesis on the impact of BJW on the support of conservative ideology and anti-liberal social attitudes was not confirmed.

AB  - The subject of the article is the social ideals of Russians and their ideas about the prospects and the ways for the development of the country. Based on the results of All-Russian sociological surveys, including those conducted in 2021-2022, the article analyzes consolidated Russians' demand for future options, clears up the conceptual foundations of such demand and identifies their social subjects. Comparing the results of sociological studies of various years, the authors of the article note stable ideas of the Russian population about the further development of the country. In the first place among the qualities that Russia of the future should possess, most Russians call social justice, overcoming corruption, mitigating social inequalities, transition to an innovative economy, strengthening the country's international positions. At the same time, as shown in the article, in their understanding of national goals and in their requests for the future, Russians rely on collective historical experience, the quintessence of which is the conviction by the majority of citizens that "Russia should live by its own mind", not looking at imported models and patterns, including Western ones. Accordingly, liberal values in their Western understanding attract only a minority of citizens. In this regard, the article raises the question of how differing perceptions of what is due and desirable in regard to Russia's future correlate with basic social differences (gender, age, education, place of residence, etc.). It is shown that the differentiation of Russians' views on this issue is practically not related to standard socio-demographic differences being rooted in their worldview choice. It is shown that, despite growing anxieties caused by the change in the political situation in the world, values and demands of Russians for the future basically fit into the trends traceable in sociological surveys of the past two decades.

TI  - THE IMAGE OF A SQUIRREL IN THE TRADITIONAL CULTURE OF THE BURYATS
T2  - TOMSKII ZHURNAL LINGVISTICHESKIKH I ANTROPOLOGICHESKIKH ISSLEDOVANII-TOMSK JOURNAL OF LINGUISTICS AND ANTHROPOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The relevance of the topic is determined by the need to preserve the intangible cultural heritage of the peoples of Russia, including knowledge about their traditional picture of the world, which includes folk views about wild fauna. In the mythological representations of the peoples of Eurasia, the squirrel is a common zoomorphic image, which is associated with its wide range of habitat and the utilitarian meaning that it had as a fur-bearing animal. In buryat ethnography, this topic has not been considered before. The aim of the work is to reconstruct the complex of buryat folk beliefs about the squirrel with the definition of its symbolism and to clarify the representation of the image of this animal in their traditional rituals. The sources for the research are ethnographic-folklore and linguistic information, especially ethnographic and folklore materials collected by N. N. Agapitov, S. P. Baldaev, Ya. I. Lindenau, etc. The main linguistic material is obtained from the two-volume dictionary "Buryad-orod toil " (2010). The author's field materials are of an auxiliary nature. The main method of research is the structural-semiotic method, which provides for the determination of values, including squirrel. The methodological basis of the work was the works of A. K. Bayburin, P. G. Bogatyrev, A.V. Gura and others. It is proved that the squirrel was a revered wild animal among the buryats. It is revealed that the image of this animal is ambiguous and characterized by ambivalence of connotation. It was determined that this animal was endowed with heavenly, feminine and producing symbols, and received a positive connotation. In addition, it was found out that in the epic of the buryats, some ornithomorphism was attributed to the image of a squirrel. At the same time, he also receives a negative connotation: the motive of the soul of the enemy of the cultural hero was associated with him; he was perceived as a sign of trouble. The image of the squirrel can be traced in family rituals, in the rituals of shamans and hunters. In family rituals, fetishes are associated with it (Ekhe Toodei, Khermeshi-noyon and Bulgasha-khatan, etc.), endowed with a protective function. In shaman rituals, he is perceived as an assistant spirit, an animal dedicated to the patron spirit, and his skin was also considered an attribute of the shaman (an emblem of the clan).

TI  - THE CHARACTER OF A LOAFER IN THE WORKS BY I. BEER, J. VON EICHENDORFF AND I. GONCHAROV
T2  - PHILOLOGICAL CLASS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is based on the idea of A. V. Mikhailov about the similarity of the character of a loafer of the Austrian baroque writer J. Beer and the Russian realist writer I. Goncharov. The German romantic J. von Eichendorff also has a character who can be called a brother of "Lorenz behind the stove" and Oblomov (the images of Eichendorff and Oblomov are also compared by the German researcher L. Fust, however, this article does not only correlate the three images, but also discovers their roots, which go back to the fairy tale; all this contributes to the novelty of this study). In the article on Eichendorff's poetics, Mikhailov notes the Baroque emble-maticity in Eichendorff's poetry, which leads to the idea of the possibility of correlating not only their poetics, but also the characters. Drawing on the concept of V. I. Tyupa about the rhetorical era - baroque, post-rhetorical (romanticism) and meta-rhetorical (post-romanticism) - the author of the article puts the loafer characters in one row and explores the similarities and differences between them, as well as studies their common origins fairy tales of the pre-rhetorical era, which can be found in the collections of fairy tales by A. Afanasyev and brothers Grimm and the structure of which was studied by V. Propp in his works on fairy tales. All works have magical helpers and things and events that determine the turns in their lives. At the same time, each work contains outlines of the features of the worldview inherent in the era - normative-rhetorical in the baroque (Mikhailov emphasizes the metaphysical nature of Beer's laughter and the desire of his characters to cognize the fullness and all varieties of baroque life), post-rhetorical in romanticism (Eichendorff's loafer is partly a romantic hero - he makes a trip to Italy, is in love with a beautiful stranger, but also carries Biedermeier features - he returns home and finds a wife) and in realism (Oblomov travels only in his dreams, and the German romantic spirit is rationa-lized in the image of Stolz). With all the similarity of motifs and topoi in the three works, the writers revealed to us through their characters their connection with their homeland and with the past; here are the dreams of the future, and the bitterness of self-consciousness, and the joy of being, and poetry, and the prose of life; here is the soul of writers in their personal, national and global elements.

AB  - The Earth's surface is constantly changing due to various anthropogenic and natural causes. Leveraging machine learning to monitor land cover changes over time may provide valuable information on the transformation of the Earth's environment. This study focuses on the discovery of land cover changes in bi-temporal, Sentinel-2 images. In particular, we rely on a Siamese network trained with labelled, imagery data of the same Earth's scene acquired with Sentinel-2 at different times. Subsequently, we adopt a transfer learning strategy to adapt the Siamese network to Sentinel-2 data acquired in any new unlabeled scene. To deal with the lack of change labels in the new scene, transfer learning is performed with change pseudo-labels estimated in the new scene in unsupervised manner. We assess the effectiveness of the proposed change detection method in two couples of images acquired with Sentinel-2, at different times, in the urban areas of Cupertino and Las Vegas.

TI  - Sea Surface Temperature Variability and Marine Heat Waves over the Aegean, Ionian, and Cretan Seas from 2008-2021
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The sea surface temperature (SST) is an important factor and indicator of the sea water quality, with various ecological and anthropogenic implications. We used high-resolution satellite-derived SST data, in tandem with field observations and long-term meteorological data, to investigate the spatial and interannual SST variability over the Aegean, Ionian, and Cretan (AIC) Seas during the recent 14-year period (2008-2021). Increasing trends were identified for most of the sub-basins of the AIC Seas. The numbers and durations (days) of the marine heat waves (MHWs) have significantly increased, especially during the last quadrennial period (2018-2021). Changes have been detected in both the maximum and minimum values; however, the trend of the mean annual values is mainly associated with the interannual increases in the lowest values (weaker minima during the cold seasons). The interannual variability and the increasing positive trends of the air temperature are very similar to the SST variations, showing a 5-to-10-day lag between the seasonal time series of the two parameters for all regions; however, extreme atmospheric events (e.g., cold fronts or heat waves) have a more direct impact on the SST variability (zero lag). MHWs were more frequent over the northern Aegean Sea, especially in Thermaikos Gulf, which is characterized as a "hot spot" for MHWs. MHWs were rarer over the southern regions, especially over the southeastern Aegean and Cretan Seas. A stratified upper ocean, controlled by buoyant brackish plumes, such as the Black Sea Waters (BSW) in the northern Aegean, may increase the heat storage capacity of the surface water masses, contributing to the further warming of the ocean. This was the case in the summer of 2021, which was a unique year for the AIC Seas, and especially for the northern Aegean, which revealed the highest SST values among all the study years. The satellite-derived observations of the 2008-2021 period showed increasing trends for all coastal waters, strong trend slopes for most of the coasts of the northern Aegean and central Ionian Seas, and milder trend slopes in the eastern Aegean.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

AB  - Short extreme events have significant impact on landscape and ecosystems in low-lying and exposed areas such as deltaic systems. In this context, this paper proposes a combined methodology for the mapping and monitoring of the flooding and water quality dynamics of coastal areas under extreme storms from Sentinel 2 imagery. The proposed methodology has been applied in a coastal bay of the Ebro Delta (Catalonia, NE Spain) to evaluate jointly the impact of Gloria storm (January 2020) in land-flooding and water quality. The experimental results show that the Gloria storm had a strong morphological impact and altered the water quality (chl-a) dynamics. The results show a recovery in terms of water quality after some weeks but in contrast the coastal morphology did not show the same degree of resilience. This paper is the first step of an overall goal that is to set the bases in a long term, for a workflow for rapid response and continuous monitoring of storm effects in coastal areas and/or highly valuable ecosystems such as the Ebro Delta.

AB  - Extracting building information using artificial sources from satellite and remote sensing data has become a valuable tool for a variety of applications such as, damage detection, infrastructure construction, land use management, and building energy consumption estimation. Recently, deep learning methods have made much progress in extracting building footprints from remote sensing (RS) imagery but many challenges persist. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been the fundamental way to extract segments of buildings, but they are not able to capture accurately the global connectivity of representations. To overcome this boundary, researchers proposed Vision Transformers which achieved state of the art accuracy in computer vision tasks [1]. Especially in building extraction from RS imagery several architectures that based on Transformers have been proposed lately. However the experimental scenarios make them difficult to compare and extract meaningful conclusions. Considering this, the current manuscript presents an analytical comparison between diverse Transformer-based semantic segmentation architectures, aiming to observe their predictive performance and computational efficiency in three building footprint extraction RS imagery datasets. Moreover, this work introduces four new architectures which are extensively compared with literature baselines.

TI  - Appraising groundwater potential zones using geospatial and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) techniques in Andasa-Tul watershed, Upper Blue Nile basin, Ethiopia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - An integrated approach of remote sensing, geographic information system and multicriteria decision analysis of analytical hierarchical process (AHP) were applied to delineate groundwater potential (GWP) zones in Andasa-Tul watershed, Upper Blue Nile Basin, Ethiopia with an area of 1872 km(2). Nine GWP influencing thematic layers comprising lithology, lineament density, geomorphology, slope, soil, drainage density, land use/land cover, rainfall and depth to groundwater level prepared from conventional and satellite data were used. The thematic layers and classes within them were given scale values based on literature and experts' decision by using Satty's AHP. The thematic layers have been integrated via their weights/rates using weighted overlay spatial function tool of ArcGIS to provide GWP map. The result shows that GWP map comprises 250.8 km(2) (13.4%) very good, 132.9 km(2) (7.1%) good, 441.8 km(2) (23.6%) moderate, 662.7 km(2) (35.4%) poor and 383.8 km(2) (20.5%) very poor zones. Validation of the GWP map with existing boreholes and springs yield shows 83.8% agreement indicating good accuracy of the method. The map removal sensitivity analysis result reveals that GWP is more sensitive to lithology (mean variation index, 1.92%) and less sensitive to geomorphology (mean variation index, 0.59%). Similarly, from the single layer sensitivity analysis, lithology and slope are found to be more effective parameters, whereas rainfall and depth to groundwater level are less effective variables. The generated GWP map in the study region can be used as important guideline for locating GWP areas for further exploration, planning and management of the groundwater resources.

TI  - Seasonal variability in copepod biomass in a cyclonic eddy in the Bay of La Paz, southern Gulf of California, Mexico
T2  - CIENCIAS MARINAS
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the main groups comprising marine zooplankton, copepods play an important role due to their position in the trophic web. We assessed the copepod biomass in a cyclonic eddy during 2 contrasting seasons in the Bay of La Paz, southern Gulf of California, which is characterized by high biological productivity. Two oceanographic expeditions took place in the winter of 2006 and the summer of 2009; a CTD probe was used to determine the physical structure of the water column, and oblique zooplankton hauls collected zooplankton samples. Satellite data were used to visualize the chlorophyll a (Chia) distribution patterns. The results showed a well-defined cyclonic eddy in both seasons, with a diameter of similar to 25 km and geostrophic velocities >50 cm.s(-1) in its periphery. At the edges of the eddy, Chla was high, reaching similar to 3 mg.m(-3) in winter. The maximum calanoid copepod biomass occurred in winter, reaching 6.6 mg.m(-3) in the western bay close to the coast; moreover, their distribution corresponded well with the Chla and circulation patterns, forming a belt shape following the periphery of the eddy, with a second peak close to the connection with the gulf. The mean values of copepod biomass exhibited a pattern with alternating calanoids-cyclopoids between winter and summer within the cyclonic eddy, with calanoid biomass higher than cyclopoid biomass in winter, which was the opposite of summer. The results highlight the impacts of the eddy on the planktonic ecosystem through its influence on the hydrographic conditions in the water column. Other factors, such as ecological interactions, population dynamics, and feeding habits, may also play a role. Feeding behavior is affected by the high concentrations of Chla, which represent a source of food for copepods observed around the eddy.

M3  - Book Review
AB  - This article presents an analysis of a collection of studies by Tamas Krausz, a famous Hungarian historian, professor at the Eotvos Lorand University of Budapest. The collection contains articles by the scholar for the period between 1980 and 2020. The Review highlights the key topics of the articles presented in the collection: the history of the Russian Revolution, the Second World War, and the role of the Hungarian troops in it, youth movements in Europe and the world in the 1960s-1970s, and the crisis and collapse of the USSR. The review proves that the key processes of the world's development in the twentieth century are assessed by Tamas Krausz through the prism of his worldview, from the standpoint of a leftwing intellectual who was formed in the atmosphere of socialist Hungary, where the degree of spiritual freedom was higher than in the Soviet Union. The Hungarian historian critically assesses both the experience of the USSR in the 1940s-1980s and the current situation in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. The review substantiates the conclusion that, according to Tamas Krausz, the socialist experiment was an attempt to implement an alternative variant of the development of society, and to ensure compliance with the principles of social justice.

AB  - ESA Forest Carbon Monitoring project (FCM) is developing Earth Observation based, user-centric approaches for forest carbon monitoring. Forest carbon accounting based on forest inventory requires precise and timely estimation of forest variables at various spatial levels accompanied by verifiable uncertainty information. In this paper, we present the algorithm trade-off and selection approach and preliminary results of the algorithm intercomparison exercise in the FCM project. The studies were performed over 7 European test sites located in Finland, Ireland, Romania, Spain and Switzerland, and one tropical forest site in Peru. EO datasets were represented by Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, TanDEM-X and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 imagery. Examined approaches include popular parametric and SAR/InSAR scattering physics based approaches, and nonparametric and machine learning approaches such as k-NN, random forests, support vector regression.

TI  - Aerial Imagery Paddy Seedlings Inspection Using Deep Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years complex food security issues caused by climatic changes, limitations in human labour, and increasing production costs require a strategic approach in addressing problems. The emergence of artificial intelligence due to the capability of recent advances in computing architectures could become a new alternative to existing solutions. Deep learning algorithms in computer vision for image classification and object detection can facilitate the agriculture industry, especially in paddy cultivation, to alleviate human efforts in laborious, burdensome, and repetitive tasks. Optimal planting density is a crucial factor for paddy cultivation as it will influence the quality and quantity of production. There have been several studies involving planting density using computer vision and remote sensing approaches. While most of the studies have shown promising results, they have disadvantages and show room for improvement. One of the disadvantages is that the studies aim to detect and count all the paddy seedlings to determine planting density. The defective paddy seedlings' locations are not pointed out to help farmers during the sowing process. In this work we aimed to explore several deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) models to determine which one performs the best for defective paddy seedling detection using aerial imagery. Thus, we evaluated the accuracy, robustness, and inference latency of one- and two-stage pretrained object detectors combined with state-of-the-art feature extractors such as EfficientNet, ResNet50, and MobilenetV2 as a backbone. We also investigated the effect of transfer learning with fine-tuning on the performance of the aforementioned pretrained models. Experimental results showed that our proposed methods were capable of detecting the defective paddy rice seedlings with the highest precision and an F1-Score of 0.83 and 0.77, respectively, using a one-stage pretrained object detector called EfficientDet-D1 EficientNet.

AB  - This paper aims to newly investigate the meaning of life in this era when various discussions on life and ethical living are commonly raised by comparing and examining the theories of life proposed by Confucianism and Daesoon Thought.Both Confucianism and Daesoon Thought explain the creation of all things as having been based on the principles of life in heaven and earth. Specifically, there is the will to live (生意 saengeui) and also divine beings (神明 sinmyeong). For this reason, everything in heaven and earth is created by obtaining the same principle of life such that it is an equal being with the same intrinsic value. Here the consciousness of being one body amid all things as one living thing is established. The consciousness of being one body forms an organic worldview in which all things are one. As a result, all things in heaven and earth exist within a mutual organic relationship, and that makes oneself and others precious life partners that coexist rather than separate beings.Nevertheless, both Confucianism and Daesoon Thought define humans as outstanding beings, set aside for a higher purpose than other beings. The excellence of humans is that by constantly engaging in self reflection and completing tasks through independent efforts, they thereby achieve the great moral doctrine of coexistence and symbiosis. In this process, cultivation of character (修養 suyang) and cultivation of the Dao (修道 sudo) are presented as means to realize one’s nature and establish the right human image. By realizing nature or humanity through the cultivation of character and cultivation of the Dao, humans fulfill their responsibilities and missions by independently participating in being nourished by Heaven and Earth (天地化育 cheonjihwayuk) or the Reordering Works of Heaven and Earth (天地公事 cheonjigongsa), both being based in the concept of the three generative forces of Heaven, Earth, and Humanity (天ㆍ地ㆍ人 cheonㆍjiㆍin).In the end, the theories of life posited by Confucianism and Daesoon Thought are based on a consciousness of being one body. Both emphasize the characteristics and roles of humans who are distinguished from other beings and phenomena. At this time, human characteristics and roles are revealed as the reasons for which humans have a responsibility and mission take care of all things. From this point of view, it can be seen that the theoretical structure of Neo-Confucianism and Daesoon Thought, in regards to their theories of life, is rather similar.

AB  - This paper compares and examines the theory of Inmulseongi of sunam(An jung-bok, 1712~1791) and Dasan(Jeong yak-yong, 1762~1836) who are members of the Toegye school, Seongho school, Silhak scholar, and reveals their similarities and differences.In conclusion, both Sunam and Dasan within the same Seongho school argue for the theory of Inmulseongi. However, there is a difference in the content of the theory of Inmulseongi that they claim. If Sunam develops the theory of Inmulseongi from the standpoint of inheriting Neo-confucianism worldview, Dasan develops the theory of Inmulseongi from the standpoint of criticizing the Neo-confucianism worldview. This is evident in the interpretation of Seong(性), and if Sunam is interpreted as a foresight of human nature in the tradition of Neo-confucianism, Dasan is interpreted as a favorite symbol. This is nothing short of saying whether it is a succession of existing Neo-confucian traditions or a shift to a new paradigm to overcome the limitations of Neo-confucianism. This is the theoretical difference between these.Nevertheless, similar theoretical structures are revealed in the process of arguing that  are different. Unlike Sunam interpreting the difference between human nature and thing nature in the composition of Sadan/bonyeonjiseong and Chiljeong/kijiljiseong, Dasan interprets it as the composition of Dosim/doeuijiseong and Insim/kijiljiseong. This is the theoretical parallel between these.

TI  - Deep Learning-Based Spatiotemporal Data Fusion Using a Patch-to-Pixel Mapping Strategy and Model Comparisons
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tradeoffs among the spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions of satellite sensors make it difficult to acquire remote sensing images at both high spatial and high temporal resolutions from an individual sensor. Studies have developed methods to fuse spatiotemporal data from different satellite sensors, and these methods often assume linear changes in surface reflectance across time and adopt empirical rules and handcrafted features. Here, we propose a dense spatiotemporal fusion (DenseSTF) network based on the convolutional neural network (CNN) to deal with these problems. DenseSTF uses a patch-to-pixel modeling strategy that can provide abundant texture details for each pixel in the target fine image to handle heterogeneous landscapes and models both forward and backward temporal dependencies to account for land cover changes. Moreover, DenseSTF adopts a mapping function with few assumptions and empirical rules, which allows for establishing reliable relationships between the coarse and fine images. We tested DenseSTF in three contrast scenes with different degrees of heterogeneity and temporal changes, and made comparisons with three rule-based fusion approaches and three CNNs. Experimental results indicate that DenseSTF can provide accurate fusion results and outperform the other tested methods, especially when the land cover changes abruptly. The structure of the deep learning networks largely impacts the success of data fusion. Our study developed a novel approach based on CNN using a patch-to-pixel mapping strategy and highlighted the effectiveness of the deep learning networks in the spatiotemporal fusion of the remote sensing data.

AB  - Monitoring infrastructures has become an essential aspect of civil engineering for site inspection, design verification, long-term reliability and safety examining. The synthetic aperture radar onboard satellite is the most excellent sensor for measuring displacement in the extensive coverage area with high spatial resolution. This study aims to design and develop the conceptual framework of the InSAR time-series analysis for automatically detecting the structure behaviour in terms of feasibility and applications. Preliminary proves of the concept are the case study of Srinagarind Dam, Bhumibol Dam, Sirikit Dam, Vajiralongkorn Dam, Lamtakong Jolabha Vadhana Power Plant, and Mae Moh Power Plant, respectively. We obtained over six hundred Sentinel-1 scenes from 2017 to 2021. The time-series displacements were estimated as -14.89 mm/yr away and +19.29 mm/yr toward a line-of-sight (LOS) propagation direction. The results show the potential of Cband SAR sensors continuous monitoring for the particular case of dams, reservoir, and mining site monitoring.

TI  - Faithful Collective Farmers and "Communist Priests": Coexistence of Orthodox and "Socialist" Cultures in the Life of the Soviet Village in the Late Stalin and Khrushchev Periods
T2  - NOVEISHAYA ISTORIYA ROSSII-MODERN HISTORY OF RUSSIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper is devoted to the problem of the existence of Orthodox traditions in the life of Soviet collective farms during post-war decades. Its main goal is to find out how the traditional confessional culture of the village has adapted to the realities of "developed socialism". Considering the Orthodox practices of Soviet peasants in the late Stalin and Khrushchev periods, the author departs from the traditionally rigid opposition of the concepts of "Soviet" and "religious", starting from the thesis about the possibility of mutual influence of the corresponding cultures and their practical coordination at the level of everyday life. The research source base was made up of materials from the central and regional offices of the Council for the Affairs of the Russian Orthodox Church under the Council of Ministers of the USSR, as well as documents of party structures that actively discussed the problems of mass religiosity during the Khrushchev period. Based on them, the paper discusses the depth of penetration of Soviet ideology into village life, the manifestations of the post-war Orthodox revival, the attitude of local party cadres to it and specific ways of adapting "village Orthodoxy" to official Soviet discourses. The paper concludes that traditional Orthodox practices were filled with additional meanings corresponding to the values of patriotism, socialist construction, and the struggle for peace officially declared by the Soviet state. In addition, the appearance of a new type of "Soviet priest" in the village is demonstrated - a priest who shares communist values with the exception of atheism and broadcasts them to his parishioners. Finally, the paper shows examples of practical coordination by peasants of elements of Orthodox and new "socialist" culture both at the level of worldview and in everyday life.

TI  - Temperate Grassland Afforestation Dynamics in the Aguapey Valuable Grassland Area between 1999 and 2020: Identifying the Need for Protection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Temperate grasslands are considered the most endangered terrestrial ecosystem worldwide; the existent areas play a key role in biodiversity conservation. The Aguapey Valuable Grassland Area (VGA), one of the most well-preserved temperate grassland areas within Argentina, is currently threatened by the anthropogenic expansion of exotic tree plantations. Little is known about the impacts of afforestation over temperate grassland landscape structures; therefore, the aim of this study is to characterize Aguapey VGA landscape structural changes between 1999 and 2020 based on remotely sensed data. This involves the generation of land cover maps for four annual periods based on unsupervised classification of Landsat 5 TM and 8 OLI images, the estimation of landscape metrics, and the transition analysis between land cover types and annual periods. The area covered by temperate grassland is shown to have decreased by almost 22% over the 20 year-period studied, due to the expansion of tree plantation cover. The afforestation process took place mainly between 1999 and 2007 in the northern region of the Aguapey VGA, which led first to grassland perforation and subsequently to grassland attrition; however, Aguapey's cultural tradition of cattle ranching could have partially inhibited the expansion of exotic trees over the final years of the study. The evidence of grassland loss and fragmentation within the Aguapey VGA should be considered as an early warning to promote the development of sustainable land use policies, mainly focused towards the Aguapey VGA's southern region where temperate grassland remains the predominant land cover type.

AB  - Coastal areas are attractive for human populations as they are important areas of business and socio-economic activities. The Prefecture of Western Greece is experiencing population movement from the urban to the coastal areas causing nuisance and changes to the marine environment. These changes need to be assessed systematically in order to build models that can predict the evolution in the future. In addition, except for the man-made infrastructures, natural phenomena such as undulation, wind and coastal currents affect the shape of the beach, the shoreline and the seabed.Remote sensing is an efficient way to measure these changes repeatedly using high resolution satellite data, air photos and airborne Lidar in conjunction with Digital Surface Models (DSMs) and orthophoto maps. These methods have disadvantages as they are high cost, especially in cases where multitemporal data is deeded.Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) photogrammetry, offers a reliable alternative solution to the acquisition of high accuracy spatial data along the littoral zone, representing a rapid low-cost tool for coastline monitoring.In the present study, the littoral area of the bay of Arkoudi situated in the Prefecture of Ilia's, Greece, has been used as test site. Repeated UAV campaigns were performed in 2020, 2021 and 2022 in synergy with extensive Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements and bathy metric campaigns. RGB and multispectral UAV data were processed in order to extract the coastline, the topography and the inclination of the beach and to estimate the evolution of the littoral zone of the area.

AB  - The current study investigates the shoreline forecasting results combining the IRS and SPOT medium resolution satellite imagery with the high-resolution air-photos. The littoral area of the bay of Katakolo situated in the Prefecture of Ilia's, Greece, has been used as a test site.Past shoreline positions have been demarcated, through on-screen digitizing method, for the years of 1945, 1960, 1965, 1968, 1975, 1987, and 1996, based on the respective high-resolution images. The shoreline evolution for the 1945-1996 period was estimated for each dataset via the Linear Regression Rate (LRR) using for the 1996 the shorelines derived from the High Resolution (HR), SPOT, and IRS datasets respectively. The results were cross-validated using the R-squared, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and the Mean Annual Error (MAE) coefficient methods. In addition, future position of the shoreline (forecasted shoreline) was estimated for 10 years (2006) by alternating the reference shoreline of the 1996 with the relative shoreline derived from the IRS and SPOT-3 satellite images respectively. The integrated forecasting function of the fifth version of the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) tool of the ArcGIS software was used for the computations. The End Point Rate (EPR) was calculated for the 1996 - 2006 period, using the 1996 actual and the 2006 forecasted shorelines based on the SPOT and the IRS data, and compared to the respective rates derived from the high-resolution actual shorelines. Moreover, the Shoreline Change Envelope (SCE) rates were computed in order to estimate the mean rate of distance between the 2006 actual and forecasted shoreline of each dataset.The images have been orthorectified and georeferenced to Hellenic Geodetic Reference System of 1987 (Greek Grid) using Leica Photogrammetry Suite (LPS), while transects every 30 meters along the coastline were created and used for the measurements.It was proved that although both datasets provide similar results, the SPOT (Pan) images seem to have an advantage, while the comparison based on the forecasting models should be avoided in sites where infrastructures have taken place as they distort the results.

T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Our study establishes general statistical methods for estimating the accuracy of diachronic low-resolution satellite instruments for shoreline monitoring using the most common satellite datasets such as Landsat and Sentinel-2. The study coast is extended from Cape Araxos to Rio Port, in the Gulf of Patras in Northwestern Peloponnese, Greece. Landsat archival data from 1996, 2008, 2016, and 2018 (30 m spatial resolution) covering the entire study area were used consisting of images acquired by the respective instruments due the time such as the Thematic Mapper (TM), the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), and the Operational Land Imager (OLI). Moreover, for the years of 2016 and 2018, Sentinel-2 imagery with 10 m spatial resolution was used. High-resolution datasets of the respective years were used as reference for the calculations. "Generate near table" and "mean center," two simple and fast statistical tools of the ArcMap v5 toolbox, were applied, and a comparison due to the relative results of shoreline change envelope (SCE) rates was performed. It is the first time that such tools are used to evaluate the accuracy of shorelines derived from low-resolution images. It was proved that the generate near table tool produces very similar results to the SCE tool of the Digital Shoreline Analysis System. There is a strong correlation between the two tools strongly dependent on the dataset being used (Landsat or Sentinel). The analysis of the Sentinel-2 datasets showed that the specific sensor can discriminate the waterline with better accuracy than all Landsat instruments and could be useful to relative studies especially when the procedure follows the subpixel level algorithms. Finally, the results showed that the upgrades of the Landsat instruments from TM to ETM and to OLI did not improve the accuracy of land-water delineation.

T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating reliably chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration from remote sensing images constitutes a vastly superior alternative to field measurements. To this end, spectral pixel signatures are used commonly for developing regression models. Spatial information has been traditionally ignored in this context, as Chl-a concentration is a spatially localized measurement, and sensors' spatial resolutions have been relatively low in the past. However, the increased spatial resolution of newer satellites and a recent study have given strong indications that spatial-spectral description can boost estimation performance. Consequently, in this letter, we address the problem of Chl-a estimation from remote sensing images using attribute profiles, one of the paramount spatial-spectral description tools. We further propose an original technique to remove their cumbersome threshold requirement via operating on each pixel's "attribute lineage." We validate our approach with multispectral Sentinel-2 images, and a data set formed by field measurements spanning almost two years over Lake Balik (Turkey). We show that the proposed method outperforms various alternatives in terms of regression performance, across multiple experimental setups, and finally, we highlight a validation malpractice encountered often in the field of water quality estimation.

Planted area estimation method using SAR data based on the proposed thresholding is also proposed. Through comparative research on the proposed and the conventional thresholding methods with RADARSAT-2 SAR imagery data, it is found that the proposed method is superior to the conventional methods. Also, it is found that the proposed thresholding method does work for rice paddy field detection with SAR imagery data through the comparison between the result by the classified method with the proposed method and field survey report of the rice paddy fields.

AB  - The Unexpected Island is a fantasy novel that begins when the heroine BarbaraMeric accidentally crashes into a small island that is not marked on the map while flying with her fiance Paul, and depicts the future of humans starting in 2004.Laos, like the island's spiritual pillar, argues for the utopian world ideology on the island. And his ideology reminds us of the fact that we, living in scientific rationalism in modern civilization today, need to find a lost utopia. At this point, The main purpose of this study is to re-read Lin Yutang's The Unexpected Island and examine the world of utopia revealed there.Lin Yutang's The Unexpected Island showed that human beings damaged by the mechanized world and scientific rationalism, which has been rediscovered to be integrated with nature, and further indicating that the eastern and western cultures can reach the utopian world through a new process of integration. In particular, the utopia in his works related to the romantic world in that it was embodied as a world oriented toward the past. Therefore, it can be said that the utopia he saw was not a world living coldly in a modernized system and society, but a form of relationship in which you and me, even the world are integrated. Above all, Lin Yutang suggests the importance of utopia in that it wanted to create an ideal community of humans living in a peaceful world where Eastern and Western cultures coexist.From this perspective, a careful observation of the significance of utopia in Lin Yutang's The Unexpected Island can not only urge human beings to reflect on the shortcomings of modernity, but also an important attempt to reflect on its meaning. In addition, Lin Yutang's utopian worldview is thought to open up the research horizon that can expect more active literary exchanges between the East and the West at a global level.

AB  - This paper proposes a parallel scheme for suppressing speckle noise in SAR images. The designed technique is based on forming 3D arrays of a clustered image by areas and using Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) estimation, where the a priori information is obtained by the Discrete Wavelet Transformation (DWT), improving the despeckling quality. Moreover, a variant of the bilateral filter is used as a post-processing stage to recover and enhance edges' quality after the filtering procedure. The proposed scheme was implemented in serial and two parallel versions. The first one uses OpenMP to parallelize over a multi-core CPU, and the second utilizes CUDA to be executed in a GPU. Experimental results have demonstrated that the framework guarantees a good despeckling performance on SAR images obtained from the TerraSAR-X database, considering objective quality criteria such as Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) and Edge Preservation Index (EPI). Furthermore, the parallel implementations' simulation results present their efficiency for a real-time environment.

M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, using the example of the shamanic ritual Shachyg (sprinkling, treatment of the spirits of the mountains and rivers), the ritual activity of the so-called modern shamans who have not undergone the ordeals of the "shamanic disease" is considered. They are "discovered" by a more experienced local who has sometimes at-tended training courses with Khakass or Tuvan shamans and has the relevant credentials. Some Kams also spoke of the shamanic gift being inherited within the family from grandfathers or grandmothers.The Shachyg ritual was performed in 2019 in Tashtagol by S. Teneshev (born in 1973) and other shamans on the Day of Indigenous Peoples of the World. At the beginning of the ritual, the reason for the ceremony is stated, and the most "painful" current problems of the whole people or a certain group of participants are listed, which can be solved with the help of higher powers. The example of a ritual text has shown that the language of ritual texts is reduced to the everyday level and is very poor. In the text of S. Teneshev that we studied, there are Russicisms, interjective exclamations, names of geographical places (e.g., the mountain Mustag), Belkovo (a suburb of Tashtagol ), but no archaisms and vocabulary connected with shamanism, and there are no allegories, similes and other means of expression characteristic of earlier records of rituals. He mentions only the god Kudai , the spirits of mountains and rivers, and the spirit of fire. However, the ritual itself is characterized by detailed treatment of the spirits of rivers and mountains, the use of ritual objects during the ritual (tambourine t?ur, kai-komus), and the presence of national costumes. During the ritual, S. Teneshev, together with other shamans, asks various eezi spirits for a majestic holiday and blessings for all the Shors present: people preserving their native language, wealth, growth of livestock, childbearing, health, happiness, and good luck.This ritual is particularly interesting because in the context of globalization, with the departure of the authentic carriers of the traditional worldview in modern society, there is a demand for the revival and maintenance of national traditions through the reconstruction and popularization of shamanistic rituals, the so-called "neo-shamanism". It is very important that researchers record these processes, analyze the material, ethnographic, and textual components of the "new" rituals, and compare them in the future with the authentic shamanic rituals recorded in the 20th century and with the global trends of neo-shamanism.

AB  - Global warming is causing increasing Heat Waves that affect human health. High temperatures markedly increase morbidity and mortality. Urban Heat Islands increase the effects of Heat Waves and are a serious inconvenience to human health and comfort. Cities can substantially increase local temperatures and reduce temperature drop at night. During the night, the greater thermal inertia of the central areas reduces their cooling capacity. On the other hand, it is important to highlight that urban vegetation plays a key role in adapting cities to Global Warming and Urban Heat Island. Green areas have lower temperatures than the rest of land uses and generate a cooling effect that spreads to their surroundings creating a "cool island" effect. The main objective of this paper is to establish the nocturnal land surface temperature and land surface air temperature of Barcelona Metropolitan Area (35 municipalities, 636 km(2), 3.3 million inhabitants) in an episode of a nocturnal heatwave and to estimate its possible impact on health and mortality. Subsequently, nighttime temperatures are analysed in this extreme heat context to determine their spatial distribution and detect the urban landscapes that are most vulnerable to extreme night heat. Modelling of land surface temperature must reveal the elements that determine night Urban Heat Island and consequently identify actions that can be implemented at urban planning level to refresh the environment during the night and thus increase the resilience of the most vulnerable landscapes and improve residents' health. This paper studies the effect of urban greenery and green infrastructures on Nighttime Urban Heat Island and propose climate adaptation measures and design for urban green areas to decrease high temperature in a Heat Wave context, which contributes to reducing the serious negative impacts on people's health.

AB  - The special significance of green spaces in cities has been fully demonstrated. Green spaces are key elements to improve the quality of urban life. They contribute to human well-being by providing ecosystem services such as climate regulation, capture of pollutants and flood control. They also promote contact between residents and community integration, and offer a favourable place for health, relaxation and contemplation of nature. Greener environments have lower crime rates. They tend to have a positive effect on people and induce mental vitality. Green spaces can help to reduce urban heat islands and generate true cold islands in urbanized environments. Finally, urban parks provide economic value for cities, including an increase in the value of properties in their proximity.The literature on urban climate has highlighted the singular importance of urban greenery for mitigating urban heat islands (UHI) and extreme temperatures. Urban vegetation plays a fundamental role in adapting to climate change in cities. Green areas register lower temperatures than the rest of urban spaces and have a cooling effect that spreads to their surroundings to create a real "cool island" effect.The World Health Organization recommends that green spaces (of at least 0.5 hectares) should be accessible within a 300 m linear distance of residences. However, the concepts of "park" and "green area" are vague and imprecise, and there is no clear consensus about what should be considered urban greenery. Highly artificialized spaces, with high proportions of sealed soil and no vegetation, are often considered "parks" in urban planning. Likewise, forest spaces, with few artificial elements, are usually considered urban "parks".The use of satellite images has helped to study urban vegetation. Indicators such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and many others allow us to understand the extent and quality of greenery, and to assess its impact on day and night temperatures. In this context, the aim of this study was to examine the extent of vegetation in Barcelona Metropolitan Area (636 km(2), 3,303,927 inhabitants) from various satellite sensors and indicators of greenness, to determine the thresholds from which it is possible to speak with rigor of urban green.

T2  - VIDEOSURGERY AND OTHER MINIINVASIVE TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The diagnostic and therapeutic approach to axillary lymph nodes is considered indispensable in the treatment of breast cancer patients.Aim: To investigate the effectiveness of 3D freehand SPECT (fhSPECT) in sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping in breast cancer, compared with the use of a conventional gamma probe.Material and methods: We retrospectively compared the fhSPECT lymph node mapping modality, with gamma probe detection in early-stage, clinically node-negative breast cancer patients, with biopsy-confirmed malignancy. The two techniques were compared based on the average number of LNs excised per axilla. The duration of SLN mapping was also compared between the two groups. The performance of the two methods on obese and post-systemic therapy patients was evaluated. FhSPECT was used in 150 cases, while the gamma probe was employed in 50 cases.Results: FhSPECT detected at least 3 nodes in 83.3% of the patients vs. 72.0% with the gamma-probe (p = 0.107). The mean number of SLNs excised per axilla was 3.66 using the gamma-probe and 4.18 with fhSPECT (p = 0.03). The average surgical time was 39 +/- 7 min with the gamma-probe and 37.54 +/- 17 min with fhSPECT (p = 0.228). Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) mean surgical time evolved from 40.2 +/- 20.77 min to 32.35 +/- 10.46 min (p = 0.033). In obese patients, a reduction in surgical times was noted from 45.5 +/- 3.09 min to 44.04 +/- 20.9 (p = 0.27), in addition to a significant increase in average LN detection in the fhSPECT group (4.26 +/- 1.44) compared to the gamma-probe group (3.2 +/- 1.65) (p = 0.043).Conclusions: The use of the fhSPECT modality is effective and safe, and, when compared to the gamma-probe, has signifi-cant advantages in SLN mapping.

TI  - A New Methodology for Wheat Attenuation Correction at C-Band VV-Polarized Backscatter Time Series
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wheat is one of the most important crops worldwide, and thus, the use of remote sensing data for wheat monitoring has attracted much interest. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations show that at C-band and VV polarization, wheat canopy attenuates the surface scattering component from the underlying soil during a significant part of its growth cycle. This behavior needs to be accounted for or corrected before soil moisture (SM) retrieval is attempted. The objective of this article is to develop a new method for wheat attenuation correction (WATCOR) applicable to Sentinel-1 VV time series and based solely on the information contained in the time series itself. The hypothesis of WATCOR is that without attenuation, VV backscatter would follow a stable long-term trend during the agricultural season, with short-term variations caused by SM dynamics. The method relies on time-series smoothing and changing point detection, and its implementation follows a series of simple steps. The performance of the method was compared by evaluating the correlation between backscatter and SM content in six wheat fields with available SM data. The water cloud model (WCM) was also applied as a benchmark. The results showed that WATCOR successfully removed the attenuation in the time series and achieved the highest correlation with SM, thus improving markedly the correlation of the original backscatter. WATCOR can be easily implemented, as it does not require parameterization or any external data, only an approximate indication of the period where attenuation is likely to occur.

TI  - A Combination of Spatial Domain Filters to Detect Surface Ocean Current from Multi-Sensor Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This research investigates the applicability of combining spatial filter's algorithm to extract surface ocean current. Accordingly, the raster filters were tested on 80-13,505 daily images to detect Kuroshio Current (KC) on weekly, seasonal, and climatological scales. The selected raster filters are convolution, Laplacian, north gradient, sharpening, min/max, histogram equalization, standard deviation, and natural break. In addition, conventional data set of sea surface currents, sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface height (SSH), and non-conventional data such as total heat flux, surface density (SSD), and salinity (SSS) were employed. Moreover, controversial data on ocean color are included because very few studies revealed that chlorophyll-alpha is a proxy to SST in the summer to extract KC. Interestingly, the performance of filters is uniform and thriving for seasonal and on a climatological scale only by combining the algorithms. In contrast, the typical scenario of identifying Kuroshio signatures using an individual filter and by designating a value spectrum is inapplicable for specific seasons and data set. Furthermore, the KC's centerlines computed from SST, SSH, total heat flux, SSS, SSD, and chlorophyll-alpha correlate with sea surface currents. Deviations are observed in the various segments of Kuroshio's centerline extracted from heat flux, chlorophyll-alpha, and SSS flowing across Tokara Strait from northeast Taiwan to the south of Japan.

TI  - Towards reconstructing Africa: Recuperation and responsibility in Ayi Kwei Armah's The Healers
T2  - TYDSKRIF VIR LETTERKUNDE
M3  - Article
AB  - A product of Africa's pre-colonial and colonial history, Ayi Kwei Armah's fifth novel, The Healers (1978), is steeped in an African communalistic worldview and the functional conception of art. In this article we examine the multiple dimensions to recuperation within the context of the reconstruction of Africa, the continental search for utopia, and the responsibility that this places on Africans. Using Armah's communitarian perspectives on health as a guide, we identify six interlocking subsets of recuperation as healing, re-creation, renascence, repossession, recall, and Sankofa (return). Informed by Molefi Kete Asante's construct of agency and Armah's communalistic injunctions to readers, we establish that permeating each of these building blocks is the responsibility of Africans to operationalize the reconstruction of Africa, the leitmotif of the novel. As helpers, visionaries, and custodians of vital traditional knowledge and skills, the healers facilitate the sharing of information on Africa's past and future against the background of British colonial domination. We also show that Armah deliberately gives the novel this polysemic title to transcend the spatial, cultural, and epistemic limitations imposed on the continent by the colonial order. We conclude that the social orientation and creative configuration of health in the work are consistent with the diverse and intermingling meanings of recuperation.

TI  - Ordered Test Site Method for Onboard Measurement Results Validation of Medium Resolution Spectroradiometers
T2  - VISNYK NTUU KPI SERIIA-RADIOTEKHNIKA RADIOAPARATOBUDUVANNIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The reduction or elimination of uncertainties is one of the main tasks in the analysis of remote sensing data. For this purpose, the upscaling and downscaling of spectroradiometric data operations are widely used. The downscaling operation is particularly used to validate medium resolution spectroradiometer data. The onboard measurement validation data is a complex task and it includes the solution of such important subtasks as (a) selection of the test site type; (b) determining the site size; (c) determining the sampling order. At the same time, after carrying out selective measurements, the question of scaling up (upscaling or generalization) of the obtained ground data arises, its purpose is to carry out validation of satellite data with low spatial resolution. Solving the problem of remote sensing data validation, terrestrial test sites are often used, their heterogeneity must always be taken into account. This problem is usually solved by applying special weighting coefficients and performing temporary periodic measurements, then using the regularization procedure for the averaged results of iterative calculations. In the absence of temporary changes, the need for regularization is eliminated. In this case, as an alternative, the method of the ordered test section can be proposed, it allows to determine the weight coefficients of the ground validation measurement results, providing a minimum of the newly proposed quadrature cost function. To solve the problem of achieving the proposed cost function minimum, the ordered subsections method as part of a single heterogeneous test section is proposed, the measurements are carried out by a sensor mounted on a low-flying carrier. The optimization problem is formulated to calculate the correction coefficients for the measurement results, where the sum of the squares of difference between the corrected data and the known representative estimate is minimized. The optimization problem is solved using a certain restrictive condition imposed on the sum of the correction factors.

TI  - Retrospective study to assess axillary management and oncological outcome after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for patients with breast cancer
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Preoperative chemotherapy (NAC) has been recognized as the standard of care for patients with locally advanced breast cancer and recently for some patients with stage II and chemoresponsive subtypes (HER2 and TNBC). Lymph node (LN) status is the most important prognostic factor in patients who receive neoadjuvant therapy. Patients who have a positive LN by fine-needle aspiration (or core needle biopsy) before neoadjuvant therapy usually undergo completion axillary dissection at the time of primary tumor resection. Axillary lymph node dissection has been the standard treatment of the axilla after NAC for many years. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) as an alternative can reduce the extent of axillary surgery without compromising the prognostic and predictive value of axillary staging.AimThe aim of this work was to primarily evaluate the effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on axillary nodal status. The secondary objective was to evaluate the percentage of patients who are eligible for SLNB after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.PatientsThis retrospective study was conducted by collecting data during the period from October 2019 to July 2021. The study included 64 patients who had biopsy-proven locally advanced breast cancer with clinically or radiologically positive axillary LNs, had been receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy at the Clinical Oncology Department, and underwent surgery after neoadjuvant therapy at the surgical oncology unit of Alexandria Main University Hospital.Exclusion criteria were as follows:Patients with early-stage breast cancer.Patients with metastatic stage IV breast cancer.Patients unfit for neoadjuvant therapy.Patients who refused neoadjuvant therapy.Patients aged less than 18 years or more than 75 years.Patients with clinically and radiologically negative axilla.MethodsData were collected retrospectively to assess the oncological and surgical outcomes after completing NAC.The files of 450 patients were reviewed, and only 64 patients were eligible patients to be included in our study.ResultsComplete pathological response (ypT0ypN0) was found in six of the 64 patients in our study.Four patients were triple-negative and two patients were HER2-enriched biological subtype.One patient was T1, one patient was T2, one patient was T3, and three patients were T4. One patient was N1, four patients were N2, and one patient was N3.ConclusionPost-neoadjuvant ultrasound is essential for assessment of axillary response. Approximately 44.4% of patients with negative post-neoadjuvant axillary ultrasound can avoid unnecessary ALN clearance.Accurate axillary staging is the cornerstone for omission of axillary clearance after neoadjuvant among patients.

AB  - Wildfire occurrences have been increasing for the past decade, leaving devastating traces across the world. In the recent efforts, remote sensing and airborne missions have been utilized to better understand and manage wildfires. This has resulted in an exponential increase in volume of remote sensing data, which has pushed the need for intelligent automation of data extraction for wildfire studies. Machine learning offers accurate automation in detecting such natural anomalies and enable decision-makers to take actions in a timely manner. Recent advances in machine learning algorithms, namely probabilistic generative methods, allow researchers and decision-makers to step beyond detection and study "what-if" scenarios for wildfire occurrences. Additionally, they offer better imitations to the stochastic behavior of nature, and wildfire events. However, optimizing the performance of these probabilistic generative models is a computationally expensive process, specially using digital computers. On the other hand, quantum computers have recently shown a promise to reduce computationally costly training of such models and provide performance improvements. There is a body of research investigating the potential for improved machine learning methods in which key operations are performed on a quantum computer. In this study, we propose a probabilistic image-to-image segmentation approach combining a very well-known segmentation method, U-NET, with a Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (CVAE) to not only detect wildfires but also describe the stochasticity of the phenomenon and be capable of running "what-if" scenarios. Our proposed model is compatible with training on quantum computers, which results in a quantum-assisted image-to-image segmentation approach and can be used to benchmark the potential benefit of quantum computing over the classical one.

TI  - Epidemiology of influenza in Ghana, 2011 to 2019.
T2  - PLOS global public health
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Influenza virus is an important contributor to acute respiratory illnesses and is estimated to cause up to 650,000 respiratory deaths each year. Ghana recorded influenza viruses as far back as 1918 when the Spanish influenza pandemic led to the death of >100,000 people in a population of 4 million at the time. An outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) among poultry in Ghana in 2007, led to the establishment of virological surveillance for influenza-like illness (ILI) by the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research (NMIMR). This surveillance system, supported by the U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit-No. 3 (NAMRU-3) and the Ghana Health Service (GHS), monitors circulating influenza strains and activity to better understand the epidemiology of influenza in Ghana. We present here the results of this surveillance system from 2011 to 2019. As part of the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) system of the GHS under the Ministry of Health (MOH), oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from patients who met a modified World Health Organization (WHO) case definition for ILI or severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) through a sentinel surveillance system in the country. Samples were transported to the National Influenza Centre (NIC) at the NMIMR and tested for influenza virus using protocols defined by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Selected isolates were sent to the WHO collaborating centre in the United Kingdom for further antigenic characterization. From 2011 to 2019, the NIC tested a total of 21,747 ILI samples and 3,429 SARI samples. Influenza positivity rates were highest in the 5-14 year old group for both ILI (20.8%) and SARI (23.8%). Compared to females, more males were seen at the health facilities for ILI and SARI symptoms with a statistically significant difference in influenza positive ILI (15% vs 13.2%, p <0.001). In terms of absolute numbers, more cases were seen at the health centres during the wet seasons (April to October) compared to the dry seasons (November to March) in Ghana. This study presents 9 years of surveillance data from outpatient and inpatient setting on influenza activity as well as the influenza A subtypes and B lineages that drive the activity. This presents useful information for influenza vaccine selection and administration. Ghana's unique influenza activity patterns also present a challenge in predicting when an outbreak could occur.

TI  - Assessment of Urban Sprawl in Sargodha City using Remotely Sense Data
T2  - ECOLOGICAL QUESTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The current study focuses on tracking urban sprawl in one of the rapidly growing cities of Pakistan i.e., Sargodha. The secondary cities have the capacity to persuade people from rural areas to relocate. In this regard, the current study is unique in that it will give a comprehensive analysis of urban sprawl of Sargodha City. The remotely sensed data is used for this purpose. The study is primarily based on the collecting of both primary and secondary data. For the last 30 years, from 1987 to 2017, primary data was gathered from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the Global Land Cover Facility (GLCF). ERDAS Imagine 2013 is used to classify land use using remotely sensed data. The Kappa Coefficient was used to compute the accuracy assessment of classified maps. Maps are used to depict a comparative analysis of urban sprawl in the city. In addition, regression analysis and simple statistical computations are also utilised to assess dynamic changes in urban sprawl. From 1987 to 2017, a 10-year interval was used to measure change in built-up land using an equation. According to the findings of the study, Sargodha City has experienced considerable changes in land use patterns. This current study is beneficial for policymakers to design the city in a well-planned manner. The appropriate design of cities can pave the way for higher living standards in rapidly growing cities of Pakistan.

TI  - Earth Observation Semantic Data Mining: Latent Dirichlet Allocation-Based Approach
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent advances in remote sensing technology have provided (very) high spatial resolution Earth Observation data with abundant latent semantic information. Conventional data processing algorithms are not capable of extracting the latent semantic information form these data and harness their full potential. As a result, semantic information discovery methods, based on data mining techniques, such as latent Dirichlet allocation and bag of visual words models, can discover the latent information. Despite their crucial rule, there are only a few studies in the field of semantic data mining for remote sensing applications. This article is focused on this shortage. Three different scenarios are used to evaluate the semantic information discovery in various remote sensing applications, including both optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data with different spatial resolutions. In the first scenario, semantic discovery method correlated the semantic perception of the user and machine to correct and enhance the user defined Ground Truth map in very high-resolution RGB data. The potential of the semantic discovery is evaluated for wildfire affected area detection in Sentinel-2 data in the second scenario. Finally, in the third scenario, the semantic discovery method is utilized to detect the misclassifications as well as the patches with ambiguous or multiple semantic labels in a Sentinel-1 SAR patch-based benchmark dataset to enhance the robustness and accuracy of the annotation in the dataset. Our results in these three scenarios demonstrated the capability of the data-mining-based semantic information discovery methods for various remote sensing.

AB  - The Oxford-Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) is one of Europe's oldest sentinel systems, providing sentinel surveillance since 1967. We report the interdisciplinary informatics required to run such a system. We used the Donabedian framework to describe the interdisciplinary informatics roles that support the structures, processes and outcomes of the RSC. Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic University, RCGP, information technology specialists, SQL developers, analysts, practice liaison team, network member primary care providers, and their registered patients have nearly quadrupled the size of the RSC from working with 5 million to 19 million peoples pseudonymised health data. We have produced outputs used by the UK Health Security Agency to describe the epidemiology of COVID-19 and report vaccine effectiveness. We have also supported a trial of community-based therapies for COVID-19 and other observational studies. The home of the primary care sentinel surveillance network is with a clinical informatics research group. Interdisciplinary informatics teamwork was required to support primary care sentinel surveillance; such teams can accelerate the scale, scope and digital maturity of surveillance systems as demonstrated by the RSC across the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Musical Performance in the Age of Postmodernism
T2  - POSTMODERN OPENINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to postmodernism musical performance. There was realized a comprehensive retrospective analysis of the phenomenon development from ancient period to nowadays. It was proved that in ancient times interpretation was explained as a form of mythological worldview embodiment; in the Middle Ages as a way of uniting man and God; in Rrenaissance as a means of harmonizing material and spiritual components of personality; in Baroque as a method of theatricality of person's existence; in Classicism as an opportunity to assert the power of human mind; Romanticism emphasized emotionality and subjectivity of concerting, the unique role of master; Modernism declared freedom of interpretation. Understanding the essence of musical performance with each historical stage became deeper, was enriched with new terminological, depth of scientific and theoretical understanding.The musical performance of postmodernism as a unique phenomenon has its own chronology of formation and development, based on achievements of previous epochs, transformed in accordance to philosophical aesthetics of the late XX century. Its outstanding constitutive qualities are: anthropology, religiosity, spirituality, meditation, improvisation, humanism, dialogicity, theatricality, rationalism, intellectualism, emotionality, playing, intertextuality, polystylistics etc.The performing art of postmodernism embodies the conceptual principles of its time: pluralism, irony, collage, synthesis, the death of the author, so on. It unites, eclectically mixes different artistic traditions and views, it forms a unique interpretive vision of musical text, demonstrates openness to dialogue with different historical epochs and civilizations, aimed at both the elite and the mass audience.

TI  - RELIGIOUS VALUES IN MODERN RUSSIAN SOCIETY: A PHILOSOPHICAL EXPLICATION
T2  - WISDOM
M3  - Article
AB  - This article analyses the results of sociological research on value orientations in modern Russian society, based on the philosophical explication of the concept of 'value'. The analysis allows us to recognize that the significance of religious values in the value system of modern society depends on both - the goals of research and their methodological foundations. A philosophical understanding of the essence and nature of values is, therefore, central. Values are principles of a meaningful human life that give ideas about what is significant and important in one's life, legitimising one's activities as the realisation of one's being. This article emphasises that the majority of respondents to the study, who belong to the Russian Orthodox Church, do not separate the confessional values from the moral values of traditional society. This tendency is also seen in the documents defining the social activities of the Church, although the division between confessional and moral values exists in the theology and religious philosophy of the Russian Orthodox Church. The authors of the article consider the essence and nature of values presented in Russian religious philosophy relevant to a religious worldview and assert the ontological, not moral, nature of values.

AB  - Livingston Island is an Antarctic island in the Southern Ocean, part of the South Shetlands Archipelago. The Bulgarian base "St. Kliment Ohridski" is located on the Hurd Peninsula some 130 m from the shores of the inner bay Emona. In this study we use data from the Sentinel-1 satellite constellation to produce velocity maps, covering few key outlet glaciers. During this research used were Sentinel-1 data in GRD format with HH polarisation. We followed the processing workflow described by international scientific community to derive ice velocity maps from pairs of SAR images using the SNAP software. In this paper are presented results for glaciers found in Livingston Island and the ice velocity extracted along the two flow line transects/longitudinal and transverse profiles. This study provides a first demonstration by authors of the operational radar satellites capacity to map and thus providing frequent and timely monitoring of the ice sheet flow as well as to monitor the dynamic evolution of the glaciers around the Bulgarian base "St. Kliment Ohridski"

AB  - Studying Earths' surface motions using data acquired by active instruments such as satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) have become ubiquitous in the last years. This trend could be attributed to large extent to the open data policy of ESA that provides such type data from Sentinel-1 mission at no cost from several online repositories. On the other hand the results produced after processing them need to be validated by data from other sources. In this paper a framework for SAR data processing is presented, whose results are compared and analysed with results from GNSS networks. In order to increase the reliability of the information provided by the radar data used in this research ascending and descending orbits of the satellite were used in order to decrease the effect of the topography. Part of railway line which passes through the town of Provadia and industrial area near it was selected as test site. This object was chosen since surface deformations often occur in it caused by natural and anthropogenic activities in that area.

T2  - International Journal of Mosquito Research
M3  - Article
AB  - Resting behavior and seasonal variation of mosquitoes are of a high degree of importance in the planning of vector control programs and should be well known. A study was carried out to determine the current resting behavior, and the seasonal variation of the malaria vector Anopheles arabiensis in selected sentinel sites in River Nile State, Sudan. Mosquitoes were collected in three different seasons; dry-cold, hot-dry, and wet-season. Mosquitoes were collected from the possible resting places at indoor and outdoor sites in four selected sentinel sites. Mosquitoes showed a preference for both indoor and outdoor resting. Anopheles arabiensis showed a marked seasonal fluctuation in the occurrence with its peaks of abundance in March, November, and January. The findings of the study might indicate a risk of indoor malaria transmission, therefore, control measures like indoor residual spray should be considered to suppress mosquito population and reduce the possibility of malaria and other vector-borne diseases transmission in the state.

AB  - Land-use changes generally are becoming through to urban classes from natural land cover classes. Remote sensing is a standard technology for such monitoring systems. On the other hand, automatic or semi-automatic applications are becoming broader and broader in most fields with development artificial intelligence over time. Building extraction from aerial photos and satellite imagery through deep learning is a new era for observing planned and unplanned urbanization, land-use changes. Besides traditional image-process methods such as supervised and unsupervised classification, deep learning presents a robust and needs less operator process. In this experiment, a commonly shared dataset is used and the sensors are QuickBird, Gaofen-2, WorldView2 with a resolution of 0.6, 0.8, 0.5 meters. Bands are Red, Green, Blue, and Near-Infrared. The dataset was split into train, test, validation, and test parts. Deep learning approaches were conducted to the dataset of different Deeplabv3+ CNN models based on Xception, Resnet-50, ResNet-18, MobileNetv2 networks. The optimized parameters were determined by selecting variations of the training options (different batch sizes, epoch numbers, backbone types, etc.). In the training phase, validation info as training and loss functions were considered. After the training process, the test phase was conducted, and evolution metrics were calculated as mean F1 score, precision, recall, IoU, and global accuracy. According to the results, the models based on ResNet-18 network were yielded better among others. Results were shown as tables and evaluated quantitatively also with time performances of the models.

TI  - Cascading effects of COVID-19 on population mobility and air quality: An exploration including place characteristics using geovisualization
T2  - GEOSPATIAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study hypothesizes that public health responses to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), including a mandated restriction of activity (commonly called a 'lockdown') resulted in reduced transportation activities and changes in air quality in Texas, USA. This presented a natural experiment where population mobility and air quality before and after the lockdown could be compared. Changes in mobility were measured by SafeGraph mobility data (from opt-in smart phone applications that transmit location data) and air quality changes were based on NO2 concentrations measured by the European Space Agency's Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite (from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument). The changes in population mobility and NO2 concentration between mid-March 2020 (lockdown initiated) and the end of 2020, as compared to the same time window in 2019, were the basis of exploring the lockdown hypothesis. Additionally, numerous socio-economic (place based) indicators were hypothesized to follow public health vulnerability assumptions based on COVID 19 incidence patterns. This hypothesis was subjected to geovisu- alization techniques in order to find potential patterns and insights into the complex combinations of these place-based data. Our results suggest that simultaneously visualizing COVID-19, mobil- ity, air quality and socio-economic data yields insights in underly- ing spatial processes related to public health policy decisions. The hypothesis that the lockdown resulted in reduced mobility and NO2 concentrations was found partially correct- this trend was observed in highly urbanized areas, but not in less populated areas. Data related public health vulnerability assumptions (e.g. a region's age, poverty, education, etc.) were agreed with in part, but disagreed with in part.

TI  - ON IDENTIFICATION, IDENTITY, AND SECURITY ISSUES IN MODERN ARMENIA
T2  - WISDOM
M3  - Article
AB  - In the current era of constant change, it is necessary not so much to rely on the past with its value system but to surmise the development tendencies of the civilization and clarify one's place and role. In the modern world, it is a shift of identification crisis followed by identity crisis as values change due to the global economy, creating a consumer character for whom identification and identity issues are secondary. A human strives to be in a security zone where a free-market economy and better living and working conditions are possible.The authors of the article aim to propose and substantiate the idea that the above-mentioned makes the observation of security, identification, and identity issues in Armenia relevant.The following methods have been used parallelly during the study: general-worldview, dialectical, general-scientific (of analysis, combination, comparison, and systematic, logical and historical), private-scientific, and descriptive.The authors have concluded that the achievements that withstood the test of time should be preserved while upgrading the national identity in modern Armenia. The Armenian society should be transformed with the right measured steps priorly. Afterwards, the transformation of political institutions will proceed more naturally and properly.

T2  - Breast disease
M3  - Case Reports
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - Intracystic papillary carcinoma (IPC) is a rare tumor with good prognosis that occurs in only 5% to 7.5% of male breast cancer. We report a case of a 46-year-old man who presented a brown nipple discharge a few months ago. He had a bilateral IPC and an invasive ductal carcinoma on the right breast. A double mastectomy was then performed with a bilateral sentinel lymph node biopsy, and he received chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and hormonotherapy. Two years after the diagnosis, the patient recovered and was free of recurrence. Considering the scarcity of this tumor type, we conducted a systematic literature review on the PubMed of all the cases of IPC in men. The clinical presentation, imaging, and treatment of the 43 case reports from the 41 articles selected were described. Furthermore, no clear guidelines for IPC management are available. Conservative surgery should also be preferred, and a sentinel lymph node biopsy should be performed systematically. Moreover, radiotherapy should be proposed in the case of conservative surgery, and hormone therapy could be proposed in the case of invasive IPC or IPC associated with a ductal carcinoma in situ.

TI  - Identifying The Potential Sources of Chemical Elements in Drainage and Rivers Using Google Earth Imageries and Posteriori Knowledge
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTEGRATED ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study attempts to identify the potential sources of the chemical elements in the river and drainage water using in-situ water quality sampling and public domain satellite data. Monitoring the physico-chemical level of urban streams and rivers is important to secure sufficient water resources, an indicator to the ecological degradation in urban areas and an indicator of environmental pollution. Nonetheless, identifying the potential sources of chemical pollutants by field observation is constrained by hard labor activities, time, and cost. Having satellite imagery that provides land use activity information would be useful in determining the chemical sources. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to utilize the publicly accessible Google satellite images in identifying the potential sources of the chemical elements' presence in the water that is physically sampled and measured over the selected urban rivers and drainage of Johor Bahru. Three chemical elements were identified, ammonia (NH3), nitrate (NO3-), and phosphate (PO43-). The identification of the chemical sources is conducted based on the interpretation of the satellite-derived information together with the posteriori knowledge, experience, and inputs in an environmental chemistry perspective. The findings revealed that the proportion of land used did not always have a significant impact on the chemical content of the waterways. For ammonia, areas with significant hotspots (aquaculture, wet market) are more significant, although the size of the area is not dominant. The nitrate content, on the other hand, showed quite a distinct pattern linked to oil palm, intensive farming, and industrial or commercial areas. There was no distinct land use pattern associated with phosphate level. However, locations with high residential areas were likely to have high phosphate content in their respective waterways or drainage to the onsite investigations with minimal labor works, cost effective, and time efficient.

AB  - Building footprint maps are of high importance nowadays since a wide range of services relies on them to work. However, activities to keep these maps up-to-date are costly and time-consuming due to the great deal of human intervention required. Several automation attempts have been carried out in the last decade aiming at fully automatizing them. However, taking into account the complexity of the task and the current limitations of semantic segmentation deep learning models, the vast majority of approaches rely on aerial imagery (< 1 m). As a result, prohibitive costs and high revisit times prevent the remote sensing community from maintaining up-to-date building maps. This work proposes a novel deep learning architecture to accurately extract building footprints from high resolution satellite imagery (10 m). Accordingly, super-resolution and semantic segmentation techniques have been fused to make it possible not only to improve the building's boundary definition but also to detect buildings with sub-pixel width. As a result, fine-grained building maps at 2.5 m are generated using Sentinel-2 imagery, closing the gap between satellite and aerial semantic segmentation.

AB  - Semantic segmentation of remote sensing images has many practical applications such as urban planning or disaster assessment. Deep learning-based approaches have shown their usefulness in automatically segmenting large remote sensing images, helping to automatize these tasks. However, deep learning models require large amounts of labeled data to generalize well to unseen scenarios. The generation of global-scale remote sensing datasets with high intraclass variability presents a major challenge. For this reason, data augmentation techniques have been widely applied to artificially increase the size of the datasets. Among them, photometric data augmentation techniques such as random brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue have been traditionally applied aiming at improving the generalization against color spectrum variations, but they can have a negative effect on the model due to their synthetic nature. To solve this issue, sensors with high revisit times such as Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 can be exploited to realistically augment the dataset. Accordingly, this paper sets out a novel realistic multi-temporal color data augmentation technique. The proposed methodology has been evaluated in the building and road semantic segmentation tasks, considering a dataset composed of 38 Spanish cities. As a result, the experimental study shows the usefulness of the proposed multi-temporal data augmentation technique, which can be further improved with traditional photometric transformations.

AB  - In this paper, we investigate the potential of the modified water cloud model to estimate soil moisture in pepper crop fields with drip irrigation in a semiarid area in Tunisia using cross-polarized L-band data (ALOS-2) and C- band data (Sentinel-1) data in Horizontal-Horizontal (L-HH) and Vertical-Vertical (C-VV) polarization, respectively. Within the context of spatially heterogeneous soil moisture, the total backscattering is the sum of pepper row scattering weighted by the vegetation fraction cover (Fc) and the inter-row soil scattering weighted by (1-Fc). The vegetation row contribution is calculated as the sum of volume scattering contribution of pepper and underlying soil components attenuated by the vegetation cover. Due to the presence of drip irrigation, the underlying soil zone is divided into two parts: irrigated and non-irrigated parts. To assess the calibrated model performance, various simulations are performed under different conditions of soil moisture and vegetation biophysical properties. Under various conditions of soil moisture, the results revealed the potential of the suggested model to simulate SAR signal where cover fraction and pepper height values are under 0.4 and 0.5 m, respectively, using L-HH and cover fraction value under 0.3 and vegetation height value 0.3 m, using C-VV data.

T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this paper was to estimate soil moisture in pepper crops with drip irrigation in a semi-arid area in the center of Tunisia using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. Within this context, the sensitivity of L-band (ALOS-2) in horizontal-horizontal (HH) and horizontal-vertical (HV) polarizations and C-band (Sentinel-1) data in vertical-vertical (VV) and vertical-horizontal (VH) polarizations is examined as a function of soil moisture and vegetation properties using statistical correlations. SAR signals scattered by pepper-covered fields are simulated with a modified version of the water cloud model using L-HH and C-VV data. In spatially heterogeneous soil moisture cases, the total backscattering is the sum of the bare soil contribution weighted by the proportion of bare soil (one-cover fraction) and the vegetation fraction cover contribution. The vegetation fraction contribution is calculated as the volume scattering contribution of the vegetation and underlying soil components attenuated by the vegetation cover. The underlying soil is divided into irrigated and non-irrigated parts owing to the presence of drip irrigation, thus generating different levels of moisture underneath vegetation. Based on signal sensitivity results, the potential of L-HH data to retrieve soil moisture is demonstrated. L-HV data exhibit a higher potential to retrieve vegetation properties regarding a lower potential for soil moisture estimation. After calibration and validation of the proposed model, various simulations are performed to assess the model behavior patterns under different conditions of soil moisture and pepper biophysical properties. The results highlight the potential of the proposed model to simulate a radar signal over heterogeneous soil moisture fields using L-HH and C-VV data.

AB  - Agriculture plays an important role in the growth of a country's economy. Crop area and yield predictions using machine learning are important investigation domains in current research fields. Wheat is the most important food crop in Pakistan which is cultivated in the Rabi season. Weather conditions, Remote Sensing (RS) data, and Machine learning (ML) technologies can be used to forecast wheat yield before actual harvesting to assist the management of wheat production, trade, and storage. In this paper, a supervised ML based framework is proposed that extracts features/Vegetation Indices (VIs) including Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Red Edge Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (RENDVI), and Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) from Sentinel-2 Satellite images and contributes for: estimation of wheat area, and identification of most effective VIs in wheat area estimation, prediction of wheat yield, and identification of most effective VIs and meteorological parameters in wheat yield prediction. In the initial experimental setup, good performance output obtained using the Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithm therefore in this framework RF machine learning algorithm is focused on wheat area estimation and generation of Land Use Land Cover (LULC) maps which is capable of estimating area with an accuracy of 84%, consumer's accuracy of 81%, producer's accuracy of 83% and kappa statistics of 0.80. LULC maps are used for wheat yield prediction. Multivariate regression forward stepwise technique is applied for yield prediction and selection of effective VIs and meteorological parameters. The adjusted coefficient of determination (R2) between reported and predicted yield found 0.84 with an error of 46.14 Kg/ha for yield prediction.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote Sensing (RS) technology provides regular monitoring of alfalfa farms, as a major source of forage production worldwide. Phenological characteristics derived from time series of RS imagery provide a valuable information source to estimate crop yield accurately. In this study, we computed spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) from time series of Landsat 8 and PROBA-V images to extract temporal characteristics of alfalfa farms throughout the growth periods in three consecutive years in the Moghan plain, Iran. Then, several new spectral-temporal features were developed based on phenological characteristics of alfalfa during the growing season. Such features particularly describe geometry and variations of the temporal curves and are thus invaluable in describing phenological attributes. We conducted several feature selection methods due to the variety of features. Machine learning (ML) methods, including ridge, lasso, Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Random Forest Regression (RFR), Boosted Regression Trees (BRT), and Support Vector Regression (nu-SVR) were utilized to build inversion models in order to estimate alfalfa yields, where the results showed satisfactory performance of GPR using the selected features by GS (RMSE=1114.0 kg/ha), RReliefF (RMSE=1157.7 kg/ha) and Boruta (RMSE=1210.2 kg/ha) as compared to the complete feature dataset (RMSE=1237.4 kg/ha). Overall, the developed phenological features coupled with feature selection methods resulted in the appropriate performance of the ML methods in alfalfa yield estimation.

M3  - Article
AB  - Non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) traditionally have certain limited applications. However, the recent technological advancements and manufacturing cost reduction opened up myriad applications of NTNs for 5G and beyond networks, especially when integrated into terrestrial networks (TNs). This article comprehensively surveys the evolution of NTNs highlighting their relevance to 5G networks and essentially, how it will play a pivotal role in the development of 6G ecosystem. We discuss important features of NTNs integration into TNs and the synergies by delving into the new range of services and use cases, various architectures, technological enablers, and higher layer aspects pertinent to NTNs integration. Moreover, we review the corresponding challenges arising from the technical peculiarities and the new approaches being adopted to develop efficient integrated ground-air-space (GAS) networks. Our survey further includes the major progress and outcomes from academic research as well as industrial efforts representing the main industrial trends, field trials, and prototyping towards the 6G networks.

T2  - RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature is an important factor in many areas, such as global climate change, hydrological, geophysical, biophysical, and land use land cover. This study attempts to retrieve the current statue of V. D. Yelevsky coal mine area in Russia and estimate Land surface temperature in the area of the years of 2006, 2010, and 2019. Furthermore, the study shows the distribution of land surface temperature among land use land cover in the area and implies spatial correlation between land surface temperature and normalized different vegetation index by using Landsat 5 and Landsat 8. The results show that the statue of coal mine portion has increased from 43.89 km(2) in 2006 to 111.40 km(2) in 2019. Also, in the three periods maximum images temperature was recorded in coal mine area (32.05 degrees C in 2006, 31.24 degrees C in 2010 and 32.81 degrees C in 2019), while minimum temperature value of land use land cover types varies among the years. In 2006 minimum value of 12.36 degrees C recorded in water bodies area, 12.36 degrees C across forest area, and again 18.41 degrees C across water bodies in 2019. Consequently, the average land surface temperature of overall area for the three observed years has increased from 18 degrees C to 22.2 degrees C, it means that changes of land surface temperature have been observed from the period of 2006 to 2019. On the other hand, the results show that land surface temperature and normalized different vegetation index for the three study years have strong negative correlations with.. square value of (R-2 = 0.93 in 2006, R-2 = 0.99 in 2010 and R-2 = 0.87 in 2019) respectively.

TI  - Methylene blue sentinel lymph node biopsy for breast cancer learning curve in the COVID-19 era: How many cases are enough?
T2  - F1000Research
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is now the gold standard for early breast cancer with clinically negative lymph nodes (N0). According to the Indonesian Board-Certified oncologist surgeon, the learning curve for evaluating fellow breast surgeons to achieve this competency could have been shorter due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to see if the learning curve for sentinel lymph node (SLN) identification can be shortened. Methods: Trainee breast surgeons were taught to perform SLNB on breast cancer patients. Intraoperative assessment and completion of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) were performed in the first setting for standardization with the attending surgeon. Sentinel lymph node identification was plotted on cumulative sum chart (CUSUM) limitations for evaluating the variability competency between the attending and trainee surgeons based on a target identification rate of 85%. Results: We concluded that CUSUM charts are the best tools currently available for assessing psychomotor learning SLNB. According to a CUSUM chart based on a reasonable set of parameters, the learning curve for SLNB using methylene blue dye is reached after 4-5 consecutive positively detected SLN. Conclusion: CUSUM Chart showed that experienced breast surgeons have completed the SLNB learning curve after 4-5 successful methylene blue attempts. In the future, this learning curve analysis can be applied to trainee breast surgeons by utilizing a proxy measure for failure, such as failure to identify the SLN.

AB  - Using the technology of structural, thermic, and atmogeochemical investigations a number of the studies within the Piatyhorivka area of the Dnieper-Donets Depression were performed. Among the studies there were the geostructural and morphostructural analyses, the structural interpretation of satellite data, field works on the emanation and thermometric surveys, laboratory chromatographic analyses of gas samples collected from the undersoil layer, integrated interpretation of atmogeochemical and remote sensing data, predicting oil-gas occurrence for the Piatyhorivka area. It is found that this area is located in the complicated structural and tectonic environment. Within its boundaries the relative "autonomic " northern and southern zones of the anomalous gas elimination are detected and five local plots of the difficult configuration in a plane projected for the further exploration of oil and gas deposits are identified.

TI  - "No, not the Moon, but a Bright Dial ..." (O. E. Mandelstam): Experience of Poetic-Ideographic Analysis
T2  - NAUCHNYI DIALOG
M3  - Article
AB  - The principles of the formation of the author's poetic ideography are highlighted - a new direction in the study of poetic texts, which is currently developing at the intersection of theoretical and practical ideography and author's lexicography. The main goal of this approach is to identify and describe the individual author's poetic pictures of the world and their representations in lexicographic parameters. Both the general model of the proposed poetic-ideographic analysis and the main theoretical concepts associated with the new cognitive-discursive approach to the interpretation of a poetic text are presented in the article. They are: a global individual-author's worldview, a local picture of a fragment of the world, which in the dictionary have features their representation within the framework of various structures: integral global-event, local-fragmentary, macro- and micro-situational. They are used in the process of poetic-ideographic analysis of the poem "No, not the moon, but a bright dial..." (O. E. Mandelstam), carried out in the proposed article on the basis of the developed analysis model, its main stages, and tasks. The prospect of the research is the study of the integral individual-author's worldview of O. E. Mandelstam, presented in the first edition of the book "Stone", as well as the compilation of the author's ideographic dictionary of the poet's language.

AB  - Understanding the effect of atmospheric aerosols on the climate is a very challenging task. These small particles absorb and scatter sunlight and alter the properties of clouds in the atmosphere. They are greatly diverse in nature, size, optical and physical properties, and in their sources of emission and way of elimination. More particularly for solar radiation, aerosols are one of the major components attenuating the sunlight under clear-sky conditions. This is quantified using the aerosol optical depth (AOD) parameter. AOD is monitored on a global scale using satellite data, but a more precise way to measure AOD locally is to use ground-level instruments that measure the direct incident light coming from the sun at a nominal wavelength and derive the AOD parameter through the Lambert-Beer law. This contribution introduced a method to estimate AOD using a multifilter rotating shadowband radiometer (MFRSR), in Doha, Qatar, where the atmosphere is highly loaded with aerosols. Having a reliable and accurate means to continuously quantify the AOD parameter in this region is of great interest for the enhancement of the understanding of the effect and impact of aerosols.

AB  - Remotely sensed data has become an effective, operative, and applicable tool that provides critical support for geological surveys and studies by reducing the costs and increasing the precision. Advances in remote-sensing data analysis methods, like machine learning algorithms, allow for easy and impartial geological mapping. This study aims to carry out a rigorous comparison of the performance of three supervised classification methods, random forest, k-nearest neighbor, and maximum likelihood, using remote sensing data and additional information in Souk El Had N'Befourna region. The enhancement of remote sensing geological classification by using geomorphometric features, principal component analysis, gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), and multispectral data of the Sentinel-2A imagery was highlighted. The random forest algorithm showed reliable results and discriminated limestone, dolomite, conglomerate, sandstone and rhyolite, silt and alluvium, ignimbrite, granodiorite, lutite, granite, and quartzite. The best overall accuracy (similar to 91%) was achieved by random forest algorithm.

AB  - Geothermal energy is one of the energies that can achieve the seventh goal of the Sustainable Development Goals, which ensures access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy. Supported by the geographical conditions of Indonesia, which is a volcanic arc country, the utilization of geothermal energy can be realized massively. This study aims to identify the location of the geothermal potential by calculating the land surface temperature and radiative heat flux from a geothermal system. We have raised a hypothesis that the heat from the geothermal system will consistently be higher than in surrounding environments. We used satellite images from The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), Sentinel 2 MSI, and Terra MODIS MOD11A2. The study was conducted in Kamojang Crater, West Java, Indonesia, by extracting land surface temperature from satellite imagery using a mono-window algorithm. The algorithm applies the concept of simple radiation transfer, which directly relates the measurement to the emissivity and temperature of the study area, and a simulation model that describes the effect of the radiation regime on the measurement. The results indicated that the detected geothermal surface manifestations are located at a higher temperature than the background. Furthermore, the high-temperature anomaly is accompanied consistently by the high temperature of ground measurements. Then, radiative heat flux as part of the heat lost from the surface is applied as a variable to calculate the geothermal reservoir energy.

AB  - Areas developed through land reclamation projects have huge economic advantages in terms of supplying lands that can be used for farmlands, urban areas and etc., however have relatively small areas of grasslands and densely located buildings compared to inland cities. Hence, an urban heat island is occurring in these areas due to this characteristic, and in particular, the urban heat island in Cheongna International City is getting serious. In this study, the urban heat island in Cheongna International City was evaluated and analyzed by classified into the three periods after the reclamation project: farmland(2001-2008), development(2009-2013) and artificial grassland(2014-2020). The land cover map and Landsat time-series imagery were utilized for measuring the differences of the land surface temperatures between the urbanized areas and the grassland/forest areas in Cheongna International City. The statistical results showed that the differences in the land surface temperature between these areas were calculated to be at most 0℃ during the period of farmland, at most 3.60℃ during the period of development, and at most 2.51℃ during the period of grassland. This study proved that the urban heat island phenomenon increased when the urbanized areas increased, and the urban heat island phenomenon decreased when the artificial grassland areas increased in Cheongna International City where the reclamation project was carried out. The statistical results derived through this research can be used as the reference data for identifying the urban heat island problem in urban planning and establishing the reduction plan.

AB  - Validation of satellite data products is critical for subsequent analysis that is based on the data. Particularly, performance of ocean color products in turbid and shallow near-land ocean areas has been questioned for long time for its difficulty that stems from the complex optical environment with varying distribution of water constituents. Furthermore, validation with ship-based or station-based measurements has also exhibited clear limitation in its spatial scale that is not compatible with that of satellite data. This study firstly performed validation of major GOCI-II products such as remote sensing reflectance, chlorophyll-a concentration, suspended particulate matter, and colored dissolved organic matter, using the in-situ measurements collected from ship-based field campaign. Secondly, this study also presents preliminary analysis on the use of drone images for product validation. Multispectral images were acquired from a MicaSense RedEdge camera onboard a UAV to compensate for the significant scale difference between the ship-based measurements and the satellite data. Variation of water radiance in terms of camera altitude was analyzed for future application of drone images for validation. Validation conducted with a limited number of samples showed that GOCI-II remote sensing reflectance at 555 nm is overestimated more than 30%, and chlorophyll-a and colored dissolved organic matter products exhibited little correlation with in-situ measurements. Suspended particulate matter showed moderate correlation with in-situ measurements (R2~0.6), with approximately 20% uncertainty.

AB  - “We are the last Romantics,” Yeats said much avowedly in regard to his romantic worldview and poetic patterns. His poetry is an attribute of his nature, a subjectivity that is distinctly surrealistic and personal to reveal his earthly senses and passions towards love, frustrations, and nationalism. His nature has been modeled against Wordsworthian tradition, not pantheistic but wonder-surprising and recognition of spirit, supernatural elements, and its dawdling beauty of nature. The presence of conscious anima mundi, his solace in the cultural unification and unity of Being is manifest romanticism. The celebration of Ireland and mythic imagination are exploited to the fullest extent ‘hammering thoughts together’ by Yeats, he could generate distinct literary and poetic traditions for modern poetry but also the Irish literary traditions and history. Yeats presented a sumptuous synergy of realism with imagination derived from the occult and history, visionary and mystic type, the conflicting selves, and nationalism and religion.

AB  - Yield forecasting has been a central task in computational agriculture because of its impact on agricultural management from the individual farmer to the government level. With advances in remote sensing technology, computational processing power, and machine learning, the ability to forecast yield has improved substantially over the past years. However, most previous work has been done leveraging low-resolution satellite imagery and forecasting yield at the region, county, or occasionally farm-level. In this work, we use high-resolution aerial imagery and output from high-precision harvesters to predict in-field harvest values for corn-raising farms in the US Midwest. By using the harvester information, we are able to cast the problem of yield-forecasting as a density estimation problem and predict a harvest rate, in bushels/acre, at every pixel in the field image. This approach provides the farmer with a detailed view of which areas of the farm may be performing poorly so he can make the appropriate management decisions in addition to providing an improved prediction of total yield. We evaluate both traditional machine learning approaches with hand-crafted features alongside deep learning methods. We demonstrate the superiority of our pixel-level approach based on an encoder-decoder framework which produces a 5.41% MAPE at the field-level.

AB  - Traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for semantic segmentation of images use 2D convolution operations. While the spatial inductive bias of 2D convolutions allow CNNs to build hierarchical feature representations, they require that the whole feature maps are kept in memory until the end of the inference. This is not ideal for memory and latency-critical applications such as real-time on-board satellite image segmentation. In this paper, we propose a new neural network architecture for semantic segmentation, "ScannerNet", based on a Recurrent 1D Convolutional architecture. Our network performs a segmentation of the input image line-by-line, and thus reduces the memory footprint and output latency. These characteristics make it ideal for on-the-fly segmentation of images on-board satellites equipped with push broom sensors such as Landsat 8, or satellites with limited compute capabilities, such as Cubesats. We perform cloud segmentation experiments on embedded hardware and show that our method offers a good compromise between accuracy, memory usage and latency.

T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) radio occultation (RO) is a novel detection technique that can provide global ionospheric products with high vertical resolution, high precision, and low cost. In recent years, China has launched the Fengyun-3(FY3) series of meteorological satellites carrying the first RO payload to simultaneously receive global positioning system (GPS) and BeiDou navigation system (BDS) signals. In the accuracy assessment of RO products observed by GNSS occultation sounder (GNOS), the maximum F2-layer electron density (NmF2) of GPS occultation and BDS occultation has a standard deviation (std) of less than 20% in comparison with that of ionosondes. The std of F-layer worst case ionospheric scintillation index (S4(max)(F)) between Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate and FY3/GNOS is less than 0.1. The above results prove the high precision of FY3 ionospheric RO products. The RO products have been applied to preliminary scientific research and applications, e.g., the process of main phase and recovery phase of magnetic storms revealed by the NmF2 observed by FY3C/GNOS, the premidnight dynamics of F-layer strong scintillation during magnetic storms revealed by GNOS scintillation data, the ionospheric perturbation driven by Tonga volcano eruption revealed by FY3/GNOS, applications of the RO data for the research of sporadic E layers, evaluation of International Reference Ionosphere model in statistics and ionospheric climatological characteristics, etc. With the successive network observation and continuous deployment of FY3 meteorological satellites, the continuous improvement of GNOS payload and the BDS system, massive high-precision ionospheric RO products will be developed and show more significant value.

TI  - Simulation of Favorable Habitats for Non-Gregarious Locust Pests in North Kazakhstan Based on Satellite Data for Preventive Measures
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper considers the approaches and possibilities of using two types of simulation: the species distribution model and the ecological niche model. The study aimed to simulate favorable habitats and the potential spread of non-gregarious locust pests in North Kazakhstan based on satellite and ground data for preventive measures. The MaxEnt software was used to conduct the simulation. According to the species distribution model, high indicators of the habitat are predicted in the Pavlodar and Kostanay regions, on 69.9-100% of the studied territory. With the simulation of ecological niches for non-gregarious locust pests, the following class boundaries were determined for the transition from quantitative to qualitative indicators from I (85-100%) to IV (0-50%), which indicates the zones of the probability of pest attack from a higher indicator to a lower one. According to the fundamental model, high indicators of the area of pest occurrence, that is, zones I and II, are located in the central and northern parts of the Pavlodar region. Here, the probability of non-gregarious locust occurrence of zone I and II with a ratio of 1:1 is observed in a slightly arid, moderately warm agro-climatic zone. In the southern part of the Kostanay region, the simulation predicts the probability of occurrence on zones I and II with a ratio of 1:2 in the moderately arid warm agro-climatic zone of this region. In the southern and southeastern parts of the Akmola region, the model predicts the probability of occurrence in zones I and II with a ratio of 1:3 in a slightly humid, moderately warm agro-climatic zone of the region. The considered species distribution model can be used as a modern tool for long-term forecasting of the spread of non-gregarious locust pests since it takes into account the peculiarities of the agricultural landscape. The fundamental niche model can be used in a long-term population forecast since it focuses more on the theoretical conditions of pest habitats.

AB  - The term ‘the mission of God’ or its Latin expression ‘missio Dei’ is used a lot in mission, church, theology, etc. not only in the ecumenical camp, but also in the so-called evangelical camp, a representative example of which can be found in Christopher J. H. Wright (1947-present).This paper studies Wright’s concept of ‘the mission of God.’ To this end, first, the concept of mission in the Lausanne movement is examined. Then Stott’s position on mission and Wright’s position on mission are analyzed.The concept of mission in the Lausanne movement basically emphasizes the primacy, priority, and urgency of evangelism, while pursuing a holistic or integral mission that considers both evangelism and social justice necessary.However, as time goes by, the order of the church-gospel-world has been changing from that of the gospel-church-world to that of gospel-world-church, taking into account the sensitivity and relevance of the times.Wright argues for an integrated relationship between evangelism and social action based on the centrality of the gospel, emphasizing that mission comes from God’s nature and that we are sent into the world. Then he explores the story of God’s mission in the grand narrative of the entire Bible, which in turn includes our mission. Through this missional hermeneutics, ‘the mission of God’ shapes and changes our worldview, revealing who we are and for what purpose we exist in all areas of life, thereby even providing self-critical and subversive change.Through this study, the concept of ‘the mission of God’ could suggest many implications for who we are as Christians sent into all areas of the world and for what purpose and plan we participate in. It could also provide valuable insights for the mission and practice of church.

AB  - Automated time series vegetation data classification has received much attention in recent years. It has important benefits in remote sensing (RS) field such as land cover vegetation quality and productivity estimation. Recently, deep learning techniques have achieved increasing success in RS data classification including vegetation mapping. However, these approaches do not consider the vegetation's characteristics such as effective rate of crop utilization that can be useful in the process of vegetation classification. Motivated by this issue and for easy multi-temporal vegetation analysis, mapping and monitoring, in this paper; a neural network model is proposed to extract the features automatically and classify the vegetation's sentiment and purposes. We conduct experiments using multi-temporal public available Sentinel-2A datasets and the obtained experimental results are evaluated with the established criteria.

TI  - Multiyear variability of ice concentration in the White Sea according to satellite data
T2  - LED I SNEG-ICE AND SNOW
M3  - Article
AB  - The objectives of this study were to analyze satellite data on the ice conditions in the White Sea available for the period 1979-2021 so that to identify statistically significant trends in closeness of ice during that period, and to establish spatial and temporal characteristics of the sea ice regime in this area. It was found that according to the satellite data a statistically significant negative trend (-0.34 +/- 0.11% year-1 at a significance level of 0.05) of the ice closeness changes was observed over the above period for all areas of the sea, which corresponds to the general tendency of reducing the area of the Arctic ice cover due to the global warming. However, contrary to the statements of J.C. Comiso, D.K. Perovich, M.C. Serreze, J. Streve, D. Notz that since the beginning of the XX century the reduction of the ice area in the Arctic Ocean accelerates, no tendency in decrease of mean annual values of the ice closeness for the White Sea was revealed. In addition, the results of the regression analysis showed a slight decrease in the absolute value of the trend from - 0.74 +/- 0.38% year-1 in 1979-1996 to -0.47 +/- 0.25% year-1 in 1997-2020. It is also shown that the results of a comparative analysis of two trends in the year-to-year variability of ice closeness in the White Sea: the first one obtained from the microwave radiometer data provided by the National Snow and Ice Data Center, and the second one revealed from data of advanced microwave scanning radiometers (the University of Bremen), are in good agreement with each other. The difference in the slope coefficients of the linear approximation is only 0.038% year-1 for the period 2002-2020. This is the important argument in support of using microwave radiometer data to determine trends in variability of ice closeness in the White Sea.

TI  - Spatio-temporal regularities of the White Sea ice regime formation
T2  - Advances in Oceanography and Limnology
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper presents the spatial and temporal regularities of the course of ice processes in the White Sea, derived from satellite data observations, for the period 2004-2020. The dependences, defining indicative dates of the White Sea ice regime of air temperature regime over its water area are given, which can be used for diagnostic and prognostic purposes. It was found that the rate of breaking (2.11%/day) of the Sea ice cover is 1.24 times higher than the rate of formation (1.70%/day). It is noted that the connection with the Barents Sea has a significant impact on the course of the ice regime of the White Sea, in particular on the beginning freeze-up phase and the beginning break-up phase. Comparative analysis of seasonal variations in ice coverage in the White Sea indicates that the course of the ice regime in recent years was slightly different from that recorded in the second half of the XX century. The average duration of the ice period decreased by 10 days, and the average values of the ice coverage decreased by 37% throughout the entire period of ice phenomena, which is in line with the global warming trend. Also, the effects of an abnormally warm winter on the formation of the White Sea ice regime in the 2019-2020 period are presented. The differences in the indicative dates of the ice regime, such as the dates of the beginning and the end of the period of ice phenomena in 2019-2020, compared to the average for the period 2004-2019, are +1 and -8 days, respectively.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The change in the land surface could occur naturally or due to human activities. The study area involves Idku Lake and the surrounding lands and occupies around 921 km(2). This area is exposed to both adverse ecological and anthropogenic activities. The main objectives of this study are; 1) detecting the historical change of the land surface elevation of the study area between 1942 and 2020, 2) identifying LULC classes in the study area between 1942 and 2020, and 3) predicting LULC change in 2030 under two different scenarios. The contour lines were extracted from the digitized topographic maps of 1942 to generate DEM then compared with 2020 SRTM-DEM to check the elevation change. The results show that around 97% and 88% of the area had an elevation < 3 m in 1942 and 2020, respectively. The maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) was applied on Landsat images to distinguish the LULC classes in 1972, 1984, 1998, 2013, and 2020, besides the digitized topographic map of 1942. Five LULC classes are distinguished in the study area water bodies, natural vegetation, fish farms, agricultural land, and bare soil. The results reveal that between 1942 and 2020, water bodies and bare soils are significantly decreased from 17% to 2% and 31%-15%, respectively, whereas the agricultural lands increased from 48% to 70% of the study area. Additionally, the land change modeler (LCM) was applied to predict the spatio-temporal distributions of LULC classes in 2030 based on two scenarios (A and B). Scenarios A predicts the LULC classes based on the classified images of 1984 and 1998, whereas scenarios B estimates the LULC classes based on the classified images of 1998 and 2013. The prediction results reveal that the agricultural land is expected to cover 74% and 70% of the area in 2030 based on scenarios A and B, respectively. Finally, as a part of Mediterranean region, the study area is threatened by the adverse effects of increasing sea level and/or temperature so, adaptation measures are critically needed.

AB  - The urban heat island (UHI) is formed due to higher local temperatures in urban areas than surrounding rural areas. Impervious surfaces and vegetation are the two major land covers that have the capability to modify energy fluxes. The Latent Heat flux, Sensible Heat Flux and the Ground Heat flux was obtained for Bangalore city and ratio of fluxes to net radiation was calculated. The mean of ratio of each flux to net radiation was calculated for each land cover and found that the urban and bare soil region shows higher values of G/R-n as compared to the vegetated land covers. The urban land cover showed higher values of H/R-n as compared to the natural land covers and the vegetation and waterbody showed higher values of LE/R-n than other land covers. The relation of sensible heat flux with imperviousness and latent heat flux with vegetation was determined. The plot of H/R-n with ISF and LE/R-n with NDVI, both showed good positive relation.

TI  - DIGITAL CULTURE VS CULTURAL ORIGINALITY? (from the experience of preserving Chinese cultural identity)
T2  - SOTSIOLOGICHESKIE ISSLEDOVANIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper examines the problem of the own cultural identity maintenance in the context of modern processes of globalization, informatization and digitalization, so as the development of digital modernity in China. The article emphasizes such a feature in the process of formation of digital modernity in Chinese society as actualization of tradition in modern digital culture. This feature manifests not as the archaization of culture and restoration of the past but as a harmonious interweaving of the modern with the traditional, the Western with the Chinese. The paper suggests that the possibilities for the synthesis of tradition and innovation are inherent in the very origins of Chinese civilization. The holistic worldview that has been repeatedly considered by the researchers of Chinese culture and philosophy is also of great importance. The authors considered it necessary to reflect the ideology of holism in the form that means ` to be in agreement, having different views', 'striving for harmony while maintaining differences'. The authors note that the reverence for the historical past, the desire to preserve national identity that determines the indicated tendency to actualize traditions in Chinese modernity are supported not only from above (by the policy of strengthening 'the national spirit') but also are supported by the population experiencing a feeling of patriotism and pride for its present.

TI  - Atmospheric humidity deficits tell us how soil moisture deficits down-regulate ecosystem evaporation
T2  - ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowing how actual evaporation is down-regulated from potential evaporation during periods with soil moisture deficits is one of the greatest challenges towards computing evaporation everywhere on a regular basis. We propose the hypothesis that vegetated landscapes transmit information on soil moisture deficits through its down-regulation of evaporation, which in turn affects the humidification and growth of the planetary boundary layer. To test this hypothesis, we examined how the evaporative fraction, defined as the ratio between actual and potential evaporation, corresponds with the soil moisture stress index, defined as the relative humidity with a power law dependence on vapor pressure deficit times a parameter, beta.We tested the parameterized soil moisture stress index with direct eddy covariance measurements of actual evaporation and computations of potential evaporation based on meteorological conditions, averaged on monthly time steps. The analysis was conducted on a dataset obtained from 144 FLUXNET sites. These sites spanned much of the world's climates and biomes and contained over 5900 months of observations.Observations of the evaporative fraction fit the model of the soil moisture stress index best for semi-arid and arid ecosystems, and least for the humid and wet ecosystems. Consequently, a significant relationship between measurements of the evaporative fraction and soil moisture stress index held for about one-half of the population of sites. Under this condition, the median value of the parameter, beta, was 1.41.To investigate the mechanism of this empirical soil moisture stress index, we diagnosed it with a coupled evaporation-planetary boundary layer model. The soil moisture stress index is strongly related to surface resistance, as defined by inverting Penman-Monteith equation. Consequently, this index provides an independent estimate of surface resistance based on easy to measure mean monthly weather conditions like relative humidity and temperature. Thereby, this soil moisture stress index has potential to be applied to weather, climate and biogeochemical models and the interpretation of satellite derived evaporation products, like the one provided by the ECOSTRESS mission.

TI  - Direct Measurements of Atmospheric Absorption of Subterahertz Waves in the Northern Caucasus
T2  - DOKLADY PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The first results of direct expedition measurements of atmospheric absorption of electromagnetic waves in the sub-terahertz frequency range of 0.1-1 THz, carried out in order to select an optimal site from the point of view of the microwave astroclimate for development of an observatory that can become an element of the radio interferometer of the Suffa observatory and, in the future, enter into collaboration with the Event horizon telescope (EHT), are presented in brief. The EHT, presenting an image of the shadow of a black hole, today consists of a dozen antennas located around the globe, and at present has no elements in its network in northern Eurasia. The studies performed may be useful not only for radio astronomy problems, but also for space communications, radar of the Moon, asteroids, and the detection of space debris objects. The first results of direct measurements of propagation of subterahertz waves at the selected sites confirmed the initial hypothesis of the expedition. This hypothesis was formulated on the basis of an analysis of meteorological data, as well as satellite data on atmospheric absorption in other ranges: optics and low-frequency radio bands. It was assumed that the work in the subterahertz frequency range in the eastern part of the northern Caucasus is more promising than in the western Caucasus. The western part is more attractive because today there are a number of observatories already operating, and the installation of one more antenna would have been much easier in terms of the necessary infrastructure and required highly qualified personnel. The hypothesis of the predominance of the eastern part was convincingly confirmed in the completed research by comparing the absorption in the 2- and 3-mm bands from the previously surveyed areas of the Western Caucasus (Terskol peak, Pastukhov mountain, KMO, BTA, RATAN-600 sites, etc.) with those studied during the expedition in 2021 for the Eastern sites on the Mayak (Gunib), Stolovaya, and Shalbuzdag mountains. Even measurements at the highest peak not only in the Western Caucasus, but also in Europe, at Mount Elbrus, carried out as part of this expedition, gave results worse than those in Dagestan and North Ossetia, confirming the futility of further search for a place for an effective subterahertz instrument in the eastern part of the North Caucasus.

AB  - Urban sprawl is often the result of the transformation of the vegetation - covered land into build-up land. This expansion is caused by economic development, population growth and changing in living standards. For the progress of a city, a vision is needed in what will be achieved and methods by which this will be made possible. Due to the development of the city, the increase of the population number and other external factors, a study was needed to determine the area of the existing green spaces in the city of Brasov, Romania, in relation with the population number. Brasov is the most representative city, located in the Center of Romania, for economic and structure change. To analyze the green areas, were used remote sensing data from 2017 and 2021. Sentinel-2A images provided the support to analyze the land cover and the changes. The images were classified using ArcGIS Pro. This process gave a better understanding of the changes that took place in Brasov. The results indicated that the green areas almost doubled from 2017 to 2021. As a result of this growth, the citizens benefit due to the spaces created for recreation and outdoor activities.

TI  - Detection of Red Tide Over Sea Surface Using GNSS-R Spaceborne Observations
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the continuous intensification of human activities in the ocean, the frequent outbreaks of red tide have caused great harm to the marine environment and ecology. Thus, the rapid detection and monitoring of red tide become particularly important. At present, the main monitoring methods depend on artificial and buoy data, as well as optical satellite remote sensing. However, these methods may not be able to effectively deal with the characteristics of red tide bloom, such as suddenness and unpredictability. The global navigation satellite system-reflectometry (GNSS-R) is an emerging technology that makes use of navigation signals as a remote sensing opportunity to obtain Earth surface information. GNSS-R has already been proved to be capable of retrieving sea surface parameters (e.g., dielectric constant and sea surface roughness) closely related to the outbreak of a red tide. In this article, we proposed a new method to estimate red tide density, which utilizes an all-new model associating GNSS-R observations with sea surface red tide density. This method can remove the weather influence and greatly decrease the revisit period, which is much longer for optical red tide remote sensing methods. The Landsat-8 near-infrared data and TechDemoSat-1 (TDS-1) GNSS-R data of a red tide outbreak in the sea off the Tsingtao coast in China are used to build and test the proposed method. The results demonstrate that the correlation coefficient is 0.73, and the root mean square error of retrieved red tide density is 2.84%, which shows that the GNSS-R technology shows great potential to perform the rapid and preliminary red tide monitoring and judgment.

TI  - Application of ocean color remote sensing products in estimation of fishing production potential in Lake Qinghai
T2  - Hupo Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of fish production potential (F-p) can provide scientific and technological support for fishery conservation and management, while traditional estimating methods of F-p in large lakes are often costly with low representativeness and time efficiency. This study estimated F-p of naked carps ( Gymnocypris przewalskii) in Lake Qinghai, the largest plateau lake of China, based on the evaluation of chlorophyll-alpha, primary productivity of phytoplankton ( PP) using VGPM ( vertically generalized production model) via ocean color remote sensing products from MODIS satellites ( 1 km resolution) during the non -freeze period ( May to October) from 2018 to 2020 surveyed field data. The average relative error is within 25% between the simulated and observed PP. The F-p results showed a seasonal fluctuation increasing first and then decreasing during the non -freeze period from 2018 to 2020, with the maximum values usually occurring in summer ( July to August). The spatial distribution showed smaller F-p appeared in the middle of the lake and larger in the shore and near the estuary of Lake Qinghai tributaries, the gross weight ranged from 25000 to 176000 tons monthly. The temporal and spatial distribution of F-p was mainly affected by temperature, exogenous nutrients and fish feeding characteristics. The F-p capacity in Lake Qinghai can support more than 458000 tons of naked carps annually, which is higher than the history and present fish resource, indicating enough fish proliferate and recovery space in Lake Qinghai. This study provides scientific and technological support for the strategies making of the fishing ban, lake closing, and fish restocking, and provides a case study for the effective estimation of F-p based on remote sensing in the same type of large lakes.

T2  - NEURAL NETWORK WORLD
M3  - Article
AB  - Sensors of different wavelengths in remote sensing field capture data. Each and every sensor has its own capabilities and limitations. Synthetic aper-ture radar (SAR) collects data that has a high spatial and radiometric resolution. The optical remote sensors capture images with good spectral information. Fused images from these sensors will have high information when implemented with a better algorithm resulting in the proper collection of data to predict weather fore-casting, soil exploration, and crop classification. This work encompasses a fusion of optical and radar data of Sentinel series satellites using a deep learning-based convolutional neural network (CNN). The three-fold work of the image fusion ap-proach is performed in CNN as layered architecture covering the image transform in the convolutional layer, followed by the activity level measurement in the max pooling layer. Finally, the decision-making is performed in the fully connected layer. The objective of the work is to show that the proposed deep learning-based CNN fusion approach overcomes some of the difficulties in the traditional image fusion approaches. To show the performance of the CNN-based image fusion, a good number of image quality assessment metrics are analyzed. The consequences demonstrate that the integration of spatial and spectral information is numeri-cally evident in the output image and has high robustness. Finally, the objective assessment results outperform the state-of-the-art fusion methodologies.

TI  - Applicability of the global TanDEM-X elevation data for terrain modelling of a forested karst area: a case study from Slovak Karst
T2  - GEOGRAPHIA CASSOVIENSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - New interferometric radar data of the TanDEM-X space mission have become recently available as a global digital elevation model providing 0.4 arc second spatial res-olution (ca. 12 meters). The TanDEM-X dataset brings new options into geoscientific re-search across multiple scales. However, the accuracy and suitability of this data have not been evaluated in such an extensive manner as, for example, the widely used SRTM data which resolution is 1 arc second (ca. 30 m). We present a validation of the vertical accuracy of TanDEM-X DEM product and an evaluation of its suitability for landform classification in a forested karst area. The DEM segmentation using geomorphons was used for the auto-mated object-based landform classification. We focused on the identification of dolines for which polygons of dolines mapped by an expert-driven approach were used for validation. Airborne lidar data in the form of DSM and DTM were used as the reference dataset for validation of the TanDEM-X DEM vertical accuracy. The results from the study area show that the vertical RMSE of the TanDEM-X data is 3.42 m with respect to the lidar DSM and 9.64 m in comparison with lidar DTM. The identification of dolines by the geomorphon approach achieved 73 % with TanDEM-X, lower than for the lidar DTM (85 %). The Tan-DEM-X elevation errors were strongly correlated with the canopy height derived from the lidar data suggesting limited suitability of the TanDEM-X data for mapping fine-scale geomorphological features under forests while there was a good match with the lidar DTM terrain in open areas.

AB  - Andaman Islands, straddling the margin of South and Southeast Asia at the edge of India's territory, is a geopolitically sensitive, hyper-masculine island-space where the mainland has inscribed its nationalist depictions of history. Post-colonial social engineering policies have resulted in the settlement of various mainland communities, including the Bengali Hindu refugees and migrants of India's eastern Partition (1947), in the islands. The settler women's participation in and contribution to the settlement, however, continue to remain peripheral in the statist narrative of rehabilitation. Focusing on the settler women's oral histories, this paper brings out their agential role in negotiating with the state's rehabilitation regime, participation in nation-building, and articulation of their subjectivity in the context of this imposed peripherality. The settler women's oral history presents a gendered history of displacement, transportation, settlement, and the island-space itself. Forgotten by the mainland-centric Partition discourse on account of being settled at the frontier, the settler identity is shaped by the erasure of the memory of multiple displacements and a strong rooting in the islands, distanced from the mainland. Further, benefits associated with being 'Islanders', coupled with their claim as 'settlers', differentiates their experience from other refugees and migrants of the eastern Partition settled across the Indian mainland. An explication of the imposed peripherality, through the lens of location, gender and caste, reveals the island-mainland relationship in the settler women's worldview, and highlights the context of rooting the 'homeland' in the islands.

TI  - An Improved Method for Destriping of VIIRS Day/Night Band Images
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The VIIRS Day/Night Band (DNB) images have opened a new era of nocturnal monitoring of global ocean, lands, and atmospheric activities at a reasonably high spatial resolution of 742 m. However, the quality of VIIRS day/night band images is seriously affected with periodic horizontal stripe noises. The image quality is further reduced on the along-track scene edges due to the complex banding effects. The noise pattern and amplitude vary according to the observation time, background light condition, and the pixel position/characteristics. To enhance the utility of VIIRS day/night band image data, we developed an improved method to reduce the noise effects and evaluate the denoised output data to ensure its radiometric integrity and quality. The noise pattern is multiplicative in nature and generated due to the detector-to-detector response variation depending on the incident light condition across the scene. Accordingly, the observed pixels in the day and night images were separated into several classes using the Otsu's threshold value. The images recorded during twilight were classified using the solar zenith angles. Pixel-by-pixel correction of the noise effects was done by multiplying the row-wise detector gains and column-wise error factors for each class. This method was tested on several day/night and twilight images captured over the different regions with varying light conditions. The results are excellent in terms of successfully removing the striping noise and reconstructing the denoised images without spatial discontinuity across the scene regardless of its observation condition.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article examines social capital as a basic phenomenon that determines the specifics of network structures' interaction. Social capital is a resource that has a direct impact on the quality of the network, its functioning and development. A set of values and norms lies in its basis. Network structures are unstable and constantly changing. These factors have a direct impact on the specifics of conflicts. Identifying the structural, relational, cognitive, and axiological dimensions of social capital is a necessary condition for clarifying the functioning of network foundation and the mechanisms of interaction between actors. The article focuses on weak and strong connections between network elements in structural dimension. The degree of influence on an actor on the development of a conflict situation depends on its centrality, the number of existing connections with other elements that are based on social capital. The relational dimension focuses on the level of trust between network elements, which determines the direction towards conflict resolution. Social capital is considered from the perspective of the presence of a common worldview, an unambiguous interpretation of logical and conceptual structures by all elements of the network in the framework of the cognitive dimension. It becomes especially important when it is necessary to make a decision in a situation of social system destabilization because of conflict. Social capital is studied from the perspective of value-based and normative attitudes of actors in the axiological dimension. Its commonality contributes to the formation of mutual understanding between network elements. Network structures are carriers of symbolic power. They are able to constitute new social communities, attract new elements to their composition. Networks often act as regulators of processes taking place in society. Network structures increase the flexibility of social institutions in the event of a conflict situation where they perform a stabilizing function.

TI  - Crafting Immunological Response Using Particulate Vaccines
T2  - CRITICAL REVIEWS IN THERAPEUTIC DRUG CARRIER SYSTEMS
M3  - Review
AB  - To achieve optimal immunogenicity, particulates present a promising vehicle for antigen delivery and have the potential to skew immune response. Particulate vaccine offers several advantages including targeting of antigen to sentinel cells, protection from degradation, sustained release, and itself acts an adjuvant mimics viral structure. Adjuvant presence is vital in overcoming the poor immunogenicity of vaccines, e.g., subunit vaccines. Adjuvants have antigen dose sparing potential and provide danger signals to alert the immune system. Various particulate carriers received attention in the delivery of vaccine antigens such as virus-like particles, liposomes, immunostimulating complexes, and polymeric particles. This review also discussed the properties of particles such as size, shape, and rigidity affecting the immunological outcome. It further highlights the cellular uptake of the particulate vaccine, antigen processing, and its presentation by antigen-presenting cells. For mass vaccination, especially in countries lacking resources, effect of storage temperature condition on stability of vaccine is pivotal. The current COVID-19 pandemic is not showing any signs of abatement and role of nanocarriers are highly relevant in SARS-CoV-2 pandemic as an effective immunization strategy. Eradication of pandemic demands the rapid evaluation of multiple approaches that can provides successful vaccination platform, enabling scalability and global distribution.

TI  - A Blind Full Resolution Assessment Method for Pansharpened Images Based on Multistream Collaborative Learning
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pansharpening aims to fuse a high spatial resolution (HR) panchromatic (PAN) image and a low spatial resolution (LR) multispectral (MS) image to obtain an HR-MS image. However, due to the lack of the real HR-MS reference image, determining pansharpened image quality at full resolution (FR) has always been a contentious issue in the community. We propose a blind FR assessment method for pansharpened images based on multistream collaborative learning. The proposed method designs a Siamese framework to collaboratively learn the spatial, spectral, and overall quality of the fused image. The parameters of the feature extraction layer in the spatial and spectral evaluation models are frozen for the overall evaluation model, thus improving accuracy and convergence speed. The proposed method was comprehensively tested and verified based on a large-scale dataset consisting of 13 620 fused images obtained by six pansharpening methods with four different thematic datasets. Furthermore, a large-scale subjective evaluation dataset, in which each of the 13 620 fused images was assessed by 28 participants, was utilized to comprehensively validate the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrated the superior performance of the proposed method to other state-of-the-art quality assessments.

TI  - Impact of Polarization Basis on Wind and Wave Parameters Estimation Using the Azimuth Cutoff From GF-3 SAR Imagery
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The azimuth cutoff wavelength of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an important parameter for retrieval of sea surface wind and wave. Earlier studies have fully demonstrated the substantial dependence of azimuth cutoff wavelength on polarization, but the present studies only focus on horizontal and vertical (H-V) linear polarization bases [horizontal-horizontal (HH), horizontal-vertical (HV)/vertical-horizontal (VH), and vertical-vertical (VV)] without considering the effects of other polarization bases (e.g., linear rotated, circular, and elliptical polarization). Benefiting from the quad-polarization advantage of GaoFen-3 SAR wave mode data and the support of polarization basis transformation theory, this study used 4648 SAR data to study the correlation between cutoff wavelength and wind and wave parameters (e.g., significant wave height and wind speed) under different polarization bases and analyzed the variation of correlation coefficient caused by polarization basis change. Finally, the results were applied to evaluate the performance of wind and wave parameters retrieval. The results of the study show that the azimuth cutoff is strongly dependent on the polarization state of the electromagnetic wave. The azimuth cutoff wavelength under the elliptical polarization bases has a higher correlation with wind and wave than that under H-V linear, circular, and linear rotated polarization bases. Using the azimuth cutoff wavelength of the elliptical polarization bases can significantly improve the retrieval accuracy of wind and wave parameters. This study shall enhance the capabilities of polarized SAR systems to precisely derive more ocean surface properties. The result implies that polarization basis is an important factor that must be considered in future ocean SAR studies.

TI  - Detecting Fine-Grained Airplanes in SAR Images With Sparse Attention-Guided Pyramid and Class-Balanced Data Augmentation
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Airplane detection in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images has drawn much attention owing to the success of deep learning methods. However, the development of fine-grained airplane detection in SAR images is still in a dilemma due to the small interclass variance and the large intraclass variance in complex scenes with strong interference from the background. In addition, the class imbalance problem in multiclass fine-grained airplane recognition also significantly limits the direct application of general deep-learning-based airplane detectors. This article proposes two effective methods to tackle the above two problems, respectively. First, we propose a sparse attention-guided fine-grained pyramid module to simultaneously sample discriminative local features scattered in multiscale layers and adaptively aggregate them with fine-grained attention to better classify subordinate-level airplanes with multiple scales. Second, a simple class-balanced copy-paste data augmentation strategy, which randomly copies an airplane of one category and pastes it onto an image according to the classwise probability, is proposed for class balance. Finally, extensive experiments on one public dataset and three representative deep-learning-based detection benchmarks are conducted to show the effectiveness and generalization of the two proposed methods. The combination of these two methods based on the cascade R-CNN benchmark also won the fifth place in fine-grained airplane detection in SAR images in the 2021 GaoFen Challenge.

AB  - This paper presents a satellite image co-registration procedure aiming at simultaneously estimating multiple affine transformations between a set of multi-temporal or multi-source satellite images, reducing error accumulation and improving metric precision. The approach is based on synchronization, a method that seeks to infer the unknown states of a network of nodes, where only the ratio (or difference) between node pairs can be measured. In our case states represent affine transformations. The proposed method globally combines via synchronization pairwise transformations computed for all the image combinations of the multi-temporal sequence, beyond the traditional image-to-base approach available in remote sensing and GIS packages. Results obtained with Landsat and Sentinel-2 images reveal that the algorithm can be used not only to perform the actual co-registration, but also as a diagnostic tool to evaluate the quality of transformation parameters through a comparison with basic co-registration methods, as well as with global least squares adjustment.

AB  - Sand. How much sand is there in the aerosols? Where it came from? It is quite challenging to attempt answering such questions without measurements taken properly at a global scale. Still, we don't have data recorded in this manner and for this purpose. This is why we investigate here some of the available measurements (Terra MODIS satellite data) closely related to dust aerosols and taken over the UAE territory - traditionally affected by intense sand-related (or even sand-driven) meteorological events. We let PCA reveal the principal subspace of the data (i. e. the global scattering tendency within the data) and classification by clustering to search for a natural tendency of grouping the data may have locally. The trend of average series in each cluster is investigated and the seasonal components are revealed. A quite spectacular numeric result arises from the analysis, namely the fact that the subspace of spatially indexed time series is almost one-dimensional. What causes this result stays unexplained for the moment but is another step forward toward qualifying the UAE territory as a dust aerosol source, destination and/or transit region.

T2  - GINEKOLOGIA POLSKA
M3  - Article
AB  - Comprehensive endometrial cancer staging requires mandatory lymph node status assessment. However, some randomized clinical studies show that full lymphadenectomy may have no therapeutic benefit in patients presented with early-stage disease. Sentinel lymph node mapping can be considered in patients at low to intermediate risk for nodal metastases and is an acceptable alternative to systemic lymphadenectomy for lymph node staging in FIGO stage I/II patients. Similarly, patients with serious comorbidities who might not tolerate a standard systemic lymphadenectomy may benefit from the procedure. Sentinel lymph node detection rates depend on cancer stage, histology, and technique used. The procedure is most performed with the use of radioactive technetium colloid (99mTc) combined with a blue dye or indocyanine green. Recently, more interest is also paid to new nanoparticles including carbon, superparamagnetic iron oxide, and mannose tracer agents. Growing interest in sentinel lymph node mapping technique has led to design increasing number of research projects regarding various mapping approaches in different endometrial cancer populations. Much attention has been paid to a non-invasive sentinel lymph node mapping techniquee.g., radiomics. This article reviews the latest research on sentinel lymph node mapping perspectives in endometrial cancer patients.

TI  - Combined Use of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 for Glacier Mapping: An Application Over Central East Alps
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The systematic monitoring of glaciers is essential to both evaluate water resource availability and better understand the effects of climate change. The increased speed of glacier changes observed in the past few years requires a more frequent update of the glacier inventories than in the past; however, the high human supervision required by the state-of-the-art techniques is discouraging their systematic application over large areas. This article proposes a novel approach to exploit the large volume of data provided by Copernicus Sentinel missions for detecting glacier outlines, including debris-covered glaciers. In detail, our method exploits the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 multitemporal images to build a composite image representing the glacier conditions during the yearly maximum ablation period. The Sentinel-2 multispectral images are classified with a support vector machine and composed to a mosaic that represents the information of the maximum glacier ablation. At the same time, the Sentinel-1 time series are exploited to build a multitemporal coherence composite that represents all the snow-covered and glaciated areas together with all the moving surfaces. This information is used together with the Sentinal-2 composite to detect the debris-covered part of the glaciers. The proposed method was tested in the Central East Alps and presented an overall accuracy of 92% with respect to a reference inventory over South Tyrol and an agreement of 90% with respect to the latest glacier inventory of the Alps from Sentinel-2. The proposed approach enables to assist glacier experts in identifying glacier outlines over large areas and in short time

AB  - Albedo quantifies the capacity of a certain surface to reflect incident solar radiation. Therefore, this parameter is relevant in environmental and climate studies as it drives both the land surface energy balance and the interaction between surfaces and atmosphere. It can be estimated and monitored at different scales using Remote Sensing technique. However, its assessment is pretty difficult as factors, such as resultant map accuracy, processing time, and complexity of the algorithm used to retrieve it, should be considered.The goal of this paper is to develop a proper JavaScript code in Google Earth Engine cloud environment in order to estimate surface albedo using two different satellite data, Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2, over two different study areas: Bari (Southern Italy), and Berlin (Northeastern Germany). To achieve this purpose, Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 images, acquired in close date, were processed in GEE environment by implementing an appropriate JavaScript code. After obtaining albedo maps over both investigated sites, the two algorithms' performances, the Silva for Landsat 8 data and the Bonafoni for Sentinel-2 images, were statistically analyzed and compared. Furthermore, to investigate the outcomes deeply, statistics metrics were computed for different land cover classes also. UrbanAtlas provided by Copernicus was used to classify the whole case studies. Both approaches showed satisfying results albeit Landsat 8 algorithm provided higher mean values than the other one.

T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous assumptions and approximations are employed when translating satellite-derived radiance to surface remote sensing reflectance (R-RS) for ocean color applications. Among these is the vicarious calibration coefficient (g) of the "long" near infrared band (NIRL) used for atmospheric correction. For this band, the prelaunch calibration has always been deemed sufficient [thus g(NIRL) = 1.00] as long as other bands are vicariously calibrated. Recent research, however, suggests that Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)/Aqua R-RS time series is quite sensitive to g(NIRL) (and associated vicarious gains in other bands). In this work, we assessed the sensitivity of Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite (VIIRS/SNPP) R-RS to NIRL calibration and compared our results to previous MODIS/Aqua and Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor onboard OrbView2 (SeaWiFS)/OrbView2 analysis. In doing so, we note that g(NIRL) sensitivities of mission-averaged R-RS time series are lower for VIIRS and SeaWiFS, relative to MODIS. At the scale of monthly climatologies (MCs), however, all sensors show prominent g(NIRL) sensitivity with that of SeaWiFS being the most substantial. These findings informed simulation analyses, whereby we identified signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and radiant path geometry, as well as their interaction, as having notable impacts on g(NIRL) sensitivity. As such, g(NIRL) sensitivity is a necessary consideration for reflectance uncertainty budgets, especially for sensors with higher NIR SNR or particular prevailing radiant path geometries. Given the geometry components embedded within g(NIRL) sensitivity, such studies should be coupled with cross-sensor intercalibrations [e.g., using simultaneous same view (SSV) measurements] toward minimizing NIRL errors between satellite instruments, but such efforts will not completely remediate remaining cross-sensor biases in R-RS.

TI  - Religion enters through the Porta dos Fundos
T2  - PLURA-REVISTA DE ESTUDOS DE RELIGIAO
M3  - Article
AB  - The video producer "Porta dos Fundos" is a vehicle of cultural policy. In this article we undertake an analysis of its cultural policy along the axis of the religious theme, which is as challenging for democratic laicism as a strong expression of common culture. The audiovisual production actively and politically mobilizes the viewer's imagination, contributing, in this case, to the debate on the religious theme and providing an opportunity to shift the viewer's worldview to expand his interpretative capacity on the "religious sacred" that, as a political-cultural expression, it has nothing "sacred" or separable from the elements of the public sphere marked by democratic laicity. For this reason, the multiple and inclusive approach present in the religious-themed videos of the collective Porta dos Fundos are ways of qualifying the level of effective democratization of Brazilian society. The inability to laugh about "sacred" themes for the short films and Christmas specials at Porta dos Fundos points, in addition to a healthy tension, the narrow political-cultural limits of a country that has not yet matured in its institutional and democratic principles.

M3  - Article
AB  - Land use change studies are very important tools because they evaluate the speed of deforestation/reforestation, determine its geographic extension and comprehend the social and economic causes of the changes at global, regional and local scales. The objective of this work was to analyze land use changes in the Guangras sector, in an area of 1 609.48 ha focused on to the recovery of ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation in the southern zone of the eastern Andean Cordillera within Sangay National Park. A spatio-temporal study was carried out through satellite images, where Landsat images were pre-processed and classified using ArcGis 10.1 software to determine the change in land use and the analysis of the transition matrix. As a result of this geospatial study, five land uses were identified: moorland, agricultural crops, forest, grassland and water bodies, as well as a change dynamic from 1991 to 2016, in relation to the forest, a decrease of 2.47 %, of moorland 0.76 %, of water bodies 0.28 %, while grassland increased by 3.07 %, and agricultural crops by 1.88 %.

AB  - This paper addresses the extraction of coastlines in SAR images exhibiting poor contrast between land and water backscatter. In place of traditional speckle filtering, we adapt a nonlinear filter whose design principles are rooted in the physics of diffusion, where image blurring is treated in a manner analogous to diffusing particles. The Speckle Reducing Anisotropic Diffusion (SRAD) filter is applied to Wide Ultra-Fine RADARSAT-2 data to examine its use in poor contrast imagery. Results indicate this is an effective filter, and when used in conjunction with traditional segmentation techniques can contribute to the delineation of edges in SAR images that would otherwise be difficult to process.

TI  - Early Radiometric Performance of Landsat-9 Thermal Infrared Sensor
T2  - EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEMS XXVII
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXVII
CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - Landsat-9, launched on September 27, 2021, carries the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS). The Landsat-9 TIRS is a close copy of the Landsat-8 TIRS instrument; it is a two spectral-band, pushbroom sensor with three Sensor Chip Assemblies (SCAs) that cover the 15-degree field-of-view. The primary radiometric change between the instruments is the addition of baffling in the Landsat-9 TIRS telescope to mitigate the stray light issue that has impacted the radiometric quality of Landsat-8 TIRS.The on-orbit radiometric performance is monitored using the on-board variable temperature blackbody and views of deep space. Maneuvers to look at and around the moon have provided an assessment of the stray light. The absolute calibration is monitored by vicarious calibration techniques by teams at NASA/Jet Propulsion Lab and the Rochester Institute of Technology.Landsat-9 completed a three-month commissioning phase in January 2022 and has been operational since February 2022. The instrument has demonstrated excellent radiometric performance, as assessed from the on-orbit measurements. The TIRS instrument is radiometrically stable to 0.1% within a power cycle, and has noise levels below 0.1K. The lunar scans and the vicarious calibration data provide evidence that the stray light has been effectively mitigated.

TI  - Land Surface Temperature Reconstruction Under Long-Term Cloudy-Sky Conditions at 250 m Spatial Resolution: Case Study of Vinschgau/Venosta Valley in the European Alps
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we present a new concept for predicting satellite-derived land surface temperature (LST) under cloudy skies over vegetated areas in the Alps. Although many different reconstruction methods have been developed, they require rarely available inputs, or they restore missing pixels from clear-sky observations with low spatial resolution (1-5 km), which makes them unreliable in heterogenous ecosystems. Given these limitations, we propose a station-based procedure to predict cloud-covered grids from 1-km Terra MODIS LST at 250 m spatial resolution. First, we explored correlations between ground-measured LST and air temperature in conjunction with other geo-biophysical variables under cloudy-sky conditions derived from ESRA clear-sky radiation model. Considering a high site dependency driven by different landcovers, in-situ data were aggregated into three groups (forest, permanent crops, grassland) and then, models were established. Next, the regressions were applied to 250-m gridded predictors to estimate cloud-covered LST pixels for six Terra MODIS LST images in 2014. While for permanent crops and forest group linear modelling was the most efficient, neural networks achieved the best performance for grasslands. The reconstructions showed reasonable LST distribution considering landscape heterogeneity of the region. The results were validated against timeseries of ground-measured LST in 2014. The models achieved reliable performance with an average R-2 of 0.84 and root-mean-square error of 2.12 degrees C. Despite some limitations, mainly due to diversified character of cloudy-sky conditions and high heterogeneity of gridded predictors, the method can effectively reconstruct overcast MODIS data at subpixel level, which shows great potential for producing cloud-free LSTs in complex ecosystems

CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing for Agriculture, Ecosystems, and Hydrology XXIV Part of SPIE Remote Sensing Conferene
CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - Many satellite-derived evapotranspiration ( ET) estimates rely on coarse resolution (CR) land surface temperature (LST) from 1-km thermal infrared bands offered by NASA and ESA instruments, like Terra MODIS and Sentinel-3 SLSTR. This affects prediction performance of ET, especially in complex regions, such as the Alps. Since most two-source energy balance (TSEB) models assume no thermal variability within a pixel, a major challenge in ET modelling is related to cell grid heterogeneity. Given this limitation, we investigate the potential of kernel-driven downscaling to obtain sub-kilometer LST products based on fine resolution (FR) sensors, i.e., Sentinel-2 MSI and MODIS VNIR, for estimating TSEB-based ET over South Tyrol, in the South-Eastern Alps. To this aim, we exploit relationships between CR LST and FR predictors using trees-based algorithms. Due to reduced capabilities of univariate models in complex ecosystems, multi-source predictors are considered, including multispectral reflectances, spectral indices, solar radiation, and topography. The performance of the TSEB model driven by disaggregated outputs is evaluated against original 1-km LST and ground-based fluxes from two eddy covariance towers. In general, turbulent fluxes forced with downscaled LST resulted in RMSE of 86 Wm-2 and mean bias of 55 Wm-2, which translated to 8% and 15% decrease in the respective estimates when compared to TSEB results with 1-km LST. Despite some limitations, mainly related to small-scale changes in landcover and topography that control LSTs and consequently affect TSEB-based ET estimates, the enhanced land surface temperature has potential for providing energy fluxes at finer spatial resolution in heterogenous ecosystems.

T2  - REVISTA PRAXIS EDUCACIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Interethnic tolerance is a determining part of professional competence of Masters of Education (Primary Teaching) in Ukraine. It is seen both as a social order for the modern education system, as a personal-professional quality formed on the basis of humanistic worldview, allowing to perform professional duties effectively. The paper's aim is to introduce education of Masters of Education into the context of interethnic tolerance formation to perform professional duties in the multiethnic educational environment of primary school. The paper examines the experience of 199 Masters of Education (Primary Teaching) who graduated with the learning strategy to improve the level of interethnic tolerance formed. We used a combination of research methods: analysis of normative documents and curricula, observation of students' performance, questionnaire, testing, pedagogical experiment, quantitative and qualitative analysis of experimental data. To improve the level of interethnic tolerance formed we developed and introduced methodical support for the effective organisation of extra / curriculum, independent work and pedagogical practice. The developed learning procedure, implemented in the experimental group, gave positive results in the formation of interethnic tolerance by motivational-value, cognitive, activity-behavioural, and reflexive-creative components. The number of students in the experimental group with high level of interethnic tolerance formed increased by 23.48%; with sufficient level - increased by 14.54%; with average and low level - decreased by 16.07% and 21.94%, respectively. The research findings are relevant for other educational programs.

TI  - UCDNet: A Deep Learning Model for Urban Change Detection From Bi-Temporal Multispectral Sentinel-2 Satellite Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Change detection (CD) from satellite images has become an inevitable process in earth observation. Methods for detecting changes in multi-temporal satellite images are very useful tools when characterization and monitoring of urban growth patterns is concerned. Increasing worldwide availability of multispectral images with a high revisit frequency opened up more possibilities in the study of urban CD. Even though there exists several deep learning methods for CD, most of these available methods fail to predict the edges and preserve the shape of the changed area from multispectral images. This article introduces a deep learning model called urban CD network (UCDNet) for urban CD from bi-temporal multispectral Sentinel-2 satellite images. The model is based on an encoder-decoder architecture which uses modified residual connections and the new spatial pyramid pooling (NSPP) block, giving better predictions while preserving the shape of changed areas. The modified residual connections help locate the changes correctly, and the NSPP block can extract multiscale features and will give awareness about global context. UCDNet uses a proposed loss function which is a combination of weighted class categorical crossentropy (WCCE) and modified Kappa loss. The Onera Satellite Change Detection (OSCD) dataset is used to train, evaluate, and compare the proposed model with the benchmark models. UCDNet gives better results from the reference models used here for comparison. It gives an accuracy of 99.3%, an F1 score (F1) of 89.21%, a Kappa coefficient (Ka) of 88.85%, and a Jaccard index (JI) of 80.53% on the OSCD dataset.

AB  - This study explores the use of satellite imagery as a rapid and cost-effective alternative to evaluate road surface condition. Spectral and texture information derived from 30-cm panchromatic and 1.2-m spaceborne optical imagery were used to assess the capabilities of satellite images in describing pavement distresses. The spectral analysis of the multispectral images indicates that pavements become brighter across all the bands as the roads become rougher. The pixel brightness values decreased when pavements were classified based on deteriorating rutting condition. While this may be useful in characterizing individual distresses, this opposing behavior of the pixel brightness values limits the capabilities of spectral indices approach in analyzing overall pavement condition when multiple distresses are present in the same location. All the texture metrics were found to follow a logical relation with pavement conditions, indicating strong evidence that satellite data have the potential to be an alternative method to evaluate pavement condition.

AB  - Scientists and engineers from the United States and Italy are developing a thermal infrared (TIR) free-flyer concept that forms an essential element of the NASA Surface Biology & Geology (SBG) designated observable and the greater NASA Earth System Observatory (ESO), which also includes observations of aerosols, clouds, convection, and precipitation; mass change; and surface deformation & change.In response to the recommendations from the 2017 National Academies decadal survey for Earth science, NASA initiated the SBG designated observable with five key research and applications focus areas: ecosystems and natural resources, hydrology, weather, climate, and solid Earth. SBG includes spaceborne measurements of hyperspectral imagery in the visible to shortwave infrared (0.4-2.5 um) and multispectral imagery in the mid and thermal infrared (3-12 um) that provide the remote sensing data needed to inform each research and applications area. High-level TIR data products include Earth surface temperature & emissivity, evapotranspiration, substrate composition, volcanic plumes, and high-temperature features. While the science, applications, and technology build on prior mission studies conducted for more than a decade, it has only been recently that a joint team of scientists and engineers from the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Agenzia Spaziale Italiana (ASI), Istituto Nazionale Geofisica e Volcanologia (INGV), and the Istituto Nazionale Astrofisica (INAF) have developed a compelling concept for a TIR freeflyer. In this concept, the TIR instrument is an eight-band radiometer. Seven of the bands are between 3 and 12 um with an additional band at 1.65 um. The instrument's 68.8 deg total viewing angle and the free-flyer's 665 km operational altitude results in a ground sampling distance (GSD) of < 60 m at nadir, produces a swath width of 935 km, and allows for a 2-3-day revisit time. A two-band visible and near infrared (VNIR) camera, with < 30 m GSD at nadir and 935 km swath width, will complement the TIR instrument. VNIR high-level data products include top & bottom of atmosphere reflectance and normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVI). The TIR instrument and VNIR camera will be mounted on a PLATiNO+ spacecraft, a multi-application, reconfigurable, and scalable platform. The launcher selected for the TIR free-flyer is the VEGA-C. To maximize the science and applications benefits the SBG-TIR free-flyer team are collaborating with personnel from the ESA Land Surface Temperature Monitoring mission (LSTM) as well individuals from the Thermal Infrared Imaging Satellite for High-resolution Natural resource Assessment (TRISHNA), a joint mission by CNES and ISRO.Pre-Phase A concept studies for the SBG-TIR free-flyer commenced in the spring 2021. This allows for the concept to be refined; for technical risks to be identified and mitigated, as necessary; and strategies for reducing the development schedule to be defined and assessed before conducting a NASA-ASI Mission Concept Review (MCR) in the spring of 2022 and a NASA Key Decision Point-A (KDP-A) as early as the summer of 2022. These are key milestones in being able to launch and begin operating the SBG-TIR free-flyer in the second half of the decade, so that many of the questions posed by the National Academies in the 2017 decadal survey can be answered.

AB  - Glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) are a major threat to the local communities and important infrastructures in the high mountain regions. This paper focuses on the development of a benchmark dataset for glacial lakes classification in Sentinel 2 multi-spectral data and subsequent detection of glacial lakes prior to a glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF). Towards this end, we collected Sentinel 2 true color scenes of High-Mountain Asia (HMA) region using glacial lakes inventory of this region. It covers an area of 2080.12 km(2) with nearly 30,121 glacial lakes. After data collection, we retained 1200 cloud free true color images and manually generated their ground truth masks. The dataset covers lakes with different shapes, sizes and radiometric signatures. For detection of glacial lakes, we used an encoder-decoder based convolutional neural network (CNN). The model is trained on the labelled dataset of glacial lakes for semantic segmentation of true color images into two relevant classes: lake and no lake. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated using intersection over union (IoU) score. It classifies glacial lakes correctly with an IoU score of 79.90%, which is quite good as far as complexity of the problem is concerned.

AB  - The automation of construction site monitoring is long overdue. One of the key challenges to track progress, quality, quantities is to integrate the necessary observations that make these analyses possible. Research has shown that semantic web technologies can overcome the data heterogeneity issues that currently halt the automated monitoring, but this technology is largely unexplored in the construction industry. In this paper, we therefore present a tentative framework for Linked Data usage on construction sites. Concretely, we combine observations of Lidar scans, UAV and hand-held cameras with the as-designed BIM through RDF graphs to establish a holistic analysis of the site. In the experiments, a proof of concept is presented of the structural building phase of a residential project and how remote sensing data can be managed during project execution.

M3  - Article
AB  - Forest cover changes in the Chakrashila Wildlife Sanctuary, in the north eastern Indian state of Assam between 2000 and 2020 were assessed using Landsat 5 TM (2000 and 2010) and Landsat 8 OLI (2020) satellite data. The objective of the study was to examine the temporal variations, if any, of forest cover in the Sanctuary. The satellite images of 2000, 2010 and 2020 were classified using supervised classification into three different categories viz: dense forest, open forest, and barren land. Based on a maximum likelihood classifier and using standard accuracy assessments, the results indicated that the area covered by barren land and open forest increased between 2000 and 2010 but decreased between 2010 and 2020. Similarly, dense forest had decreased by 22.32% between 2000 and 2010 but increased by 15.19% between 2010 and 2020. These changes occurred reflecting the positive results emanating from conservation policies and afforestation efforts by the primary stakeholder, the state forest department, in recent years. Such efforts were linked to the enhanced institutional status of the protected area, which had been upgraded from a Reserved Forest in 1966 to that of a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1994.

AB  - The Italian Space Agency (ASI) promotes the use of space assets to address not only scientific research questions, but also civilian applications and to the social-economic benefit of citizens. In the current scenario, when efforts are made to achieve the United Nations' 2030 Agenda Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the COSMO-SkyMed data exploitation initiatives launched by ASI - "Open Call for Science" and "Open Call for National Industry/Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs)" - show increasing statistics proving that users are exploring how this state-of-the-art space technology can be used to address several applications feeding into SDGs. A selection of the successful experiences is discussed in relation to infrastructure monitoring, environmental assessment, understanding of and mitigation to natural hazards and climate change. The ASI's initiatives also helped companies to develop new businesses and cooperate with local administrations to address sustainability and land management issues.

AB  - HINTERGRUND UND ZIELE: Eine asymmetrische Verteilung von Melanomen zugunsten der linken Korperhalfte wurde wiederholt beschrieben.PATIENTEN UND METHODIK: In einer prospektiven Querschnittstudie untersuchten wir bei 702 Patienten einer dermatologischen Klinik die Verteilung melanozytarer Navi zwischen der linken und der rechten Korperhalfte. AuSSerdem bestimmten wir retrospektiv das Verhaltnis von links zu rechts (L/R) von primaren Melanomen, Lymphknotenmetastasen und Navi in Sentinel-Lymphknoten (SN) bei 2004 konsekutiven Melanomfallen.ERGEBNISSE: Die L/R-Ratios fur kutane Navi und Melanome betrugen 1,23 (95%-Konfidenzintervall [KI] 1,12-1,36) sowie 1,6 (95%-KI 1,37-1,88). Sowohl bei kutanen Navi als auch bei Melanomen wurde der Linksuberschuss hauptsachlich in intermittierend lichtexponierter Haut gefunden. In der Navuspopulation waren 92,4% Rechtshander. Die Tumordicke nach Breslow und die Ulzerationsrate waren bei linksseitigen oder rechtsseitigen primaren Melanomen ahnlich.SCHLUSSFOLGERUNGEN: Melanozytare Navi und Melanome sind numerisch haufiger auf der linken Korperhalfte zu finden. Wir nehmen asymmetrische Sonneneinstrahlung als ursachlich an. Die groSSe Mehrheit der Rechtshander konnte ihre Korperhaltung bei Aktivitaten im Freien unbewusst so ausrichteten, dass das Licht von links einfallt. Dadurch wird der Schattenwurf durch den dominanten Arm, die Schulter oder den Kopf vermieden.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study, based on materials collected in the 18th-20th centuries, and on the author's field findings over the last 40 years, shows the role of rocks in the Ob Ugrian worldview and ritual practices. Evidence is provided on the veneration of various natural stone objects. Reasons for the cult of worshipping such places are discussed. One reason was that the rock resembled a human or animal figure. In legends and myths, the stone houses of heroic ancestors were correlated with numerous caves in the Ural Mountains. The main part of the article introduces materials relating to the stone figures of deities and patron spirits, supported by mythical narratives explaining the ways that a mythological hero was changed into stone. Examples are given of the figures of deities with a stone base found among local groups of the Ob Ugrians, such as the Lyapin and Sosva Mansi, Synya and Polui Khanty. The role of rocks in childbirth and funerary rites is examined, as well as their role in economic practices such as fishing. In Khanty and Mansi mythological beliefs, the modifier "stony" was equivalent to "iron" or "strong".

TI  - Modeling of aerial biomass in dry subtropical temperate forests in northeastern Mexico
T2  - BOSQUE
M3  - Article
AB  - Information regarding biomass and wood volume of trees are two important factors that allow for analysis of the sustainability of forests. The objective of this study was to calculate the aerial biomass, amount of carbon and timber volume of dry subtropical temperate forests containing Pinus pseudostrobus Lindl. in northeastern Mexico. Field data corresponding to 57 sampling sites were used, including 28 Permanent Forest Research Sites and 29 conglomerates from the National Forest and Soil Inventory, from which biomass, carbon and volume were calculated using allometric equations. The spectral data (NDVI, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) were derived from a Landsat 8 image taken in the year 2020. Using the results of the linear relationship between biomass-carbon and NDVI, a positive correlation (P = 0.007) was found using Spectral data from Landsat images for biomass increase and carbon sequestration in coniferous forests in the state of Nuevo Leon. The research contributes to the understanding of the dynamics of carbon and biomass for the improvement of sustainable development.

T2  - AGRICULTURA SOCIEDAD Y DESARROLLO
M3  - Article
AB  - Indigenous communities conserve their local practices around natural resources, which contribute to the conservation of nature and the satisfaction of their dietary and sociocultural needs. The objective of the study was to analyze the practices of exploitation and management of natural resources in indigenous spaces of Oaxaca. The ethnoecological method was used: the structured interview and field visits. It was found that interview respondents implemented different types of agricultural practices, with the following standing out: sowing of associated or interspersed crops, construction of retention walls (bordos), and terraces and leveling. Soil management was carried out in a differentiated way; in two sites they use manure from backyard animals and in another community they use domestic waste. The water management practices were different per community and were subject to their culture; the management of irrigation water by gravity stood out, and to a lesser extent the harvest of rainwater. The harvest of plants, fungi and the exploitation of wild animals were also frequent. Rituals are still practiced that are devoted to the soil, to a lesser extent to water, to the mountain and to animals. It is concluded that the communities of study conserve their practices that were developed locally.

TI  - Bi-Modal Transformer-Based Approach for Visual Question Answering in Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, vision-language models based on transformers are gaining popularity for joint modeling of visual and textual modalities. In particular, they show impressive results when transferred to several downstream tasks such as zero and few-shot classification. In this article, we propose a visual question answering (VQA) approach for remote sensing images based on these models. The VQA task attempts to provide answers to image-related questions. In contrast, VQA has gained popularity in computer vision, in remote sensing, it is not widespread. First, we use the contrastive language image pretraining (CLIP) network for embedding the image patches and question words into a sequence of visual and textual representations. Then, we learn attention mechanisms to capture the intradependencies and interdependencies within and between these representations. Afterward, we generate the final answer by averaging the predictions of two classifiers mounted on the top of the resulting contextual representations. In the experiments, we study the performance of the proposed approach on two datasets acquired with Sentinel-2 and aerial sensors. In particular, we demonstrate that our approach can achieve better results with reduced training size compared with the recent state-of-the-art.

AB  - Baron Heinrich Freiherr von Stackelberg is remembered for his market typology and his principles of political economics. However; he also stands out for his singular admiration of authoritarian political regimes. The purpose of this article is therefore to rethink and reinterpret elements that will help us gain a fuller understanding as to why Stackelberg adopted such a political stance. These elements derive from the information that has already been identified by historians of political economy. We intend to delve into certain aspects of Stackelberg's controversial life, especially in relation to his personality, his profile, and his upbringing, and demonstrate that lurking in the background of his conception of the market was a radical worldview.

AB  - This study presents an effective tool for mapping irrigated areas at plot scale using Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) time series. Using supervised classification models, the absence of robust terrain reference dataset can limit the production of irrigated area maps. The proposed framework tends to generate automatically reference dataset of irrigated and rain-fed samples to train a random forest (RF) classifier in order to classify irrigated and rain-fed plots. The selection of reference training dataset is based on two irrigation metrics derived from S1 and S2 time series. The RF classifier is then built using the S1 and S2 time series data of the selected training samples. The framework was applied over a temperate study site located in the north-central France for four different years. The classification results show that the irrigation map accuracies variy between 72.8% and 93% depending on the climatic conditions of the examined year. Results also demonstrated that the proposed framework has nearly the same accuracy as classical RF classifiers built using collected terrain reference data.

T2  - BUDDHIST-CHRISTIAN STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - John B. Cobb, Jr., is one of the most influential Christian theologians of the past fifty years. Having written from an interdisciplinary lens, engaging economics, education, biology, and beyond, Cobb is not the typical theologian. One of Cobb's earliest con-cerns is the environmental crisis, having written the first single-author book on the subject in 1972. Cobb recognized early on that the environmental crisis was systemic, pervading modernity in both thought and culture, and sought to approach the prob-lem as such. This paper explores Cobb's religious and philosophical arguments regarding the environmental crisis. The first section identifies theological (anthropo-centrism) and philosophical (substance-based thinking) assumptions that impede seri-ous awareness of the environmental crisis. Here, Cobb's alternatives are presented in the quest for a more responsive worldview. Second, because environmental issues are pervasive in our modes of thinking, reconsidering education becomes a promising avenue in forming an ecological civilization. This section explores Cobb's detestation of the current education system in the West that idolizes isolated, fragmented dis-ciplines. Instead, Cobb suggests the creation of a holistic, post-disciplinary approach. Finally, Cobb's legacy for the common good concludes this paper by supplying exam-ples of his impact on the creation of an ecological civilization.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - OCEANS Conference
CL  - Chennai, INDIA
AB  - In the wee hours of 28 January 2017, the BW Maple (a liquefied petroleum tanker) collided with another Tanker (MT Dawn Kanchipuram) in the coastal waters off Kamaraj Port, Ennore resulting in an estimated 196 MT of bunker fuel (Grade 6) resulting in an oil spill. On the next day, large patches of oil were observed on the rocky shores approximately 13 km south of the Port. Sentinel satellite images displayed the movement and spread of oil slicks along the coast. Reconnaissance surveys were conducted to assess the implication of oil spills by analyzing various physicochemical and biological parameters at 72 locations comprising of 34 shores and 38 offshore stations. Total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) at Kasikoilkuppam was recorded from 1560 mu g/l on 30th Jan to a maximum concentration of 5573 mu g/l on 8th February 2017. Though the TPH was initially high, the value returned to normalcy in the subsequent months. The variation between air temperature (AT) and sea surface temperatures (SST) was almost about 5 degrees C observed off Tiruchanakuppam (TRK-O), where oil had accumulated. Chl-a concentration was higher during pre-than-post-spill. Chl-a value has substantially reduced in all the coastal stations indicating the impact of oil on biomass. On average, there was a slight decline of 1 mg/L in dissolved oxygen (DO) level during the oil spill event. Phytoplankton, zooplankton, and macrofaunal composition did not indicate any major changes, however, the spatial variations attributed to the local variability. A few cases of mullets and anchovies fish mortality were reported. Though the fish catch remained unaffected, however, a sharp decline in sales was noted due to the notion that the fishes were contaminated with oil. Remarkably, the results obtained during the survey benefitted in assessing the impact on the environment as well as resolving appropriate compensation for different stakeholders.

TI  - Spatial patterns of urban blue-green landscapes on land surface temperature: A case of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia
T2  - CURRENT RESEARCH IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Drastic changes in the urban landscape can lead to irreversible changes in the spatiotemporal pattern of the land surface temperature (LST). The present study was aimed to map the effects of blue-green urban landscapes on LST using geospatial techniques in Addis Ababa during 2006-2021. Object-based image analysis (OBIA) was used to produce land-use/land-cover (LULC) maps using high-resolution imagery from SPOT 5 and Sentinel 2A. Land surface temperature was retrieved from thermal imageries of Landsat 7 ETM+ (band 6) and Landsat 8 TIRS (band 10) using the Mono-Window Algorithm (MWA). Built-up area was the most dominant LULC in the city with expanding trend with an annual growth of 4.4% at the expense of farmland, vegetation, and bare land. In contrast, 53.7% of farmland, 48.1% of vegetation, and 59.4% of bare land were transformed into built-up class during 2006-2021. Mean LST showed an increasing trend from 25.8 degrees C in 2006 to 27.2 degrees C and 28.2 degrees C during 2016 and 2021, respectively. Highest mean LST was observed at bare land having average values of 26.9 degrees C, 28.7 degrees C, and 30.1 degrees C in 2006, 2016 and 2021, respectively. Regression analysis has revealed a strong negative correlation between NDVI and LST, a strong positive correlation between NDBI and LST, and a weak negative correlation between MNDWI and LST. Built-up areas and vegetation cover play a decisive role in the variation of LST compared to surface water. These findings are helpful for understanding urban green as well as land-use planning to minimize the potential impacts of urbanization.

TI  - Domestic Space and Household Culture of the Children of Soviet Kazakhstan, 1950s-1970s
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EARLY CHILDHOOD SPECIAL EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the article is to analyse the household relations and everyday life of the children of Kazakhstan in the post-World War II period until the 1970s, and their impact on shaping the worldview of the future "builders of socialism". The authors explore certain elements affecting the formation of the child's emotional world through the study of material and social components of the child's domestic space. The domestic space of the studied period was a unique phenomenon. It was a combination of the national rural traditions and the elements of urbanized culture, individualism and collectivism, and privacy and publicity. Based on their research findings, the authors come to the conclusion that the children's domestic space of that time was characterised by the lack of many necessities and amenities, but, nevertheless, the majority of the interviewed respondents consider this period to be one of the best in their lives.

TI  - Against domesticated art. A further reading on "The Origin of the Work of Art" and Nazism
T2  - LOGOS-ANALES DEL SEMINARIO DE METAFISICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Many scholars have read Martin Heidegger's "The Origin of the Work of Art" from his political commitment to National Socialism. Is the essay on art an embodiment of his true political position? The aim of this research is to re-explore the links of this work of Heidegger with National Socialism in the light of some fragments of the so-called Black Notebooks, especially those of volume 94 of the Gesamtausgabe that compiles the notes elaborated by the philosopher between 1932 and 1938, years in which the different versions of "The Origin of the Work of Art" were conceived and exposed. The hypothesis I defend in this paper is that reading the essay on art from its political commitment is an unjustified interpretation. It will be shown that, in the years that the essay was being conceived and exposed, Heidegger was critical of the cultural and artistic policies in National Socialist times. With this I do not pretend neither to deny the political dimension in general sense that the writing can have, nor much less the proven and indisputable adhesion of Heidegger to Nazism. But if we ask ourselves if the latter is relevant for his philosophy of art, the answer, in my opinion, is no.

TI  - BARK BEETLE ATTACKS IN ABIOTICLY IMPACTED CONIFEROUS FORESTS IN SMOLYAN REGION AND MONITORING OF THE DAMAGES BY REMOTE SENSING METHODS
T2  - Nauka za Gorata
M3  - Article
AB  - Damages caused by abiotic factors and attacks by bark beetles in the coniferous forests of the Smolyan State Forestry for the last eight years (2014-2021) were analyzed. In 2015, heavy damage from wet snow was recorded on 110.5 ha, mainly in coniferous plantations. The damaged wood was not removed from the plantations, as a result of which a calamity of the pine bark beetle (Ips acuminatus) occurred and in the following two years, 45.6-52.2 ha of healthy pine forests were attacked and destroyed by the pest. In 2018, a windstorm affected 330.2 ha of natural spruce, white pine and fir forests near Smolyan. The affected wood (over 100,000 m(3)) was removed from the stands within one year, and the damages by the spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus) in the following years did not exceed 0.4-14.0 ha, and from I acuminatus - 0.4-6.7 ha. Remote sensing data were applied to assess the damage and health status of the affected forests: satellite images covering 4613.5 ha of affected stands; images taken with a multispectral camera "Parrot SEQUOIA" integrated with an unmanned aerial system "Autel Robotics EVO II" in four stands with a total area of 87.5 ha. It has been found that the use of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) is only appropriate for short-term studies after natural disturbances.

TI  - Melville's Curves: Mathematics and the Melvillean Imagination. Measuring a Cycloid in <i>Moby</i>-<i>Dick</i>
T2  - MIRANDA
M3  - Article
AB  - In this essay I reflect on the role mathematics plays in Melville's works and imagination moving from one specific mathematical reference in chapter XCVI of Moby-Dick "The Try-Works." Here Ishmael mentions the cycloid, a peculiar geometrical construct that was at the center of mathematical and philosophical debates during the 17th century. In the first part of my essay I intend to show how it is only in the light of some of its properties that Ishmael's playful reference to the cycloid can be understood, thus testifying to the author's profound understanding of these mathematical notions. Moreover, Melville must have also been aware of the pivotal role the cycloid played in the history of early modern thought: the investigation into its properties was at the basis of the invention of calculus, which in turn was at the center of the philosophy of post-Cartesian thinkers such as Leibniz and Spinoza. Building on this, in the second part of my essay I intend to show how Ishmael's mention of the cycloid can be seen as a reference to a philosophical worldview according to which nature appears as a continuum of indefinitely foldable matter, a view in which Melville conflates such diverse thinkers as Spinoza, Plato, Goethe or the Transcendentalists and which he presents as both fascinating and problematic. Once the cycloid episode is read in this light and put in relation to a series of structurally similar scenes throughout the novel, it can be interpreted as the representation of this ambivalent position, one of many instances of Melville's ability to bring together and keep alternative worldviews in creative tension.

TI  - Estimation of the spatial and temporal variability of evapotranspiration components in a vineyard with the two source energy balance model (TSEB) using both thermal airborne and the fusion of Sentinel 2 and 3 imagery
T2  - IX INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON IRRIGATION OF HORTICULTURAL CROPS
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 9th International Symposium on Irrigation of Horticultural Crops
CL  - Univ Basilicata, Matera, ITALY
AB  - Accurate estimates of crop water status in heterogeneous crops by means of remote sensing thermal imagery has been mostly achieved through airborne imagery, but not so much with satellites. The lower spatial resolution in the thermal infrared bands in most of the currently available satellite platforms is, among others, one of the reasons that limited its practical implementation for irrigation purposes. In this context, the European Space Agency (ESA) is funding the project Sentinel for Evapotranspiration (SEN-ET), which has the goal to develop an optimal methodology for estimating actual crop evapotranspiration (ETa) at a spatial resolution of 20 m based on synergistic use of Sentinel 2 and Sentinel 3 satellites' observations. To achieve it, ETa estimates were evaluated, among others, with the two-source energy balance (TSEB) model. This work aims to assess the vineyards' spatial and temporal variability of the ETa estimates and its components with the TSEB as well as to compare differences in ETa and T (transpiration) using the land surface temperature (LST) measured by airborne thermal imagery (TSEB-2T) and with a data mining sharpening method capable to fuse images from Sentinel 2 and 3 imagery (TSEB-PT) and to increase the spatial resolution of LST from 1 km to 20 m. To achieve it, three flights were conducted throughout the growing season with an aircraft equipped with a thermal sensor. Concomitant with image acquisitions, Psi(stem) was measured in 32 vines uniformly distributed in the vineyard. The correlations between Psi(stem) with ETa and T were significant in all cases, but coefficients of determination (R-2) slightly improved when both ETa and T were estimated with TSEB-2T. However, estimating time-series of ET throughout the growing season with the TSEB-PT, combined with crop models, could be used to assess vine water requirements and for scheduling irrigation.

M3  - Review
AB  - The work describes and analyzes the monograph of L.P. Naydenova "The Life of a Russian Man of the 16th-17th Centuries (Faith, Family, Everyday Affairs)". It was published in 2020. In it, the author considers issues of the inner world of a person, his relationship with loved ones, and his place in the family. Many of the topics have been understudied. In addition, they are difficult to study, since they are associated with family relationships, and with the closed, personal life. The review was written in order to acquaint readers with the research of the author of the monograph, with the identification of peculiarities of the urban lifestyle, which are inherent in the large cities of the Russian state at the turn of the Middle Ages and early Modernity. This knowledge makes it possible to consider the question of criteria of the characteristics of the city during the Middle Ages and late Modernity. This book may be of interest to specialists in the history of the Middle Ages, medieval family and society. It will be useful to urbanists, sociologists, researchers involved in studying everyday life and mentality. The book will be useful to everyone who is interested in the worldview and everyday history of the Russian medieval city and medieval society.

AB  - Seasonal snow is one of the most dynamic components of the cryosphere. The structure and composition of snowpacks is complex and highly variable, both in space and also in time. This study evaluates a new method for identifying phase changes of seasonal snow cover in the Argentinean Andes using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data available in Google Earth Engine (GEE) through time series derivatives and positive and negative anomalies. The results were compared with an approach based on fixed threshold time series phase change detection.

AB  - The Brazilian Savanna is the second largest biogeographical region in Brazil and present different vegetation types, consisting mostly of tropical savannas, grasslands, and forests. The forest types have different tree cover and floristic composition, which is associated to leaf deciduousness. Considering the importance of Cerrado to biodiversity conservation and the maintaining of environmental services, the development of methods to map the different forest types in Cerrado is important for conservation programmes, subsidize restauration plains, and to allow estimations of carbon sink and stock. Mapping heterogeneous tropical areas, such as the Brazilian Savanna, is very complex due to the natural factors and peculiarities of the vegetation types, and it's still particularly challenging to separate between different forest formations. In this study we tested machine learning approaches based on the use of dense image time series, in order to evaluate the separability Dry Tropical Forests and Savanna woodlands. We considered the Brazilian State of Tocantins as the study area, which is located in the Northern region of the country. RF classification of Landsat dense time series showed an overall accuracy of 0.85005, while the LSTM approach presented an overall accuracy of 0.88601, with the highest fl-score for the savanna woodlands class, suggesting the capability of the recurrent neural networks on handling complex long-term dependencies such as the EVI dense time series data. This study showed the potential for the development of a semiautomatic method for discriminating the different types of forest formations in the Brazilian Savanna, based on remote sensing.

AB  - This paper presents an annual crop classification exercise considering the entire area of continental Portugal for the 2020 agricultural year. The territory was divided into landscape units, i.e. areas of similar landscape characteristics for independent training and classification. Data from the Portuguese Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) was used for training. Thirty-one annual crops were identified for classification. Supervised classification was undertaken using Random Forest. A time-series of Sentinel-2 images was gathered and prepared. Automatic processes were applied to auxiliary datasets to improve the training data quality and lower class mislabelling. Automatic random extraction was employed to derive a large amount of sampling units for each annual crop class in each landscape unit. An LPIS dataset of controlled parcels was used for results validation. An overall accuracy of 85% is obtained for the map at national level indicating that the methodology is useful to identify and characterize most of annual crop types in Portugal. Class aggregation of the annual crop types by two types of growing season, autumn/winter and spring/summer, resulted in large improvements in the accuracy of almost all annual crops, and an overall accuracy improvement of 2%. This experiment shows that LPIS dataset can be used for training a supervised classifier based on machine learning with high-resolution remote sensing optical data, to produce a reliable crop map at national level.

AB  - During oil extraction process, natural gases escape from wells, and the procedure for recovering these gases requires heavy investments from oil and gas companies. That is why, most often, they prefer to burn them with flares. This practice, which is very common by oil and gas companies in oil-producing countries, is highly emitting greenhouse gases. Under increasing pressure from the World Bank and environmental defenders, several producer countries are committed to reducing gas flaring. To this end, researchers in the oil and gas industry, academia and governments are working to develop approaches for determining ways to measure gas flaring and its emissions. Among the most widely used approaches, for local and global monitoring of gas flares, are those that exploit remote sensing data, particularly Night time Light (NtL) ones. Indeed, it is possible to extract, from such data, some physical parameters of flames produced by gas flares, and these parameters can be used to estimate annual volumes of flared gas. In this investigation, three spectral analysis-based approaches are tested to estimate flare physical parameters from Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) NtL data. Linear and nonlinear spectral unmixing methods applied on NtL VIIRS data, are anticipated to improve, by using a pure spectrum of flames, results provided by the classical one that considers the modeling of the Planck law curve applied on the manipulated observed mixed data. Experiments, based on realistic synthetic VIIRS NtL data, are conducted and obtained results confirm the expected improvements.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

CL  - Kuala Lumpur, MALAYSIA
AB  - In this paper, a novel approach, based on a multistage informed spectral unmixing technique, for detecting and mapping several mineral deposits in the Gara-Djebilet region (Southwestern Algeria), is presented. The considered technique, which is related to linear spectral unmixing methods, uses an iterative informed multiplicative nonnegative matrix factorization algorithm. This technique unmixes the used PRISMA hyperspectral remote sensing data by exploiting known spectra of the considered minerals. More precisely, the originality of this work consists in applying iteratively, in two stages, the considered informed unmixing algorithm. During the first stage, abundant but irrelevant minerals, with known spectra and present in the considered region, are detected, and are then removed from the original hyperspectral data, which thus lead to the creation of new hyperspectral data to which the considered unmixing technique is applied, during the second stage, in order to detect and map other relevant minerals, with known spectra, and possibly together with unknown materials. Experiments are carried out with the considered real hyperspectral data, which cover the studied area, to assess the potential of the proposed approach. The obtained results are mainly confirmed and validated by prior knowledge of the investigated area.

AB  - Hypersharpening results in creating unobservable hyperspectral remote sensing data with high spectral and spatial resolutions, by combining a hyperspectral image, characterized by a high spectral resolution, with a high spatial resolution multispectral one. In this paper, a new hypersharpening method, based on the linear spectral unmixing concept, is proposed. This one, based on a multiplicative Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) technique, extends the Coupled NMF (CNMF) algorithm by addressing the spectral variability phenomenon. The introduced algorithm that uses multiplicative and iterative update rules minimizes a cost function that takes into account the specific structure of involved matrices, in order to deal with the spectral variability phenomenon. The proposed method is applied to realistic synthetic data, and its effectiveness is evaluated with established performance criteria. The obtained results show that the developed extended CNMF algorithm yields sharpened hyperspectral data with fine spectral and spatial fidelities. Also, these results demonstrate that the proposed technique outperforms the tested hypersharpening literature approaches.

AB  - In this work, the changes detection problem in multitemporal hyperspectral remote sensing images is investigated, in particular the case when observed scenes do not contain the same materials is considered. The proposed strategy combines clustering and linear spectral unmixing techniques to obtain a set of hyperspectral endmember spectra that are present in the considered multitemporal data. Then, the obtained spectra are used to estimate, by means of nonnegative matrix factorization, multitemporal abundance maps. The changes detection is accomplished by comparing the estimated abundance maps. The proposed methodology is compared with other unmixing-based approaches widely used in the literature and the simulation results show that the proposed strategy outperforms the other tested methods.

T2  - SCIENTIFIC PAPERS-SERIES MANAGEMENT ECONOMIC ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the southern part of the Romanian Plain, a research was carried out over a period of 5 agricultural years (2016 - 2021) regarding the evaluation of wheat crops, consisting of 7 premium varieties, on a surface of 110 ha. The NDVI index was used to assess the quality of management, the influence of climate change, which are in constant variation, on wheat crops and their ability to fix atmospheric carbon in the form of CO2. For analyzing the data obtained from the Sentinel-2 satellite, in order to make the NDVI periodically summing and, then, to establish the daily average during the vegetation period from spring to summer, the calculation of the correlations and of the complex functions in 2D were used. In the integrated amount, NDVI ranged between 110.06 in 2020, the driest year, and 124.79 in 2018, the most favorable year for wheat cultivation. Yields also fluctuated in direct proportion to NDVI values, from 2,100 to 6,700 kg of wheat/ha. The obtained results place the area in conditions of high risk to water and other climatic factors, risks that can be partially reduced by optimizing crop management.

AB  - Nowadays, the volume and variety of vessel tracking data are rapidly increasing. The Automatic Identification System (AIS) is the main source of vessel tracking data as most commercial vessels need to bear an AIS transponder and transmit messages every few seconds to minutes, depending on the vessel type and navigational status. Although calculating the density of vessel traffic based on AIS provides the most valuable insights, other sources of data could also be added in order to obtain a more complete picture of the maritime domain, as there are areas with limited AIS coverage and areas where vessels tend to switch-off their transponders. In the work described in this paper, we highlight those areas by performing vessel detection in Copernicus Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery and producing "dark vessel" density maps, i.e., maps showing the density of vessels not transmitting AIS messages. The experimental evaluation of our approach shows that our framework achieves an accuracy greater than 95%.

AB  - The article reveals the specifics of creation, content, functions and value of the electronic information and bibliographic resource "Outstanding Educators of Ukraine and the World" of V. O. Sukhomlynskyi State Scientific and Pedagogical Library of the National Academy of Educational Sciences of Ukraine in a comparative dimension with similar Ukrainian and foreign electronic biographical resources. The goals of the development of the electronic biographical resource have been formulated; the specifics of formation of its content and structure have been characterized; the importance of electronic biographical resources in the domestic and foreign educational and scientific space as a component of digital humanities has been substantiated. The influence of the use of electronic biographical resources on public opinion and on a person in the educational dimension has been investigated. It has been proven that in the context of the digital transformation of the scientific sphere and the integration of the Ukrainian education into the European educational and scientific space, the development of electronic information and specialized bibliographic resources, dedicated to well-known personalities in the sphere of education, history and culture, got significant repercussions. We have substantiated why the electronic resource "Outstanding Educators of Ukraine and the World", containing information about Ukrainian and foreign educators and public figures, is a unique specialist resource without analogues. It is a significant contribution to the development of digital pedagogical biographics and it makes it possible, through the prism of scientific biographies, to trace systematically the development of the Ukrainian and foreign education, pedagogical thought in both macrohistorical and microhistorical dimensions and to contribute to the restoration of the national pedagogical memory. The representation via the electronic resource of the generalized knowledge about the humanistic ideas of the Ukrainian and foreign educators and public figures of the past is of great importance for education in general, in particular for pedagogical education in Ukraine, namely in the system of professional training; it is a source of formation of a pedagogical worldview students who will be teachers in the future, increasing their spiritual culture in the face of global civilizational challenges. We have revealed that the information and bibliographic resource requires further updating, taking into account the new achievements of the Ukrainian and foreign historical, educational and biographical studies and the latest information technologies. The priority tasks for improving the electronic resource have been identified, in particular: the prospects for the content and the ways of updating information and making qualitative changes in the functionality of the electronic educational resource.

TI  - The Dynamic Relationship between Air and Land Surface Temperature within the Madison, Wisconsin Urban Heat Island
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban heat island (UHI) effect, the phenomenon by which cities are warmer than rural surroundings, is increasingly important in a rapidly urbanizing and warming world, but fine-scale differences in temperature within cities are difficult to observe accurately. Networks of air temperature (T-air) sensors rarely offer the spatial density needed to capture neighborhood-level disparities in warming, while satellite measures of land surface temperature (LST) do not reflect the air temperatures that people physically experience. This analysis combines both T-air measurements recorded by a spatially-dense stationary sensor network in Dane County, Wisconsin, and remotely-sensed measurements of LST over the same area-to improve the use and interpretation of LST in UHI studies. The data analyzed span three summer months (June, July, and August) and eight years (2012-2019). Overall, T-air and LST displayed greater agreement in spatial distribution than in magnitude. The relationship between day of the year and correlation was fit to a parabolic curve (R-2 = 0.76, p = 0.0002) that peaked in late July. The seasonal evolution in the relationship between T-air and LST, along with particularly high variability in LST across agricultural land cover suggest that plant phenology contributes to a seasonally varying relationship between T-air and LST measurements of the UHI.

TI  - Unsupervised Change Detection Using Convolutional-Autoencoder Multiresolution Features
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of deep learning (DL) methods for change detection (CD) is currently dominated by supervised models that require a large number of labeled samples. However, these samples are difficult to acquire in the multitemporal case. A possible alternative is leveraging methods that exploit transfer learning for CD by reusing DL models pretrained for other tasks. However, the performance of the transfer-learning-based models decreases as much as the target images differ from the ones used for training the model. To overcome this limit, we propose an unsupervised CD method that exploits multiresolution deep feature maps derived by a convolutional autoencoder (CAE). It automatically learns spatial features from the input during the training phase without requiring any labeled data. The proposed method processes the bitemporal images to obtain and compare multiresolution bitemporal feature maps. These feature maps are then analyzed by a feature-selection technique to select the most discriminant ones. Furthermore, an aggregated multiresolution difference image is computed and used for a detail-preserving multiscale CD. In the context of this CD approach, we propose two alternative strategies to retrieve multiscale reliability maps. We tested the proposed method on bitemporal multispectral images acquired by Landsat-5 and Landsat-8 representing burned areas and Sentinel-2 images representing deforested areas. Results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed CD technique.

T2  - IMAGE AND SIGNAL PROCESSING FOR REMOTE SENSING XXVIII
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Image and Signal Processing for Remote Sensing XXVIII
CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - Many Change Detection (CD) methods exploit the bi-temporal multi-modal data derived by multiple sensors to find the changes effectively. State-of-the-Art CD methods define features with a common domain between the multi-modal data by normalizing input images or ad hoc feature extraction/selection methods. Deep Learning (DL) CD methods automatically learn features with a common domain during the training or adapt the features derived by multi-modal data. However, CD methods focusing on multi-sensor multi-frequency SAR data are still poorly investigated. We propose a DL CD method that exploits a Cycle Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) to automatically learn and extract multi-scale feature maps in a domain common to the input multi-frequency multi-sensor SAR data. The feature maps are learned, during unsupervised training, by generators that aim to transform the input data domain into the target one while preserving the semantic information and aligning the feature domain. We process the multi-sensor multi-frequency SAR data with the trained generators to produce bi-temporal multi-scale feature maps that are compared to enhance changes. A standard-deviation-based feature selection is applied to keep only the most informative comparisons and reject the ones with poor change information. The multi-scale comparisons are used for a detail preserving CD. Preliminary experimental results conducted on bi-temporal SAR data acquired by Cosmo-SkyMed and SAOCOM on the urban area of Milan, Italy, in January 2020 and August 2021 provided promising results.

TI  - An overview of Zika virus genotypes and their infectivity
T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
M3  - Review
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA arbovirus belonging to the genus Flavivirus. It was first isolated from a sentinel monkey in Uganda in 1947. More recently, ZIKV has undergone rapid geographic expansion and has been responsible for outbreaks in Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and America. In this review, we have highlighted the influence of viral genetic variants on ZIKV pathogenesis. Two major ZIKV genotypes (African and Asian) have been identified. The Asian genotype is subdivided into Southwest Asia, Pacific Island, and American strains, and is responsible for most outbreaks. Non-synonymous mutations in ZIKV proteins C, prM, E, NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, and NS4B were found to have a higher prevalence and association with virulent strains of the Asian genotype. Consequently, the Asian genotype appears to have acquired higher cellular permissiveness, tissue persistence, and viral tropism in human neural cells. Therefore, mutations in specific coding regions of the Asian genotype may enhance ZIKV infectivity. Considering that mutations in the genomes of emerging viruses may lead to new virulent variants in humans, there is a potential for the re-emergence of new ZIKV cases in the future.

AB  - Among the most rapid and dramatic changes related to Arctic permafrost thaw are retrogressive thaw slumps. These slumps evolve by a retreat of the slump headwall during the summer months, making their change visible by comparing digital elevation models over time or by identifying the induced vegetation changes in time-series of optical satellite images. In this study we use digital elevation models generated from TanDEM-X observations to detect and derive volume and area change rates for RTSs on the Taymyr Peninsula. The available data takes allows to compare two time periods: from 2010/11/12 to 2016/17 and from 2017/18 to 2020/21. From 2016 onwards optical Sentinel-2 observations are available for which we manually map thaw slumps for each year in a small sub-area and compare the results to the TanDEM-X mapped RTSs. We found a strong, non-linear increase in the second time-period of the TanDEM-X period and by using the optical mapped RTSs we could attribute this increase to the Siberian heatwave in 2020.

CP  - IEEE International Conference on Space Optical Systems and Applications (ICSOS)
CL  - Kyoto, JAPAN
AB  - As the demand for satellite data transmission increases, higher capacity optical links need to be developed to allow satellites to be connected directly to ground stations (GST). The advantages of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) direct-to-Earth links are smaller latency when compared to relay systems using Geostationary Orbit (GEO) satellites, i.e. LEO-to-GEO and GEO-to-GST, and an increased available bandwidth offered by the optical spectrum with respect to radio frequency (RF) which allows for much higher link capacity. The increase in data rate of optical satellite to ground links towards 100 Gbps will require implementing optical coherent transceivers with capability to compensate for Doppler shift and atmospheric channel impairments. An important figure of merit which needs to be carefully considered in a satellite system is the equipment power consumption. The power consumption of coherent receivers used for terrestrial applications is closely related to the bit rate, with a receiver back-end digital signal processing being responsible for the vast majority of the power consumed.In this paper we propose a hybrid approach to signal processing consisting of simplified digital and analogue elements allowing for significant power reduction. Moreover, one of the attractive aspects of the proposed approach is that it does not require an increased complexity for an increase in baud rate. It will be discussed that the analogue approach to the frequency and phase recovery would allow a saving of approximately 40% to 50% of power on the overall DSP block at baud rates between 10 Gbaud and 100 Gbaud.

T2  - GigaScience
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The barnacles are a group of >2,000 species that have fascinated biologists, including Darwin, for centuries. Their lifestyles are extremely diverse, from free-swimming larvae to sessile adults, and even root-like endoparasites. Barnacles also cause hundreds of millions of dollars of losses annually due to biofouling. However, genomic resources for crustaceans, and barnacles in particular, are lacking. Results Using 62x Pacific Biosciences coverage, 189x Illumina whole-genome sequencing coverage, 203x HiC coverage, and 69x CHi-C coverage, we produced a chromosome-level genome assembly of the gooseneck barnacle Pollicipes pollicipes. The P. pollicipes genome is 770 Mb long and its assembly is one of the most contiguous and complete crustacean genomes available, with a scaffold N50 of 47 Mb and 90.5% of the BUSCO Arthropoda gene set. Using the genome annotation produced here along with transcriptomes of 13 other barnacle species, we completed phylogenomic analyses on a nearly 2 million amino acid alignment. Contrary to previous studies, our phylogenies suggest that the Pollicipedomorpha is monophyletic and sister to the Balanomorpha, which alters our understanding of barnacle larval evolution and suggests homoplasy in a number of naupliar characters. We also compared transcriptomes of P. pollicipes nauplius larvae and adults and found that nearly one-half of the genes in the genome are differentially expressed, highlighting the vastly different transcriptomes of larvae and adult gooseneck barnacles. Annotation of the genes with KEGG and GO terms reveals that these stages exhibit many differences including cuticle binding, chitin binding, microtubule motor activity, and membrane adhesion. Conclusion This study provides high-quality genomic resources for a key group of crustaceans. This is especially valuable given the roles P. pollicipes plays in European fisheries, as a sentinel species for coastal ecosystems, and as a model for studying barnacle adhesion as well as its key position in the barnacle tree of life. A combination of genomic, phylogenetic, and transcriptomic analyses here provides valuable insights into the evolution and development of barnacles.

Their lifestyles are extremely diverse, from free-swimming larvae to sessile adults, and even root-like endoparasites. Barnacles also cause hundreds of millions of dollars of losses annually due to biofouling. However, genomic resources for crustaceans, and barnacles in particular, are lacking.Results Using 62x Pacific Biosciences coverage, 189x Illumina whole-genome sequencing coverage, 203x HiC coverage, and 69x CHi-C coverage, we produced a chromosome-level genome assembly of the gooseneck barnacle Pollicipes pollicipes. The P. pollicipes genome is 770 Mb long and its assembly is one of the most contiguous and complete crustacean genomes available, with a scaffold N50 of 47 Mb and 90.5% of the BUSCO Arthropoda gene set. Using the genome annotation produced here along with transcriptomes of 13 other barnacle species, we completed phylogenomic analyses on a nearly 2 million amino acid alignment. Contrary to previous studies, our phylogenies suggest that the Pollicipedomorpha is monophyletic and sister to the Balanomorpha, which alters our understanding of barnacle larval evolution and suggests homoplasy in a number of naupliar characters. We also compared transcriptomes of P. pollicipes nauplius larvae and adults and found that nearly one-half of the genes in the genome are differentially expressed, highlighting the vastly different transcriptomes of larvae and adult gooseneck barnacles. Annotation of the genes with KEGG and GO terms reveals that these stages exhibit many differences including cuticle binding, chitin binding, microtubule motor activity, and membrane adhesion.Conclusion This study provides high-quality genomic resources for a key group of crustaceans. This is especially valuable given the roles P. pollicipes plays in European fisheries, as a sentinel species for coastal ecosystems, and as a model for studying barnacle adhesion as well as its key position in the barnacle tree of life. A combination of genomic, phylogenetic, and transcriptomic analyses here provides valuable insights into the evolution and development of barnacles.

TI  - IDEOLOGY IN SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT OF RUSSIA: NEW VIEW
T2  - SOTSIOLOGICHESKIE ISSLEDOVANIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article substantiates the inherent importance of ideology for the social development of Russia both in historical dynamics and at the present stage. It is argued that ideology triggers the mechanism of transition from one institutional cycle to another, as its image of the future is associated with the rejection of the existing order. The ideology of socialism, which denies private property, has contributed to the entrenchment of 'razdatok' economy that has taken shape since the emergence of the Russian state. The ideology of Russian liberalism led to the replacement of the classical market by a quasi-market, the core of which preserved outdated distribution mechanisms. This model was as at the turn of the 19th - 20th centuries, and now, the cause of economic stagnation and acute social polarization. It is assumed that the ideology of new solidarism may become the next step in the worldview of Russian society, as it integrates the ideas of liberalism and socialism through the symbiosis of their practical base - the market and distribution. Solidarity in the new format is the principle of building a social system based on a balance of individual and common interests, in which its citizens have real subjectivity, equal opportunities, the right to elections and civil protests within the framework of a strong social state. The course based on the contractual 'razdatok' model, based on the ideology of new solidarity, will be an effective engine for overcoming the systemic crisis in Russia.

TI  - Land Cover Change and Its Impact in Crop Yield: A Case Study from Western Nepal.
T2  - TheScientificWorldJournal
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - This study was conducted in Tanahun district of Gandaki Province, Nepal, to analyze the land cover change over two decades, the migration effect in land cover, and the impact caused in crop production by Rhesus macaque. Landsat TM/ETM+ for land use of 2000 and 2010 extracted by ICIMOD and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS satellite images for land cover 2019 were downloaded from the USGS website. A purposive sample for household survey was carried out based on crops damaged by the monkey. Two hundred and fifty households were taken as samples. The Landsat images were analyzed by ArcGIS, and the social data were analyzed using SPSS and MS Excel. Land cover change data revealed increment of forest cover from 36.57% to 40.91% and drastic decrease in agriculture crops from 57.52% to 43.78% in the period of 20 years. The accuracy of the data showed overall classification accuracy of 86.11%, 81.08%, and 75% with overall kappa statistics 0.83, 0.77, and 0.74, respectively. The migration effect in the land cover was related to remittance and migrated members and found a significant positive relationship. Analyzing the trend of production with an increase in the forest cover, 21% decrease in paddy, 5% decrease in maize, and 26% decrease in millet were found as compared to the production in 2000. The econometric model concluded that the quantity of crop damage was negatively significant in relation to distance from forest and distance from water body while positively significant to distance from settlements and distance from owner's home. The quantity of crop damage was estimated 113.89kg per household, and the cost was 78.82 USD. This study recommends active forest management; regular thinning, and weeding. Remittance generated should be invested in the agriculture field by the households. Damage relief should be made available for the damage cost by Rhesus macaque.

M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Primary rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) of breast is an uncommon entity and axillary lymph node (ALN) involvement is exceedingly rare.METHODS: Herein, we are reporting a case of RMS of breast with ALN metastasis in an adolescent girl. We searched Pubmed and Cochrane databases with keywords rhabdomyosarcoma and breast. All studies published in English language literature were included. Articles describing metastatic involvement of breast with RMS were excluded.RESULT: The initial search yielded a total of 8468 studies, out of which 03 were found to be duplicate. 8420 studies were excluded based on title and abstract as they did not fulfill inclusion criteria. Full text of the remaining 48 studies was screened. After full text screening, 26 case reports describing primary breast RMS were included. Overall 21% patients had axillary lymph node metastasis.CONCLUSION: Axillary staging should be considered in every patient undergoing surgery for breast RMS. However, it's impact on recurrence and survival could not be determined based on current review.

TI  - A remote sensing approach to explore the available water spread for fisheries development in the reservoirs of Godavari River Basin, Telangana, India
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Reservoirs have tremendous fisheries potential amongst the inland water resources and aptly referred as 'sleeping giants', as the fish yield potential of these resources are yet to be tapped. Existing gaps in the availability of absolute information and data on the inland water resources hinder the applicability and implementation of various fisheries development programmes, which in turn impact inland fisheries production. The present study was carried out in the reservoirs viz., Sri Ram Sagar, Kaddam and Swarna from the Godavari Basin, covering the period 2016-2021, as a case study to demonstrate the use of remote sensed data in fisheries stock enhancement planning. The perennial and seasonal water spread area of the reservoirs under study, estimated through composite water maps prepared using Sentinel 2A data ranged between 8 to 19 and 4 to 29%, respectively. Further, the potential area for enclosure fish culture (both cage and pen culture) in these reservoirs were found to range between 14.89% (Sir Ram Sagar) to 48.54% (Kaddam). The field validated results revealed less than 0.1% of the perennial water spread area mapped in these reservoirs is under use for cage culture. This highlights under-utilisation of these reservoirs and demonstrates scope for developing enclosure fish culture or other culture-based fisheries for enhancing the fish production. The study also demonstrates the use of geospatial tools in development planning for expanding enclosure fish culture in the reservoirs and in turn enhancing fisheries production from the reservoirs in India.

AB  - This paper presents the application of computer vision and artificial neural networks for autonomous approach and landing and taxiing for an aircraft. In civil aviation and unmanned aircraft system industry, safety has always been the prime concern. We present a system which uses modern pattern recognition algorithm to aid in the landing of all types of aerial vehicles. The auto-land systems used today in aviation sector utilize a radio waves-based system known as Instrument Landing System (ILS) which has been in operation since decades. Although, it is efficient but might sometime be intermittent and is vulnerable to interference.Moreover, the auto-land system works in conjunction with different devices such as radio altimeter, ILS, Global Positioning System (GPS) and others. But, before reaching the Minimum Decision Altitude (MDA), pilots are expected to have the runway threshold marking, aiming point marking, displacement arrows and other touchdown markings/lights in-sight for landing. For this purpose, use of imaging sensors as an augmentation system for pilots during landing can improve the safety manifolds. Our method uses modern artificial neural networks to learn to recognize and localize important visual references during landing and taxiing useful for pilots by utilizing the satellite imagery dataset from Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing.

AB  - Accurate and high-resolution spatio-temporal information on crop growth is essential for agronomic management and grain yield estimation. Data provided by the dual-pol Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) on board Sentinel-1 is an effective way for crop mapping and monitoring from space independent of weather conditions. In this study, we propose a target characterization parameter, theta(xP) that utilizes the 2D Barakat degree of polarization and the elements of the covariance matrix representing dual-pol SAR data. We also propose an unsupervised clustering scheme using theta(xP) and the scattering entropy, HxP. We utilize time-series Sentinel-1 data of wheat fields over a Canadian test site to show the sensitivity of theta(xP) to the development of crop morphology at different phenological stages. Similarly, the effectiveness of the unsupervised H-xP=theta(xP) clustering plane is also examined using a sequence of temporal clustering plots. This innovative clustering framework will be convenient for the operational use of Sentinel-1 SAR data for agricultural applications.

AB  - In the remote sensing community, Land Use Land Cover (LULC) classification with satellite imagery is a main focus of current research activities. Accurate and appropriate LULC classification, however, continues to be a challenging task. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of multi-temporal (monthly time series) compared to mono-temporal (single time step) satellite images for multi-label classification using supervised learning on the RapidAI4EO dataset. As a first step, we trained our CNN model on images at a single time step for multi-label classification, i.e. mono-temporal. We incorporated time-series images using a LSTM model to assess whether or not multi-temporal signals from satellites improves CLC classification. The results demonstrate an improvement of approximately 0.89% in classifying satellite imagery on 15 classes using a multi-temporal approach on monthly time series images compared to the mono-temporal approach. Using features from multi-temporal or mono-temporal images, this work is a step towards an efficient change detection and land monitoring approach.

TI  - A GPU-Based Solution for Ray Tracing 3-D Radiative Transfer Model for Optical and Thermal Images
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Three-dimensional (3-D) radiative transfer (RT) models are frequently recognized as a prerequisite when using high spatial resolution remote sensing (RS) data in heterogeneous surfaces. However, most studies of 3-D RT models have been restricted to limited applications due to the low computational efficiency. Therefore, this study proposed a graphic processing unit (GPU)-based solution for the ray tracing 3-D RT model. A state-of-the-art graphics and compute application programming interface (API), Vulkan, were introduced to implement the RT process. A bounding box method was adopted for the computation acceleration. By comparison with a central processing unit (CPU)-based solution, the performance efficiency of the proposed solution is significantly better: the simulation time of a GPU model is significantly reduced by more than 99% when facing a large-scale simulation mission. The simulation accuracy of the two solutions is similar, with root mean squared errors (RMSEs) lower than 0.005, 0.032, and 0.31 K for the red, near-infrared (NIR), and brightness temperature (BT) images, respectively. An evaluation based on airborne multiangle measurements also indicated that the accuracy of the proposed solution was satisfactory for simulating the red and NIR bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) and BT directional anisotropies (DAs), with RMSEs lower than 0.003, 0.020, and 0.20 K, respectively, when treating the whole scene as a pixel. Considering the simulation accuracy and efficiency, a GPU-based model will be an important supplement to the CPU model.

TI  - Uncertainty in Aqua-MODIS Aerosol Retrieval Algorithms During COVID-19 Lockdown
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This letter reports uncertainties in the Aqua-Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Level 2 dark target (DT), deep blue (DB), and multiangle implementation of atmospheric correction (MAIAC) aerosol optical depth (AOD) during the COVID-19 lockdown period (February-May 2020) compared to the pre-COVID-19 period (February-May 2019). Validation of AOD retrievals was conducted against AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) Version 3 Level 1.5 AOD data obtained from three sites located in urban (Beijing_CAMS and Beijing_RADI) and suburban (XiangHe) areas of China. The results show the poor performance of the DT and DB algorithms compared to the MAIAC algorithm, which performed better during the lockdown period. Overall, all MODIS algorithms overestimated the AOD and showed higher positive bias under high aerosol loading conditions during lockdown than during prelockdown. This is mainly attributed to the overestimation of the aerosol single-scattering albedo (SSA), which was found higher during lockdown than during the same period in 2019.

TI  - Integration of Surface Reflectance and Aerosol Retrieval Algorithms for Multi-Resolution Aerosol Optical Depth Retrievals over Urban Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The SEMARA approach, an integration of the Simplified and Robust Surface Reflectance Estimation (SREM) and Simplified Aerosol Retrieval Algorithm (SARA) methods, was used to retrieve aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550 nm from a Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) at 30 m spatial resolution, a Terra-Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) at 500 m resolution, and a Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) at 750 m resolution over bright urban surfaces in Beijing. The SEMARA approach coupled (1) the SREM method that is used to estimate the surface reflectance, which does not require information about water vapor, ozone, and aerosol, and (2) the SARA algorithm, which uses the surface reflectance estimated by SREM and AOD measurements obtained from the Aerosol Robotic NETwork (AERONET) site (or other high-quality AOD) as the input to estimate AOD without prior information on the aerosol optical and microphysical properties usually obtained from a look-up table constructed from long-term AERONET data. In the present study, AOD measurements were obtained from the Beijing AERONET site. The SEMARA AOD retrievals were validated against AOD measurements obtained from two other AERONET sites located at urban locations in Beijing, i.e., Beijing_RADI and Beijing_CAMS, over bright surfaces. The accuracy and uncertainties/errors in the AOD retrievals were assessed using Pearson's correlation coefficient (r), root mean squared error (RMSE), relative mean bias (RMB), and expected error (EE = +/- 0.05 +/- 20%). EE is the envelope encompassing both absolute and relative errors and contains 68% (+/- 1 sigma) of the good quality retrievals based on global validation. Here, the EE of the MODIS Dark Target algorithm at 3 km resolution is used to report the good quality SEMARA AOD retrievals. The validation results show that AOD from SEMARA correlates well with AERONET AOD measurements with high correlation coefficients (r) of 0.988, 0.980, and 0.981; small RMSE of 0.08, 0.09, and 0.08; and small RMB of 4.33%, 1.28%, and -0.54%. High percentages of retrievals, i.e., 85.71%, 91.53%, and 90.16%, were within the EE for Landsat 8 OLI, MODIS, and VIIRS, respectively. The results suggest that the SEMARA approach is capable of retrieving AOD over urban areas with high accuracy and small errors using high to medium spatial resolution satellite remote sensing data. This approach can be used for aerosol monitoring over bright urban surfaces such as in Beijing, which is frequently affected by severe dust storms and haze pollution, to evaluate their effects on public health.

AB  - It is well known that nowadays remote sensing has a very crucial role in agricultural applications using in particular spectral indices as analysis tools useful to describe the temporal and spatial variability of crops, derived from processing of satellite images, each with different resolutions on the ground, according to the satellite of origin. It is also known that today such information can also be obtained through the use of sensors mounted on UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle). In the present note we want to carry out a detailed analysis to define the condition of vigor of a vineyard situated in the province of Reggio Calabria (Southern Italy), comparing multispectral satellite images (Sentinel-2) with those provided by UAV platforms at low altitude, using as a parameter of effectiveness the relationship between the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and the vigor of the crops. It is also proposed a GIS (Geographic Information System) for the management of agricultural land in order to build a system that can provide alerts in case interventions are needed depending on crop water stress.

AB  - The effect of urbanization on environmental justice in Rwanda from 1999 to 2019 is examined in this research. Specifically, the research sought to document changes in land use and land cover in the study region from 1999 to 2019, to analyze the environmental consequences of urban growth in Rwanda. Land use/land cover patterns were identified and modelled using remotely sensed data. The results show that, in the majority of instances, built-up areas have increased at 15 to20% , whereas forests, vegetation and water bodies have decreased 49% in Nyagatare city. It has been observed that urbanization is out of step with the natural urban environment, resulting in soil erosion, violent winds, flooding, and landslides, all of which are associated with the failure of environmental justice. 64 people died and 178 injured in 5 years, settlement destruction, flooding occurrences, infrastructure damage, loss of natural habitat, and agricultural loss are all associated with urban development, especially uncontrolled settlements in metropolitan settings. The research suggests that current households in high-risk zones be moved to other zones and the government should strengthen its greening city strategy and raise public understanding of environmental issues.

TI  - Viral aetiology of influenza-like illnesses and severe acute respiratory illnesses in Morocco, September 2014 to December 2016
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLOBAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background There is a scarcity of information on the viral aetiology of influenza-like illness (III) and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) among patients in Morocco. Methods From September 2014 to December 2016, we prospectively enrolled in-patients and outpatients from all age groups meeting the World Health Organiza-tion (WHO) case definition for III and SARI from 59 sentinel sites. The specimens were tested using real-time monoplex reverse-transcription polymerase chain reac-tion method for detecting 16 relevant respiratory viruses. Results At least one respiratory virus was detected in 1423 (70.8%) of 2009 spec-imens. Influenza viruses were the most common, detected in 612 (30.4%) of pro-cessed samples, followed by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in 359 (17.9%), human rhinovirus (HRV) in 263 (13.1%), adenovirus (HAdV) in 124 (6.2%), parainfluenza viruses (HPIV) in 107 (5.3%), coronaviruses (HCoV) in 94 (4.7%), human bocavirus (HBoV) in 92 (4.6%), and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) in 74 (3.7%). From 770 samples from children under 5 years old, RSV (288, 36.6%), influenza viruses (106, 13.8%), HRV (96, 12.5%) and HAdV (91, 11.8%) were most prevalent. Among 955 samples from adults, Influenza viruses (506, 53.0%), and HRV (167, 17.5%) were most often detected. Co-infections were found in 268 (18.8%) of 1423 positive spec-imens, and most (60.4%) were in children under 5 years of age. While influenza vi-ruses, RSV, and HMPV had a defined period of circulation, the other viruses did not display clear seasonal patterns. Conclusions We found that RSV was predominant among SARI cases in Morocco, particularly in children under 5 years of age. Our results are in line with reported data from other parts of the world, stating that RSV is the leading cause of lower re-spiratory tract infections in infants and young children.

TI  - SADA-Net: A Shape Feature Optimization and Multiscale Context Information-Based Water Body Extraction Method for High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have significance in remote sensing image mapping, and pixel-level representation allows refined results. Due to inconsistencies within a class and different scales of water bodies, the water body mapping has challenges, such as insufficient integrity and rough shape segmentation. To resolve these issues, we proposed an intelligent water bodies extraction method (named SADA-Net) for high-resolution remote sensing images. This method considers multiscale information, context dependence, and shape features. The network framework integrates three critical components: shape feature optimization (SFO), atrous spatial pyramid pooling, and dual attention modules. SADA-Net can accurately extract an extensive range of water bodies in complex scenarios. SADA-Net has certain advantages regarding small and dense water bodies extraction, as the SFO module effectively solves the defects of the unified processing of low-level features in the encoder stage of CNNs, which highlights the shape information of a water body. Two data types (red, green, and blue bands and multispectral images) are employed to verify the performance of the proposed network. The best result achieved an evaluation index F1-Score of 96.14% in large-scale image segmentation, and the structural similarity index measure reached 94.70%. Overall, the proposed method achieves the purpose of maximizing the integrity and optimizing the shape of a water body. Additionally, the SADA-Net proposed in this article has a specific reference value for high-resolution remote sensing image water bodies mapping.

AB  - Accurate knowledge on the time-delays between detector bands is paramount for the observation of dynamic features in Sentinel-2 imagery. Sentinel-2 inter-band time delays have been characterised analytically and empirically on Level-1B images with help of the rigorous geometric model. Two major contributors have been identified: optical distortion and satellite altitude inducing across- track and along-track delay variations up to +/-2% with respect to ESA handbook fixed value. A harmonic attitude perturbation induces a 0.15% peak to peak temporal modulation on delays. An original method is proposed in order to estimate inter-band delays from L1C orthorectified and tiled products. The method relies on the orbital ephemeris embedded in L1C metadata and a lookup table. The performance assessment exhibits a maximum error of 1% and a rms error of 0.28%.

AB  - This study estimates monthly variation of surface water volume of Thac Mo water reservoir, located in Binh Phuoc province, in South Vietnam, for the 2016-2021 period, using SAR Sentinel-1 observations and Jason-3 altimetry data. SAR Sentinel-1 observations have been pre-processed mainly using the Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform to estimate variation of surface water extent, while Jason-3 radar altimetry data has been processed using the AlTiS software to estimate variation of surface water level of the reservoir. Results show a very good agreement between variations of the reservoir's surface water volume derived from satellite data and that derived from in situ measurement, with a correlation of 95.4%.

TI  - INTEGRATING INSAR COHERENCE AND BACKSCATTERING FOR IDENTIFICATION OF TEMPORARY SURFACE WATER, CASE STUDY: SOUTH KALIMANTAN FLOODING, INDONESIA
T2  - XXIV ISPRS CONGRESS: IMAGING TODAY, FORESEEING TOMORROW, COMMISSION III
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 24th ISPRS Congress on Imaging Today, Foreseeing Tomorrow
CL  - Nice, FRANCE
AB  - Accurate and reliable information about the spatiotemporal level of surface water can be provided by Temporary Surface Water (TSW) monitoring. TSW is defined as a waterbody experiencing frequent drying phases which also correspond to surfaces frequently affected by flooding. In Indonesia, flooding is a frequent disaster, which is about 30% of the total number of disasters that occurred. In mid-January 2021, South Kalimantan Province, Indonesia was hit by a flood. The loss impact of this disaster is estimated at Rp. 1.349 trillion. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), one type of remote sensing, can be used to map the spatial distribution of flood inundation. SAR has the advantage of not being constrained by day or night, weather conditions, and cloud cover or fog. Nowadays, the availability of Sentinel-1 SAR images can increase the use of SAR imagery for flood mapping. Specular reflections that occur on the smooth water surface produce a darker color in the SAR backscattering data, which makes floodwater distinguishable on dry land surfaces. However, inundation between buildings can cause changes in the backscattering value. Several studies have shown that the Interferometric SAR coherence method is a good method for mapping floods in urban areas. The main goal of this study is thus to map Temporary Surface Water (flood) of the South Kalimantan flood event in Indonesia using Sentinel-1 SAR imagery. With backscattering data, flood in a non-urban area can be mapped, but it is difficult to map flood in an urban area. Therefore, we will try to integrate InSAR coherence and SAR backscattering data in order to map flood in the whole study area. The result shows that using backscattering data, bare soil or non-urban flood inundation in the whole study area can be mapped with an overall accuracy of about 76.4%. Yet, flood in an urban area cannot be mapped only with backscattering data. The result from coherence imagery can map flood inundation in an urban area. Thus, integration from both of them can map flood inundation in the whole study area, either urban or non-urban.

AB  - The weather-forecast based Radio Meteorological Operation Planner (RadioMetOP) model for the dynamical satellite link-budget design and its operational application to the BepiColombo ESA deep-space mission to Mercury is described. BepiColombo is the first European deep-space mission adopting Ka-band for the downlink of telemetry data. At such high frequency, conventional link budget techniques, based on past climatological statistics, are not usually suitable. RadioMetOP provides a channel prediction dynamical model, exploiting atmospheric statistics derived by numerical weather forecasts run on the specific transmission period and ground station, coupled with a radiopropagation model for estimating both path atmospheric attenuation and sky noise temperature. The use of RadioMetOP should improve the scientific data throughput when compared to conventional link budget design techniques. RadioMetOP model will be operationally ingested within the BepiColombo mission operation activities and tested thanks to the collaboration with ESA-ESOC. RadioMetOP model approach can be generalized to become a multi-mission, multi-site, and multi-frequency suitable for future satellite mission at Ka band and above.

TI  - The Outline of Constitutional Regulations on the Freedom of Conscience and Religion in Poland
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Freedom of conscience and religion is one of the fundamental freedoms of person. This freedom is a constitutionally registered freedom and its exercise, like its constitutional guarantees, is the foundation of the modern concept of a democratic state's rule of law. At the same time, the concept of a democratic rule of law is a source of limitations for this freedom, implemented in the spirit of European standards. The regulation of the freedom of conscience and religion under the Constitution of the Republic of Poland is a relatively extensive regulation, showing its own specificity, rooted in the experiences of the past, undemocratic political reality. Freedom of conscience and religion cannot be considered solely in the sphere of the psyche and in the sphere of privacy. On the contrary, it has an important public-law dimension. The issue taken up is closely related to the freedom of worldview, which determines both the behavior of the individual towards himself and the behavior of the individual towards other people and towards the community. The author presents and analyzes the regulation in question against the background of the principles determining the position of churches and religious associations in the state and their relations with the state.

TI  - Brotherhood in the Face of One God. M.K. Gandhi on Ways to Overcome Interreligious Disagreements
T2  - VOPROSY FILOSOFII
M3  - Article
AB  - The monotheistic idea is represented in the article as religious-philosophical base of nonviolent worldview. Belief in One God can help us to avoid and resolve any (not only religious) conflicts, but only providing that: 1) we considerate all religions as equal paths leading to one spiritual goal; 2) we regard God as some power which connects the whole world, but not as someone beyond the universe who only rules it. Essentially that means two things: understanding that any claim of some religious community to possession of ultimate truth is failure and affirming at the same time the value of general spiritual kinship. These two notions make for us clear that intolerance and enmity are senseless. Noted above complex of ideas was analyzed on the example of M.K. Gandhi's religious-philosophical thought which was foundation of his peacekeeping activity. The Indian thinker expresses his ideal of unity in diversity with the "tree of religions" metaphor. He depicts different faiths as branches of one spiritual root. He shows that all religions express divine truth in their original deepness in equal measure and at the same time all they are imperfect on the exoteric, i.e. cultural level. This way he proves absurdity of fanatic assurance in superiority of one faith over the others. He sees the method of overcoming religious conflicts in people's understanding of their kinship with God which helps them to realize their kinship with each of His creation. These ideas were foundation of Gandhi's numerous callings to stop Hindu-Muslim conflict which darkened the last period of his life. The illustration is his short article "God is One" (25.09.1924). The Russian translation of this text is presented to the readers.

TI  - On the Potential of Sequential and Nonsequential Regression Models for Sentinel-1-Based Biomass Prediction in Tanzanian Miombo Forests
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study derives regression models for aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation in miombo woodlands of Tanzania that utilize the high availability and low cost of Sentinel-1 data. The limited forest canopy penetration of C-band SAR sensors along with the sparseness of available ground truth restricts their usefulness in traditional AGB regression models. Therefore, we propose to use AGB predictions based on airborne laser scanning (ALS) data as a surrogate response variable for SAR data. This dramatically increases the available training data and opens for flexible regression models that capture fine-scale AGB dynamics. This becomes a sequential modeling approach, where the first regression stage has linked in situ data to ALS data and produced the AGB prediction map; we perform the subsequent stage, where this map is related to Sentinel-1 data. We develop a traditional, parametric regression model and alternative nonparametric models for this stage. The latter uses a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) to translate Sentinel-1 images into ALS-based AGB prediction maps. The convolution filters in the neural networks make them contextual. We compare the sequential models to traditional, nonsequential regression models, all trained on limited AGB ground reference data. Results show that our newly proposed nonsequential Sentinel-1-based regression model performs better quantitatively than the sequential models, but achieves less sensitivity to fine-scale AGB dynamics. The contextual cGAN-based sequential models best reproduce the distribution of ALS-based AGB predictions. They also reach a lower RMSE against in situ AGB data than the parametric sequential model, indicating a potential for further development.

M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Toxic amyloid-beta (A beta) peptides aggregate into higher molecular weight assemblies and accumulate not only in the extracellular space, but also in the walls of blood vessels in the brain, increasing their permeability, and promoting immune cell migration and activation. Given the prominent role of the immune system, phagocytic blood cells may contact pathological brain materials.Objective: To develop a novel method for early Alzheimer's disease (AD) detection, we used blood leukocytes, that could act as "sentinels" after trafficking through the brain microvasculature, to detect pathological amyloid by labelling with a conformationally-sensitive fluorescent amyloid probe and imaging with confocal spectral microscopy.Methods: Formalin-fixed peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from cognitively healthy control (HC) subjects, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD patients were stained with the fluorescent amyloid probe K114, and imaged. Results were validated against cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and clinical diagnosis.Results: K114-labeled leukocytes exhibited distinctive fluorescent spectral signatures in MCI/AD subjects. Comparing subjects with single CSF biomarker-positive AD/MCI to negative controls, our technique yielded modest AUCs, which improved to the 0.90 range when only MCI subjects were included in order to measure performance in an early disease state. Combining CSF A beta(42) and t-Tau metrics further improved the AUC to 0.93.Conclusion: Our method holds promise for sensitive detection of AD-related protein misfolding in circulating leukocytes, particularly in the early stages of disease.

TI  - Pirra Jungku: Comparison of traditional and contemporary fire practices on Karajarri Country, Western Australia
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT & RESTORATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional fire practices in Australia's deserts may have created mosaics of post-fire seral stages that benefitted some plants and animals. Managing fire to emulate the patterns produced by traditional burning practices is a common objective in contemporary conservation planning in Australia's deserts. However, the extent to which traditional burning in deserts affected fire regimes across space and time is contested. We aim to contribute to knowledge about the impacts of traditional burning on fire patterns in the Great Sandy Desert, northwest Australia. Our study covered the traditional lands of the Karajarri people, where some families were living a traditional lifestyle on Country until the 1960s. We analysed high-quality aerial photographs taken over 18,000 km(2) of Karajarri Country in the 1940s. Fire footprints up to several years old were mapped from these images, and their spatial characteristics were compared to those of contemporary fire regimes over the same area, visualised using high-resolution Sentinel satellite imagery. Fires in the 1940s (considered traditional) were more numerous but much smaller than contemporary (2016-2020) fires. The areal extent of recently burnt areas was smaller and the fire frequency was lower in the 1940s. Contemporary fire patterns around cultural sites differed little from fire patterns elsewhere in the landscape, possibly because people were burning over large areas rather than only at localised sites. Our study suggests that Karajarri influenced fire patterns at a landscape scale in the Great Sandy Desert, at least during periods of average rainfall. The findings are helping Karajarri refine fire management goals, for example, by informing the size and dispersion of future burns, and supporting community discussion about fire and culture. Fire management outcomes for plants and animals are being tracked with a biodiversity monitoring program.

TI  - Code and data for: Decoupling channel count from field-of-view and spatial resolution in single-sensor imaging systems for fluorescence image-guided surgery
T2  - Zenodo
M3  - Software
AB  - Significance Near-infrared fluorescence image-guided surgery is often thought of as a spectral imaging problem where the channel count is the critical parameter, but it should also be thought of as a multiscale imaging problem where the field-of-view and spatial resolution are similarly important. Aim Conventional imaging systems based on division-of-focal-plane architectures suffer from a strict relationship between the channel count on one hand and the field-of-view and spatial resolution on the other, but bioinspired imaging systems that combine stacked photodiode image sensors and long-pass/short-pass filter arrays offer a weaker tradeoff. Approach In this paper, we explore how the relevant changes to the image sensor and associated image processing routines affect image fidelity during image-guided surgeries for tumor removal in an animal model of breast cancer and nodal mapping in women with breast cancer.

TI  - Code and data for: Decoupling channel count from field-of-view and spatial resolution in single-sensor imaging systems for fluorescence image-guided surgery
T2  - Zenodo
M3  - Software
AB  - Significance Near-infrared fluorescence image-guided surgery is often thought of as a spectral imaging problem where the channel count is the critical parameter, but it should also be thought of as a multiscale imaging problem where the field-of-view and spatial resolution are similarly important. Aim Conventional imaging systems based on division-of-focal-plane architectures suffer from a strict relationship between the channel count on one hand and the field-of-view and spatial resolution on the other, but bioinspired imaging systems that combine stacked photodiode image sensors and long-pass/short-pass filter arrays offer a weaker tradeoff. Approach In this paper, we explore how the relevant changes to the image sensor and associated image processing routines affect image fidelity during image-guided surgeries for tumor removal in an animal model of breast cancer and nodal mapping in women with breast cancer. Results We demonstrate that a transition from a conventional imaging system to a bioinspired one, along with optimization of the image processing routines, yields improvements in multiple measures of spectral and textural rendition relevant to surgical decision-making.

TI  - USE OF THE QUAGGA DREISSENA BUGENSIS MUSSEL AS A MEANS OF ASSESSING THE CONTAMINATION OF LAKE NEUCHATEL WATERS BY NEONICOTINOIDS.
T2  - Bulletin de la Societe Neuchateloise des Sciences Naturelles
M3  - Article
AB  - Neonicotinoids are ubiquitous in the environment but some compartments of the ecosystem, such as waterways, are less well documented. The aim of this research is to establish an inventory of the contamination of the water of the lake of Neuchatel by neonicotinoids by using the quagga mussel Dreissena bugensis as bioindicator species. We searched for all molecules of the neonicotinoid class authorized in Switzerland (acetamiprid) as well as those that have been banned (imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, clothianidin and more recently thiacloprid). Of 40 mussel samples, 23 were contaminated with at least one neonicotinoid and several samples were contaminated with a cocktail of neonicotinoids. This research validates the use of quagga mussels as a bioindicator or sentinel species to estimate neonicotinoid contamination of waters. Despite the small quantity of samples, the analysis of the flesh of 40 individuals of D. bugensis demonstrated that the lake of Neuchatel is contaminated by neonicotinoids.

TI  - Learning Relevant Features of Optical Water Types
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This work introduces a novel method that makes use of machine learning (ML) techniques to classify hyper- and multi spectral observations into optical water types (OWTs). Classification was done using k-means clustering, which was followed by a feature relevance step based on the sensitivity analysis (SA) of the predictive mean and variance function of a Gaussian process (GP) regression model. The method was used both in training and predictive mode. The latter allows applying the approach for new unlabeled observations, so that the OWTs and the associated relevant features can automatically be assessed. The methods were studied on hyperspectral synthesized and in situ Arctic data, and were further evaluated on a test image acquired over Arctic seas. Good empirical results encourage wide adoption of the methodology to be applied in operational processing and assessment of water types.

TI  - [Translated article] Update on the Diagnosis and Management of Desmoplastic Melanoma.
T2  - Actas dermo-sifiliograficas
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - Desmoplastic melanoma (DM) accounts for 0.4% to 4% of all melanomas. These skin tumors are mainly formed by amelanotic spindled melanocytes immersed in an abundant collagen stroma and are classified as pure when the desmoplastic component accounts for at least 90% of the invasive tumor and as mixed or combined otherwise. DMs are more common in men (male to female ratio, 1.7 to 2:1), and the mean age at diagnosis is 66 to 69 years. The tumors tend to occur in chronically sun-exposed areas, often in association with lentigo maligna, and are difficult to recognize because they can resemble a scar, presenting as a firm, unpigmented papule or plaque with poorly defined borders. DMs also have a strong tendency to recur locally, and pure variants rarely spread to the lymph nodes. Nonetheless, recently published series suggest that patients with DM have a similar prognosis to those with nondesmoplastic melanoma of the same thickness. The clinical management of DM varies in certain aspects from that of other melanomas and is reviewed in this article.

TI  - UNIQUENESS OF LANGUAGES- THE BOUNDARY AND BOUNDLESSNESS OF A LANGUAGE
T2  - DACOROMANIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Within linguistic diversity, each language is unique, representing a creation of the linguistic community, manifested and crystallized over time, during the process of historical becoming. Such language uniqueness is not revealed only at phonetic, morphological and syntactical level, but also at semantic level, at the level of internal configuration of the meanings. World structuring through language meanings is proven to be specific to each language, conferring, thus, uniqueness to each language, even at this deep semantic level. Therefore, linguistic creativity, manifested historically, essentially determines such language individuality, recognizable, first of all, at semantic level, because language is, above all, a creative interpretation of the world and, thereby, it provides the speakers a specific "worldview". However, the flip side of such uniqueness could lead to the issue of the language as a "circle", as a boundary, as a limitation of the possibilities of referring to the world, invoking sometimes the inherent idiomatic constraints. Our paperwork sets out to show briefly and to analyze a few of the aspects that could outline language boundaries, but also the perspectives that open such inevitable boundary towards boundlessness.

TI  - Assessment of Recent Flow, and Calving Rate of the Perito Moreno Glacier Using LANDSAT and SENTINEL2 Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We mapped flow velocity and calving rates of the iconic Perito Moreno Glacier (PMG), belonging to the Southern Patagonian Icefield (SPI) in the Argentinian Patagonia. We tracked PMG from 2001 to 2017, focusing mostly upon the latest images from 2016-2017. PMG delivers about ca. 10(6) m(3) day(-1) of ice in the Lago Argentino, and its front periodically reaches the Peninsula Magallanes. Therein, the PMG causes an ice-dam, clogging Brazo Rico channel, and lifting water level by about 10 m, until ice-dam failure, normally occurring in March. Here, we used 36 pairs of satellite images with a resolution of 10 m (SENTINEL2, visible, 9 pairs of images) and 15 m (LANDSAT imagery, panchromatic, 27 pairs of images) to calculate surface velocity (V-S). We used Orientation Correlation technique, implemented via the ImGRAFT(R) TemplateMatch tool. Calving rates were then calculated with two methods, namely, (i) M1, by ice flow through the glacier front, and (ii) M2, by ice flow at 7.5 km upstream of the front minus ablation losses. Surface velocity ranged from about 4 m day(-1) in the accumulation area to about 2 m day(-1) in the calving front, but it is variable seasonally with maxima in the summer (December-January-February). Calving rate (CRM) ranges from 7.72 x 10(5) +/- 32% to 8.76 x 10(5) +/- 31% m(3) day(-1), in line with recent studies, also with maxima in the summer. We found slightly lower flow velocity and calving rates than previously published values, but our estimates cover a different period, and a generally large uncertainty in flow assessment suggests a recent overall stability of the glacier.

AB  - The domain of high-resolution and very high-resolution optical sensors and Synthetic Aperture Radars (SAR) has dramatically increased. Dependable satellites providing accurate and reliable measurements are key to essential urgent activities such as climate change monitoring. As Earth Observation (EO) system architect in Europe, the European Space Agency (ESA) needs to assess the quality and the suitability of the EO data provided by its own satellites and to promote awareness about the importance of assessing EO data quality provided by other missions, e.g. in the commercial and New Space sector. Also, this would allow establishing a dialog with the EO data mission providers in order to improve the overall coherence of the EO system and data interoperability. Furthermore, some of these missions are potential candidates to become ESA Third Party Missions (TPM), pending ESA selection. Calibration/Validation (Cal/Val) activities are fundamental to assess the quality of EO satellite data, requiring dedicated measurements taken from established reference Cal/Val sites and networks. However, Cal/Val sites are often customized to the operator's needs, with little to no flexibility. Therefore, ESA is currently willing to explore the new idea of an open and pioneering reference site, named as Cal/Val Park. The concept is currently under investigation and is meant to be a multi-Agency cooperation.

AB  - The need to protect, monitor and evaluate the impact of natural phenomena on the environment, in recent years, plays a role of considerable importance for society and our planet. In the last decades, Italian Space Agency (ASI) invested significant effort in Earth Observation ( EO) using COSMO-SkyMed radar satellites (Constellation of Small satellites for Mediterranean basin Observation). Since the beginning of the operational life of this mission, ASI promoted the issue of specific initiatives, based on the exploitation of COSMO-SkyMed data. Innovation and research have allowed a profound change in the data acquisition and acquisition methodologies coming to develop increasingly complex and innovative technologies. The focus of this work is to provide an overview of the innovative products and services proposed and marketed by NeMeA Sistemi srl.NeMeA Sistemi developed new and innovative technologies using integrated data for the monitoring and protection of environmental and anthropogenic health, in coastal and nearby areas. The 3xA project is aimed at spotting environmental changes through time in selected geographical regions. Taking as input two SAR acquisitions at time t(1) and t(2), the acquisitions are firstly pre-processed, homogenised and finally undergo a completely self-supervised algorithm which takes advantage of DNNs to classify changed/unchanged areas. Results are later validated against real environmental changes by means of the SardOS's output data. This method shows promising results in automatically producing a change map from two input SAR images.

TI  - AMERICAN IDEALISM
T2  - ROUTLEDGE HANDBOOK OF IDEALISM AND IMMATERIALISM
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Philosophical idealism comes in many forms. While, very broadly, it is often characterized as the view that mind or spirit constitutes (fundamental) reality, many adjectives have been applied to nuances about this view: absolute idealism, naturalistic idealism, subjective idealism, transcendental idealism, and others. In the discussion that follows, the notion of idealism will be centered on conceptions of metaphysical, epistemological, and axiological idealism. Metaphysical idealism focuses on what is real, epistemological idealism on what is knowable (and how), and axiological idealism on issues of value and values (including moral, aesthetic, and spiritual). By speaking of these three conceptions, it is not meant to suggest that they are mutually exclusive categories or realities. What is real, what is knowable, and what is valuable overlap and interrelate. One can focus on, say, epistemological concerns about idealism while not attending to axiological or metaphysical matters, even though they are not irrelevant to a full discussion and understanding of idealism. Idealism, broadly speaking, has had a long-standing presence in American philosophical thought, from the earliest philosophical traditions up to the twenty-first century. However, as will be seen in this chapter, different American philosophers dealt with different conceptions of idealism - or perhaps this could be phrased as different aspects of an idealist worldview - given their particular philosophical concerns and emphases. As one example, some held an idealist view within a theistic context, others within a secular one. Additionally, some offered arguments and positions that were not directly advocating idealism but were rejecting materialism or proposing views that were consistent with - while not arguing for - idealist tenets.

TI  - Characteristics and patterns of care of endometrial cancer before and during COVID-19 pandemic
T2  - JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has correlated with the disruption of screening activities and diagnostic assessments. Endometrial cancer (EC) is one of the most common gynecological malignancies and it is often detected at an early stage, because it frequently produces symptoms. Here, we aim to investigate the impact of COVID-19 outbreak on patterns of presentation and treatment of EC patients. Methods: This is a retrospective study involving 54 centers in Italy. We evaluated patterns of presentation and treatment of EC patients before (period 1: March 1, 2019 to February 29, 2020) and during (period 2: April 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021) the COVID-19 outbreak. Results: Medical records of 5,164 EC patients have been retrieved: 2,718 and 2,446 women treated in period 1 and period 2, respectively. Surgery was the mainstay of treatment in both periods (p=0.356). Nodal assessment was omitted in 689 (27.3%) and 484 (21.2%) patients treated in period 1 and 2, respectively (p<0.001). While, the prevalence of patients undergoing sentinel node mapping (with or without backup lymphadenectomy) has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic (46.7% in period 1 vs. 52.8% in period 2; p<0.001). Overall, 1,280 (50.4%) and 1,021 (44.7%) patients had no adjuvant therapy in period 1 and 2, respectively (p<0.001). Adjuvant therapy use has increased during COVID-19 pandemic (p<0.001). Conclusion: Our data suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the characteristics and patterns of care of EC patients. These findings highlight the need to implement healthcare services during the pandemic.

TI  - FORMATION OF THE RESEARCH THESAURUS IN STUDY OF THE PHENOMENON OF DACHA IN RUSSIAN LITERATURE OF THE 19TH-21ST CENTURIES
T2  - STUDIA LITTERARUM
M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with the problems of studying the dacha as a special kind of artistic space in Russian literature of the 19th-21st centuries. The author of the article analyses dacha against the background of a much better studied "literary estate," discusses and clarifies the concepts of "dacha culture," "dacha text," "dacha topos," introduces into scientific circulation, shows relationship and dynamics of the terms "literary dacha," "poetosphere of dacha," "dacha myth." The article lists main constitutive differences between the toposes of estate and dacha formed in the 19th and early 20th centuries. In Soviet time, due to the disappearance of the owner's estate, a number of its functions (unity of nature and culture, storage of family and ancestral memory, etc.) passed to the dacha. Already since the 1920s, the "poetosphere of dacha" has been formed, largely due to the atmosphere of writers' country villages (Tarusa, Peredelkino, Komarovo, etc.), which have become specific toposes of artistic creativity. In the 1960-1980s - the period of mass dacha construction in the USSR - the "dacha culture" is enriched either by the romance of individual enterprise, or by the excitement of esoteric search. The literature of the turn of the 20th-21st centuries formed "dacha myth," which has absorbed the antinomic connotations of the decentered worldview of modernity. For the purpose of scientific development of the phenomenon of literary dacha, the article sets the task of forming a research thesaurus as relevant to the subject of the study of the categories' system.

TI  - Nostalgic Overtones in "The Autumn Cry of the Hawk" by I. Brodsky
T2  - NAUCHNYI DIALOG
M3  - Article
AB  - The article offers a new perspective of the interpretation of the poem by I. Brodsky "The Autumn cry of a hawk" (1975). If the text is traditionally considered as the realization of the theme "the poet and the crowd", then the nostalgic motifs of "the autumn cry" are highlighted in the work. It is shown that the first years of emigration formed certain milestones in Brodsky's mind that required "intermediate" results, and the year 1975, the third year of emigration, actualized the motives of the "native nest" in the poet's mind. However, unlike the usual angles of homesickness, the worldview of the herobird Brodsky outgrows the limits of nostalgic feeling, but acquires the features of an ontological myth about the laws of the existence of the Universe. The motives of the individual's fate, freedom / lack of freedom of the individual obscure the motives of homesickness in Brodsky's text, but the latter do not disappear without a trace, but are marked with a number of "American" and "Russian" details, images, word forms. The multiplicity of geographical toponyms (Connecticut, New England, Rio Grande), the redundancy of signs of "alien" reality (13 American states, "English" speech) allow us to explicate the invisible contrast "your own and others' ", reinforced by the antitheses "up / down", "heat / ice", "North / South". The distinct plot of the poem (the flight of a hawk to his native places) turns out to be an important semantic entourage that enhances the depth of poetic perception.

TI  - Estimation of the impact of biomass burning based on regional transport of PM<sub>2.5</sub> in the Colombian Caribbean
T2  - GEOSCIENCE FRONTIERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Deterioration of air quality due to the increase in atmospheric emissions from biomass burning (BB) is one of the major environmental problems worldwide. In this study, we estimated the contributions of BB to PM2.5 concentrations in the municipalities of Soledad and Malambo located in the Colombian Caribbean. The evaluation period ranged from February 24 to March 30, 2018, a period with a high number of BB events recorded in the surroundings of the evaluated sites. The contribution of BB to the two sampling sites was estimated using the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) dispersion model with forwarding trajectories from each of the burning points identified by satellite images (n = 1089). The PM2.5 emissions were determined using the fire radiative power (FRP), obtained by remote-sensing data, and corresponded to the radiant energy released per time unit by burning vegetation. The average PM2.5 concentrations during the evaluation period were 19.91 mu g/m(3) for Soledad and 22.44 mu g/m(3) for Malambo. The average contribution of BB to these municipalities was 22.8% and 28.8%, respectively. The methodology used in this study allowed to estimate the contribution of this important source without knowledge of a previous tracer of BB, thereby increasing the use of the proposed procedure worldwide. This information would enable the implementation of effective mitigation, thereby diminishing the adverse impact of PM2.5 on the health of the population.

M3  - Article
AB  - Land-use change analysis and future models were used to examine environmental degradation and control unplanned development. This study aimed to reveal the temporal changes in Golcuk district, identify improper land uses by analyzing the changes, develop future modeling, and predict future trends using the Modules for Land-Use Change Evaluation plug-in.Accordingly, land uses produced by the unsupervised classification method using Landsat satellite images were used for change analysis from 1984 to the present. The modeling for 2035 was obtained from this perspective. The results of land-use changes are illustrated using change maps, loss/gain graphs, and statistical data.Rapid urban growth in the Golcuk district has also affected other important land-use types such as agriculture. Based on modeling results, the settlement was expected to cover 9.77% (2025.90 ha) of the total area in 2020 and is expected to cover 13.53% (2808 ha) of the total area in 2035. It has been discovered this growth has opened up agricultural areas to settlement, and it has been modeled that cultivated areas will be lost in the future. These areas are remarkable because of their high earthquake risk.

AB  - During the Gwangju Uprising in May 1980, Yoon Sang-won, a spokesman for the civil army, had a pro-American worldview. Also, Gwangju citizens at that time advocated anti-communism. Therefore, the pro-Americanism and anti-communism sentiment served as the ideological background of Yoon Sang-won's request for U.S. Government’s intervention to mediate between the civil army and Chun Doo-whan group. In addition, rumors circulated that the U.S. military would come to help on the morning of May 26, which was the contextual background of the day of the request for Yoon’s trial of arbitration. Against this backdrop, Yoon Sang-won decided that if the U.S. intervenes (intercession of ceasefire), he could save Gwangju citizens. And he requested arbitrat ion at a press conference that began at 4 p.m. on May 26. Therefore, the direct reason for Yoon Sang-won's request for arbitration was to save citizens, the direct background was the rumors, and the ideological background was pro-Americanism & anti-communism.

AB  - In this work, we present an advanced implementation of the full resolution Parallel Small BAseline Subset (P-SBAS) DInSAR processing chain, aimed to effectively and automatically generate DInSAR products (displacement time series and corresponding velocity maps) related to single buildings and infrastructures over the whole Italian territory. The proposed full resolution P-SBAS pipeline exploits innovative hardware and software parallel technologies based on GPUs, which are able to efficiently process large amounts of full resolution DInSAR data stacks in reasonable time frames and with high scalability. The presented results, achieved by processing very large archives of full resolution X-band first and second generation COSMO-SkyMed data and C-band Sentinel-1 images, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution in terms of computing time and computational efficiency.

TI  - ANALYSIS AND SEMANTIC INTERPRETATION OF THE SCANDINAVIAN ORNAMENT OF THE NEW EARLY MEDIEVAL WAR AXE OF THE VOLGA-KAMA TYPE FROM THE SOUTHERN PART OF REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA
T2  - SKANDINAVSKAYA FILOLOGIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study is devoted to the full-fledged introduction into scientific circulation of a unique early medieval iron war hatchet inlayed with silver originating from the southern steppe zone of the Dniester-Prut interfluve of present-day territory of Republic of Moldo-va. The ornamented battle axe of 10th-11th centuries was found near the village of Razeni. The type of form of war axe from Razeni is similar to type of war axes originated in the Middle Volga region, where there was a tradition of making similar ornamented war axes of this type. The main feature of the war ax from Razeni is the Scandinavian ornament in Ringerike style. The semantics analysis of the ornamented motif and its interpretation - is one of the main tasks of this research work of the description and introduction of the unique find into scientific circulation. The image is interpreted as the tree of life Yggdrasil sprouting from the deck of the boat, which is worshiped by an anthropomorphic figure interpreted as a Viking. The present scientific work has widely direct and indirect analo-gies of Scandinavian origin from the Bronze to the Viking Age. The methodology of this research includes a deep and extensive comparative analysis of the motif elements on the surface of the war hatchet. The work makes a deep structural and semantic analysis in the broad context of ancient Germanic sources and previous scientific research on the worldview of the Vikings, reflected in their mythopoetic and mythological concepts and traditions. The ceremonial-battle axe from Razeni was presumably made and ornamented in the Volga Bulgaria by order of a Viking-man, and then got in the borderland of An-cient Rus in the area of the Bugeac steppe of the Dniester-Prut interfluve of territory of present-day Republic of Moldova. The ceremonial-battle axe could have been brought in Bugeac steppe of the Dniester-Prut interfluve by means of circulation the international water arteries "from the Varangians to the Persians" along the Volga river, and "from the Varangians to the Greeks" along the Dniester river. The uniqueness of the ornamented war hatchet from Republic of Moldova is due to the fact that it is the first find of this type of axes in the Dniester-Prut interfluve of modern Republic of Moldova, and this axe no have direct analogies in eastern Europe. The early medieval ceremonial battle axe decorated with silver, contain the image of Old Norse cosmogonic representations in a stylized motif form on the surface of the hatchet. The unique item that captures the combination and interaction of different cultures at the junction of their intersection in the Medieval world.

AB  - Micronutrient deficiency (MND), which is a form of malnutrition that can have serious health consequences, is difficult to diagnose in early stages without blood draws, which are expensive and time-consuming to collect and process. It is even more difficult at a public health scale seeking to identify regions at higher risk of MND. To provide data more widely and frequently, we propose an accurate, scalable, lowcost, and interpretable regional-level MND prediction system. Specifically, our work is the first to use satellite data, such as forest cover, weather, and presence of water, to predict deficiency of micronutrients such as iron, Vitamin B12, and Vitamin A, directly from their biomarkers. We use real-world, ground truth biomarker data collected from four different regions across Madagascar for training, and demonstrate that satellite data are viable for predicting regional-level MND, surprisingly exceeding the performance of baseline predictions based only on survey responses. Our method could be broadly applied to other countries where satellite data are available, and potentially create high societal impact if these predictions are used by policy makers, public health officials, or healthcare providers.

AB  - The method of forest restoration monitoring after wildfires is proposed. It is based on the joint use of ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 polarimetric radar data to assess the temporal dynamics of physical scattering mechanisms and the analysis of long time series of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) calculated with help of Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform. This made it possible to quantitatively analyze the process of post fire reforestation in terms of changes in the projective coverage and geometric dimensions of forest undergrowth. Such a new approach will make it possible further to take into account more accurately the role of boreal forests as one of the largest carbon stocks.

M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, temperature characteristics and heat load in the city of Dubrovnik are investigated by using temperature data observed at the local meteorological station in Dubrovnik for the period 1961-2019, satellite data collected by LANDSAT5 satellite for the period 2001-2010, and climate indices data obtained from simulations of an urban climate model (MUKLIMO_3) for the period 2001-2010. Trends in daily mean, maximum, minimum, and seasonal temperatures were analysed by using Sen's slope and the Mann-Kendall test. Results reveal rising trends for all of the studied temperature-related elements. However, it is demonstrated that temperature increase is greatest for the summer season with the highest rise for daily maximum temperatures. The same approach was applied to examine trends of climate indices (summer days and tropical nights), which indicates an increase in the number of both summer days and tropical nights. Results of satellite data of average summer land surface temperatures for the period 2001-2010 indicate that urbanised surfaces and bare rock areas heat up more than natural surfaces with vegetation. Climate indices (summer and hot days, warm evenings, and tropical nights) simulated by the urban climate model MUKLIMO_3 also reveal that, on average, in the city of Dubrovnik urbanised surfaces heat up more than natural surfaces with vegetation and that nocturnal heat load is reduced in lower-density built-up areas.

M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Since the SARS-CoV-2 became of concern in January 2020, many preventive measures have been adopted in educational settings to ensure the control of COVID-19 pandemic among children and staff in schools. This study aims to set up a school sentinel surveillance network with the purpose of monitoring SARS-CoV-2 infection, seroprevalence as well as to analyse the impact of preventive interventions of SARS-CoV-2 in school settings. Additionally, we will assess diverse screening strategies in a cohort of students and school staff to monitor the screening acceptance and its potential impact. Altogether, we hope this study will enable the design of more effective strategies for the prevention of COVID-19 spread. Methods and analysis The sentinel schools' study is a cross-sectional, school-based project including 26 participating sentinel schools in Catalonia (Spain). Children, adolescents and staff at the schools will be invited to participate. This project will be carried out from January 2021 to June 2022 as follows: (1) twice yearly serological testing and molecular SARS-CoV-2 detection and questionnaires covering SARS-CoV-2 symptoms, tests, health, knowledge, attitudes and behaviours; (2) an environmental evaluation carried out in different classrooms; (3) SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics and the impact of different variants among confirmed cases and classmates; (4) a participatory process by which the participants are invited to act as coinvestigators to evaluate prevention strategies and provide recommendations to improve COVID-19 prevention in schools. Descriptive analysis will be performed for the main variables collected. The incidence and seroprevalence will be calculated and the association with sociodemographic factors and school characteristics will be determined using multivariate logistic regression. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval was obtained from the IDIAPJGol and the Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron ethics committees. A report will be generated quarterly. Findings will be disseminated at national and international conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals.

TI  - <i>ARTIFACT</i> THEORY: TOWARDS A CRITIQUE OF THE ICONICITY OF THE ANCIENT GREEKS
T2  - ROCZNIKI HUMANISTYCZNE
M3  - Article
AB  - The artifact theory is part of the author's project of iconicity criticism presented in his book Reliefy rozmazane. Rzeczy i obrazy w kulturze dawnej Grecji [Smeared Reliefs: Things and Images in Ancient Greek Culture] (2020). It aims to remodel foxed thinking about products of Greek culture from the archaic and classical periods in the perspective from the category of the image entangled in philosophical discourse, and thus having an unclear and historically variable status. The category of artifact, proposed in place of the image encompasses all artistic products and social activities, practices, and the games associated with them, as well as their worldview motivations. The artifact is thus a kind of socially embedded dynamic iconic entity. The notation in partial italics is meant to distinguish this concept from the archaeological artifact, the thing in its purely material physical dimension. The artifact category also emphasises the processual character of the perception of things in ancient cultures, e.g. the becoming instead of the being. According to the theory presented, a vessel, a statue, or a painting has not as much a visual dimension as a performative and agentive one; it is a form of interference in the world. The dynamics of looking at things was, moreover, dependent on the environment, which is revealed, for example, in the different way in which Homer's Telemachus looked at artifacts in the palace of Menelaus and in that of Nestor. This difference is presented by the author within the framework of two distinguished types of culture choros (chi omega rho omicron sigma) and diakrisis (delta iota alpha kappa rho iota sigma iota sigma).In the second part of the article, the status of iconicity in archaic culture is redefined using a critical approach. It is a cognitive strategy aimed at revealing and characterizing the games and social practices behind the forms of artistic disposition inherent in Greek culture. Iconicity in the critical perspective is not so much the result, or outcome of something serving aesthetic purposes, but rather one of the activities that make up what a given statue or painting is as a state of affairs (Sachverhalt).

AB  - Soil organic matter (SOM) is essential in terms of soil fertility and conservation, and it has an impact on soil physical and biological activity. It is necessary to track the status of SOM and its dynamics frequently. This task is expensive and time-consuming if only a chemical analysis is used. This study was carried out in Sidi Bennour, situated in Morocco's Doukkala irrigated area. Satellite data may offer an alternative and provide low-cost filling for this void. A special value was shown by predicting the SOM using statistical models and satellite images. This study aims to compare SOM predictions using four different models and RapidEye images. The selected models are multiple linear regression (MLR), k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), decision trees (DT), and artificial neural networks (ANN). The obtained results indicate that the ANN provides the best fitted model compared to other models with R-2 = 0.482 in training and R-2 = 0.472 in the test. The ANN model provided the lowest RMSE (0.251) and MAE (0.185). The MLR reveals nearly the same results except that it gives a larger difference between training and test than ANN, with R-2 = 0.455 in training and 0.481 in the test. MLR provided the same RMSE (0.251) as the ANN and an approximate MAE of 0.185.

AB  - Researchers in the oil and gas industry, academia and governments use different approaches for determining ways to measure and significantly reduce gas flaring and its emissions. However, the lack of a unique method poses a continuing problem in determining the impacts and roles of these in environmental degradation on both local and global levels. Satellite sensors are an attractive option for local and global monitoring of gas flares, particularly Night time Light (NtL) satellite data. Indeed, it is possible to extract, from NtL data, some physical parameters of flames produced by gas flares, and these parameters can later be used to estimate the annual volumes of gas flared and will make it possible to achieve greenhouse gas reduction goals. In this work, two approaches are used to estimate such parameters (temperature, emissivity and power radiated by flare gas) from, publicly available, NtL Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) data. The second approach, based on spectral unmixing applied on the considered NtL VIIRS data, is expected to improve, by providing a pure spectrum of flames, obtained results by the classical one, which uses Planck law curve modeling applied on the considered observed mixed data.

AB  - Forecasting vegetation indices represents a hot topic nowadays because of the climate change impacts challenges. Several time series forecasting models are proposed in the literature. However, researchers are continuously looking for an accurate and more performing one. This paper proposes a novel way to combine forecasting models results. Particularly interested in vegetation changes, our study relies on NDVI time series extracted from MODIS DATA. These temporal profiles describe a forest cover located in the northwestern of Tunisia, an African country. To this aim, normally fitted weights and evidence theory were selected to build an accurate combination model. Our findings highlight: on one hand, the importance of studying the statistical properties of the analyzed data. On the other hand, they shed the light on the ability of increasing the accuracy of forecasting models by combining them.

AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data and Interferometric SAR (InSAR) products in particular, are one of the largest sources of Earth Observation data. InSAR provides unique information on diverse geophysical processes and geology, and on the geotechnical properties of man-made structures. However, there are only a limited number of applications that exploit the abundance of InSAR data and deep learning methods to extract such knowledge. The main barrier has been the lack of a large curated and annotated InSAR dataset, which would be costly to create and would require an interdisciplinary team of experts experienced on InSAR data interpretation. In this work, we put the effort to create and make available the first of its kind, manually annotated dataset that consists of 19,919 individual Sentinel-1 interferograms acquired over 44 different volcanoes globally, which are split into 216,106 InSAR patches. The annotated dataset is designed to address different computer vision problems, including volcano state classification, semantic segmentation of ground deformation, detection and classification of atmospheric signals in InSAR imagery, interferogram captioning, text to InSAR generation, and InSAR image quality assessment.

T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground deformation measured from interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data is considered a sign of volcanic unrest, statistically linked to a volcanic eruption. Recent studies have shown the potential of using Sentinel-1 InSAR data and supervised deep learning (DL) methods for the detection of volcanic deformation signals, toward global volcanic hazard mitigation. However, detection accuracy is compromised from the lack of labeled data and class imbalance. To overcome this, synthetic data are typically used for fine-tuning DL models pretrained on the ImageNet dataset. This approach suffers from poor generalization on real InSAR data. This letter proposes the use of self-supervised contrastive learning to learn quality visual representations hidden in unlabeled InSAR data. Our approach, based on the SimCLR framework, provides a solution that does not require a specialized architecture nor a large labeled or synthetic dataset. We show that our self-supervised pipeline achieves higher accuracy with respect to the state-of-the-art methods and shows excellent generalization even for out-of-distribution test data. Finally, we showcase the effectiveness of our approach for detecting the unrest episodes preceding the recent Icelandic Fagradalsfjall volcanic eruption.

TI  - Improving Sentinel-3 SAR Mode Processing Over Lake Using Numerical Simulations
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Access to fresh water is a key issue for the next decades in the context of global warming. The water level of lakes is a fundamental variable that needs to be monitored for this purpose. The radar altimetry constellation brings a worldwide means to this question. Recent advances in radar altimeter onboard tracking modes have allowed monitoring thousands of lakes and rivers. Now, measurements are widely available with better resolution: it is time to drastically improve the processing. The altimetry waveforms over lakes are difficult to analyze and very different from the ocean ones. We face a large variety of signals due to surface roughness, lake geometry, and environment. The inversion process, named retracking, shall be able to describe all these components. We propose here a retracking based on physical simulations taking as inputs the lake contour and the instrument characteristics. Fitting the simulation on the waveforms gives the water surface height. The algorithm has been tested on the Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B time series over Occitan reservoirs (France) and Swiss lakes and compared to in situ references. Over small Occitan reservoirs (few ha to few km(2)), the unbiased root-mean-square error (ub-RMSE) is better than 14 cm. Over the medium-size Swiss lakes, the ub-RMSE is better than 10 cm for most of them.

AB  - Recent research has shown the sensitivity of Sentinel-1 Cband (5.4 GHz) radar data to snow depth. This finding could potentially help fill a long standing gap in remote sensing, but the physical basis behind this sensitivity is not yet sufficiently understood. A field experiment was set-up at two sites in the US Rocky Mountains in Idaho to study the polarimetric radar response, continuously throughout multiple winter seasons. This paper describes the design and properties of the tower-based, fully polarimetric, C-band radar system and presents the first findings. Hourly measurements were made during the winters of 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 at two different sites in Idaho. When studying the time domain responses, the scattering from the snow volume, the ground surface and multiple bounces can be discerned.

AB  - Every year, deforestation results in the loss of wide stretches of forest which is worsening the state of air quality, biodiversity, indigenous cultures, climate, meteorological conditions, etc. According to the Monitoring of the Andean Amazon Project (MAAP), roughly 20 million hectares of land were lost due to deforestation in 2020. To address the issue of deforestation, this study proposes a derivation of the deforestation risk model to target the spread of deforestation, which is the first step towards its prevention. The region of interest - North West of Mato Grosso, Brazil - was selected based on two characteristics: it is a deforestation hotspot according to MAAP and it comprises 4 indigenous lands. The sequence for developing the risk model comprises reference information collection, information cleaning, classification, postprocessing, and change detection. In a crowdsourcing mapathon, reference data were gathered, and they were refined in an iterative process using existing land cover maps and photo interpretation. Google Earth Engine and the Random Forest algorithm were used to classify Sentinel-2 imagery for 2019 and 2020. The results obtained are land cover maps from 2019 and 2020 and land cover change, and the risk model. The results are not demonstrating intensive deforestation in the region of interest, however, the deforestation appears to be systematic in two subregions, indicating that it has the potential to spread. An additional concern in the case of these subregions is their proximity to the indigenous land.

AB  - Electric Vehicles (EV's) are presented as a viable solution to meet environmental targets and sustainable development goals. A successful transition towards an EV-dominated market relies on effective charging infrastructures. Given that the majority of customers charge their EVs at home, it is critical that effective surveying methods are developed to identify individual properties suitable for home EV charging to support future urban development projects. In this study, we critically review the current state-of-the-art approaches to identifying houses suitable for EV charging. We expand on prior research by presenting two novel methods utilizing geospatial analysis, multispectral image analysis, and machine learning techniques and demonstrate that these methods outperform the current state-of-the-art. This work represents a major step towards understanding the current EV charging infrastructures in the UK, and provides a means to support the future sustainable development of green mobility solutions.

AB  - "Love and mercy are concepts that in great philosophical, worldview, and religious systems have been functioning in the world for two thousand years. In some sense, tenderness is tiny in comparison" -with these words Piotr Glinski the former Polish Minister of Culture and National Heritage reacted to Olga Tokarczuk's Nobel Speech. Glinski's charge against Tokarczuk stems from a misunderstanding of her intentions. It was precisely the lack of rooting in the history of philosophy, the impossibility of embedding tenderness in a specific religious system, and freedom from ascribed meanings and associations that made Tokarczuk choose tenderness. Understanding tenderness as empathy and recognizing fellow sufferers in oneself reflects how Tokarczuk makes literary use of Eastern philosophy.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This research examines the dialectical relationships between the precautionary principle, the logic of prevention and prudential dynamics, based on accounts of the experiences of academics in nearly fifteen countries around the world.AIM OF THE STUDY: The study examines the contradictory relationships generated by the perceptions of risk and urgency between the injunctions to act in accordance with the rules prescribed by the health authorities and the dynamics of self-training allowing the singular and prudent integration of rules for the maintenance of individual and collective life in a pandemic situation.RESULTS: Two levels of results are characterized: concerning the method, the survey system potentially constitutes a monitoring system enabling the production of "flash surveys" giving access to the state of the epidemic situation from local relays in different countries around the world. With regard to the relationship to knowledge, the results also tend to underline the importance of in-depth educational work to develop a "culture of prudential action" in a pandemic situation.CONCLUSION: The narrative survey implemented in the form of a "flash survey" could be duplicated in 2021 and be perpetuated in the form of a "sentinel watch" system, by questioning the concepts and actions at work in the various countries, particularly with a view to developing educational strategies to raise awareness of ecological risks and to develop knowledge of action bringing together the scales of the socialized individual and the world, through the articulation of prevention, education and ethical aims in public health.

T2  - EVIDENCE BASED LIBRARY AND INFORMATION PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective - To determine if reference staffing models are a predictor of reference question rates and if academic library patrons' reference behaviors are linked to reference staffing models and desk visibility.Design - A retrospective case study.Setting - Two academic libraries at a large R3 public university in the state of Georgia, United States of America.Subjects - 10,295 service transactions (chat and in-person, including non-reference transactions related to directional and technology questions) from the 2016 fiscal year and 6,568 service transactions (chat and in-person, including only chat non-reference transactions) from FY 2017.Methods - Analysis of two years of service transaction data (July 2015 to June 2017) recorded by librarians using the reference analytics module of Springshare's LibAnswers at three locations (virtual 24/7 chat and two libraries with different physical locations, such as centrally-located or harder-to-find service points) for three kinds of reference service modes: chat, fully-staffed in-person services, and occasional "on-call" services. "Reference" transactions were classified using the Reference & User Services Association (RUSA) definition. Email, SMS/text, and Facebook inquiries were excluded from this study. One library, which had the same service model for the 2016-2017 fiscal years, served as the studys "control" so that an analysis of service model alterations could be conducted.Main Results - The rate of chat reference remained steady, independent from the desk model employed. There was also an overall decline in reference questions from FY 2016 to FY 2017. For FY 2016, the average daily chat transaction rate was 16.1 inquiries (range: 0 inquiries for some days and up to 51 for others) compared to an average 20.5 inquiries at the two physical service locations (range: 0 to 95 inquiries per day). In FY 2017, the average daily chat transaction rate was 13.9 inquiries (range: 0 to 46 inquiries per day) compared to 6.8 transactions for the physical locations (range: 0 to 19 inquiries per day). For FY 2016, when the model shifted to on-call, the average daily chat transaction rate was 14 inquiries compared to the physical locations with 0 and .67 inquires per day. In FY 2017, the averages were 19.33 for chat compared to .33 and .33 for the physical locations.Conclusion - For the two fiscal years studied here, question rates and reference behaviors seemed to be linked to staffing models. Patrons in this study preferred a staffed and visible desk and 24/7 chat, while "on-call" services were not favored. By replacing the visible desk with an on-call model, the library created a situation where chat was the only consistent reference service offering. As a result, patrons may have viewed the visible desk as being unreliable. The on-call service model appears to have negatively affected patron behavior since, according to the data presented, patrons' reference needs were best met by chat and a visibly staffed desk service model.

TI  - Image Classification With Small Datasets: Overview and Benchmark
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Image classification with small datasets has been an active research area in the recent past. However, as research in this scope is still in its infancy, two key ingredients are missing for ensuring reliable and truthful progress: a systematic and extensive overview of the state of the art, and a common benchmark to allow for objective comparisons between published methods. This article addresses both issues. First, we systematically organize and connect past studies to consolidate a community that is currently fragmented and scattered. Second, we propose a common benchmark that allows for an objective comparison of approaches. It consists of five datasets spanning various domains (e.g., natural images, medical imagery, satellite data) and data types (RGB, grayscale, multispectral). We use this benchmark to re-evaluate the standard cross-entropy baseline and ten existing methods published between 2017 and 2021 at renowned venues. Surprisingly, we find that thorough hyper-parameter tuning on held-out validation data results in a highly competitive baseline and highlights a stunted growth of performance over the years. Indeed, only a single specialized method dating back to 2019 clearly wins our benchmark and outperforms the baseline classifier.

AB  - Remote sensing data are usually collected by SAR instruments on-board airplanes or satellites and many applications have been developed in a wide range of scientific subjects. Developments in technologies permit radar sensors to be miniaturized, which now allow them to be embedded on-board smaller platforms such as UAVs. ONERA is currently developing a new line of SAR instruments on-board UAV, called SAR-Light. In its first version, it is a mono-polarized (VV) SAR operating in X-band at high spatial resolution (0.25 m). This paper presents the SAR-Light instrument and describes the performance obtained during a flight tests campaign carried out in April 2021 in the South of France.

AB  - Regional maps of rice fields provided early in each growing season facilitate production estimates, planning around harvest logistics, marketing and targeted agronomic recommendations. This work develops maps of all irrigated rice fields in New South Wales, Australia. Classification models were trained on reference maps from the 2019 and 2020 harvest seasons. Model predictions were tested against a reference rice map from the 2021 harvest season, covering 60,000 km(2). The random forest algorithm was used, with features from aggregated time-series of Sentinel-2 imagery. A sequence of maps were generated at intervals of 15 days, from early to late in the growing season, with accuracy assessed at each time. The maps achieved 95% overall accuracy against point samples at 16 January 2021 (similar to 80 days after sowing). Pixel-based F1-scores against the reference map were above 80% for the 1, 16 and 31 January classified maps.

TI  - Remote sensing to characterize inundation and vegetation dynamics of upland lagoons
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding broad trends in the distribution and composition of wetlands is essential for making evidence-based management decisions. Determining temporal change in the extent of inundation in wetlands using remote sensing remains challenging and requires on-ground verification to determine accuracy and precision. Therefore, optimization and validation of remote sensing methods in threatened wetlands is a high priority for their conservation. Despite their ecological importance in the landscape, we have little knowledge of the variation in the spatial extent of inundation in upland lagoons, a threatened ecological community in New South Wales, Australia. Our project developed locally trained algorithms to predict the extent of water and emergent vegetation using imagery from the Landsat-5, -7, and -8 satellites. The best model for upland lagoons used shortwave infrared reflectance (performing better than normalized difference spectral indices), with model accuracy against validation transects greater than 95%. We applied the model to images from 1988 to 2020 across 58 lagoons to generate a dataset that demonstrates the variable water regime and vegetation change in response to local rainfall over 32 years such as in the lagoons. Our results reduce threats to a dynamic threatened ecological community by filling an important knowledge gap and demonstrate a valuable method to understand historical and current changes in the hydrology of dynamic wetland systems more broadly.

TI  - Fuel-Specific Aggregation of Active Fire Detections for Rapid Mapping of Forest Fire Perimeters in Mexico
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Context and Background. Active fires have the potential to provide early estimates of fire perimeters, but there is a lack of information about the best active fire aggregation distances and how they can vary between fuel types, particularly in large areas of study under diverse climatic conditions. Objectives. The current study aimed at analyzing the effect of aggregation distances for mapping fire perimeters from active fires for contrasting fuel types and regions in Mexico. Materials and Methods. Detections of MODIS and VIIRS active fires from the period 2012-2018 were used to obtain perimeters of aggregated active fires (AGAF) at four aggregation distances (750, 1000, 1125, and 1500 m). AGAF perimeters were compared against MODIS MCD64A1 burned area for a total of 24 fuel types and regions covering all the forest area of Mexico. Results/findings. Optimum aggregation distances varied between fuel types and regions, with the longest aggregation distances observed for the most arid regions and fuel types dominated by shrubs and grasslands. Lowest aggregation distances were obtained in the regions and fuel types with the densest forest canopy and more humid climate. Purpose/Novelty. To our best knowledge, this study is the first to analyze the effect of fuel type on the optimum aggregation distance for mapping fire perimeters directly from aggregated active fires. The methodology presented here can be used operationally in Mexico and elsewhere, by accounting for fuel-specific aggregation distances, for improving rapid estimates of fire perimeters. These early fire perimeters could be potentially available in near-real time (at every satellite pass with a 12 h latency) in operational fire monitoring GIS systems to support rapid assessment of fire progression and fire suppression planning.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Patterns of Fire on Saipan, CNMI
T2  - PACIFIC SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sediment core studies from Saipan suggest that fires did not play a prominent role in the disturbance regime of the Mariana Islands and have increased in frequency since human settlement around 4,000 years ago. On Saipan fires are understood to interrupt the pattern of succession leading to the degradation of native limestone forests, the proliferation of grasslands and the eventual creation of badlands. Little baseline data regarding the spatial and temporal patterns of fire on Saipan exist to create effective Fire Management Plans. This project uses Landsat 8 images from April 2013 to July 2020 and the Normalized Burn Ratio to identify historic fires to evaluate patterns that will inform on effective fire management policies. Over the study period we detected 1,608 ha of burnt land, in four specific hotspots. Of the area burned, 40% were in grasslands, 31% in evergreen forests, and 21% in scrub-shrub. 41% of all hectares that burned more than once throughout the study period were grasslands, indicating that this was the landcover type most vulnerable to repeat burn events. We also found a strong seasonal trend, with the average amount of burnt land detected in the dry season 280% higher than the average amount of burnt land detected in the wet season. Finally, both total precipitation and the absence of precipitation were highly correlated to the amount of burn area identified (P < .05). The information elucidated through this study will be used by local agencies to implement management plans geared toward controlling wildfires.

AB  - Building modeling from remote sensing data is essential for creating accurate 3D and 4D digital twins, especially for temperature modeling. In order to represent buildings as gap-free, visually appealing, and rich in details models, geo-typical prototypes should be represented in the scene. The sensor data and freely available OSM data are supposed to provide guidelines for best-possible matching. In this paper, the default similarity function based on intersection over union is extended by terms reflecting the similarity of elevation values, orientation towards the road, and trees in the vicinity. The goodness of fit has been evaluated by architecture experts as well as thermal simulations with a thermal image as ground truth and error measures based on mean average error, root mean square and mutual information. It could be concluded that while intersection over union measure still seems to be most preferred by architects, slightly better thermal simulation results are yielded by taking into account all similarity functions.

TI  - Avalanche decision schemes to improve pediatric rib fracture detection
T2  - MEDICAL IMAGING 2022: COMPUTER-AIDED DIAGNOSIS
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Medical Imaging - Computer-Aided Diagnosis
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Rib fractures are a sentinel injury for physical abuse in young children. When rib fractures are detected in young children, 80-100% of the time it is the result of child abuse. Rib fractures can be challenging to detect on pediatric radiographs given that they can be non-displaced, incomplete, superimposed over other structures, or oriented obliquely with respect to the detector. This work presents our efforts to develop an object detection method for rib fracture detection on pediatric chest radiographs. We propose a method entitled "avalanche decision" motivated by the reality that pediatric patients with rib fractures commonly present with multiple fractures; in our dataset, 76% of patients with fractures had more than one fracture. This approach is applied at inference and uses a decision threshold that decreases as a function of the number of proposals that clear the current threshold. These contributions were added to two leading single stage detectors: RetinaNet and YOLOv5. These methods were trained and tested with our curated dataset of 704 pediatric chest radiographs, for which pediatric radiologists labeled fracture locations and achieved an expert reader-to-reader F2 score of 0.76. Comparing base RetinaNet to RetinaNet+Avalanche yielded F2 scores of 0.55 and 0.65, respectively. F2 scores of base YOLOv5 and YOLOv5+Avalanche were 0.58 and 0.65, respectively. The proposed avalanche inferencing approaches provide increased recall and F2 scores over the standalone models.

AB  - The study aimed to identify the most relevant variable from remote sensing data that may be utilized to forecast species-specific fish availability. Because of the schooling habits and reliance on surface productivity, the Indian mackerel, Rastrelliger kanagurta, has been suggested as a prospective species for such investigations in tropical waters. The current study showed how a geographic database can aid in focusing attention on key oceanic characteristics that can serve as the most dependable predictors of fish abundance. Generalized Additive Model (GAM) on the GIS platform was used to analyze satellite-derived Chlorophyll (Chl.) data, Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data and geo-referenced catch weights of Indian Mackerel. When comparing moderate and low catch weighting to high catch weighting, the Chl. content was highly significant. SST was important when the catch weighting was high, but not when the catch weighting was moderate or low.

M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the article is to determine the function of the horse and horse harness in the representations and rituals of the Khakas associated with the children's cycle. The chronological framework of the work covers the late XIX - mid XX centuries . The choice of such time limits is determined by the state of the source base on the research topic. Ethnographic and folklore materials collected by both pre-revolutionary and modern researchers: I. G. Gmelin, N. F. Katanov, V. Ya. Butanaev, N. S. Teneshev, etc. served as a source base. Folklore materials - excerpts from heroic tales (alyptyg nymakhtar) used in this work presented for the first time in the author's translation in Russian. In the article under consideration, archival ethnographic materials on the indicated problems are also introduced into scientific circulation. Leading in the research is the principle of historicism, when any cultural phenomenon is considered in development and taking into account a specific situation. The research methodology is based on historical and ethnographic methods: remnants (relic) and semantic analysis. As a result of the analysis, the following conclusions can be drawn: 1) in the traditional culture of the Khakass, the horse and its image occupied an important place. This pet was included in the ritual associated with the children's cycle; 2) In the religious and mythological consciousness of the people, the image of a horse was steadily associated with the idea of vitality and fertility; 3) Not only the image of this ungulate and some parts of its body were endowed with magical protective properties; 4) The sacralization of the horse contributed to the fact that its image in its various manifestations was widely represented in the rituals associated with prenatal, birth and postnatal childhood cycles. An important place in this process was given to individual elements of horse equipment; 5) The horse performed a significant function in the socialization of the child, including in such stages as naming and mastering riding skills.

TI  - Determining nitrogen deficiencies for maize using various remote sensing indices
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Determining a precise nitrogen fertilizer requirement for maize in a particular field and year has proven to be a challenge due to the complexity of the nitrogen inputs, transformations and outputs in the nitrogen cycle. Remote sensing of maize nitrogen deficiency may be one way to move nitrogen fertilizer applications closer to the specific nitrogen requirement. Six vegetation indices [normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI), red-edge normalized difference vegetation index (RENDVI), triangle greenness index (TGI), normalized area vegetation index (NAVI) and chlorophyll index-green (CIgreen)] were evaluated for their ability to detect nitrogen deficiency and predict grain maize grain yield. Strip trials were established at two locations in Arkansas, USA, with nitrogen rate as the primary treatment. Remote sensing data was collected weekly with an unmanned aerial system (UAS) equipped with a multispectral and thermal sensor. Relationships among index value, nitrogen fertilizer rate and maize growth stage were evaluated. Green NDVI, RENDVI and CIgreen had the strongest relationship with nitrogen fertilizer treatment. Chlorophyll Index-green and GNDVI were the best predictors of maize grain yield early in the growing season when the application of additional nitrogen was still agronomically feasible. However, the logistics of late season nitrogen application must be considered.

TI  - Combination of Time Series of L-, C-, and X-Band SAR Images for Land Cover and Crop Classification
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The availability of new Earth observation satellites operating radar sensors at different frequencies enables the combination of multiple dimensions of the data (time, frequency, polarimetry, and interferometry) in many applications. Image classification is expected to benefit from the diversity of observation. This work illustrates classification experiments carried out with series of images acquired by ALOS-2 PALSAR (L-band), Sentinel-1 (C-band), and TanDEM-X (X-band) in two application domains: 1) land cover classification and 2) crop-type mapping. Their usage, both separately and in combination, serves to identify the complementarity of information. In this work, we propose a new color representation of the pairwise class separability in the case of using three frequency bands, which help identify which bands (or combinations of them) provide the best performance. Results in terms of accuracy scores (overall and class-specific) show that the use of the three frequency bands always outperforms the individual hands and their pairs. In addition, for both land classification and crop-type mapping the accuracy of using coherence time series is lower than the one obtained with the intensity time series, but there is complementarity in terms of sensitivity when both coherence and intensity time series are used together. The classes which are most benefited at each particular case of study have been identified. Finally, a partial tradeoff has been found between the use of multiple frequency bands and the length of the available time series.

T2  - COMPUTER OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper considers a problem of classifying Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite images for environmental monitoring of the Baikal Natural Territory (BNT). The specificity of the BNT required the creation of a new set of 12 classes, which takes into account current problems. The set was formed in such a way that the areas corresponding to these classes completely covered the BNT. A training dataset was formed using a web interface based on Sentinel-2 satellite images. The classification of satellite images was carried out using Random Forest algorithms and the ResNet50 neural network. The accuracy of the calculations showed that the classification results can be used to solve actual problems of the Baikal natural territory, in particular, to analyze changes in the forestland, assess the impact of climate change on the landscape, analyze the dynamics of development activities, create farmland inventory, etc.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article addresses evaluative utterance, which is considered in terms of its subject-matter, semantics and structure on the material of British and American fictional discourse of the 19th and the first half of the 20th centuries. The classification of value-related objects of evaluation as reflected in the fictional discourse of the selected periods is presented. The suggested classification incorporates evaluative utterances describing two thematic spheres, i. e. "Human being" and "Surrounding world". The dynamics of positive and negative evaluative utterance types in the period under study is described. The proportion of emotional and rational components in the complex meaning of evaluative utterances is determined. Trends in evolution of semantic types of evaluative utterances in the English fictional discourse of the 19th and the first half of the 20th centuries are brought into the open. Structural types of sentences, in which evaluative attitude is verbalized, are singled out, with their communicative productivity being identified and compared. The structural components of the evaluative predicate are outlined. Frequency value of morphological-and-semantic evaluative means and means of a mixed type is identified in the fictional discourse under analysis. Means of modifying the expressiveness degree in the evaluative utterances are described. The suggested approach to the evaluative utterances in the fictional discourse demonstrates the dynamics of axiological worldview of the speaking community. The growing trends for communicative compression and transparency, for the increase in emotiveness of evaluative utterances and a greater degree of gradation of the evaluative attribute, as well as the corresponding language changes, related to the phenomenon of evaluative utterance, are reflected in the linguistic worldview.

TI  - Inhomogeneous Anisotropic Analysis of the Available Water Content of the Upper Soil Layer According to Ground-Based and Remote Sensing on the Territory of Russia
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Hydrometeorological Center of Russia receives agrometeorological information from about 950 stations one time per ten days and the remote sensing Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) data from three Meteorological Operational (MetOp) satellites. We suggest a combined objective analysis (OA) of the available water content based on the available water content measurements at agrometeorological stations and on remote sensing data. The new version of OA is constructed using two neural networks and the backpropagation of error to learn it simultaneously. The first neural network is used to convert the ASCAT data into the available water content values, and the second network is used to estimate the inhomogeneities of soil moisture fields. We use the optimal interpolation (OI) method for assimilation of the ground-based data. In the new version, we evaluate the correlation functions (CFs) of inhomogeneous non-Gaussian fields, not from sample statistics but from machine learning methods. The method takes into account the combining of various datasets: ASCAT data, Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) soil types, European Space Agency (ESA) GlobCover, and National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) climate data.

TI  - Empirical and semi-empirical chlorophyll-<i>a</i> modeling for water quality assessment through river-lake transition in extreme Southern Brazil
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mirim lagoon is the second largest lacustrine water body in Southern Brazil, providing water for local communities. However, algae growth and water quality in the lagoon and in tributaries rivers is influenced by nutrient's increase. In this context, this study performs the empirical and semi-empirical chlorophyll-alpha (Chl-alpha) modeling using remote sensing and in situ data for water quality assessment. Water quality data were collected at 15 sample locations in the lagoon on the date of Sentinel-2 satellite overpass. Surface reflectance data were derived from the Sen2Cor atmospheric correction method and correlated with Chl-alpha concentration. The best model presented a Pearson's correlation coefficient = 0.81 and Mean Absolute Error = 0.13 mu g.L-1. Low Chl-alpha concentration is observed at the Northern lagoon, possibly due to suspended solids presence. The same occurs in the left margin, being associated with the influence of land use for agriculture. High Chl-alpha concentrations are associated with shallower and lentic areas. The mean Chl-alpha concentration predicted by the model was 17.34 mu g.L-1, similar to the observed value in situ (16.32 mu g.L-1). Overall, the empirical model developed can be applied as a tool to reduce costs and efforts in fieldwork measures and to understand eutrophication in this river-lake transition ecosystem.

AB  - The dataset presents a continuous mapping of the shoreline contours in the Gallocanta Lake (NE Iberian Peninsula, Spain) along the period 1984-2020 with a sub-weekly frequency (2-5 days) together with the associated water elevation and water volume. The shorelines were obtained with subpixel accuracy by applying the extraction system SHOREX on freely-available  images acquired by the satellites Sentinel-2 (sensor MSI), Landsat 5 (TM), Landsat 7 (EMT+), and Landsat 8 (OLI). At the same time, the mean elevation of the water level and the volumetric changes were respectively assigned and deduced for the same dates. This constitutes a valuable data package for robust analysis of the lake trends, as well as the response to rainfall events.Shapefiles of the lake contour appear in vector format (WGS 1984 / UTM Zone 30N, EPSG code: 32630) containing the associated elevation and volumetric information of each date.

TI  - Advantages of sentinel lymph node mapping by single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography in early-stage malignant head-and-neck skin tumors
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The aim of this study was to determine the advantages of preoperative sentinel lymph node mapping (SLNM) by single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT / CT) in patients with early-stage cutaneous head-and-neck malignancies.Materials and Methods: We conduct a 7-year and 6 months retrospective, cross-sectional study. Patients with early-stage malignant head-and-neck skin tumors and cutaneous adnexa who underwent SLNM by SPECT/CT from March 2012 and December 2019, were included in the study. Results: We retrospectively analyzed 28 patients: Melanoma was the most frequent tumor (64.2%), followed by squamous cell carcinoma (25%). The anterior cheek was the most common functional subsite (25%). Twenty-seven patients (96.4%) had a successful SLN detection with SPECT/CT. Neck lymph node dissection was performed in 23 patients (82.1%). According to the pathological specimen, lymph nodes were found in all of them; hence, the efficacy of the SPECT/CT for SLNM was 100%. At 7-year follow-up, systemic recurrence was found in one patient (3.6%), another had locoregional recurrence (3.6%), and the mortality rate was 3.6%. Conclusions: In early-stage malignant head-and-neck skin tumors, there is a high concordance between SLN found by SPECT/CT and the histopathological results. Preoperative SPECT/CT accurately detects the SLN, assesses unexpected lymph nodes and their drainage pathways, and facilitates their location by reliably showing the relationships between sentinel nodes and important anatomic structures. This allows to perform a clear preoperative evaluation, an accurate staging for all patients and to avoid excessive dissections that could result in cosmetic and functional deformities.

AB  - Old-growth forests (OGFs) are extremely valuable relict ecosystems for studying natural disturbance dynamics. Small-scale disturbances caused by tree crown mortality of one or few individuals, i.e. gap dynamics, are the most frequent events occurring in OGFs. Understanding these processes requires information on the spatial arrangement of forest patches dominated by different tree species and forest canopy gaps at a fine spatial scale. Here, we aimed at mapping different land-cover classes including conifers, broad-leaved trees, and forest canopy gaps using two very-high-resolution satellite images, i.e. Pleiades images, in the mixed fir-spruce-beech OGF reserve of Biogradska Gora (Montenegro). Specifically, we coupled an Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) approach and a Random Forest classifier, trained with samples partly derived from field data. The adopted approach showed high accuracy for the main land-cover classes (conifers, broadleaved trees, grasslands, bare ground, and water), e.g. producer's and user's accuracy higher than 92% and 95%, respectively. Conversely, forest canopy gaps were classified with lower accuracy, e g minimum producer's and user's accuracies of 75% and 54%, respectively. Despite the exploitation of textural metrics during both image segmentation and classification, the lack of remote sensing data providing information on the vertical structure of the forest stand prevented us from accurately map forest canopy gaps.

AB  - This study aims to determine the direct effect of aerosol on one element of the radiation energy balance that includes short-wavelength (SW). The AOD data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, MODIS level 3 instrument, Terra satellite, and the Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) radiation component instrument were obtained to observe the spatial and temporal variations in the aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550 nm and their relationship to the radiation balance element. These data were analyzed from January 2000 to April 2019 in Indonesia. The results of the analysis show that the average daily temporal fluctuation of AOD showed a respectively high value, namely 1.03 on 23 October 2015 and 0.68 on 9 October 2006. This very high AOD value was closely related to forest fires in Sumatra and Kalimantan. The immediate reaction in Kalimantan was when there was an increase in the accumulation of aerosol particles in the atmosphere in urban areas in this region, namely Palangka Raya, Pontianak and Banjarmasin. From the results of processing using the scatter plot statistical method, the relationship between AOD and SW obtained a negative correlation value (r) which was quite high for Pontianak with r = 0.62.

AB  - In this paper, we argue that the degradation model assumed by existing work on super-resolution of remote sensing images deviates from those in real-world images. To address the above problem, this article proposes a super-resolution reconstruction method for unpaired airplanes in remote sensing images, which consists of a model that simulates the multiple degradations in real-world scenarios and a super-resolution generative adversarial network that generates high-resolution images. Specifically, the novel degradation model can cover a wide range of degradations in natural scenes, which contains diverse factors of additive Gaussian noise, Poisson noise, Brown Gaussian noise, Gaussian blur, etc. Experiments are conducted on the airplane targets in the Gaofen challenge dataset, and the results demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to state-of-the-art methods, especially in raw remote sensing images with multiple noise and blur, which may be preferred in other practical satellite applications with harsh circumstances.

TI  - Anisotropic Spatial-Spectral Total Variation Regularized Double Low-Rank Approximation for HSI Denoising and Destriping
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral images (HSIs) can finely discriminate distinct objects with a high spectral resolution, and they are widely employed in various applications. However, mixed noise severely degrades the quality of HSI and restricts the performance of subsequent tasks. As one of the critical preprocessing steps, HSI denoising has been developed rapidly, among which low-rank (LR) prior-based methods have achieved superior performance. Nevertheless, the existing approaches frequently fail to completely remove noise and reconstruct high-quality HSIs when tackling complicated mixed noise with multiple types of high-intensity stripe noise. To solve this problem, we propose an HSI denoising and destriping method based on anisotropic spatial and spectral total variation regularized double LR approximation (ATVDLR). The double LR (DLR) approximation framework is devoted to separating the clean image from the mixed noise by exploiting both the global correlations of the HSI tensor and the LR structure of stripe noise. Furthermore, the anisotropic spatial and spectral total variation (ASSTV) regularization is introduced to preserve the spatial-spectral smoothness of HSI and the directional feature of stripes, thereby further suppressing high-level stripes and Gaussian noise. Finally, the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs) technique is designed to solve the proposed ATVDLR model. Extensive experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art techniques in multitype high-intensity mixed noise reduction and image structural information protection, and has superior performance in complex mixed noise removal of real Gaofen-5 (GF-5) HSIs.

AB  - Land cover (LC) and LC change information are essential data in terrestrial surface research. However, the LC products are highly inconsistent, especially in the mountainous area. Most LC assessment studies focused on the consistency of spatial patterns, while ignoring the consistency of change and elevation heterogeneity. In this article, four LC products were assessed for spatiotemporal consistency on the Tibetan Plateau (TP), including the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer LC (MCD12Q1), the climate change initiative LC (CCI-LC), the 30-meter global land cover (Globeland30) and the multiperiod land use/ LC remote sensing monitoring database in China. The impact of elevation on the consistency of multiple LC products across spatiotemporal scales was further analyzed. The spatial consistency of the three and more products was about 70%, with higher consistency for grassland and bare land and lower consistency for wetland and shrubland on the TP. Globeland30 and CCI-LC were better than others for overall monitoring, with the inconsistency of less than 45% by Google Earth dataset validation. The temporal change consistency of the four LC products was less than 10%. With increasing elevation, the average spatial consistency decreased and the LC change area and temporal change consistency increased. There is a high inconsistency of LC changes on the TP in existing commonly used products, demonstrating the need to develop high-quality LC products in long time series.

TI  - A comparative analysis of the epidemiology of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus in Russia, 2013/14 to 2018/19
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLOBAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are among the leading causes of lower respiratory tract infections worldwide. We conducted a comparative analysis of the age distribution and spatiotemporal epidemiology of influenza and RSV in Russia using sentinel surveillance data from 2013-14 to 2018-19 in six cities located in the western, central, and eastern regions of the country.Methods We calculated the positivity rate for influenza and RSV (by month, season, and overall) in each city, separately for patients seen at the primary and secondary care level (out-patients medical centres housing GP practices and infectious diseases hospitals, respectively). We compared the age distribution of patients infected with the different influenza virus (sub)types and RSV.Results A total of 17551 respiratory specimens were included: the overall positivity rate was 13.5% for influenza and 4.4% for RSV. The A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) and B virus (sub)types caused 31.3%, 44.0% and, respectively, 24.7% of all influenza cases. The median age was older among influenza (15 years) than among RSV patients (3 years); differences across influenza virus (sub)types were seen only at the primary care level, with influenza A(H3N2) patients being significantly older than A(H1N1)pdm09 or B influenza patients. The timing of influenza epidemics was similar across cities, with the peak typically occurring in February or March. In contrast, the typical peak timing of RSV epidemics varied largely across cities, and the virus was often detected also in spring and summer months (unlike influenza).Conclusions Influenza and RSV epidemiology differed in many regards in Russia, especially in the timing of epidemics and the age distribution of infected subjects. Health policies aimed at containing the burden of diseases of viral respiratory infections in Russia should take these findings into account.

AB  - In this paper, the physical and optical properties of aerosol plumes emitted by industrial stacks are analyzed using hyperspectral PRISMA satellite images. The plume aerosol optical thickness (AOT) and aerosol modal radius are retrieved with an algorithm using the statistical formalism of the optimal estimation method. SENTINEL-2/MSI data are also used to constrain the surface reflectances. The algorithm is applied to fine particle emissions from three industrial sites: a flaring emission from a gas flaring at an oil extraction site in Hassi Messaoud, Algeria (07/09/2021), a steel plant in Wuhan, China (03/24/2021) and a coal plant in Kendal, South Africa (09/25/2021). The mean fine mode radii vary between 0.10 to 0.39 mu m, 0.30 to 0.70 mu m and 0.40 to 1.25 mu m for the flaring site, the steel site and the coal plant, respectively. These radii are associated with AOTs varying between 0.2 to 1.0 for the flare emission, 0.5 to 3.4 for the steel plant and 0.6 to 2.4 for the coal plant.

TI  - The Examples of Riddle, Mani and Lullaby by Shahsavan Turks
T2  - MILLI FOLKLOR
M3  - Article
AB  - Riddle, mani and lullabies are oral cultural products that have survived up to the present day and have been preserved under the umbrella of anonymity in thousands of years of Turkish culture. These products, which have many social and artistic functions, reflect the common cultural values of the societies they belong to. Leaving their motherland and spreading to various geographies of the world, Turks also carried their material and spiritual cultural elements to the new places to which they migrated. In this geography known as the Turkish world, all material and spiritual elements of Turkish culture and the set of values that belong to these elements are preserved and kept alive. This common set of values, which can be traced in a wide area extending from Turkistan to the interior parts of Europe, from Siberia to the Persian Gulf, has taken a unique form in every geography, but in fact it has not undergone any changes. In other words, riddle, mani and lullabies; The Turkish world, which includes many elements such as the worldview of the Turks, intelligence and reasoning power, aesthetic taste and perception, are the common products of folk literature. At the same time, these products, which are also one of the most common and rich types of oral culture, are known by various names in the Turkish world. The most important way to reveal the new forms of riddle, mani and lullabies in different geog-raphies and the interpretations in these geographies are compilations. Thanks to the field studies, many lost or unknown elements of the Turkish world come to light. One of the most important geographies for the Turkish world is Iran. Iran, where is estimated to have at least thirty million Turks, stands out as a country that hosts the most Turkish population after Turkey. Despite the crowded Turkish population in the country, few studies have been made on Iran Turkishness and Iran field of Turkish folk literature in Turkey. Among the Iranian Turkish communities, one of the communities that keep the nomadic or semi-nomadic Turkish culture alive today is the Shahsavan Turks. No study has been conducted so far, based on direct field research, on the oral culture products of Shahsavan Turks in Turkey. The main mass of Shahsavan Turks are constituted by those who migrated to this region from the Anatolian area at the beginning of the XVI century. As a natural result of the nomadic lifestyle, Shahsavan Turks have a developed oral culture treasury. In this study, firstly, Shahsavan Turks are introduced with summary info and afterwards, general information about oral cultural products such as riddle, mani and lullabies which are the common features of Turkish world are shared. After general information about riddle, mani and lullaby genres was given, the term equivalents of these genres in Shahsavan variant (taptap-baca/tapbaca, bayati/buyati, mahni, laylay) were explained by taking into consideration the Azerbaijan field. As a result of field studies, examples of riddle, mani and lullaby compiled from Shahsavan Turks were examined in terms of structure and subject, and the Turkey Turkish equivalents of these examples were presented in the study. In the conclusion part, a general evaluation of Shahsavan riddle, mani and lullabies is carried out and attention is drawn to the richness of the oral culture tradition in Shahsavan Turks.

TI  - CHARACTERIZATION OF LAND USE COVER DATASETS FROM A GLOBAL TO AN ANDALUSIAN LEVEL: AN " OBSTACLE COURSE" FOR USERS
T2  - GEOFOCUS-REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA DE LA INFORMACION GEOGRAFICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Advances in the field of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and in Remote Sensing (RS) have led to the production of a significant number of Land Use and Land Cover (LUC) datasets. These datasets show great diversity in terms of the extents mapped, the scale and spatial resolution, or the temporal and thematic resolution, among others. In this paper, we review 33 general (non-thematic) LUC datasets covering different extents (from global to regional level), which are currently available or will be in the future for Andalusia (Spain). 17 are global, 10 European, 3 cover Spain and 3 Andalusia. The aim is to analyze the spatial, temporal and thematic parameters of these datasets so as to enable users to choose the one that best suits their purposes. Spatial parameters include format, spatial resolution, cartographic scale, Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) and Minimum Mapping Width (MMW); temporal parameters include temporal resolution or timeframe (single or time series), i.e., the length of time and the number of available dates. The thematic parameters include the number of classes and their nature, compatible legends and group of classes. This comparative analysis shows that within these 33 datasets, at least 217 different products/maps are on offer to users. This wide variety of maps is a major source of uncertainty and makes the path to find the best LUC dataset a real "obstacle course" for users.

TI  - Hospitalization Due to Fire-Induced Pollution in the Brazilian Legal Amazon from 2005 to 2018
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is widely used in the Amazon as a ubiquitous driver of land management and land cover change. Regardless of their purpose, fires release a considerable amount of pollutants into the atmosphere, with severe consequences for human health. This paper adds to the extant literature by measuring the causal effect of fires on hospitalizations, using the approach of instrumental variables, whose validity is assessed with multiple statistical tests. A wide range of confounders are added as covariates, seizing on the accuracy enhancement potential of a broad and fine-grained dataset that covers 14 years of the whole Amazon territory at a municipal-monthly level. The results reveal a positive effect of fire on hospitalizations due to respiratory illnesses in general, and particularly in those due to asthma. A 1% increase in pollution concentration would increase hospitalizations by 0.14% at a municipality-monthly level. A total of 5% of respiratory hospitalizations were estimated to be attributable to fire-induced pollution, corresponding to 822 cases per month. The analysis demonstrates that the coupling of econometrics and remote sensing data is a promising avenue towards the assessment of impacts caused by fires, which may be applied to other regions of the world subjected to anthropogenic fires.

AB  - Land surface water is the most active part of the earth's surface layer and plays an important role in material balance and energy transformation. The monitoring of dynamic changes in surface open water helps to grasp the distribution and changes of water resources, which is important for understanding the impact of human activities on water resources and safeguarding the ecological security of the basin. In the study, 72,520 Landsat images were processed using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform to study the long-term changes of the open surface water in the Yellow River Basin (YRB) from 2000 to 2020. The results show that (1) The multi-index water body extraction rules (MIWER) is suitable for long-term and large-scale surface water mapping based on Landsat images; (2) From 2000 to 2020, both permanent and seasonal water in the whole YRB and sub-basins have increased. In general, the total open surface water in the YRB show an increasing trend with obvious spatial heterogeneity; (3) The changes of open surface water in the YRB are related to climate change and intensive human activities, but the influencing factors vary in different regions and need to be further studied in the future. The findings of this study can be used to help the policy-makers understand changing water resources and their driving mechanism and provide a reference for water resources management, agricultural irrigation, and ecological protection.

TI  - Spectral-Spatial Feature Completely Separated Extraction with Tensor CNN for Multispectral Image Compression
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS, SIGNAL PROCESSING, AND SYSTEMS, VOL. 1
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 10th International Conference on Communications, Signal Processing, and Systems
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Considering the rich spectral and spatial information of multispectral image, a learned multispectral image compression method named spectral-spatial feature completely separated extraction with tensor CNN is proposed. In encoder, two parallel modules, spectral module and spatial module, are applied to extract spectral and spatial features respectively. Then in order to reduce the loss in the downsampling process, two tensor layers that integrate tucker decomposition and neural network are utilized to decompose the multiway features. The decomposed feature tensors are concatenated along the channel dimension, saving the spectral and spatial features separately. To recover the features, the concatenated tensor is split in symmetric decoder after quantizer and entropy codec. Finally, postprocessing module is utilized to remove the compression artifacts of reconstructed image fused by recovered feature tensors. Besides, rate-distortion optimization is embedded to balance the trade-off between the rate loss and the distortion. Experiments on eight-band dataset from the WorldView-3 satellite demonstrate our proposed method outperforms JPEG2000 and 3D-SPIHT in PSNR.

AB  - Sentinel-1 C-band SAR observations over the high-altitude Senator Beck Basin in Colorado show spatial patterns strongly modulated by local topography. An uncalibrated coupled snow hydrology-radiative transfer model driven by downscaled atmospheric reanalysis data (30-m, 15-min) was applied to simulate the spatial and temporal evolution of the backscattering behavior of the seasonal snowpack without vegetation. Model simulations were corrected to capture the impact of complex topography on the viewing geometry. The moisture-attenuated background backscattering field was estimated from a small number of averaged summertime measurements under snow-free conditions. The comparison between the results shows good agreement (< 3 dB) between simulated and observed backscattering fields except in very steep slopes (> 25 degrees). Localized higher discrepancies at lower elevations and relatively flat terrain can be unambiguously attributed to underestimation of snowfall in the reanalysis data.

TI  - Harmonized Chlorophyll-a Retrievals in Inland Lakes From Landsat-8/9 and Sentinel 2A/B Virtual Constellation Through Machine Learning
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Moderate-high-resolution satellite missions provide an opportunity to capture subtle spatial variability in lakes; however, the sparsity of time series for individual satellite instruments cannot monitor temporal variation in the lake environment. To date, studies on the joint observations of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) in inland lakes from multiple missions have been poorly reported. Here, we generated a harmonized Chl-a dataset for the lakes in the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau in China from 2013 to 2022 by the Landsat 8/9 (L8/L9) and Sentinel-2A/B (S2A/S2B) virtual constellation. This study first examined the performance of four atmospheric correction processors to derive the remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) from L8/L9 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and S2A/S2B multispectral instrument (MSI) images. We determined that the dark spectral fitting algorithm generated better R-rs than the other processors, e.g., R-rs(561) mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) = 15.2%, R-rs(665) MAPE = 27.5%, and R-rs(704) MAPE = 25.7%. OLI-derived R-rs at five visible and near-infrared bands showed satisfactory agreement with MSI (slope = 0.94 and MAPE = 11.8%). The mixed density network outperformed the six state-of-the-art algorithms and other two machine learning models in retrieving Chl-a [MSI: MAPE = 31.4% (N = 109) and OLI: MAPE = 38.0% (N = 74)]. The satisfactory agreement of Chl-a retrievals between the synchronous MSI and OLI images (N = 2 293 821 and MAPE = 34.6%) supported the establishment of the virtual constellation. MSI- and OLI-derived Chl-a in nine major lakes in the studied area exhibited apparent seasonal variability from 2013 to 2022, particularly after 2017. Results highlight a solution to establish the Landsat/Sentinel-2 virtual constellation for improving the spatial and temporal resolutions of a database of lake water quality.

AB  - Oil spills in the marine environment increasingly represent a significant problem for the ecosystem. The intensification of the operations of extraction, transport and storage of hydrocarbons has in fact caused a greater frequency of the occurrence of accidents, with consequent dispersion of the material in an uncontrolled manner. Remote sensing plays a fundamental role in identifying and monitoring these phenomena. In particular, using satellite images obtained with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) technology, spill recognition methodologies have been developed through automatic and semi-automatic approaches. This paper analyses the accident that occurred in March 2017 in the Persian Gulf, through the Sentinel-1 Single Look Complex (SLC) and Ground Range Detected (GRD) SAR image Change Detection technique, to evaluate the dispersion of hydrocarbons. The use of the SentiNel Application Platform (SNAP) software of the European Space Agency (ESA) made it possible to determine the amount of oil involved in the spill. Furthermore, through the Web-based application General NOAA Oil Modeling Environment (WebGNOME) the dynamic propagation model of the spilled hydrocarbons was produced based on the morphology and meteorological conditions of the site examined which further confirmed the validity of the Change Detection operations Sentinel-1 images. Finally, the results were compared with those obtained using automatic methodologies developed by ESA, confirming the greater accuracy of the procedures used in this study.

AB  - In Venezuela, according to a report by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) dated September 2021, up to 50,000 oil spills at sea have been monitored in the 2010-2016-time frame. In the current two-year period, the situation does not seem to have changed: the state refinery of the Venezuelan oil company Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA), located near El Palito (Carabobo), is estimated to have been responsible for nearly 100,000 barrels of oil spilled in just one year. The aforementioned spills, with the intensification of extraction, transport and storage operations, have given rise to a greater number of accidents resulting in uncontrolled dispersion of material, endangering local marine-coastal ecosystems. The one that took place in July 2020 stands out, reconstructed a posteriori using satellite images that have highlighted its geo-environmental impact. Remote sensing has played a fundamental role in identifying and monitoring the spread of hydrocarbons; in the present study, the same event was analysed using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar Image (SAR) Change Detection techniques. The use of the desktop software SeNtinel Application Platform (SNAP) of the European Space Agency (ESA) made it possible to quantify the ocean surface affected by the phenomenon under analysis; at the same time, an algorithm was formulated within the cloud platform Google Earth Engine (GEE) which confirmed the same outputs but more quickly and allowed the implementation of an algorithm that exploits the statistical concept of value of Otsu threshold. The results obtained were subsequently compared with other results extrapolated through automatic methodologies developed by ESA, which supported a better accuracy of the procedures used in this study.

TI  - Nodal Assessment in Endometrial Atypical Hyperplasia
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC AND OBSTETRIC INVESTIGATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Atypical endometrial hyperplasia (AH) is the neoplastic precursor more often associated with endometrial cancer (EC). Nowadays, 25-50% of patients subjected to hysterectomy for preoperative AH are diagnosed with EC at the final pathological analysis. Furthermore, there is no consensus on which preoperative AH patients would benefit from sentinel lymph node mapping. This study aimed to evaluate nodal assessment and preoperative cancer risk factors in preoperative AH patients undergoing nodal surgical staging. Methods: Patients undergoing surgical treatment for AH were retrospectively included in the analysis. Patients were divided into two groups (AH and EC groups) based on the final surgical pathology. The ESGO/ESTRO/ESP risk classification was used for EC cases. Design: This was a retrospective study. Results: Of the 207 AH patients treated, 152 cases met the inclusion criteria. Among preoperative AH patients with final EC diagnosis, 39 patients were in the low-risk group (25.7%), 8 in the intermediate-risk group (5.3%), 4 in high-intermediate (2.6%), and 3 patients were allocated in the high-risk group (2.0%). Fifty-four total patients underwent nodal surgical staging. Only one nodal micrometastasis (0.7%) was found at ultrastaging. Multivariate analysis showed abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) (p = 0.01), hypertension (p < 0.01), and endometrial thickness >= 20 mm (p = 0.02) statistically more represented in patients with EC at final surgical analysis. EC risk was 2.9 (95% CI: 1.29-6.48) in AUB, 2.7 (95% CI: 1.06-6.92) in hypertension, and 3.1 (95% CI: 1.19-7.97) in endometrial thickness z20 mm cases. Limitations:The present study has limitations inherent in its retrospective nature. Conclusion: The overall risk of nodal metastases in preoperative AH patients was low. Conversely, 9.9% of the preoperative AH patients belonged to the intermediate or high-risk group for EC at the final histological examination. Preoperative cancer risk factors would identify AH patients for whom nodal staging could be suggested. (C) 2022 S. Karger AG, Basel

TI  - Retrospective study of tumors from cattle slaughtered in Lombardy (Italy): preliminary evaluation on the establishment of a bovine cancer registry
T2  - VETERINARIA ITALIANA
M3  - Article
AB  - Forty-one tumors were detected in a population of 1,649,003 cattle slaughtered in 4 abattoirs in Lombardy over a 5-year period, for an overall prevalence of 2.5 tumors per 100,000 cattle. Tumors were classified according to the WHO histological classification of tumors of domestic animals. Alimentary and hemopoietic systems were commonly affected with 9 cases each. Other affected sites were the respiratory (n = 3), urinary (n = 2), endocrine (n = 2), musculoskeletal (n = 2), nervous (n = 1), and cardiovascular (n = 1) systems. The peritoneum was affected by 6 cases, while the primary location of 3 tumors of the connective tissues and 3 metastatic carcinomas was unidentified. Liver tumors and mesotheliomas, for which environmental risk factors are well-known in humans, were common, as well as tumors typically encountered in pediatric human patients (tumors of mesenchymal tissues, pulmonary blastomas and nephroblastomas). These findings suggest the useful role of bovines as sentinel and model for human carcinogenesis. Our study indicates that the establishment of a bovine cancer registry in Lombardy is feasible considering its potential contribution to understanding the role of environmental risk factors in the genesis of tumors in animals and humans.

AB  - Artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) have grown in popularity in recent decades as a result of advances in high-performance computing (HPC) and open-source software. Earth science research has benefited from these advancements and continues to do so. However, entry-level AI/ML projects frequently have a significant level of complexity that prevents them from being realized. Furthermore, HPC workflows oftentimes require specialized knowledge for the installation and management of software dependencies. Our group has been working on closing this gap, particularly focused in remotely sensed applications, by leveraging high performance computing containers to make code portable across environments. In this paper we present the design and implementation of a set of containers to both speed up and optimize the development of remotely sensed data applications. These containers have been made publicly available for the use of the science community and include common AI/ML frameworks and hardware acceleration libraries. Here we present several use cases and experiments of how containers can be leveraged to speed up the development and deployment of AI/ML software and some examples of containerized applications performance.

AB  - The estimation of forest parameters, such as canopy height model (CHM) and above ground biomass (AGB), is of utmost importance for forest monitoring, carbon-cycle modelling, disturbance analysis, resource inventorying and natural disaster prevention. In this work, we profit from the most recent advancements in deep learning research to propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for frequent forest parameter estimation at large scale. Our technique consists of a fully convolutional, multi-modal framework, which works on a single set of complementary multi-spectral and interferometric SAR data, acquired by ESA's Sentinel-2 and DLR's TanDEM-X missions, respectively. The regression performance of our framework has been tested over four tropical forest test sites in Gabon, Africa. The estimation of CHM shows promising early results when compared to state-of-the-art methods and has the advantage of requiring only a single input image pair instead of a longer time-series, as commonly done for state-of-the-art model-based techniques.

AB  - Remote sensing technologies, such as radiometry radar or synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) provide satellite observations with different spatio-temporal resolutions. Some of these observations can be combined to enhance the resolution of satellite products. In this paper, we formulate the data interpolation problem as a signal reconstruction on a graph, where the weights of edges between nodes are chosen as a function of high resolution ancillary data, e.g., geospatial data or observations from an instrument providing high resolution imagery. Our method is initialized with a high resolution signal directly interpolated from coarse observations obtained from a first instrument. Then, we solve a quadratic Laplacian optimization problem to ensure that the obtained high resolution observations are consistent with our original estimates while being smooth on the constructed graph. Preliminary results show that our approach leads to better remote sensed data reconstruction when compared against traditional spatial filtering and interpolation techniques.

AB  - The aimed of the study was to identify the characteristics of fish farms and the progress of the enterprises that practice the activity during the time span of 13 years (2008 to 2021) in Alto Paraiso municipality (RO, Western Amazon), aiming to know the general aspects and verify the number of enterprises, spatialization in the municipality and size. The study was carried out using remote sensing tools, analyzing the occupation in the municipality with fish farming, through the processing of images from the SPOT-5 satellite (for 2008) and CBERS-4A satellite (for 2021), made available by SEDAM and INPE Agencies, respectively. Image processing was performed using the GIS QGis 3.20.2 (Odense) and allowed the creation of image maps of fish farming in the study area. In addition, the vectorization of fish farms was carried out, where the water surface area was analyzed for the composition of heat maps that allowed a geographic analysis of the behavior of patterns. The results obtained shown that in the municipality there are small, medium and large fish farms, the evolution of fish farms in the municipality was in the order of 200% for the number of enterprises and 874% for the amount of water surface.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

AB  - PRISMA data is still underexploited in what concerns mineral exploration, while the high demand for battery components such as lithium (Li) instigates exploration of other low-grade deposits such as St. Austell (Cornwall, UK). This study assesses the potential of PRISMA data to target such Li deposits through the detection of topaz as a proxy to the mineralization using band math and partial unmixing techniques. The topaz distribution maps obtained are coherent between each other and with the known geology of the area, highlighting the PRISMA potential, although there could be some shortcomings related to its spatial resolution. Comparison with Sentinel-2 or Worldview-3 data shows the limitations of multispectral products, despite some potential to use Worldview-3 that need to be further investigated. In the future, new approaches to directly detect Li-micas and field validation of the results must be conducted.

CP  - Conference on Earth Resources and Environmental Remote Sensing/GIS Applications XIII Part of SPIE Remote Sensing Conference
CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - GREENPEG is a H2020 project developing exploration toolsets for critical materials in pegmatites. Lineament mapping is a powerful tool to identify geological structures at different scales, which is commonly applied in mineral exploration. To extract lineament information, different types of data can be employed, namely: (i) optical remote sensing data, (ii) radar remote sensing data, and (iii) digital elevation models (DEM5). All these data have been used by GREENPEG, where image processing of Sentinel-1 and ALOS (DEM) datasets were evaluated to identify regional-scale tectonic structures, such as faults, that may have controlled pegmatite melt emplacement. Automated geomatics methods to extract lineament information and perform lineament mapping were employed and the mean direction of the extracted lineaments was evaluated through rose diagrams. In general, the results of the radar image processing were affected by noise in the coastal areas and by the topography of the region. ALOS data presented some advantages, due to less influence from topography and human structures (saving time in the visual inspection of the results). Moreover, even though higher thresholds for the minimum length to consider as a lineament were applied to Sentinel-1 images, ALOS-derived lineaments were longer. The main trend of the extracted lineaments is in agreement between the two datasets, although specific trends are clearer in the ALOS-derived lineaments because the shaded reliefs produced already filtered the azimuth of lineaments to be extracted according to light incidence angle. For all three project demonstration sites (Leinster, Ireland; Wolfsberg, Austria; and Tysfjord, Norway) it was possible to identify lineaments that may relate to structures that controlled pegmatite emplacement. This study demonstrates the usefulness of different satellite data in structural mapping and mineral exploration.

AB  - The objective of this work is to process environmental data from the state of Amapa, aiming to identify deforested areas and the activities developed in this region, as well as the correlation between deforestation and the incidence of fire focus. The study covers the period between 2001 and 2019, using deforestation data from the project for Annual Mapping of Land Cover and Land Use in Brazil (MapBiomas), data of fire focus from the National Institute for Space Research (INPE) and data from the MCD64A1 burned area product, by means of the MODIS sensor. The processing and treatment of the information was done in the Lacarta Laboratory (geography/ Unifap) using Arcgis software. The results obtained show that, like the other states of the Amazon biome, in the state of Amapa the environmental dynamics of vegetation suppression is promoted by anthropic pressures caused mainly by agriculture and cattle ranching activities, especially along the amazon savanna.

AB  - The fourth industrial revolution and breakthroughs in emerging technologies, namely in Big Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Quantum Computing, have the potential to change the nature of space activities, ranging from space exploration, space tourism, to space activities. The practical applications of AI are manifold and include the automation of repetitive tasks in the manufacturing of satellites and spacecrafts, image recognition of satellite data and provision of assistance to astronauts in task and behaviour management. While emerging technologies offer new opportunities, the side effects of these promises rest on the negative issues associated. Ensuring the accessibility of space datasets, while also ensuring the identification and mitigation of cybersecurity implications of AI-powered devices and quantum computers, remains essential. These are some of the few challenges that scientists, design engineers, and decision-makers will have to face in both the short and long-term.Based on the above, this paper will discuss the possibilities presented by emerging technologies, their associated risks in the space sector, and finally the potential mitigating measures addressing the degree of coordination that is necessary to ensure that space activities remain peaceful and beneficial for all humankind.

T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Model-based approaches to pansharpening still constitute a class of widely employed methods, thanks to their straightforward applicability to many problems, dispensing the user from time-consuming training phases. The injection scheme based on an accurate estimation (exploiting regression) of the relationship between the details contained in the panchromatic (PAN) image and those required for the enhancement of the multispectral (MS) image represents the most updated approach to this problem, being characterized by both theoretical and practical optimality. We elaborated on this scheme by designing a procedure for estimating the key parameters required for the optimal setting of such a regression-based approach. We tested this approach on several datasets acquired by the WorldView satellites comparing the proposed approach with a benchmark consisting of some state-of-the-art pansharpening methods.

TI  - Characterizing spatial and temporal deforestation and its effects on surface urban heat islands in a tropical city using Landsat time series
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - With 1.76 million inhabitants, Me ' rida city has recently become the most populated city in southeast Mexico, being one of the most attractive cities for investment in real-estate projects. This has increased deforestation to the periphery, resulting in heat islands. We used time series of Landsat images and the BFAST algorithm to analyze annual deforestation around Me ' rida city over the 2000-2018 period. Land surface temperature was also estimated using Landsat images to compare temperatures before and after deforestation and examine heat islands in the city. The deforestation maps had a 96.82% overall accuracy on average, user's and producer's accuracy values of 91.62% and 95.46%, respectively, and an estimated total deforested area of 5413 ha over the study period. Land surface temperature increased in 2.36-3.94 degrees C after deforestation, and heat islands of varying intensity were detected in 80% of the urban territory, mainly where deforestation occurred. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of Landsat images and the BFAST algorithm for detecting deforestation in peri-urban spaces, as well as the usability of Landsat images for estimating land surface temperature. These images are effective tools for urban land-use planning and for examining the formation of heat islands in tropical cities.

The results obtained showed chlorophyll-a density values between 0.4 and 6.3 mu g/L, average Secchi depth of similar to 3.0m and water surface temperature between 13.7 and 32.8 degrees C. This configuration culminated in an (ultra)oligotrophic environment. When comparing the estimated and measured values, a greater congruence of methods for measuring water surface temperature is noted.

TI  - Data mining applied to feature selection methods for aboveground carbon stock modelling
T2  - PESQUISA AGROPECUARIA BRASILEIRA
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this work was to apply the random forest (RF) algorithm to the modelling of the aboveground carbon (AGC) stock of a tropical forest by testing three feature selection procedures - recursive removal and the uniobjective and multiobjective genetic algorithms (GAs). The used database covered 1,007 plots sampled in the Rio Grande watershed, in the state of Minas Gerais state, Brazil, and 114 environmental variables (climatic, edaphic, geographic, terrain, and spectral). The best feature selection strategy - RF with multiobjective GA - reaches the minor root-square error of 17.75 Mg ha-1 with only four spectral variables - normalized difference moisture index, normalized burn ratio 2 correlation texture, treecover, and latent heat flux -, which represents a reduction of 96.5% in the size of the database. Feature selection strategies assist in obtaining a better RF performance, by improving the accuracy and reducing the volume of the data. Although the recursive removal and multiobjective GA showed a similar performance as feature selection strategies, the latter presents the smallest subset of variables, with the highest accuracy. The findings of this study highlight the importance of using near infrared, short wavelengths, and derived vegetation indices for the remote-sense-based estimation of AGC. The MODIS products show a significant relationship with the AGC stock and should be further explored by the scientific community for the modelling of this stock.

AB  - An Internet of Things system designed for the collection and processing of surface water quality and meteorological data is presented. The open source software architecture is an important aspect of the design of this system, based on common commercial of the shelf components. It integrates: low power microcontrollers and single board computers to acquire and process the data from the most common parameters measured by water quality monitoring systems; long range communications using the LoRaWAN protocol allowing the system to be deployed over large and remote areas; asynchronous and reliable communications; a container based software design for easy, scalable and controllable deployment, thus reducing the complexity of the reproduction of the experimental setup in systems research. This paper also describes the design and implementation of a geospatial database using free and open source software. The system allows the user to visualize and plot the acquired data from the measurement of water quality parameters and meteorological data of various water-bodies at different time periods. Real-time measurements of parameters such as: air and water temperature; electrical conductivity; pH and evaporation, among others, can be correlated with other important properties. Remote sensing data providing real-time information to predict, prevent and act on water quality is also incorporated in the system.

TI  - Laparoscopic lymph node biopsy for lymphoma with a novel use of indocyanine green fluorescence in a 66-year-old male patient.
T2  - International journal of surgery case reports
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Indocyanine green (ICG) near-infrared fluorescence is primarily employed in detecting Intraoperative sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping or to evaluate the extent of radical lymphadenectomy mainly in colo-rectal and gastric cancer. To date there are no reports indicating the use of this dye to detect pathologic lymphatic tissue when a lymph node biopsy for suspected lymphoproliferative disease is performed.PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 66-year-old male patient was admitted to the hospital for severe pain of left renal colic type. A computed tomography (CT) scan and a positron emission tomography (PET) showed a left hydroureteronephrosis due to ureter compression by paraortic solid tissue of lymphomatous aspect with a standardized uptake value (SUV) of 15. Multiple lymphadenopathies on paracaval, para-aortic and common iliac sites were present as well.DISCUSSION: A laparoscopic lymph node biopsy (LLB) was planned for diagnostic purposes. After induction of anesthesia a ICG solution was injected Intradermally at both inguinal regions. At laparoscopy a complete visualization of the pathologic lymphnodes was achieved, enabling incisional biopsies of the lymphomatous mass. Histopathological examination showed an extranodal localization of an aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.CONCLUSION: ICG-fluorescence seems to offer a simple and safe method for pathologic lymph node detection. LLB in the suspicion of intra abdominal lymphoma can largely take advantage by this novel opportunity not yet tested to date. More studies with large case series are needed to confirm the efficacy of ICG-fluorescence for detecting pathologic lymph nodes.

TI  - Medicinal plants used among the Tenek inthe Huasteca, Mexico
T2  - CIENCIAUAT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tenek culture is an indigenous group from Mexico that still performs traditional medicine practices which reflect their interaction and con-nection with nature, as well as their worldview, and identity. Nevertheless, this knowledge is being eroded. The present research aims to determine the different species of medicinal plants used by Tenek to treat symptoms associated to illnesses and injuries. A survey was administered to 189 persons form 5 different rural localities in the Huasteca region from Veracruz, specifically Tantoyuca municipality, Additionally, 19 indigenous, traditional medicine doctors were interviewed. The results were analyzed by descriptive statistics. As a result, 152 species were detected, which belong to 63 different botanical families. 48 % of the identified species belonged to 10 of these botanical species, the predominant biological form being herbaceous. Likewise, 45 % of the identified species are wild. Thus, medicinal plants play an important role in the healthcare system of the rural areas studied. These plants are part of their biocultural heritage, therefore their germplasm and associated traditional knowledge must be conserved in the face of conditions such as climate changes and land use, poverty, and the migration of the youngest; particularly because this traditional knowledge has basically been inherited through oral tradition.

TI  - New safer management for breast cancer patients who need neoadjuvant therapy during SARS-COVID pandemic.
T2  - Breast disease
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - During the first hit of SARS-COVID pandemic, an important reorganization of Healthcare Services has been done, and new protocols and pathways to protect frail patients like oncological patients were designed. The second hit of pandemic had stressed these new pathways and suggests to health-workers some improvements for safer management of patents.We reported our experience in organizing the clinical pathway of neoadjuvant therapy candidate patients based on the execution of sentinel lympho-node biopsy and the placement of implantable venous access port in the same access to operating room before neoadjuvant chemotherapy suggesting a possible organizational model. In the period October-December 2020 we have included in this new type of path twelve patients and we have not registered any cases of COVID among the patients included. We think this new path, adopted amid the second hit, will be useful for all Breast Units that are facing the challenge of guaranteeing the highest standards of care in a historical moment where the health emergency occupies the efforts of health workers and the economic resources of health systems.

TI  - Assessment of selective logging impacts using UAV, Landsat, and Sentinel data in the Brazilian Amazon rainforest
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Several studies have assessed forest disturbance in tropical forests using Landsat imagery. However, the spatial resolution (30 m) of Landsat images has often been considered too coarse to accurately detect the extent and impacts of selective logging. The Sentinel-2 satellite launched in 2015 has been providing images at spatial resolutions of 10 to 20 m and those images have shown an improved potential for detecting forest disturbances in tropical regions. We compared Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 imagery for detecting selective logging in a rain forest site in the Brazilian Amazon. The aerosol-free modified soil adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI_af) was retrieved from the satellite images acquired in August 2020 immediately following logging. A robust reference dataset of very-high-resolution imagery (0.5 m) acquired using a complementary metal oxide semiconductor sensor (visible bands) onboard of an unmanned aerial vehicle was used to image the area of interest and a map derived from it was used to assess the classification accuracies made using satellite-derived data. The overall accuracy of the classified Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 images varied between 54% and 83%, depending on the applied classification parameters for distinguishing undisturbed from disturbed forest canopy. Images acquired using the UAV allowed us to detect subtle impacts of canopy openings by selective logging activities. Images acquired using the UAV allowed the detection of small canopy openings, but not Sentinel-2 or Landsat-8. Sentinel-2 provided more details of canopy disturbances than Landsat image. Our classification approach is fully implementable on the Google Earth Engine platform and is a promising technique to monitor selective logging impacts in tropical forests.

AB  - Among climate effects, fires are reported to be the most catastrophic events both economically and environmentally, in fact, recent statistics report about 340,000 hectares (ha) burnt in countries of the European Community during 2020, corresponding to an area 30% larger than Luxembourg. In worst cases, fire-affected areas will be permanently damaged. Then, there is a need for solutions to help institutions and researchers to keep the environment under monitoring, assess the damage severity and help planning burned area recovery. To this purpose, this paper presents a smart monitoring framework that bridges spectral image clustering with soft computing techniques to describe the effective fire damages in the monitored area. The approach collects images from Sentinel-2 satellite, assesses Spectral Indices (SIs) from them, then by clustering, divides the area into different sub-regions according to their vegetative features. Then these sub-regions are parsed by a fuzzy decision tree, able to interpret the damage of fire severity in each sub-region. Experiences show that by dividing the area into many sub-regions, fire damage can be detected at different levels of granularity, providing a detailed map of the most damaged sub-areas to plan, for example, ad-hoc recovery interventions.

TI  - Evaluation of OLCI Neural Network Radiometric Water Products
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Radiometric water products from the neural net-work (NNv2) in the alternative atmospheric correction (AAC) processing chain of Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) data were assessed over different marine regions. These products, not included among the operational ones, were custom-produced from Copernicus Sentinel-3 OLCI Baseline Collection 3. The assessment benefitted of in situ reference data from the Ocean Color component of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET-OC) from sites representative of different water types. These included clear waters in the Western Mediterranean Sea, optically complex waters characterized by varying concentrations of total suspended matter and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in the northern Adriatic Sea, and optically complex waters characterized by very high concentrations of CDOM in the Baltic Sea. The comparison of the water-leaving radiances L-WN(lambda) derived from OLCI data on board Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B with those from AERONET-OC confirmed consistency between the products from the two satellite sensors. However, the accuracy of satellite data products exhibited dependence on the water type. A general underestimate of L-WN(lambda) was observed for clear waters. Conversely, overestimates were observed for data products from optically complex waters with the worst results obtained for CDOM-dominated waters. These findings suggest caution in exploiting NNv2 radiometric products, especially for highly absorbing and clear waters.

Although transit metastases have been described for malignant melanoma, some cases of transit metastases have also been reported among primary cutaneous non-melanoma cancers. Treatment of patients with in-transit squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a multimodal approach for advanced staging imaging and therapy, including Mohs micrographic surgery, adjuvant radiation, and possibly sentinel lymph node biopsy and immunotherapy or chemotherapy. Here we report two cases of in-transit metastasis with primary cutaneous SCC.

T2  - Revista Veterinaria - Corrientes
M3  - Article
AB  - The obligate ectoparasites Varroa destructor and Nosema sp affect honey bee Apis mellifera health and generate important colony losses. This paper describes and analyze information from sentinel units about varrosis and nosemosis regional distribution and prevalence level during three years, according to a surveillance program of EEA INTA Rafaela and INTA national beekeeping program. During the study, a total of 49 apiaries were monitored in four different zones of Santa Fe Province (North, South, Riverside and Central zone), which were visited at three moments every year: before autumn acaricide treatment, after the treatment and at the beginning of spring. Data about apiary management practices and samples for Varroa mites and Nosema were collected. We found high percentages of Varroa after treatment in South Zone during 2017 and in North Zone during 2018 and 2019. Our results suggested that, both region and control strategies impact on Varroa infestation level during the course of the year, being their relative importance depend on the moment when it is observed. In addition, seasonal trend of Varroa in response to bee dynamic population explained the absence of interaction between period and year factors. According to our study, a surveillance program by means of sentinel apiaries which identify the main spread period was effective in monitoring and remedying the level of both pathogens, so to ensure a healthy bee colony.

TI  - Effect of the slope angle and its classification on landslides
T2  - HIMALAYAN GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The preparation of landslide susceptibility maps is a complex process with regards to selection of study field, parameters, and methods. The phase after the determination of the landslide distribution in landslide susceptibility studies is selection of methods and parameters to be used. A review of approximately 1500 randomly selected publications revealed that it was necessary to select a parameter based on the area, in each study, the most preferred parameter was the slope angle. Generally, it was observed that automatic slope angle classifications were used in the preparation of landslide maps. Therefore, there is no standard in slope angle maps nor in the class range that is referenced when preparing them. In this study, class ranges and slope angle values of areas where landslides have occurred were determined from the 15 literature, and of these, 40 landslides areas were selected in Turkey and their slope angle maps were created. These were evaluated based on the slope angle classes determined in the published literature. The effects of slope angle on the landslide were determined, and an understanding was gained of how important it was to be careful when determining the classification of slope angle. When smaller class ranges were selected, different results were obtained suggesting that the selection of the range of classes are vital in the preparation of landslide susceptibility maps.

AB  - The night-time images captured by the astronauts on the International Space Station represent a valuable source of information for all researchers interested in the study of light pollution. There is a significant advantage in using remote sensing data, because local measurements require too much time to cover a large area. We present this paper to make a relative estimation of the amount of lighting that is projected into the atmosphere in different cities of Mexico. The main purpose was to determine light pollution by geo-referencing night-time images obtained from the International Space Station. We can use the results in subsequent studies on the variation of night-time lighting conditions and their socio-demographic, socio-economic, and environmental relationships. This work interests lighting engineers, night sky modelers and public policy researchers who have a continuous need for sufficient data on the distribution of light intensity to enable better analysis and the establishment of regulatory measures.

AB  - Solar photovoltaic power plants are in rapid expansion throughout the world, with the total area occupied by panels being linked to the total electrical power produced. This paper considers this case as an instance of the generic problem of estimating the total area occupied by a class of interest in spaceborne hyperspectral images. As the spatial resolution characterizing these sensors is too coarse, spectral unmixing techniques identify the contribution of a specific material to the spectrum related to a single image element. Final results are obtained by summing all contributions in an area of interest, and favourably compared to pixel-based detection, also using higher resolution Sentinel-2 data. The data used in this paper are acquired by the currently operative DESIS sensor, mounted on the International Space Station, encouraging the use of spaceborne imaging spectrometers for such applications.

TI  - Assessing Remotely Piloted Aerial Systems in the characterization of rocky shores for oil spills environmental sensitivity mapping, northern Sao Paulo littoral, Brazil
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) for oil spills was developed to assist coordinators to evaluate oil spill impact along shorelines and also to coordinate the allocation of resources during and after the incident, aiming to reduce environmental damage and consequences. Recently, Remotely Piloted Aerial Systems (RPAS) are being used in a wide range of areas, since they complement traditional remote sensing data (e.g., satellite images) and offer a rapidly, precise, detail and high-resolution images that fit well for environmental studies. Herein, the use of high-resolution RPAS images for ESI analysis of rocky shores in the Brazilian territory was performed. Using RPAS images, with their higher-resolution compared with ArcGIS Pro Basemap satellite images, increased the detailed of ESI analysis for oil spills, increasing the number of regions in the rocky shore that are more sensitive to oil spills. The RPAS images were able to decrease the number of areas that were less sensitive to oil spills, and increase areas that are more sensitive to oil spills. This increase is important, since they were not detected in the ESI analysis using conventional ArcGIS Pro Basemap satellite images. The RPAS images permit to delineate precisely rocky shores, improving ESI interpretation in rocky shores.

TI  - Dynamics of land cover and land use in Pernambuco (Brazil): Spatio-temporal variability and temporal trends of biophysical parameters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in land use and land cover can generate the degradation of ecosystems or can be linked to a recovery of their functions. In this sense, the study of biophysical parameters of the surface helps to identify patterns and quantify the changes that have occurred. The objective was to evaluate the changes in biophysical parameters in the state of Pernambuco during 2000-2019 of albedo, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), and Surface Temperature (ST) with data from the MODIS sensor. The MOD09A1 and MOD11A1 image product collections estimate the biophysical parameters on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) software/platform. Reduced annual images of the parameters listed above were generated, totaling 120 images, in which we obtained the descriptive statistics of each one. For the climatic characterization of the study area, we extracted monthly pixel values in 45 rainfall stations and determined the annual averages of the biophysical parameters and annual accumulated rainfall. We applied the Mann-Kendall temporal trend test, the Kendall coefficient, and the Theil-Sen test to determine the significance, direction, and magnitude of changes in the biophysical parameters from 2000 to 2019 at regional (state) level and homogeneous rainfall zones. The results indicate that rainfall affected the behavior of the biophysical parameters, with a decrease in SAVI by 0.06 (-19%) and an increase in temperature by 2.70 degrees C, (+9%) when comparing rainy and dry years. Vegetation indices decreased, and surface temperature increased throughout the state, however, the results were not significant. At the level of homogeneous rainfall zones, only the coastal region showed a significant reduction in vegetation indices in the order of 0.04 in the analyzed period, demonstrating that economic and social pressures may be altering the dynamics of the local ecosystem. Other studies can compare different regions to verify the possible effects of different public policies on the preservation of natural resources.

AB  - We are interested in monitoring the soil movements that occur after flooding events using advanced multi-temporal differential interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) technique. We considered two post-flood soil deformation events that happened in Tunisia. We used five groups of Sentinel1 datasets in order to generate the velocity maps of the soil displacements that happened after heavy rainfalls in October and September, 2018, respectively, in Rouhia region and the "Cape Bon" peninsula in Tunisia. Our motivation behind this work is to provide a comprehensive multi-temporal monitoring of the post-flood soil instabilities using the Parallel computing version of the Small BAseline Subset (P-SBAS) approach because we are aware of the infrastructural and material difficulties for the use of conventional in-situ soil displacement methods especially during the times of crises. Furthermore, we used the information of the erodability maps to classify the ground surface susceptibility to erosion. These thematic maps are used, in this study, to qualitatively confirm the P-SBAS analysis results that related the ground surface movements to the existence of floodwater.

T2  - PLOS global public health
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - There is limited surveillance and laboratory capacity for non-influenza respiratory viruses in India. We leveraged the influenza sentinel surveillance of India to detect other respiratory viruses among patients with acute respiratory infection. Six centers representing different geographic areas of India weekly enrolled a convenience sample of 5-10 patients with acute respiratory infection (ARI) and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) between September 2016-December 2018. Staff collected nasal and throat specimens in viral transport medium and tested for influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), human meta-pneumovirus (HMPV), adenovirus (AdV) and human rhinovirus (HRV) by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Phylogenetic analysis of influenza and RSV was done. We enrolled 16,338 including 8,947 ARI and 7,391 SARI cases during the study period. Median age was 14.6 years (IQR:4-32) in ARI cases and 13 years (IQR:1.3-55) in SARI cases. We detected respiratory viruses in 33.3% (2,981) of ARI and 33.4% (2,468) of SARI cases. Multiple viruses were co-detected in 2.8% (458/16,338) specimens. Among ARI cases influenza (15.4%) were the most frequently detected viruses followed by HRV (6.2%), RSV (5%), HMPV (3.4%), PIV (3.3%) and AdV (3.1%),. Similarly among SARI cases, influenza (12.7%) were most frequently detected followed by RSV (8.2%), HRV (6.1%), PIV (4%), HMPV (2.6%) and AdV (2.1%). Our study demonstrated the feasibility of expanding influenza surveillance systems for surveillance of other respiratory viruses in India. Influenza was the most detected virus among ARI and SARI cases.

AB  - This paper examines the content and significance of Confucius and the sound of Geomungo published in the second volume of The Great East Asian Fairy Tale Series in the 1940s to confirm the possibility that the text had a relevant meaning associated with the cultural imagination of East Asia as a cultural community and recalling Trans-East Asian Memories. On the surface, the Chinese fairy tale collection is characterized as an introduction to Chinese characteristics and worldview and presents an attitude of respecting China as the origin of Japanese Confucian, Buddhist, and Taoist ideas. Second, considering that it was during the Pacific War, the author carefully selected and refined the stories so that small Japanese citizens could acquire state-centered thinking, loyalty ideas, and warrior spirit through Chinese fairy tales. Third, the author seems to have expected children to understand and “sympathize” with China by finding cultural similarities between Japan and China and placing what is known as the “uniqueness of Japan”, Mono-no-aware throughout the work.In conclusion, the Chinese fairy tale collection recalls the Trans East Asian memory that Japan embraced through cultural exchanges with China in the past and argues that a similar and differentiated Japanese culture was formed as a result in hopes that Japan and China will build a strong relationship.

AB  - This paper examined the contents and characteristics of The Japanese History of the World and Japan as the country of god published by colonial Joseon during the 15-year war period in the early 1930s, and as a result, it can be seen that Japan’s medieval worldview emerged. First, through the analysis of the contents of the two books, it was found that they wanted to find a strong logic from Medieval Japan to unite not only the Japanese residents in Joseon but also intellectuals of Joseon and to have pride as the Japanese Loyal Subject. In common, it seems the way of thinking that the state is important and the people dedicated to the state were requested. Also it is understood that the attitude of a warrior with loyalty to the king and Japan as the country of god was required to reveal the superior side of the Japanese people. The principle of “the family,” which is also the internal logic for the idea of The Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, refers to a community-style social organization including blood ties and other members, but it can be seen that patriarchal loyalty was combined to become family nationalism and the whole nation sought unification around the emperor.The above conclusions are very similar to the concepts that were discussed especially about Overcoming Modernity and The Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere in the 1940s. Thus, it can be seen that the comprehensive concepts of Overcoming Modernity and The Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere were already formed from the early 1930s.

AB  - Vegetation growth changes in urban areas are important for understanding ecosystem responses to climate change. In this study, a method for vegetation growth trend extraction in urban areas based on piecewise linear regression and seasonality removal from Landsat time series data is proposed. A case study in Tianjin, China indicated that considering seasonality in vegetation growth trend analysis had impact on the absolute values and even the signs of trends. Compared to piecewise linear regression without seasonality removal, the proposed method extracted more pixels with significantly monotonic growth trends.

M3  - Article
AB  - An optimal interpolation (OI)-based technique is utilized to generate global daily gridded wind products from Scatsat-1 data. The first guess (i.e., background) for the OI is used from the analyses of National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF) global operational model. The generated gridded products are subsequently validated using observations from global moored buoys and surface winds analyses from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), and that shows a root mean square error of similar to 1.3 m/s in wind speed and similar to 19 degrees in wind direction. Along with the gridded winds, several wind-dependent products (e.g., wind stress, wind divergence, wind stress curl, sensible and latent heat flux, etc.) are also generated. The gridded products from Scatsat-1 are available freely from Meteorological and Oceanographic Satellite Data Archival Center (www.mosdac.gov.in) since October 03, 2016.

AB  - The improvement of crops water productivity WP is becoming a necessity under increasingly scarce water resources, particularly in arid regions. This study focuses on the contribution of remote sensing in the assessment of the cereals WP in northern Tunisia. WATPRO model was used with time series of LANDSAT-8 and SENTINEL-2 images to evaluate WP over the Lebna basin in 2015-2016. Results give WP in cereals plots between 0.4 and 0.5 Kg/m3. The WP of cereals over Lebna basin was achieved by the extraction of cereals from a landcover map obtained with SVM classification of a SENTINEL-2 time-serie. Spatial analysis shows that 57% of the cereals in Lebna basin have a medium to high WP. SENTINEL- 2 give 5% more cereal areas with higher WP compared to LANDSAT-8.

AB  - Satellite-Based (SB) Remote Sensing (R/S) column values, such as Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), and surface values, such as Particulate Matter (PM), can be leveraged for better monitoring and tracking of the pattern of life for peatland fireinduced smoke, smog, and precipitation-generating cloud cover (a Potentially Toxic Triumvirate or PTT), which might initially move out over coastal waters, but subsequently return to coastal lands, peninsulas, as well as nearby islands with ensuing effects. In many cases, as noted by interviews with those involved with firefighting task forces, the tracking of the PTT stops at the border between land/sea. Traditionally, the amalgam of SB R/S and land surface values have been more readily available. However, the availability of Version 3 Maritime Aerosol Network (MAN) data and shipbased measurements of opportunity, such as via the Amazon procurable Microtops II Sunphotometer (MIIS), have made sea surface values more prevalent. Available Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and other SB R/S data can be combined with MIIS data for enhanced contextualization. Conjoined with the fact that aerosols from the peatland fires have been characterized, the Biomass Burning (BB) (e.g., peatland fire) tracer tracking of, among others, Levoglucosan (LG) in PM2.5 and PM1 presents an opportunity for both Post-fire Evaluation and Pre-fire Planning. Yet, a core challenge centers upon the issue that while SB R/S estimation of PM2.5 has become quite pervasive, the estimation of PM1 requires more care, such as by way of a more robust AOD-PM characterization. Contributory to this goal is AOD normalization, such as by considering Planet Boundary Layer Height (PBLH). Traditionally, this can be derived using a Wavelet Covariance Transform (WCT) (e.g., Haar) for boundary detection in the scattering ratio, and the main contribution of this paper is that of a more robust implementation of the WCT by way of an Optimal Convex Relaxation (OCR)-based approach. The ensuing enhanced AOD-PM characterization, improved AOD normalization, enhanced tracking, and more reliable contextualization might be of value-added proposition for better understanding the impact of peatland fires and improving Postfire Evaluation and Pre-fire Planning.

TI  - Aerosol Characteristics and Their Impact on the Himalayan Energy Budget
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The extensive work on the increasing burden of aerosols and resultant climate implications shows a matter of great concern. In this study, we investigate the aerosol optical depth (AOD) variations in the Indian Himalayan Region (IHR) between its plains and alpine regions and the corresponding consequences on the energy balance on the Himalayan glaciers. For this purpose, AOD data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS, MOD-L3), Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET), India, and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) were analyzed. Aerosol radiative forcing (ARF) was assessed using the atmospheric radiation transfer model (RTM) integrated into AERONET inversion code based on the Discrete Ordinate Radiative Transfer (DISORT) module. Further, air mass trajectory over the entire IHR was analyzed using a hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model. We estimated that between 2001 and 2015, the monthly average ARF at the surface (ARFSFC), top of the atmosphere (ARFTOA), and atmosphere (ARFATM) were -89.6 +/- 18.6 Wm(-2), -25.2 +/- 6.8 Wm(-2), and +64.4 +/- 16.5 Wm(-2), respectively. We observed that during dust aerosol transport days, the ARFSFC and TOA changed by -112.2 and -40.7 Wm(-2), respectively, compared with low aerosol loading days, thereby accounting for the decrease in the solar radiation by 207% reaching the surface. This substantial decrease in the solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface increases the heating rate in the atmosphere by 3.1-fold, thereby acting as an additional forcing factor for accelerated melting of the snow and glacier resources of the IHR.

AB  - Previous studies have identified and examined the elevated aerosol layers (EAL) using LiDAR measurements from CALIPSO or MPLNET. Here we identify the EALs and their properties using ground-based aerosol measurements in Mukteshwar, a remote site in the Himalayan Mountains in northern India, from 2006-2013 (March-August only). EAL events are screened from the 8-year measurements by considering the ratio of PM10 to PM2.5 equal to or greater than two. BC increases by two to threefold and shows a good association with the PM concentration during the EAL events. The presence of strongly absorbing and scattering aerosol in EAL can be seen by their varying range of 10-50 Mm-1 and 50-350 Mm-1, respectively. CALIPSO, MPLNET, Dust Aerosol Optical Thickness, and NASA'S Worldview Earthdata are used to verify the EAL events identified from the ground-based aerosol measurements. The back-trajectory analysis clearly shows an influx of airmass from Arabia's arid regions and the west Arabian sea.

Due to the low resolution and the overflow characteristics of NTL data, it is difficult to extract urban built-up areas in small cities with undeveloped economy and small areas. How to extract them accurately becomes an important problem. Based on normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), and normalized land surface temperature (NLST), we proposed an improved night light index, named vegetation, building, and LST-adjusted NTL urban index (VBTANUI) to accurately extract built-up areas in small cities by the marker-based watershed segmentation algorithm. Taking Jiayuguan, Ezhou, and Wuzhishan, China, as three examples, we extracted their urban built-up areas. Compared with the four traditional NTL indexes, such as vegetation-adjusted NTL urban index (VANUI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI)-adjusted NTL index (EANI), NDBI by bands 6 and 5 of Landsat 8 (BANUI65), and NDBI by bands 4 and 3 of Landsat 8 (BANUI43), the results showed that: 1) the VBTANUI could effectively enhance the light intensity of the built-up boundaries; 2) F1 scores of VBTANUI in three cities are of 89.60%, 95.70%, and 82.75%, respectively, which are 6.04%, 7.12%, 8.10%, and 8.47% higher in average than that of the traditional four indexes; and 3) VBTANUI is feasible and effective in the extraction of built-up areas in small cities with undeveloped economy and small areas.

TI  - Biomass estimation of crops and natural shrubs by combining red-edge ratio with normalized difference vegetation index
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Biomass is a critical biophysical parameter used to monitor agricultural and terrestrial ecosystems. Operational difficulties in measuring biomass on the field scale led to use of remote sensing techniques. Numerous vegetation indices (VIs) have been developed for this purpose, most of which utilize bands in the VIS-NIR spectral region. However, a significant number of them exhibit saturation at leaf area index (LAI) higher than 2. We propose an innovative vegetation index red-edge ratio normalized difference vegetation index (RERNDVI), that combines a VI sensitive to moderate to high LAI with VI sensitive to low to moderate LAI. An empirical assessment of the performance of our new index compared with nine existing spectral indices was conducted using hyperspectral and biomass data collected by Center for Advanced Land Management Information Technologies for maize and soybean fields, and Sentinel-2 data for semi-arid shrubland sites for which biomass was estimated based on the allometric model. The coefficient of determination (r(2)) of RERNDVI with green biomass for maize and soybean is high, but equally important, its noise equivalence is significantly lower than that obtained for all other indices for the full range of biomass levels. Nevertheless, RERNDVI-biomass relationships vary for different crops and shrubs, suggesting that generalizing these relationships will require information regarding canopy structure parameters as well.

AB  - Monitoring biomass changes in the Mediterranean ecosystems is important for better understanding their responses to climatic and anthropogenic changes. Multi-frequency SAR data (L-band PASLAR and C-band Sentinel-1) is investigated for developing a biomass estimation model along a climatic gradient in Israel. First, the relationships between biomass and transmissivity at various frequencies are discussed. Multi-frequency polarimetric radar vegetation index (MPRVI) is then proposed utilizing the ensemble average of degree of polarization and cross-polarized backscattering coefficients. After randomly partitioning the data for training set and testing set, the new MPRVI-based biomass model is evaluated. It shows a good agreement with reference biomass data with an r-square of 0.899 and a root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of 0.381 kg/m(2) and with a relative RMSE (RRMSE) of 10.8%.

AB  - This study aims to examine the operation pattern of Natural Elements and the worldview in the <Thunderstorm> through comparison with <Elm Tree>. First, both works started with lines that the characters sense nature, and the lines are repeatedly presented. But that the sense of nature is different, Focusing these surface differences in nature utilization patterns were analyzed.Next, the fundamental differences in the natural elements between the two works were discussed using the surface differences captured above as a clue. This is that the nature of <Thunderstorm> is expressed in time, whereas the nature of <Elm Tree> is expressed in space. From this, if the world of <Elm Tree> is an opposing world in which the world of the father and the world of the mother coexist and compete for power, the world constructed in <Thunderstorm> is an opposing world in which the wild world infiltrating the father's world competes for power.Lastly, the cultural background that influenced the worldview of the two works was discussed. In <Thunderstorm>, which was constructed by temporalizing nature, the sense of the times in which the patriarchal feudal system fell and the old and new generations were replaced. Whereas the sense of the times when the Puritan ethics met and changed with the western pioneering era worked in <Elm Tree>, which was built by spatializing nature.

AB  - The Maghreb( ) is a region called Al-Maghrib in Arabic. On the narrow side it includes countries such as Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia, and on the broad side it embraces countries such as Libya, Mauritania and Western Sahara. Although the Al-Maghrib region seems to have many historical, religious and cultural homogeneity, if you look inside you can see that there is a cultural gap due to the diverse ethnic organization. The main ethnic group living in the al-Maghrib region are the Berbers. They are living with their own identity and their own language and culture, even though they contain cross-cultural and mixed languages in their inner life due to invasion and colonial rule of foreign peoples. We can get a glimpse of their spirit, values and worldview by analyzing and researching the local Christian culture, Islam and indigenous religions.Recently there seems to be no concern that the culture of these regions will change easily. However COVID-19 is expected to have some impact on the Al-Maghrib region either negatively or positively. Therefore it is necessary to change the mission plan accordingly. This thesis intends to consider the meaning of the Al-Maghrib region and the mission plans of the Berbers, Berbers and Islam and Al-Maghrib in North Africa.Those who want to do missionary work in the time of COVID-19 should see it as a period of training for the church and missionary for the post-corona era, and have to face various changes  and  unpredictable  scenarios  by  randomly  changing different technologies. To this end it is necessary to implement the methods that the missionary should carry out with a more specific method. Mission is one of God’s almighty acts and it is the work of the Holy Spirit who makes this work and brings results. I hope that Maghrip missions in this post-corona era will have the powerful presence and guidance of the Holy Spirit. I also hope to renew the land of Maghrip by being connected with the community life of the church.

AB  - This study proposed a paddy rice mapping based on handcrafted features combined with deep learning methods. In this research, the rice growth-related features were extracted from time-series SAR data provided by C-band Sentinel-1A images. Four rice features were first extracted from the rice growth curve, including Average Normalized Backscatter (ANB), Backscatter Variation Rate (BVR), Time Interval (TI) and Backscatter Difference (BD). Then, the deep learning U-Net model with four combined rice features was used to obtain the mapping distribution of paddy rice-fields. In the study, the experimental areas were composed of two important rice growth counties in central Taiwan, including Yunlin and Changhua counties. The experimental results showed that the detection accuracy of the proposed method for rice and non-rice can achieve 92.3% and 98.2%, respectively. These results demonstrate the great potential of SAR data in mapping paddy fields using the U-Net model with proposed feature inputs.

AB  - The VIIRS instruments onboard the SNPP and NOAA-20 satellites have identical spatial resolutions and the same spectral bands. Similar prelaunch tests and identical on-orbit calibration algorithms established the foundation for their consistent Earth measurements. Calibration assessment and consistency comparisons are useful to maintain their performance and measurement accuracy. Simultaneous nadir overpasses (SNO) between two satellites are commonly used for a direct calibration comparison between sensors. However, there are no SNO between SNPP and NOAA20. Hence, a reference sensor or Earth measurements are normally used to bridge the comparison. As a reference, we focus on the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) onboard the GOES-R series spacecraft and its application to the SNPP and NOAA-20 VIIRS comparison. GOES16 and GOES17 are the first two satellites of the GOES-R series and were launched on November 19, 2016 and March 12, 2018, respectively. Their operational positions are on the equator with longitudes of 75.2 degrees West over land and 137.2 degrees West over ocean, respectively. The ABI is the primary imaging instrument of these spacecrafts for the Earth's weather, oceans, and environment, with observations (every 10 minutes) that provide vast data for GEO- Low Earth orbit (LEO) and LEO-LEO comparisons utilizing it as an intermediate reference sensor. VIIRS and ABI have spectrally matched bands and can have simultaneous measurements over any selected site every day. The simultaneous measurements over the same site also have various scan angles. These features provide advantages for a VIIRS-to-ABI comparison. The spectral response function difference between instruments, sites selected, and view angles will have effects on the instrument measurements. Their impacts on the calibration comparison, including the use of double differences, will be discussed. By collecting VIIRS measurements over a large range of view angles, the view angle effect will also be investigated. The collection of an ample amount of data provides an advantage for statistical analyses and potential big data applications to sensor calibration assessments. This method can also be applied to other sensor calibration comparison and performance assessments, such as GOES16 and GOES17 ABI, and Terra and Aqua MODIS.

CL  - Berlin, GERMANY
AB  - The MODIS instruments onboard the Terra and Aqua satellites have been in operation for over 22 and 20 years, respectively. The instruments' calibration accuracy has been maintained, even with instrument degradation. Electronic crosstalk in the thermal emissive bands (TEB) is a known issue with an increasing impact on the calibration and product. The Terra MODIS photovoltaic (PV) longwave infrared (LWIR) bands crosstalk corrections have been applied in Collection 6.1 (C6.1). However, the electronic crosstalk contamination for some detectors in the mid-wave infrared (MWIR) bands and the Aqua PV LWIR bands affect the Level-1B (L1B) product's measurement accuracy and image quality. In Collection 7 (C7), crosstalk corrections for select detectors in the Terra and Aqua MWIR and Aqua PV LWIR bands are applied. The entire mission crosstalk coefficients for the select detectors and bands are derived from scheduled lunar observations and populated in the form of look-up tables (LUTs). The Aqua PV-LWIR bands exhibit similar downward crosstalk trends as the Terra PV-LWIR bands, especially in recent years. The crosstalk coefficients and their trends provide a guideline for the correction application. Earth measurement analyses before and after the correction provide contamination and correction assessments. It has been shown that the product quality is enhanced with the crosstalk correction applied in C7. For C7, the crosstalk coefficient uncertainty is derived from the fit residuals between the measured values and a linear fit over a three-year sliding window. The uncertainty propagation is modeled and applied in the total uncertainty calculation in the L1B product. The TEB electronic crosstalk LUTs have been processed over the entire Terra and Aqua MODIS missions. This paper presents the C7 crosstalk correction, as well as its assessment and uncertainty propagation algorithm to the TEB uncertainty.

AB  - Taiwan's agriculture is an important national economic industry. Ensuring food security and stabilizing the food supply are the government's primary goals. The Agriculture and Food Agency (AFA) of the Executive Yuan's Council of Agriculture has conducted agricultural and food surveys to address those issues. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images will not be affected by climatic factors, which makes them more suitable for the forecast of rice production. This research uses the spatial-temporal neural network convolutional long short-term memory network (ConvLSTM) to identify rice fields from SAR images. The results show that ConvLSTM can greatly reduce the proportion of model false positives to 51.16%, produced higher average precision of 95.70%, and F1-score of 0.9648. The ConvLSTM neural network has produced good results for rice field identification compared with state-of-the-art neural networks.

T2  - JOURNAL OF CYTOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is the standard of care for breast cancer (BC) patient staging. The axillary node status can be evaluated by frozen section (FS) or imprint cytology (IC). Despite the major disadvantages of tissue loss and freezing artifact in FS, many pathologists consider SLN IC a more difficult task requiring special expertise and prefer FS to IC. Aims: To conduct a large cohort study to evaluate the results of intraoperative SLN IC, compare them with those of FS and permanent section (PS), and determine the best method for general pathologists. Settings and Design: A very large cohort study with many pathologists engaged was designed and the diagnostic results were compared. Materials and Methods: With 12 pathologists engaged, we conducted the largest patient cohort study of SLN IC to date, including 4,327 consecutive BC patients undergoing SLN biopsy during the past 15 years. The touch imprints were stained using three different methods and evaluated. The PS was used as the gold standard for evaluation. Statistical Analysis: The false positivity, false negativity, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the IC and FS for each pathologist were evaluated and compared. Results: Our results showed an overall sensitivity of 82.7%, specificity of 99.3%, and an accuracy rate of 95.9% for SLN IC, which were comparable to those of FS. The accuracy rate did not correlate with the length of working experience and the staining method. Conclusions: Intraoperative hematoxylin and eosin (H & E)-stained IC preparation was found to be the best SLN examination method for general pathologists.

M3  - research-article
AB  - The purpose of this thesis is to reinterpret Kim Soo-young’s poem entitled “Telephone Story” as a poem expressing an active poetic attitude. In other words, this paper intends to assert that “Telephone Story” is not only a poem which introduces a fresh poetic diction, but also that it can be reinterpreted as one that effectively reveals Kim Soo-young’s poetic worldview during the 1960s. This means that the poetic historical significance of the poem can be reevaluated from a broader context.To this end, this paper first examines the process by which the poetic effect of “Telephone Story” occurs in relation to theatricality. According to the proposal of this paper, the utterances of “Telephone Story” ’s first and second stanzas can be divided into three layers in terms of ‘the angle of the actor’s gaze looking at the audience’. These are the utterances within the work, the utterances facing outside the work, and the utterances which span between the two. It is argued that the primary source of the poetic effect of “Telephone Story” is that the three layers of utterances which cross the inside and outside of the work collide and lie side by side. This three-layer division is also applied to the full composition of the 1st to 3rd stanzas beyond the utterances of 1st and 2nd stanzas.This analysis of poetic effects and composition are further tied to the interpretation of possible meanings of poetry. In other words, it is ultimately argued that the formal composition, in which the ‘noise-performance’ of the first and second stanzas showing the ‘lateness’ of the poem is followed by the third stanza making a ‘statement’ about the ‘lateness’, can be interpreted as an expression of a willful poetic attitude : “I will be making a ‘statement’ on the ‘lateness’ of poetry which cannot be the enforcement of despair itself.” if this interpretation is valid, this paper further asserts that “Telephone Story” can be evaluated as a good poem because it can be judged that it has acquired the inherent aesthetic value that the poem is able to achieve.As such, this paper attempted to perform the systematic analysis of poetic effects and composition, the interpretation of possible meanings, and value judgment with reasons.

TI  - Fusion of Multitemporal Multisensor Velocities Using Temporal Closure of Fractions of Displacements
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous glacier velocity observations, derived from spaceborne imagery, are available online, but it remains difficult to analyze them because they are measured with different temporal baselines, by various sensors. In this study, we propose a novel formulation of the temporal closure to fuse multitemporal multisensor velocity observations without prior information on the displacement behavior and the data uncertainty. We establish a system of linear equations between combinations of displacement observations and fractions of estimated displacements. The proposed approach provides a velocity time-series with a regular and optimal temporal sampling, the latter representing a compromise between the temporal resolution and the signal-to-noise ratio. The proposed approach is first evaluated on synthetic datasets and second on Sentinel-2 and Venus velocity observations over the Fox glacier in New Zealand. The results show the intra-annual variability of Fox glacier surface velocity with a reduced uncertainty and complete temporal coverage.

AB  - This paper proposes to use methods for compressing the temporal profiles of Sentinel-1 images, in order to be able to evaluate and analyze the richness of the temporal dynamics, both on a glacier and on a watershed. We propose to use unsupervised deep learning to auto-encode the temporal information in 3 dimensions, allowing to use the three descriptors as three RGB components to produce a colored composition synthesizing the information. We compare this Convolutional AutoEncoder (CAE) approach with a dimensionality reduction based on a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the temporal profiles. The two methods, CAE and PCA, are applied to a time series over the Kyagar Glacier before and after a surge event, and on an alpine watershed to compare the differences in dynamic evolution associated with different terrain classes with and without snow. On the one hand, on the glacier, the stacks of 10 images used are too short for CAE to extract more than two really significant axes. On the other hand, with longer profiles available over the alpine watershed, the CAE is interesting to improve the clustering results obtained from the decomposition.

AB  - Land use and land cover information in combination with other thematic datasets related to detailed reference spatial data in localities from an important dataset for different types of analyses in different domains. At the time being, when it comes to the strategy of the SDG, Green Deal, Destination Earth, and construction of Earth's digital twins, there is no model and database that would effectively gather information about the Earth's surface in sufficient detail and complex relations. The situation is much worse in Africa compared to Europe since there exist only scattered map layers from public sources across all Africa like Africover and CCI Land Cover 2016. Moreover, the other close option 'OpenStreetMap' with a continent-wide coverage collects data on a voluntary basis with minimal attributes. For this reason, it's prudent to provide validation and harmonisation of this data. Therefore, there was a focus on developing and optimising a new solution based on the Open Land Use (OLU) 2.0 data model. The OLU 2.0 database combined various thematic data with the most detailed reference geometry available. Thematic datasets were focused primarily on the information of land use and land cover and additionally on other themes like soil, topographic characteristics, climatic parameters, data from classification of remote sensing data, vegetation indices of field blocks, etc. and in different time periods. In this way, OLU4Africa 2.0 defined a model which can have large potential in Africa for high-end applications such as food security modelling; environment, biodiversity, and ecosystem protection; planning purposes; forest and water protection. It is worth mentioning that the OLU4Africa 2.0 application has been nominated among WSIS Prizes 2022.

TI  - Identity and Shared Humanity: Reflections on Amartya Sen's Memoir
T2  - ETHICS & INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
M3  - Review
AB  - Amartya Sen's memoir, Home in the World, is a compelling read, giving a fascinating view of the making of the mind of one of the foremost public intellectuals of our time. In reflections on the first three decades of his life-all filled with an amazing range of experiences, encounters, and intellectual explorations that span Asia, Europe, and North America-Sen weaves a comprehensive and interlocking narrative that brings together a unitary worldview where two multi-dimensional themes are juxtaposed throughout the book: the presence of the past and the convergence of the near and the far. In this essay, I highlight some of the life experiences and lessons shared in Sen's memoir grounded in his ideas of identity and shared humanity. These ideas took on a prominent place in Sen's life, in part, through his educational experience at the innovative school founded by the visionary poet Rabindranath Tagore. I draw on the views of both Sen and Tagore, as discussed in Sen's memoir. These lessons and ideas can help us in appreciating the power of knowledge, the value of education, and the allure of diversity. They can also guide us in our search for a more just world.

AB  - Deep learning methods on remote sensing data are an attractive approach in place of human observation for automating recognition of hundreds of thousands of tree species in nature. However, this approach requires a large amount of training data for each species, while actual data are scarce - only a small subset of tree species data can be acquired, notwithstanding the unknown, new species. To overcome the data scarcity challenge and to enable versatile recognition of known and unknown species, we propose a knowledge-driven transfer learning framework for tree species profiling, where a base model of multitasking graph neural network is trained on synthetic species data, which are generated from the universal botany domain knowledge and limited field measurement data. This base model is then transferred to a new multitasking graph neural network model to train on real tree data of limited availability. Our proposed species recognition framework was tested for profiling tree species by classifying a few species profile parameters and showed a significant improvement in the prediction accuracy in comparison to deep learning models trained on just real tree data.

TI  - Forest Fire Characterization Using Landsat-8 Satellite Data in Dalma Wildlife Sanctuary.
T2  - Remote sensing in earth systems sciences
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - A forest fire has caused a loss of biodiversity and forest heterogeneity and resulted in forest degradation and fragmentation. Remote sensing techniques have been widely used for locating and delineating forest fires. The present study has employed Landsat-8 satellite data during 2014-2020 for spatiotemporal analysis of forest fire in Dalma Wildlife Sanctuary (DWS). Normalized burn ratio (NBR) has been used to delineate forest fire-affected locations along with visual interpretation techniques. The results showed that an extensive area was burnt and deforested due to forest fire in DWS during 2014-2020. The burned areas due to forest fires within the notified forest boundary in DWS were 12.11km2, 25.5km2, 22.45km2, 9.11km2, 24.44km2, 10.09km2, and 1km2 during 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively, whereas burned areas outside notified boundary were 2.24km2, 4.15km2, 1.48km2, 3.29km2, 3.31km2, 1.9km2, and 0.1km2. According to visual image interpretation, the highest burned area was found in 2015 (25.5km2), whilst the least affected was found in 2020 (1km2), and fires were mainly seen in the degraded forests and open forest regions. The present study revealed that forest fire is more dominant in Asanbani, Pardih, Bhelaipahari, Gobargushi, Bamri, Andharjhor, Somadih, Koira, Tetla, Bochkamkocha, Sah, Rbera, and Jamdih locations/beats in DWS. Thereby, these forest beats need attention from forest managers to control fire-mediated forest degradation for the conservation and restoration of forests in DWS.

AB  - One of the most devastating repercussions of an earthquake is soil liquefaction. Traditional field investigation methodologies allow for the prediction of liquefaction-related damages. However, there are numerous obstacles in doing field investigations, including inaccessibility, cost, and instrument-related drawbacks. In this study, liquefaction-triggered changes in soil moisture content have been derived using geospatial techniques as a qualitative analysis. The 3rd Jan 2017 earthquake of M-w 5.7 that had hit Agartala city and its vicinity left a mark of its near Kanchabari site in the form of ground fissures. This site has been selected as the reference liquefaction site for the analysis. Pre- and post- earthquake optical satellite imageries have been used to detect changes in soil moisture using band ratios and statistical technique such as tasseled-cap transformation. The algorithms have shown an increment in soil-moisture around the liquefied site. However, a detailed field-based geotechnical investigation is a must for a quantitative analysis.

AB  - This research is aimed at analyzing surface deformation and groundwater change over the Sangrur district of Punjab, India, using a satellite remote sensing technique. To this end, ALOS-PALSAR SAR sensor data are investigated using an advanced Wavelet-based multi-temporal (WabInSAR) technique. Here we analyzed and compared the InSAR-derived surface deformation, precipitation and groundwater level data for understanding freshwater depletion in the study area. The result exhibits faster rates of land subsidence on the northwest part of the Sangrur district with a maximum of similar to 7 cm/yr. Further, the InSAR-derived deformation region shows a good correlation with the groundwater head level change. This study will provide valuable information about the potential groundwater depletion zone and the risks associated with the infrastructure damage over the region.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Conference on Space Optical Systems and Applications (ICSOS)

AB  - Australia is known to be the most arid continent on Earth. Given the link between aridity and the lack of clouds, Australia should be well-placed to have favourable conditions for space-related optical communications. There are many investigations in the literature that focus on identification of the preferred site(s) in those countries for locating satellite-to-ground optical communications infrastructure. On this matter, there are several observations about Australia that are of relevance. Firstly, the country is large and very geologically old and has been subjected over time to significant erosion. Apart from the high terrain in the SE of the continent, the country is relatively flat, which implies the selection of sites with low atmospheric scintillation may be a limiting factor. Changes in cloud cover due to climate change appears to be regional but variable on the decadal scale. Finally, much of the continental interior is inhospitable rangeland and desert with low population density and consequently little in the way of high bandwidth communications infrastructure. We reported previously on an analysis of a 40-year data set of satellite-derived cloud cover statistics to assess cloud cover change. In the present study we investigate, using the most recent decade of that data set, the ranking of six widely distributed sites across the Australian continent. Additionally, we explore multi-site selections to provide a statistically-based ranking of combinations of sites: any combination of three sites of the six sites analysed will achieve an average clear-sky probability greater than 0.90 with some combinations as high as 0.98. The large distances between sites (similar to 500 - 2000 km) supports the assumption of statistically independent cloud cover.

AB  - Remote retrieval of near-surface chlorophyll-a (Chla) concentration from small inland waters adopts two different approaches: development of local models using in situ Chla measurements in target waterbodies or application of globally trained models with no need of local in situ measurements. While the abundance and diversity of small lakes undermine the former approach, application of global models often biases estimations due to uncertainties of atmospheric correction. Here, we introduce a regional approach wherein local in situ data from select waterbodies is used to retrieve Chla in nearby lakes. We trained semi-empirical (SE) and machine-learning (ML) algorithms, namely 2band, LMDN, and SVR, over four ice-free seasons (2017-2020) using 193 pairs of near-surface Chla in Buffalo Pound Lake, Canada, and near-coincident satellite-derived remote-sensing reflectance from Sentinel-2. Ability of locally trained models and a globally trained mixture density network (MDN) to retrieve Chla for unseen data (N = 50) was evaluated for six other catchment lakes. Regional approaches based on locally trained ML models (SVR, LMDN) unbiasedly estimated Chla in test sites (overall error approximate to 60%) and outperformed locally trained SE models and globally trained ML models (reduced error by 20%, bias by 50%). These findings suggest that ML-based regional models are capable of expanding regional Chla retrieval from optically-similar waterbodies.

AB  - The Split-Window (SW) algorithm has been developed in order to retrieve Land Surface Temperatures (LST) from Thermal InfraRed (TIR) remote sensing data. In this paper, a study has been carried out using MODTRAN 4.0 radiative transfer code simulations using the TIR channels of the Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and The Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) onboard the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Satellites to obtain numerical coefficients of the proposed algorithms. Results from validation, using the standard atmospheric simulation for various situations and the ground truth data sets demonstrate the applicability of the algorithm. A detailed analysis of the estimated total error in LSTSW,. Total(Ts), shows that the algorithms are able to estimate accurate LST with mean value of about 1.31 K, a minimum of 1.25 K and a maximum of 1.38 K (with an amplitude of 0.13 K), a standard deviation of about 0.04 K and a root mean square error (rmse) of about 1.31 K.

TI  - An interpretable deep forest model for estimating hourly PM<sub>10</sub> concentration in China using Himawari-8 data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization and industrialization in China had led to increased pollutants emission. PM10 is one of the main components of air pollutants, which significantly impacts human health, environment, and regional or global climate. In this study, a new machine learning deep forest (DF) model was used to construct the aerosol optical depth (AOD) and near-ground PM10 concentration (AOD-PM10) model. The DF model combines the advantages of deep neural networks and tree models, which can provide model interpretability. Combined with the Himawari-8 AOD, meteorological, and auxiliary factors, the hourly PM10 concentration in China (spatial resolution: 0.05 x 0.05) was obtained. The results show that AOD has the highest contribution to the importance of features in the AOD-PM10 model, accounting for approximately 13.5%, and the contributions of boundary layer height, temperature, and relative humidity to the importance of features were 11%, 8.6%, and 7%, respectively. A 10-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate the performance of the model. The hourly cross validation results from 09:00 to 16:00 (Beijing time) show that the R-2 range was 0.82-0.88, and the root mean square error and absolute mean error were 18.55-23.12 mu g/m(3) and 11.54-16.82 mu g/m(3), respectively. The R-2 values of daily, monthly, seasonal, and annual average PM10 estimated by the model were 0.87, 0.91, 0.94, and 0.94, respectively. The areas with high PM10 concentrations are mainly in northern China, especially in the North China Plain, and the peak value of daily average PM10 can reach 91 mu g/m(3); the Intraday variation of PM10 in southern China ranges from 67 mu g/m(3) to 72 mu g/m(3). A large-scale dust weather process was analyzed. Based on the AOD-PM10 model, the contribution of long-range transport dust to PM10 in China and Northern China were 25.6% and 38.1%, respectively. The PM10 measured by the station and estimated by the DF model indicated good consistency.

TI  - Method of Water Body Information Extraction in Complex Geographical Environment from Remote Sensing Images
T2  - SENSORS AND MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - The water body on the earth's surface is an important element of the environmental ecosystem. Floating matter, suspended matter, and dissolved matter negatively affect most traditional methods used to extract water body information from remotely sensed images. As a result, extracting water body information with high precision from a wide range from remote sensing images that contain complex ground-based objects has proved difficult. In this study, we proposed a method of extracting water body information from a remote sensing image that considers the wetness of ground-based objects, and we carried out threshold value selection using the Otsu method and post-processing supported by mathematical morphology. Hangzhou Bay, which is rich in inland water resources and marine resources, was selected as the study area. The results obtained from a Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) image show that the contours and spatial extent of the water extracted by the method arc highly consistent, with reduced effects of floating matter, suspended matter, and dissolved matter; the producer's accuracy and user's accuracy are 0.9706 and 0.9572, respectively. Overall, the proposed method can provide technical support for the accurate extraction of water body information, which is of great significance for the scientific management of water resources.

TI  - LAND SUBSIDENCE CHARACTERISTICS OF CPEC AS REVEALED BY SBAS-INSAR - A CASE OF GWADAR PORT PAKISTAN
T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is located in one of the geological disaster zones, the occurrence of potential geological disasters poses a great threat to the environment in this area. The dynamic variations of the urbanization in CPEC poses potential risks to the local people. Thus, the present work takes Gwadar Port as an example to study land subsidence characteristic of port city in CPEC. In this study, A Small Baseline Subset InSAR (SBAS-InSAR) strategy was used to process Sentinel 1A SAR datasets (including ascending and descending orbits) acquired from 2017 to 2018 to investigate land subsidence in Gwadar Port. The intercomparison between ascending and descending InSAR results are in good agreement, which indicates that SBAS-InSAR is reliable in detecting land subsidence in this area. The InSAR measurements show that land subsidence rate ranges from -34 mm/year to 12 mm/year. 3D settlement result of region D reveals that there are several subsidence funnels in this area, and the area with settlement over - 15mm / year reaches 0.52 km2. Combined with optical remote sensing images, it is found that the area with serious subsidence is concentrated in the reclamation area. Our monitoring results will help to strengthen disaster prevention in CPEC.

AB  - As Remote Sensing technologies undergoes accelerated evolution, excessive amount of satellite imagery collected by both active and passive sensors becomes accessible, from which the observation and assessment of the Earth's environment are predominantly advantaged. This paper proposes an automated twostage framework, employing differencing, clustering and thresholding techniques on images captured by Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) for change detection, and Deep Neural Network (DNN) for scene classification on optical imagery. With target region's location and a timespan as input, the recommended scheme is capable of delivering geographical description about the potential changes occurred within the area and given interval, as well as a semantic understanding about the region's context. Experimental results and quantitative assessment on three real datasets are incorporated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed work, while its deficiencies and future research potentials are deliberately discussed as well.

AB  - Aerosol is one of the important factors leading to atmospheric pollution, but there are still relatively few studies on the variation of AOD at high resolution, which brings some influence on the study of the variation of small-scale aerosol such as cities. Based on Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) data, aerosol inversion is carried out by using structure function method and 6SV model, and the AOD inversion results with 500m resolution in Beijing urban area are obtained. The results show that the pixel interval has an obvious impact on aerosol inversion. Using the structure function method and the distance value of 15, the AOD accuracy of B07 band is the best, but the accuracy of other bands is poor, so the more data need to be collected later to improve and verify the algorithm.

Spatiotemporal fusion is a flexible method that combines two types of satellite images with high temporal resolution or high spatial resolution to generate high-quality remote sensing images. In recent years, many spatiotemporal fusion algorithms have been proposed, and deep learning-based methods show extraordinary talents in this field. However, the current deep learning-based methods have three problems: 1) most algorithms do not support models with large-scale learnable parameters; 2) the model structure based on convolutional neural networks will bring the noise to the image fusion process; and 3) current deep learning-based methods ignore some excellent modules in traditional spatiotemporal fusion algorithms. For the above problems and challenges, this article creatively proposes a new algorithm based on the Swin transformer and the linear spectral mixing theory. The algorithm makes full use of the advantages of the Swin transformer in feature extraction and integrates the unmixing theories into the model based on the self-attention mechanism, which greatly improves the quality of generated images. In the experimental part, the proposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art results on three well-known public datasets and has been proven effective and reasonable in ablation studies.

TI  - A Superpixel-Guided Unsupervised Fast Semantic Segmentation Method of Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Semantic segmentation is one of the fundamental tasks of pixel-level remote sensing image analysis. Currently, most high-performance semantic segmentation methods are trained in a supervised learning manner. These methods require a large number of image labels as support, but manual annotations are difficult to obtain. To address the problem, we propose an efficient unsupervised remote sensing image segmentation method based on superpixel segmentation and fully convolutional networks (FCNs) in this letter. Our method can achieve pixel-level images segmentation of various scales rapidly without any manual labels or prior knowledge. We use the superpixel segmentation results as synthetic ground truth to guide the gradient descent direction during FCN training. In experiments, our method achieved high performance compared with current unsupervised image segmentation methods on three public datasets. Specifically, our method achieves an adjusted mutual information (AMI) score of 0.2955 on the Gaofen Image Dataset (GID), while processing each image of size 7200 x 6800 pixels in just 30 s.

AB  - Glacier lake is one important component of the ecosystem of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau. The changes of glacier lakes are extremely sensitive to climate and environmental changes, and also closely related to water resources changes and geological disasters. In this study, the typical area of glacial lakes development in Qinghai Tibet Plateau was selected. To extract glacier lakes in this area, a machine-learning based method (MLB) was proposed with Landsat-8 and NASADEM dataset. Considering the spectral features and topographic features, a total of 14 parameters were taken as the inputs of the proposed MLB. Compared with the threshold segmentation method (TS), the MLB performed superior. The kappa coefficient (KC) and overall accuracy (OA) of the MLB method are 0.8602 and 99.49, respectively. While, those values of TS are 0.6123 and 98.88, respectively. The TS may fail under certain conditions, especially in the cloud shadow. The results reveals that the accuracy of glacial lake extraction in the high-altitude area may be improved with the MLB. There is a potential for automated glacial lake mapping with the MLB in rugged mountain areas at a large scale.

TI  - A random forest method for constructing long-term time series of nighttime light in Central Asia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The nighttime light (NTL) data from Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) and Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership Satellite's Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP-VIIRS) have been extensively used to characterize spatiotemporal variations of human activities on the ground. However, inconsistency of these two datasets hampers their applications for long-term analysis. Hence, the current paper managed to introduce the Random Forest model (RF) for constructing a long-term time series of NTL with considering topographical and climatic influences. Performance of the RF was compared with that of several common curve estimation methods, namely linear regression, quadratic regression, cubic regression, logistic regression and Biphasic Dose Response (BDR) model based on two datasets in overlapping years of 2012 and 2013. Relative importances of natural factors were quantified with the initial RF model with all variables inputted into, and four typical RF models with relatively better performance were screened on this basis. The results showed that VIIRS data, latitude and longitude, elevation and precipitation were inputted into RF models in turn and their simulation accuracies gradually increased. According to accuracy indicators, RF models with topographical and climatic factors as input variables were far superior to the BDR which performed better than other curve estimation methods. In particular, the RF model with VIIRS data, latitude and longitude as input variables had higher simulation accuracy and less computation amounts was recommended as the best-fit RF model for the inter-calibration of NTL data in Central Asia. Afterwards, two continuous time series of NTL from 1992 to 2018 generated respectively with the best-fit RF and BDR were compared and results indicated that calibrated data with the RF were more consistent with DMSP-OLS data and Landsat 8 satellite images. Besides, the scope and brightness of NTL with RF had a significant positive correlation with log-transformed socioeconomic factors, confirming the availability of RF. The current paper offers a new thought to settle inconsistency of NTL data from two sensors with considering influences of natural factors, which is expected to help understand and explore complex interactions between natural environment and human activities in the arid Central Asia.

TI  - Landscape Characteristics and Evolution of Traditional Chestnut Cultivation System in Kuancheng, Hebei Province
T2  - Journal of Ecology and Rural Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - Chestnut (Castanea mollissima) cultivation has a long history in Kuancheng Manchu Autonomous County, Hebei Province. In 2014, the traditional chestnut cultivation system in Kuancheng was selected as an important agricultural cultural heritage in China. Agricultural heritage landscape is a significant component of agricultural heritage. The study of landscape characteristics and evolution contributes to deeply understanding the characteristics and changes of landscape patterns and promotes systematic protection, inheritance, and development. Based on Landsat and MODIS satellite remote sensing data and field investigation, this paper studied the landscape distribution, structure, and evolution characteristics of traditional Chinese chestnut culture system heritage site in Kuancheng. The results show that: (1) there were mainly six types of landscape in the heritage area: chestnut forest, deciduous forest, evergreen forest, farmland, construction land, and water area. The forest coverage rate was up to 84.72%, and the chestnut forest was the second most dominant land. scape type after the deciduous forest, with an area of 151.60 km(2)( 27.70%). (2) The heritage system formed a spatial structure of mountain landscape from the top of the mountain to the valley, which was " forest-chestnut forest-farmland-village-water area", and formed a landscape of flat and sloping chestnut forest, as well as a composite intercropping landscape with crops, fungi, poultry, and medicinal materials. (3) The overall landscape distribution of the heritage site is fragmented, while the local connectivity within each landscape type is sufficient; (4) Since 2000, the forest coverage of the heritage area has been expanding at a rate of 8.8 km(2) center dot a(-1), and the chestnut forest contributed 83.28% to the increase of forest area, and helped to improve the regional vegetation greenness. The traditional Chinese chestnut cultivation system in Kuancheng, Hebei province has crucial economic, cultural and ecological values. With the policy support of Kuancheng government, the landscape dominance of chestnut forest is constantly improving.

TI  - Cropland Change Detection With Harmonic Function and Generative Adversarial Network
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Time-series image change detection is one of the most challenging tasks to remote sensing society. Due to complex phenological patterns of cropland, it is difficult to design an efficient strategy for cropland change detection. In this work, an integrated framework is proposed to perform change detection with a limited number of training samples. There are two improvements in this proposed cropland change detection method: 1) the harmonic function is utilized to fill the missing data within a time-series image stack by considering phenological patterns of cropland and 2) the CropGAN was developed to generate realistic samples for training data set enrichment. Compared to the traditional change detection methods, the proposed strategy able to detect different kinds of cropland changes even with few number of samples. Experiments on a Landsat time-series image stack demonstrated that the proposed CropGAN can significantly improve change detection accuracies, given a limited number of labeled samples.

TI  - Estimation of Daily All-Wave Surface Net Radiation With Multispectral and Multitemporal Observations From GOES-16 ABI
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As a vital parameter describing the Earth surface energy budget, surface all-wave net radiation (R-n) drives many physical and biological processes. Remote estimation of R-n using satellite data is an effective approach to monitor the spatial and temporal dynamics of R-n. Accurate daily R-n estimation typically depends on the spatio-temporal resolutions of satellite data. There are currently few high-spatial-resolution daily R-n products from polar-orbiting satellite data, and they exhibit limited accuracy due to sparse diurnal observations. In addition, traditional estimation approaches typically require cloud mask and clear-sky albedo as inputs and ignore the length ratio of daytime (LRD), which may lead to large errors. To overcome these challenges and obtain R-n data with improved spatial resolution and accuracy, an operational approach was proposed in this study to derive daily 1-km R-n, which takes the advantages from a radiative transfer model, a machine learning algorithm, and multispectral and dense diurnal temporal information of geostationary satellite observations. An improved all-sky hybrid model (AHM) coupling radiative transfer simulations with a random forest (RF) model was first developed to estimate the shortwave net radiation (R-ns). Then, another RF model was developed to estimate the daily R-n from R-ns, incorporating the LRD, which is called extended hybrid model (EHM). Data from the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) onboard the new-generation Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES)-16 with a 5-min temporal resolution and a 1-km spatial resolution were used to test the proposed method. Compared to traditional lookup table (LUT) algorithms, the results show that AHM not only makes the process of Rns estimation simple and efficient but also has high accuracy in estimating instantaneous all-sky R-ns. Benefiting from high spatio-temporal resolutions, our daily R-ns estimates using GOSE-16 data exhibited superior performance compared to using the 1-km Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and 1 degrees Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) product. Using accurate daily R-ns estimates and LRD as inputs, the EHM model shows reasonably good results for estimating R-n (R-2, RMSE, and bias of 0.91, 20.95 W/m(2), and -0.05 W/m(2), respectively). Maps of 1-km R-ns and R-n exhibit similar spatial patterns to those from the 1 degrees CERES product, but with substantially more spatial details. Overall, the proposed R-n retrieval scheme can accurately estimate all-sky 1-km R-ns and R-n at mid- to low-latitudes and can be easily adapted and applied to other GOES-16-like satellites, such as Himawari-8, Meteosat Third Generation (MTG), and Fenyun-4. This study demonstrates the advantages of estimating R-n using geostationary satellites with improved accuracy and resolutions.

TI  - Incremental Detection of Remote Sensing Objects With Feature Pyramid and Knowledge Distillation
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - When a detection model that has been well-trained on a set of classes faces new classes, incremental learning is always necessary to adapt the model to detect the new classes. In most scenarios, it is required to preserve the learned knowledge of the old classes during incremental learning rather than reusing the training data from the old classes. Since the objects in remote sensing images often appear in various sizes, arbitrary directions, and dense distribution, it further makes incremental learning-based object detection more difficult. In this article, a new architecture for incremental object detection is proposed based on feature pyramid and knowledge distillation. Especially, by means of a feature pyramid network (FPN), the objects with various scales are detected in the different layers of the feature pyramid. Motivated by Learning without Forgetting (LwF), a new branch is expended in the last layer of FPN, and knowledge distillation is applied to the outputs of the old branch to maintain the old learning capability for the old classes. Multitask learning is adopted to jointly optimize the losses from two branches. Experiments on two widely used remote sensing data sets show our promising performance compared with state-of-the-art incremental object detection methods.

TI  - Overview of the performance of satellite fire products in China: Uncertainties and challenges
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite fire observations provide an essential constraint for the estimation of global biomass burning emissions. In this study, we present a comprehensive insight into the performance of the common satellite fire products in eastern China. Despite consistent spatial patterns, both polar-orbiting and geostationary satellite observations have large omission errors for the agricultural burning fires. Owing to a coarse resolution of 2 km, approximately 90% of the concurrent 375 m Visible infrared Imaging Radiometer (VIIRS) fires are not detected in Himawari-8 products. Nevertheless, the total amount of daily Himawari-8 fires is much higher than those of VIIRS and 1 km Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS). The peak time of diurnal fire counts in eastern China has obvious seasonal variations, some of which are missed by polar-orbiting satellite detection. Validation by 3 m PlanetScope images shows that VIIRS and MODIS have a very high accuracy in detecting crop straw burning fires. However, Himawari-8 fires have obvious false alarms due largely to their algorithm defects. Also, the coarse resolution of Himawari-8 tends to make fire detection more likely to be obscured by dense smoke. The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) supervisions reveal prevalent small agricultural fires (< 0.5 x 10(4) m(2)) in the extensive croplands that are not detected in the common satellite fires. As control measures get more stringent, spatial-temporal patterns as well as the scales of biomass burning activities in China have undergone dramatic changes. Considering the crucial role of satellite fires in estimating biomass burning emissions, it is necessary to improve satellite fire detection with more advanced observations and retrieval methods.

TI  - Using Triple Collocation Observations to Estimate Satellite Measurement Noise
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowing how much measurement noise is in a signal is critical for evaluating the overall performance of a satellite observation. We developed a triple collocation observation (TCO) algorithm for estimating measurement noise by collocation comparing the local deviations of three satellite data sets. When we evaluated our algorithm with a synthetic data set, the results showed that the algorithm effectively derived measurement noise from satellite signals despite the many intermission signal differences among the satellites. The TCO algorithm produced x003C;6.66x0025; uncertainty in the measurement noise estimates that we derived from the synthetic data set. In addition, to maximally isolate measurement noise from ocean color images, we developed a set of data quality control criteria to apply when identifying synchronous pixel pairs. Using images from the Medium Resolution Spectral Imager II (MERSI II), the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments, we applied our data quality control criteria and found that the TCO algorithm produced measurement noise consistent with the measured prelaunch or specifications for VIIRS and MERSI II instrument noise. However, the TCO measurement noise was significantly lower than the spaced MODIS noise because MODISx2019;s extended service time likely produced instrument degradation. Overall, MODIS performed better than MERSI II but worse than VIIRS. Furthermore, we found that the residual error in remote sensing reflectance exponentially decreased as the measurement signal-to-noise ratio (MSNR) increased. Because of this exponential relationship, the MSNR should not be lower than 181 to achieve the x003C;5x0025; uncertainty goal of remote sensing reflectance at 443 nm that NASA proposed. Our results suggest that the TCO algorithm is an effective approach for comprehensively estimating and comparing instrument performance.

TI  - A Remapping Technique of FY-3D MWRI Based on a Convolutional Neural Network for the Reduction of Representativeness Error
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The assimilation of spaceborne passive microwave measurements often suffers from representativeness errors due to the mismatch between the observation footprints and numerical weather prediction (NWP) model grids. In this article, a new brightness temperature remapping technique based on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed to reduce the representativeness error in FengYun-3D (FY-3D) microwave radiation imager (MWRI) observation data assimilation. The remapping technique uses an adapted dataset construction method in which the training data consist of synthetic NWP-model-grid-based MWRI brightness temperature (T-B) images and synthetic MWRI-observed antenna temperature (T-A) images. The synthetic T-A and T-B, which are generated through radiative transfer for TOVS (RTTOV) model and MWRI degradation model, make the network learn the spatial remapping relationship between observation and background T-B in data assimilation. In addition, land-sea mask information is input into the CNN to help the network better analyze the coastline area data. The CNN-based remapped MWRI observation data are evaluated through observation minus background (OMB) diagnosis with the Global/Regional Assimilation and PrEdiction System (GRAPES) four-dimensional variational (4D-Var) system. The experimental results illustrate that the bias and standard deviation of OMB with the CNN-based remapped MWRI observation are quantitatively reduced compared with the raw measurements in GRAPES 4D-Var.

The accuracy of the fusion data was assessed using Argo in-situ measurements. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the fusion SST data (a temporal resolution of 12 h) ranged from 0.49 degrees C to 0.62 degrees C. The fusion SST data was more accurate than the AVHRR OISST data. There was no significant difference between the fusion SST data and RSS MW-IR SST data. This fusion SST data has high spatial coverage, with high temporal resolution and high precision.

TI  - Geospatial Transformer Is What You Need for Aircraft Detection in SAR Imagery
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although deep learning techniques have achieved noticeable success in aircraft detection, the scale heterogeneity, position difference, complex background interference, and speckle noise keep aircraft detection in large-scale synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images challenging. To solve these problems, we propose the geospatial transformer framework and implement it as a three-step target detection neural network, namely, the image decomposition, the multiscale geospatial contextual attention network (MGCAN), and result recomposition. First, the given large-scale SAR image is decomposed into slices via sliding windows according to the image characteristics of the aircraft. Second, slices are input into the MGCAN network for feature extraction, and the cluster distance nonmaximum suppression (CD-NMS) is utilized to determine the bounding boxes of aircraft. Finally, the detection results are produced via recomposition. Two innovative geospatial attention modules are proposed within MGCAN, namely, the efficient pyramid convolution attention fusion (EPCAF) module and the parallel residual spatial attention (PRSA) module, to extract multiscale features of the aircraft and suppress background noise. In the experiment, four large-scale SAR images with 1-m resolution from the Gaofen-3 system are tested, which are not included in the dataset. The results indicate that the detection performance of our geospatial transformer is better than Faster R-CNN, SSD, Efficientdet-D0, and YOLOV5s. The geospatial transformer integrates deep learning with SAR target characteristics to fully capture the multiscale contextual information and geospatial information of aircraft, effectively reduces complex background interference, and tackles the position difference of targets. It greatly improves the detection performance of aircraft and offers an effective approach to merge SAR domain knowledge with deep learning techniques.

AB  - Soil moisture content (SMC) is a significant factor affecting crop growth and development. However, SMC estimation based on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) will be influenced by a variety of surface parameters, such as vegetation cover and surface roughness, which are usually difficult to measure. In order to retrieve the SMC across agricultural areas (such as wheat fields) without ground measurement. In this study, a model-based polarization decomposition method was used to decompose the original SAR signal into different scattering components representing different scattering mechanisms. Then different volume scattering models were used and compared to remove the scattering contribution from vegetation canopy, so as to extract the surface scattering component related to the soil moisture. Finally, combined with the extensively used surface scattering model (CIEM) and the method of roughness parameters optimization, the look-up table method was used to estimate the soil moisture during wheat growth period. The achieved R-2 and RMSE of the SWC are 0.534, 5.62 vol. %, which indicates that this approach has a good estimation performance on the soil moisture under wheat during its growing period.

TI  - On-Orbit Real-Time Variational Image Destriping: FPGA Architecture and Implementation
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On-orbit real-time image processing is of increasing demands due to requirements for quick-response missions. Image destriping is usually an important pre-processing step to improve image quality in practice. The unidirectional variational models have shown impressive destriping performance. However, they are not easy for real-time implementation for high-computation complexity and there are few attempts for hardware implementation. This article is the first hardware implementation of variational image destriping algorithm, which achieves high throughput for large-swath remote-sensing images. In this article, a fully pipelined hardware architecture is proposed. First, the involved iteration loop is unrolled and a coarse-grained parallelism is obtained. Second, for each deployed iteration computation blocks (ICBs), a dedicated timing arrangement is designed to alleviate the bottleneck caused by the data dependency within each ICB, obtaining a fine-grained parallelism. Moreover, to further optimize the critical path, an approximate simplification scheme is proposed, saving the resource usage and reducing computing delay. The proposed architecture is implemented and verified on a XILINX 6vcx240t field programmable gate array (FPGA); it achieves a maximum frame rate up to 41.9 frames/s with delay of only tens of row cycles for 8-bit 2048x2048 images. It performs all the processing on the pixels in raster scan order on-the-fly as they are being transmitted from camera payload, which significantly facilitates on-orbit real-time processing of large-swath remote-sensing images with high data rate.

TI  - A Novel Indoor Positioning Framework
T2  - CMES-COMPUTER MODELING IN ENGINEERING & SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Current positioning systems are primarily based on the Global Positioning System (GPS). Although the GPS is accurate within 10 m, it is mainly used for outdoor positioning services (Location-Based Service; LBS). However, since satellite signals cannot penetrate buildings, indoor positioning has always been a blind spot for satellite signals. As indoor positioning applications are extensive with high commercial values, they have created a competitive niche in the market. Existing indoor positioning technologies are unable to achieve less than 10 cm accuracy except for the Ultra Wide Band (UWB) technology. On the other hand, the Bluetooth protocol achieves an accuracy of 1 to 2 m. In this work, we use Bluetooth wireless signals to build a novel indoor positioning framework to avoid the high manufacturing costs involved in the UWB technology. The Bluetooth signals are combined with the results from artificial intelligence algorithms to improve accuracy. During laboratory indoor location tracking, the accuracy rate is 96%, which provides effective indoor tracking for the movement of people.

TI  - TCNIRv: Topographically Corrected Near-Infrared Reflectance of Vegetation for Tracking Gross Primary Production Over Mountainous Areas
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv) has been increasingly used as a proxy of gross primary production (GPP) across various temporal scales, ecosystems, and climate conditions. However, topography significantly distorts NIRv and GPP estimations over mountainous areas. We evaluated the topographic effects on NIRv and applied a path length correction (PLC) for improving its performance over mountainous areas. The proposed topographically corrected NIRv (referred to TCNIRv) was evaluated by multiple Landsat-8 operational land imager (MI) images with concurrent in situ GPP measurements over the Liigeren mountainous forest area. TCNIRv reduced topographic effects in the original NIRv and it was comparable to the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI), which are often deemed to be independent of topographic effects. In addition, TCNIRv better agreed with GPP than the other vegetation indices (VIs): coefficient of determination R-2 = 0.90 and root mean square error RMSE = 1.40 g.Cm-2.d(-1) for TCNIRv compared to R-2 = 0.71 and RMSE = 2.47 g.Cm-2.d(-1) for NIRv. The evaluation shows that TCNIRv is a reliable proxy of GPP, and because of its simplicity and physical soundness, it will facilitate vegetation monitoring over complex topography mountainous areas.

TI  - Spatial -temporal evolution and drivers of ecosystem service value in the Dongting Lake Eco-economic Zone, China
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid urbanization, research on the spatial -temporal evaluation and drivers deduction of ESV is important for regional social -economic -ecological coordinated and sustainable development. Based on remote sensing data of Dongting Lake Eco-economic Zone in four years ( 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2018), we investigated the spatial -temporal pattern deduction characteristics of ecosystem service value ( ESV) from a grid scale of 3 km x 3 km with the technological support of ArcGIS and GeoDa, as well as combining the equivalent factor, spatial auto -correlation and hot -spot analysis method. We further explored the dominant drivers of spatial heterogeneity of ESV and the interaction mechanisms among different drivers using geo-detector. The results showed that, during the study period, the construction land area had the most significant growth by 49.2%. Nevertheless, grassland and water area had a relatively large decrease, while the other land area did not change. The ESV decreased gradually in general during the study period. The ESV of unused land increased rapidly, while that of the other lands all showed decrease to different extents. The overall spatial layout of ESV in the study area was "high in the middle and low in the surroundings". The spatial cluster effect of ESV was significant, but the cluster effect of high and low values of ESV tended to weaken during the study period, showing a trend of gradually decreasing. The spatial heterogeneity of ESV was affected by the coupling and coordination of natural environmental factors and socio-economic factors in the study area, with largest contribution from the human active index.

TI  - Effect of the Partitioning of Diffuse and Direct APAR on GPP Estimation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of gross primary productivity (GPP) is necessary to better understand the interaction of global terrestrial ecosystems with climate change and human activities. Light use efficiency (LUE)-based GPP models are widely used for retrieving several GPP products with various temporal and spatial resolutions. However, most LUE-based models assume a clear-sky condition, and the influence of diffuse radiation on GPP estimations has not been well considered. In this paper, a diffuse and direct (DDA) absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR)-based method is proposed for better estimation of half-hourly GPP, which partitions APAR under diffuse and direct radiation conditions. Firstly, energy balance residual (EBR) FAPAR, moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) leaf area index (LAI) (MCD15A2H) and clumping index (CI) products, as well as solar radiation records supplied by FLUXNET2015 were used to calculate diffuse and direct APAR at a half-hourly scale. Then, an eddy covariance-LUE (EC-LUE) model and meteorological observations from FLUXNET2015 data sets were used for obtaining corresponding LUE values. A co-variation relationship between LUE and diffuse fraction was observed, and the LUE was higher under more diffuse radiation conditions. Finally, the DDA-based method was tested using the half-hourly FLUXNET GPP and compared with half-hourly GPP calculated using total APAR (GPP_TA). The results indicated that the half-hourly GPP estimated using the DDA-based method (GPP_DDA) was more accurate, giving higher R-2 values, lower RMSE and RMSE* values (R-2 varied from 0.565 to 0.682, RMSE ranged from 3.219 to 12.405 and RMSE* were within the range of 2.785 to 8.395) than the GPP_TA (R-2 varied from 0.558 to 0.653, RMSE ranged from 3.407 to 13.081 and RMSE* were within the range of 3.321 to 9.625) across FLUXNET sites within different vegetation types. This study explored the effects of partitioning the diffuse and direct APAR on half-hourly GPP estimations, which demonstrates a higher agreement with FLUXNET GPP than total APAR-based GPP.

TI  - A Siamese Network Based U-Net for Change Detection in High Resolution Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing image change detection (RSICD) is a technique that explores the change of surface coverage in a certain time series by studying the difference between multiple remote sensing images (RSIs) collected over the same area. Traditional RSICD algorithms exhibit poor performance on complex change detection (CD) tasks. In recent years, deep learning (DL) techniques have achieved outstanding results in the fields of RSI segmentation and target recognition. In CD research, most of the methods treat multitemporal remote sensing data as one input and directly apply DL-based image segmentation theory on it while ignoring the spatio-temporal information in these images. In this article, a new siamese neural network is designed by combing an attention mechanism (Siamese_AUNet) with UNet to solve the problems of RSICD algorithms. SiameseNet encodes the feature extraction of RSIs by two branches in the siamese network, respectively. The weights are shared between these two branches in siamese networks. Subsequently, an attention mechanism is added to the model in order to improve its detection ability for changed objects. The models are then compared with conventional neural networks using three benchmark datasets. The results show that the Siamese_AUNet newly proposed in this article exhibits better performance than other standard methods when solving problems related to weak CD and noise suppression.

TI  - Open-Pit Mine Area Mapping With Gaofen-2 Satellite Images Using U-Net
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Obtaining information on the surface coverage of open-pit mining areas (OPMAs) is of great significance to ecological governance and restoration. The current methods to map the OPMAs face problems such as low mapping accuracy due to complex landscapes. In this article, we propose a hybrid open-pit mining mapping (OPMM) framework with Gaofen-2 (GF-2) high-spatial resolution satellite images (HSRSIs), using an improved U-Net neural network (U-Net+). By concatenating the previous layers with each subsequent layer to ensure that there is a maximum of feature maps of each layer in the network, the U-Net+ can reduce the loss of feature information and make the extraction capability of the network more powerful. Two independent OPMAs were selected as the study area for the OPMM. By taking advantage of GF-2 HSRSIs, a total of 111 open-pit mine sites (OPMSs) were mapped and each OPMS boundary was validated by field surveys. Then, these OPMSs were used as input to assess the accuracy of the OPMM results obtained by the U-Net+. By comparing our results with those provided by five state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms: Fully Convolutional Network (FCN), SegNet, U-Net, Residual U-Net (ResU-Net), and U-Net++, we conclude that the proposed framework outperformed these methods by more than 0.02% in Overall Accuracy, 0.06% in Kappa Coefficient, 0.03% in Mean Intersection over union, 8.36% in producer accuracy and 4.44% in user accuracy. Therefore, the proposed framework thus exhibits very promising applicability in the ecological restoration and governance of OPMAs.

TI  - JAGAN: A Framework for Complex Land Cover Classification Using Gaofen-5 AHSI Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Owing to their powerful feature extraction capabilities, deep learning-based methods have achieved significant progress in hyperspectral remote sensing classification. However, several issues still exist in these methods, including a lack of hyperspectral datasets for specific complicated scenarios and the need to improve the classification accuracy of land cover with limited samples. Thus, to highlight and distinguish effective features, we propose a hyperspectral classification framework based on a joint channel-space attention mechanism and generative adversarial network (JAGAN). To relearn feature-based weights, a higher priority was assigned to important features, which was developed by integrating a two-joint channel-space attention model to obtain the most valuable feature via the attention weight map. Additionally, two classifiers were designed in JAGAN: sigmoid was used to determine whether the input data were real or fake samples produced by the generator, while Softmax was adopted as a land cover classifier to yield the prediction type labels of the input samples. To test the classification performance of the JAGAN model, we used a self-constructed complex land cover dataset based on GaoFen-5 ANSI images, which consists of mixed landscapes of mining and agricultural areas from the urban-rural fringe. Compared with other methods, the proposed model achieved the highest overall classification accuracy of 86.09%, the highest kappa amount of 79.41%, the highest Fl score of 85.86%, and the highest average accuracy of 8230%, indicating the JAGAN can effectively improve the classification accuracy for limited samples in complex regional environments using GF-5 AHSI images.

TI  - NIGAN: A Framework for Mountain Road Extraction Integrating Remote Sensing Road-Scene Neighborhood Probability Enhancements and Improved Conditional Generative Adversarial Network
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mountain roads are a source of important basic geographic data used in various fields. The automatic extraction of road images through high-resolution remote sensing imagery using deep learning has attracted considerable attention. But the interference of context information limited extraction accuracy, especially for roads in mountain area. Furthermore, when pursuing research in a new district, many algorithms are difficult to train due to a lack of data. To address these issues, a framework based on remote sensing road-scene neighborhood probability enhancement and improved conditional generative adversarial network (NIGAN) is proposed in this article. This framework can be divided into two sections: 1) road scenes classification section. A remote sensing road-scene neighborhood confidence enhancement method was designed for classifying road scenes of the study area to reduce the impact of nonroad information on subsequent fine-road segmentation and 2) fine-road segmentation section. An improved dilated convolution module, which is helpful in extracting small objects such as road, was added into the conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) to increase the receptive field and pay attention to global information, and segment roads from the results of road scenes classification section. To validate the NIGAN framework, new mountain road-scene and label datasets were constructed, and diverse comparison experiments were performed. The results indicate that the NIGAN framework can improve the integrity and accuracy of mountain road-scene extraction in diverse and complex conditions. The results further confirm the validity of the NIGAN framework in small samples. In addition, the mountain road-scene datasets can serve as benchmark datasets for studying mountain road extraction.

TI  - Distribution and Attribution of Gross Primary Productivity Increase Over the Mongolian Plateau, 2001-2018
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Gross primary productivity (GPP) over the Mongolian Plateau (MP) is a vital component of the global terrestrial carbon cycle. Using the latest MODIS GPP estimates at the best achievable spatial resolution along with several ancillary datasets, we investigated GPP variations in the MP region during 2001-2018 and attributed these changes to land-surface temperature (T-s), total precipitation (P-t), landcover change (LCC), and atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations. The 18-year-averaged annual cumulative GPP in the MP region was 357.02 +/- 24.76 gC m(-2) yr(-1) during the study period, ranging from 60.51 +/- 6.10 gC m(-2) yr(-1) in deserts to 596.41 +/- 35.49 gC m(-2) yr(-1) in forests. A linear regression analysis indicated a significant overall increase in GPP, at a rate of 3.91 gC m(-2) yr(-1) (p < 0.01). In comparison, GPP increased at a rate of 0.79 gC m(-2) yr(-1) in deserts (p < 0.01), 4.79 gC m(-2) yr(-1) in forests (p < 0.01), and 5.76 gC m(-2) yr(-1) in grasslands (p < 0.01). Our detailed attribution analysis indicates that GPP is positively sensitive to surface air temperature (0.15 gC degrees C-1 ) and total precipitation (0.25 gC mm(-1)) but negatively sensitive to atmospheric CO2 concentrations (-0.20 gC mol(-1)) and LCC (-0.93 gC class(-1)). Furthermore, we reported large differences in the spatial patterns and magnitudes among individual variables in the GPP attribution analysis, with LCC proving to be the dominant factor followed by CO2 fertilization effects; climatic factors had comparatively little influence on GPP variations during the study period. Although MODIS GPP does not take CO2 fertilization effect into account, the close relationship between MODIS GPP and atmospheric CO2 concentrations still pose referencing value in attributing the GPP increase in this period. Overall, the findings of this study contribute to our understanding of the responses of sensitive ecosystems to the competing effects of climate change and human disturbance at regional scales.

TI  - Monitoring Persistent Coal Fire Using Landsat Time Series Data From 1986 to 2020
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coal fires pose great threats to valuable energy resources, the ecological environment, and human safety. They are one of the most persistent fires on the Earth, which can burn for an extremely long-term period from decades to hundreds or even thousands of years. Remote sensing detection of coal fires is of significance for mitigating coal fire hazards. Nevertheless, short-term or temporal discrete land surface temperature (LST) data have limited capability in characterizing the persistent coal fire. This study proposed a methodology to monitor persistent coal fires using long-term Landsat thermal images and further to analyze spatiotemporal dynamics of coal fires. A total of 1118 high-quality Landsat images (each image containing $446\times446$ pixels) spanning 35 years from 1986 to 2020 in the Wuda coalfield area (China) were processed to retrieve the LST. LST time series of each pixel was decomposed into the seasonal, trend, and remainder components. Coal fire areas were demarcated by using the range of the trend components. To trace the trend and change point of the LST time series, the Mann & x2013;Kendall test was applied to the trend components, and the Pettitt test was employed to the original time series vectors of those pixels located in the coal fire areas, respectively. The random sample consensus algorithm was utilized to identify the background temperature (inliers) and high temperature (outliers) and, thus, judge the coal fire burning period, and the symbolic aggregate approximation algorithm was used to evaluate the robustness of the judgment. The calibration was conducted according to the filed surveys, obtaining spatiotemporal 3-D coal fire dynamics. The proposed methodology was testified by comparisons with fieldwork and regional anomaly extractor algorithm, demonstrating good performance in comprehensive monitoring of persistent coal fires.

TI  - Identification of key genes related to flowering by transcriptome of flowering and nonflowering<i> Prunella</i><i> vulgaris</i>
T2  - BIOLOGIA PLANTARUM
M3  - Article
AB  - Prunella vulgaris L. have high medicinal and ornamental values. It blooms in summer and then quickly withers, and there is no research on the regulatory mechanisms of flowering-related genes. Therefore, in this study, the flowering (leaves and spicas) and nonflowering (leaves) parts of P. vulgaris were sequenced with an Illumina HiSeq 4000, and 187 387 transcripts were obtained using Trinity software package. A total of 10 158 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found in the leaves of flowering and nonflowering P. vulgaris, with 6 294 upregulated genes and 3 864 downregulated genes. DEGs in leaves of flowering and nonflowering P. vulgaris were mainly annotated for metabolic processes (4 207) in Gene Ontology (GO) and ribosomal pathways (416) in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Screening of this set of genes yielded 50 flowering-related unigenes homologous to Arabidopsis genes involved in multiple regulatory pathways related to plant flowering, including autonomous, vernalization, gibberellin, and age pathways. In addition, there are significant differences in the expressions of genes related to flowering, such as PvFLC, PvSOC1, and PvFY, as well as genes involved in plant hormone signal transduction and sugar metabolism. The accuracy and reliability of the transcriptome results were verified by quantitative real-time RT-qPCR analysis of PvGA20OX, PvSVP, PvELF3, PvCRY1, and PvSOC1. Thus, we speculate that the flowering of P. vulgaris is regulated by certain genes related to the flowering regulation pathway and sugar and hormone metabolism pathways. Analysis of the P. vulgaris transcriptome will provide a basis for revealing its flowering mechanism.

TI  - Thick Clouds Removing From Multitemporal Landsat Images Using Spatiotemporal Neural Networks
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat images have played an important role in the field of Earth observation and geoinformatics. However, optical Landsat images are frequently contaminated by cloud cover, especially in tropical and subtropical regions, which limits the utilization of these images. To improve the utilization of Landsat images, in this study, we propose a novel spatiotemporal neural network with four modules: a cloud detection module, a spatial-temporal learning module, a spatial-temporal feature fusion module, and a reconstruction module. The results of the experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is quantitatively effective (root mean square error < 0.0179) and can achieve a better result for reconstructing Landsat images than some of the widely used existing deep learning methods and multitemporal methods. The proposed neural network method provides an effective tool for the removal of contiguous, thick clouds from satellite images, so as to improve the quality of subsequent remote sensing mapping and geoinformation extraction.

TI  - Improving Leaf Area Index Retrieval Using Multi-Sensor Images and Stacking Learning in Subtropical Forests of China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The leaf area index (LAI) is a key indicator of the status of forest ecosystems that is important for understanding global carbon and water cycles as well as terrestrial surface energy balances and the impacts of climate change. Machine learning (ML) methods offer promising ways of generating spatially explicit LAI data covering large regions based on optical images. However, there have been few efforts to analyze the LAI in heterogeneous subtropical forests with complex terrain by fusing high-resolution multi-sensor data from the Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Sentinel-2 Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI), and Advanced Land Observing Satellite-1 digital elevation model (DEM). Here, forest LAI mapping was performed by integrating the MSI, SAR, and DEM data using a stacking learning (SL) approach that incorporates distinct predictions from a set of optimized individual ML algorithms. The method's performance was evaluated by comparison to field forest LAI measurements acquired in Xingguo and Gandong of subtropical China. The results showed that the addition of the SAR and DEM images using the SL model compared to the inputs of only optical images reduced the mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) by 26% and 18%, respectively, in Xingguo, and by 12% and 8%, respectively, in Gandong. Furthermore, the combination of all images had the best prediction performance. SL was found to be more robust and accurate than conventional individual ML models, while the MAE and RMSE were decreased by 71% and 64%, respectively, in Xingguo, and by 68% and 59%, respectively, in Gandong. Therefore, the SL model using the three-source data combination produced satisfied prediction accuracy with the coefficients of determination (R-2), MAE, and RMSE of 0.96, 0.17, and 0.28, respectively, in Xingguo and 0.94, 0.30, and 0.47, respectively, in Gandong. This study revealed the potential of the SL algorithm for retrieving the forest LAI using multi-sensor data in areas with complex terrain.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Remote Sensing Image Fusion Using Multiscale Two-Stream Convolutional Neural Networks
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal remote sensing image fusion (STF) is a promising way to obtain remote sensing data with both fine spatial and temporal resolutions. Gradual and abrupt changes in land surface reflectance images are the main challenges in existing STF methods. Advanced deep learning techniques present powerful ability in learning image-changed information. Therefore, this article proposes a novel spatiotemporal image fusion method using multiscale two-stream convolutional neural networks (STFMCNNs). Multiscale two-stream convolutional neural networks are proposed to capture different sizes of objects in feature learning from a coarse spatial resolution image and two pairs of coarse and fine spatial resolution (FR) images at other dates. Meanwhile, temporal dependence and temporal consistency are explored as complementary information for STFMCNN. Moreover, a local fusion method is developed to characterize local variation by combining two predicted images derived from each stream. Two experiments on different real images are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of STFMCNN. Results show that STFMCNN outperformed three existing methods by predicting more accurate FR images with more preserved changed information.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Fusion Network for Land Surface Temperature Based on a Conditional Variational Autoencoder
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High spatiotemporal resolution land surface temperature (LST) data are essential for dynamic monitoring and prediction in climate change research. Due to the limitations of remote sensing instruments, the current platforms have difficulty in achieving a compromise between high spatial and temporal resolutions for LST products. In this study, we propose a spatiotemporal fusion network for LST based on a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE-LSTFM). First, an improved network is designed based on the CVAE by reconstructing an encoder and a decoder. To generate fine LST images based on dense time series, a variational inference model is formulated to integrate coarse and fine LST image pairs in variational autoencoded latent space. In addition, a new compound loss function for the proposed training method is designed to reduce the effects of noise and outliers. Then, a pretraining mechanism is adopted to optimize the network training process, and the parameters can be transferred to the training network of the CVAE to accelerate network convergence. Finally, a novel weighting strategy that considers spatiotemporal variations in LST (LST consistency weighting) is employed to solve the spatiotemporal heterogeneity problem caused by the rapid changes in LST. The method is quantitatively tested and evaluated in the Heihe River Basin using FY-4A LST and MODIS LST from September 2019. Compared with two traditional models and two deep learning-based models, CVAE-LSTFM yields lower root-mean-square error (RMSE) (average < 1.26 K) and learning perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS, average < 0.13) values and higher structural similarity (SSIM, average > 0.96). In practice, CVAE-LSTFM can generate high spatiotemporal resolution LST values (hourly IST with a 1-km spatial resolution) with high accuracy, quality, and robustness.

TI  - Multi-Spectrum Hierarchical Segmentation Algorithm: A New Aerosol Optical Thickness Retrieval Algorithm for Urban Areas
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Retrieving aerosol optical thickness (AOT) from remote-sensing images of urban areas remains challenging, especially for bright-reflecting land surfaces. In this study, a novel algorithm, called multi-spectrum hierarchical segmentation (MSHS), was developed to retrieve the AOTs for urban surfaces. In this algorithm, the apparent reflectance of multiple shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands was employed and divided into tiny segments successively and hierarchically. Each segment was further segmented into object and nonobject parts using the Otsu algorithm in the coastal band. Hereafter, the congeneric apparent reflectance pixels of the object part were extracted, and the surface reflectance of this congener was obtained based on the minimum reflectivity and 6S model. AOT was then retrieved based on a precalculated lookup table (LUT) using the coastal band. Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sun/sky radiometer measurements from 2013 to 2019 from Beijing, China, were used for validation. Results showed that the 30-m AOT retrievals obtained using Landsat-8 images exhibited good consistency with the ground-based measurements, with an overall correlation coefficient of similar to 0.871, expected error of similar to 59.04%, root mean square error of similar to 0.148, and mean absolute error of similar to 0.096. Compared to dense dark vegetation (DDV) algorithm, MSHS algorithm exhibited higher correlation and lower error. This implied that this new algorithm can help in characterizing aerosol distribution patterns within a city in a more refined way and provide support for tracing air pollution sources.

AB  - SAR and optical images provide complementary information on land-cover categories in terms of both spectral signatures and dielectric properties. This paper proposes a new unsupervised land-cover segmentation approach based on contrastive learning and vector quantization that jointly uses SAR and optical images. This approach exploits a pseudo-Siamese network to extract and discriminate features of different categories, where one branch is a ResUnet and the other branch is a gumble-softmax vector quantizer. The core idea is to minimize the contrastive loss between the learned features of the two branches. To segment images, for each pixel the output of gumble-softmax is discretized as a one-hot vector and its proxy label is chosen as the corresponding class. The proposed approach is validated on a subset of DFC2020 dataset including six different land-cover categories. Experimental results demonstrate improvements over the current state-of-the-art techniques and the effectiveness of unsupervised land-cover segmentation on SAR-optical image pairs.

TI  - Self-Supervised SAR-Optical Data Fusion of Sentinel-1/-2 Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The effective combination of the complementary information provided by huge amount of unlabeled multisensor data (e.g., synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical images) is a critical issue in remote sensing. Recently, contrastive learning methods have reached remarkable success in obtaining meaningful feature representations from multiview data. However, these methods only focus on image-level features, which may not satisfy the requirement for dense prediction tasks such as land-cover mapping. In this work, we propose a self-supervised framework for SAR-optical data fusion and land-cover mapping tasks. SAR and optical images are fused by using a multiview contrastive loss at image level and super-pixel level according to one of those possible strategies: in the early, intermediate, and late strategies. For the land-cover mapping task, we assign each pixel a land-cover class by the joint use of pretrained features and spectral information of the image itself. Experimental results show that the proposed approach not only achieves a comparable accuracy but also reduces the dimension of features with respect to the image-level contrastive learning method. Among three fusion strategies, the intermediate fusion strategy achieves the best performance. The combination of the pixel-level fusion approach and the self-training on spectral indices leads to further improvements in the land-cover mapping task with respect to the image-level fusion approach, especially with sparse pseudo labels. The code to reproduce our results will be found at https://github.com/yusin2it/SARoptical_fusion.

AB  - The demand for high-precision sea surface temperature (SST) has been growing rapidly in recent years because SST is one of the key parameters to describe the thermal state of the sea surface. This article analyzes the differences between microwave remote sensing and infrared remote sensing for SST, including the spatial resolution difference and the penetration depth difference. In order to improve the accuracy of retrieved SST, this article proposes a joint inversion algorithm for SST from combining microwave brightness temperature (BT) and infrared BT, which has also taken the influence of wind speed and atmosphere into consideration. Experiments confirm that SST data obtained from the joint inversion algorithm are more accurate than those obtained from the existing inversion algorithms.

TI  - A Large-Aperture Remote Sensing Camera Calibration Method Based on Stellar and Inner Blackbody
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Radiometric calibration of satellites is one of the core technologies for analyzing satellite data quantitatively. For large-aperture remote sensing cameras, the blackbody is placed in the rear optical path due to its weight and size. As a result, the front optics' self-emission cannot be evaluated when the inner blackbody is observed. To achieve full optical path calibrations, stars are used as radiation calibration sources for large-aperture cameras. In high-energy concentration detection systems, the point spread function (PSF), intrapixel sensitivity (IPS), capacitive coupling, and sampling phase may cause some energy of the point source to be lost, resulting in an energy difference between the extended and point sources. It is important to note that conventional aperture photometry is not always the ideal method for obtaining high-precision photometry. This article proposes a method for compensation of point-source signals based on capacitive coupling correction, PSF reconstruction, and IPS model, and establishes a response conversion model for stellar and inner blackbodies. According to calibration coefficients based on stars and inner blackbody, the error between the star calibration coefficient and the inner blackbody calibration coefficient is 0.18%, which is better than 59.4% before the proposed method was applied. The error between the two methods can be stabilized within 0.3% within 140 days of the launch of the satellite.

TI  - A Hybrid Leaf Area Index Estimation Method of Dioscorea Polystachya Turczaninow Using Sentinel-2 Vegetation Indices
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Dioscorea polystachya Turczaninow is an herbaceous vine plant distributed in China, and its rhizome named Chinese yam is a famous traditional Chinese medicine for treating diabetes and other diseases. However, a large region monitoring method of its growth status is lacking, which is important for Chinese yam yield estimation. Therefore, this study proposed a leaf area index (LAI) estimation algorithm for Dioscorea polystachya Turczaninow using a hybrid method and Sentinel-2 vegetation indices (VIs). First, two feature selection algorithms the gradient boosting regression tree (GBRT) and absolute Pearson correlation coefficient (APCC), were combined with field-measured data and radiation transfer model simulated data to generate four different feature-important ranking groups. Then, a hybrid feature selection algorithm was used to determine the best feature subsets under each ranking group, and GBRT regression and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) were used to develop the LAI estimation models. Finally, the best LAI estimation model for Dioscorea polystachya Turczaninow was determined based on validation accuracy. The results indicated that the field-measured data were more reliable than the simulated data for feature selection, and the best LAI estimation model was the LASSO model using nine selected VIs, which achieved the performance with root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.391 and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.310. The proposed method could provide real-time LAI estimates for future Chinese yam yield prediction.

AB  - Differential Tomography SAR (D-TomoSAR) is a significant technology for large-scale land subsidence monitoring, which can be utilized to obtain deformation information. In particular, it owns unique technical advantages, such as high deformation sensitivity and accuracy. D-TomoSAR allows resolving layovers by handle the situation where multiple scatterers exist within a range-azimuth resolution cell. However, the extraction of scatterers is a critical and challenging issue. As we all know, there are four main parameters for a PS in SAR images. They are namely amplitude, phase, coherence and signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR). In this paper, the characteristic of the four parameters is analyzed firstly. Then, according to the characteristic of the four parameters, three different methods of PS extraction are studied theoretically, which are amplitude dispersion (AD) threshold method, coherence coefficient (CC) threshold method and SCR threshold method in temporal and spatial domain. Finally, the SAR data from TerraSAR-X satellite are used for experimental at North Star Times Tower in Beijing, China. The extraction results of the three approaches are compared. The experimental results show that AD and SCR methods are more reliable than CC method. It is due to that CC approach is affected by the neighborhood pixels to a large extent. Additionally, SCR method is more time saving than AD and CC methods. Therefore, we can conclude that SCR approach is suitable for engineering application.

TI  - Exploring the Applicability of the Semi-Empirical BRDF Models at Different Scales Using Airborne Multi-Angular Observations
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Semi-empirical bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) models are developed based on various spatial-resolution pixels. Because of its simplicity and physical significance, it is widely used in medium- and low-spatial-resolution quantitative remote sensing. With the emergence of high-spatial-resolution remote sensing data and the lack of high-spatial-resolution BRDF models, semi-empirical BRDF models have also been directly applied to high-spatial-resolution qualitative and quantitative remote sensing research. However, whether semi-empirical BRDF models can be directly applied to pixels with high resolution remains unclear. To answer this question, this letter quantitatively evaluates the applicability of semi-empirical BRDF models for remote sensing data with 0.5-30 m spatial resolution based on the WIDAS multi-angular observation dataset obtained during the HiWATER experiment in 2012. The results demonstrate that the semi-empirical BRDF models are not applicable at the 0.5 m pixel scale but are applicable at the 10 m pixel scale. There is a transitional pixel scale from not applicable to applicable between 0.5 and 10 m. We define this scale as the optimal minimum pixel scale (OMS) of semi-empirical BRDF models. The OMS is related to the spatial structure of the vegetation scene, and it is highly consistent with the canopy characteristic scale calculated based on the semivariogram method (R-2 = 0.901). Therefore, the range of the semivariogram can be used to estimate the OMS to answer the question of which scale semi-empirical BRDF models are applicable to high-spatial-resolution images.

TI  - Analysis of Deep Learning Techniques for Maasai Boma Mapping in Tanzania
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Underdeveloped countries in sub-Saharan Africa often contain cultural subpopulations that are underserved in regard to health and education. This perpetuates the health challenges of the country as a whole, and it is therefore of interest to be able to automatically map the subpopulation for the health services delivery. International nonprofit health organizations have often taken the lead in these efforts, providing humanitarian aid (e.g., clean water and food) as well as health care. This is necessary, as the ethnic subpopulations are not well integrated into the society and the existing health care systems. In this study, we explicitly explore the Maasailand of Tanzania, to evaluate the use of deep neural networks (DNN) to aid in the automatic visual analysis of remote sensing data to geolocate Maasai boma structures. We investigate the performance of four state-of-the-art DNN as classifiers of boma presence within high-resolution imagery; all showing over 95% F1 score performance. Additionally, we scan over 3900 km(2) of high-resolution imagery, combining a ProxylessNAS with broad area aggregation and mapping techniques and demonstrate the discovery of hundreds of boma, many that were not discovered by human analysts performing visual scans. The trained ProxylessNAS model generates a classified vector response field (CVRF). The CVRF is aggregated by a mode-seeking algorithm to detect potential locations of boma structures within the study area. The model detected numerous human false negatives (HFNs) and achieved 94.022% TPR and 95.395% F1 score using an aggregation aperture of 250 m within a 76.620 square kilometers area of interest.

AB  - The active population is an indicator of urban vitality, representing socioeconomic vitality. An accurate mapping for the active population is the foundation for supporting regional sustainable development. Current research mainly relies on human mobile location data, which are challenging to access due to privacy and data sharing concerns. Thus, it is essential to map a wide area of the active population cost-effectively. This study demonstrates how an end-to-end deep learning approach can be used to reliably estimate urban active population distribution from remote sensing imagery. Learning based on the object and regional feature may provide insights into active population distribution by coupling ResNet-50 and Fully Convolutional Networks to achieve economic features that fuse Google surface features and night-light remote sensing data. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using multiple remote sensing data to quantify the distribution of active populations. The proposed model (ResNet-50+FCN, R-2=0.82) can better explain the differences in active population estimation than the ResNet-50 model (R-2=0.61). The study provides new insights into estimating active populations in cities that lack location-based service records.

TI  - The Effect of Thickness of Covering Soil on Soil Water Retention and Crop Growth in Land Reclamation Filled with Fly Ash: Evidence from GPR and UAV Investigation
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid, accurate, and non-destructive monitoring after land reclamation is the basis of and key to realizing land restoration evaluation, as well as land use direction decision-making and improvement. However, the biggest problem with the filling reclamation method is the poor soil water retention caused by the insufficient thickness of covering soil (TCS), which results in the loss of soil nutrients. In addition, the cost of filling reclamation has also increased due to the excessive TCS. In this study, multi-source remote sensing data acquisition methods were used to assess the impacts of the TCS of the filling reclamation method on soil water retention and crop growth (CG). We found that as the TCS increases, the overall trend of the CG gradually increases, and the overall trend of the soil water content slowly increases. However, considering the huge economic costs and the cost of soil sources, we suggest that the optimal TCS for the filling reclamation method should be controlled within 40-50 cm. The results of this study provide a reference for the use of multi-source remote sensing technology for rapid evaluation of the restoration effects of reclaimed areas and for the rational utilization of coal chemical wastes.

TI  - A Framework for Big Earth Observation Data Using Horizontal Scaling Strategy
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid growth of Earth observation (EO) data poses a challenge to the way of data management. An efficient framework based on big data technology can bring new solutions. Some excellent frameworks have been proposed, which provide efficient organization and management of EO data. However, they are not optimized for data distribution in the storage environment. In this letter, an optimized EO data management strategy is proposed. Different horizontal scaling strategies are designed to explore the optimal scheme of EO data distribution. The MapReduce parallel computing model was used to test the performance of data retrieval in the experiment. The results show that the proposed strategy contributes to the efficient organization and arrangement of data. Remote sensing (RS) data blocks can be evenly distributed to different shards according to the time characteristics and hash characteristics of the strategy, and the logical index of the data reduces the time consumed by the routing process. This distributed management mode that achieves load balancing provides a framework foundation for parallel computing. Therefore, the framework with an efficient strategy can improve the performance of data management.

AB  - Floods are among the most common disasters and natural hazards in the world, affecting human lives and causing severe economic damage. They are mainly due to extreme weather phenomena but can be aggravated by anthropogenic factors. A fast unsupervised flood mapping method is proposed for the Upper East region in Ghana, an area yearly exposed to flood events due to the spillage of Bagre dam after heavy rains. The method consists in applying an unsupervised threshold imaging technique to Sentinel-1 images, filtering, mosaicking and finally detecting changes in the water maps. The flood maps are made available through the AfriCultuReS' platform at high resolution every 6 days for a large area during the flood-prone period. The thorough validation of the flood products qualitatively by local experts and quantitatively using a global surface water reference dataset for floods, will ensure its adoption by end users for the benefit of local communities.

TI  - Auroral Kilometric Radiation as a Diagnostic Tool for the Properties of the Magnetosphere
T2  - JETP LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Auroral kilometric radiation is used as a tool for the remote diagnostics of processes in the Earth's magnetosphere. Using satellite data and the spectrum of fluctuations of auroral kilometric radiation at various frequencies, the fractal properties of the auroral region of the magnetosphere depending on the altitude of a source and the frequency of generated radiation are studied. The fractal characteristics (Hurst exponent and fractal dimension) of the medium in the region of generation of auroral kilometric radiation and their dynamics depending on the altitude and frequency are determined from the scaling law. It is shown that the scaling and Hurst exponent increase with the altitude (or with a decrease in the signal frequency), whereas the fractal dimension decreases with an increase in the altitude. The scaling and fractal parameters obtained in this work indicate that the processes under consideration exhibit long-range dependence.

AB  - Forest fires are responsible for significant losses to societies, ecosystems, and economies worldwide. To keep a check on these losses and to avoid wildfires, predicting the occurrence of these forest fires are important because these can help in wildfire management and prevention. In recent times, with the availability of real time high resolution remote sensing satellite data over larger geographies, it is becoming easier to study geologic features of our planet. One such example is the live fuel moisture content (LFMC), which is defined as the "mass of vegetation water per unit dry biomass", a crucial factor determinant of wildfire risk. Using the Live Fuel Moisture Content in combination with ground truth wildfire data from the United States Geological Survey, I predict whether there will be a fire in the near future within a 8 km grid over the area of interest using supervised machine learning models such as KNN, SVM, Random Forest, and Neural Networks. We conducted two experiments, using a single image within 15 days of a fire, and a combination of 3 images within 45 days of a fire. Our results show that the random forest performs best with an accuracy of 76.06% for a single image, and 75.07% for multiple images.

AB  - The object of the study is the processing of space images on the territory of the Carpathian territory in the Lviv region, obtained from the Landsat-8 satellite. The work aims to determine the area of deforestation in the Carpathian territory of the Lviv region from different time-space images obtained from the Landsat-8 satellite. Methods of cartography, photogrammetry, aerospace remote sensing of the Earth and GIS technology were used in the experimental research. The work was performed in Erdas Imagine software using the unsupervised image classification module and the DeltaCue difference detection module. The results of the work are classified as three images of Landsat-8 on the territory of the Carpathian territory in the Lviv region. The areas of forest cover for each of them for the period of 2016-2018 have been determined. During the three years, the area of forests has decreased by 14 hectares. Our proposed workflow includes six stages: analysis of input data, band composition of space images on the research territory, implementation of unsupervised classification in Erdas Imagine software and selection of forest class and determination of implementing this workflow, the vector layers of the forest cover of the Carpathians in the Lviv region for 2016, 2017, 2018 were obtained, and on their basis, the corresponding areas were calculated and compared.

TI  - MODIS-based climatology of the Surface Urban Heat Island at country scale (Romania)
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - This article provides the first country-scale climatology of the Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) investigated across the cities with more than 30,000 inhabitants from Romania using using the MODIS Land Surface Temperature (LST) data set developed within the Land Surface Temperature Climate Change Initiative (CCI) project (LST_cci), funded by European Space Agency. The main findings refer to the relationship between air temperature and LST, temporal variability of the LST over selected urban areas, and the country-scale variations of the SUHI intensity (SUHII), defined as the thermal contrast between the city and its rural proximity. Night-and day-time conditions introduce major differences, the seasonality is an important bias, and the results are presented accordingly. The LST is very well correlated with air temperature (T2m) under clear-sky conditions. At nighttime, the average SUHII is around 0.9 degrees C in all summer months, while at daytime the average SUHII equals 2.5 degrees C, in June, 2.3 degrees C in July, and 1.9 degrees C in August. The results are relevant for clear-sky conditions and show that the city size (mainly the log transformed area size), climate type (i.e., Cfa, and Cfb, by nightime, and Cfb, and Dfb, by daytime), and land use-land cover (LULC) conditions (i.e., Urban fabric) amplify the magnitude of the SUHII across Romania.

TI  - The Book of Poems "Black and Blue" by A. Ladinskiy: N. Gumilev's "Lessons" and Occasional Mythopoetics
T2  - NOVYI FILOLOGICHESKII VESTNIK-NEW PHILOLOGICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The article examines the first book of poems "Black and Blue" (1930) by A.P. Ladinskiy, a representative of the Paris branch of the first wave of literature of the Russian diaspora, in the aspect of the creative development of N.S. Gumilev's poetics. The analysis of the emigrant poet's poems shows that the inheritance of N.S. Gumilev in his lyrics manifests itself primarily in the conceptualization of the mythologeme of the path as the basis of the ontological self-realization of the lyrical subject. The movement of A.P. Ladinskiy's poetical consciousness towards the convergence of earthly and heavenly principles is correlated with the search for world harmony, which determines N.S. Gumilev's artistic worldview. Focusing on N.S. Gumilev's principles of subjective representation, A.P. Ladinskiy in the structure of the book "Black and Blue" uses a wide range of lyrical masks of the poetic "self" (admiral, European traveler, Florentine fugitives, crusaders, masons, argonauts, etc.), actualizing certain historical and cultural codes and characterized by a common desire to bridge the gap between the material and spiritual aspects of being. It is concluded that the "lessons" by N. Gumilev, connected simultaneously with the acmeistic attention to the "worldly" reality, and with the neoromantic thirst to comprehend the heavenly-otherworldly world, turn out to be one of the key factors in the formation of occasional mythopoetics in the lyrics of A.P. Ladinskiy. At the same time, the artistic concept of the world in "Black and Blue" is fundamentally different from N.S. Gumilev's, since in it the strong-willed "self" of the warrior-traveler comes to the fore not so much as the ontologically vulnerable personality of the exile sufferer. The poetic myth of A.P. Ladinskiy, largely growing out of N.S. Gumilev's concept of the universe, postulates the ultimate thirst for the unity of the microcosm and macrocosm and the tragic realization of the impossibility of overcoming their antinomy.

AB  - Given a coarse satellite image and a fine satellite image of a particular location taken at the same time, the high-resolution spatiotemporal image fusion technique involves understanding the spatial correlation between the pixels of both images and using it to generate a finer image for a given coarse (or test) image taken at a later time. This technique is extensively used for monitoring agricultural land cover, forest cover, etc. The two key issues in this technique are: (i) handling missing pixel data and (ii) improving the prediction accuracy of the fine image generated from the given test coarse image. This paper tackles these two issues by proposing an efficient method consisting of the following three basic steps: (i) imputation of missing pixels using neighborhood information, (ii) cross-scale matching to adjust both the Point Spread Functions Effect (PSF) and geo-registration errors between the course and high-resolution images, and (iii) error-based modulation, which uses pixel-based multiplicative factors and residuals to fix the error caused due to modulation of temporal changes. The experimental results on the real-world satellite imagery datasets demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-art by accurately producing the high-resolution satellite images closer to the ground truth.

AB  - Ice failures are among the least known and least studied mass movements, both because large events are quite rare, and because they usually develop in remote and little-frequented areas. However, the unprecedented transformation of glaciers due to climate change, on the one hand, and the growing human pressure on high-elevation environments, on the other, nowadays require a more careful and in-depth consideration of these hazardous processes, such as tragically highlighted by the collapse of the Marmolada Glacier (Italy) on July 3, 2022. In this context, a review of existing documentation on past glacier failures is essential to learn about their spatio-temporal distribution, the characteristics of the glaciers where the failures occurred and flow properties. In turn, these findings are fundamental to inform the assessment of current and future hazards. The present work contributes to the topic by documenting, cataloguing, and analysing the glacier failures larger than 10,000 m3 that occurred in the Italian Alps in the period 1930-2022. Sixty-eight glacier failures are documented, which affected 29 glaciers distributed throughout the Italian Alps. The volumes of glacier failures are mostly between 10,000 and 50,000 m(3) (1.1 x 10(6) m(3) in one case). The events occurred mainly in summer, with a frequency peak in August. The H/L ratio, i.e. the ratio between the vertical (H) and horizontal (L) distances covered by the process, indicator of the mobility of the detached mass, is between 0.33 and 0.80. Although glacier failures can occur during both glacial advance and retreat, we found a sharp increase in the number of documented cases since the 1990s. We are aware that, due to the difficulty of finding information, the dataset provided in this work is only partially representative of the glacier failures that occurred in the Italian Alps in the period considered: nevertheless, it is a useful starting point for studies aimed at assessing hazards related to glacier failure, and for risk mitigation. Given the speed and intensity with which glaciers and their surrounding environments are evolving in response to climate change, their continuous observation is essential, as is the systematic documentation of glacier failure events. Remote sensing data and tools can nowadays facilitate glacier monitoring and the documentation of ice failures: however, field data such as those collected during the annual glaciological surveys of the Italian Glaciological Committee (CGI) remain fundamental for the validation of remote sensing data and numerical models.

AB  - We propose an unsupervised methodology for multi-class change detection (CD) in multimodal remote sensing data fused using the Kronecker product formalism. The method utilizes the compressed change vector analysis (C(2)VA) on the fully vectorized change matrices. The multimodal case is demonstrated using dual-frequency full-polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data obtained by EMISAR over the Foulum agricultural area. The change types are investigated using ground truth data for the growth of various crops. The work showcases the capability of the Kronecker product-based CD formalism beyond conventional scalar change indices.

TI  - Methodology for groundnut discrimination based on timeseries of dual-polarimetric SAR parameters
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The groundnut, also known as peanut, is a legume crop that is classified as both a grain legume and an oil crop (due to its high oil content). About 85% of the total groundnut in India is sown in the kharif season under rainfed conditions. This makes it extremely difficult to apply the optical remote sensing methodologies for groundnut discrimination and acreage estimation. We develop a remote sensing strategy based on timeseries synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery, which is immune to the rainy conditions of the observation period. Further, our work is distinct from the traditional multitemporal SAR backscatter analysis as it incorporates polarimetric parameters such as the alpha angle (a) and the polarimetric radar vegetation index to aid discrimination. These parameters were shortlisted on the basis of maximal sensitivity to groundnut growth stages. Random forest classifier, an ensemble learning-based classifier, is used to carryout the crop classification using these parameters. This approach is contrasted with SAR backscatter-based analysis (using the same RF classifier) and with a Euclidean distance (ED)-based model matching method (with the same polarimetric parameters). A detailed comparative analysis of classification accuracy of groundnut discrimination is carried out using extensive ground truth data over the agricultural fields of Junagadh district in the Gujarat state of Western India. The backscatter-based analysis with RF achieves 86.2% overall accuracy in discriminating groundnut (with the competing cotton crop), whereas polarimetric parameters with ED model matching achieves 76%. Using the proposed method, with dual-pol parameters derived out of Sentinel-1 SAR data, we report 92.7% overall accuracy with a kappa coefficient of 0.81. The major insight is that combining timeseries polarimetric information together with a good machine learning classifier improves the classification accuracy of short crops compared to nonpolarimetric approach.

TI  - Demand-Side Democracy vs. Supply-Side Democracy. Reconstructing and Interpreting the Analogies between Democracy and the Market
T2  - OECONOMIA-HISTORY METHODOLOGY PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Starting from the distinction between "categorical" and "formal" analogies, this paper proposes a reconstruction of the analogies between market and democracy as well as an interpretation of their uses. This reconstruction reveals two main ideal-typical representations of economic and political processes conveyed by the use of democracy-market analogies by 20th century economists. Some of them consider that the outcomes of economic and political processes are or should be essentially determined by the demand side of the market, i.e. by the preferences of consumers and citizens. This is a political worldview that we call "demand-side democracy". Others believe, on the contrary, that the economic system and democracy are processes driven by the supply side of the market. In terms of the positive use of the analogy, we argue that the demand-side democracy view is directly dependent on the assumptions underlying neoclassical economics, so that the more an economist distances himself from them, the more he proposes a "supply-side democracy" view. The normative uses of the analogy are however resistant to any simplistic characterization.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article was written in honor of the 255th anniversary of the birth of Nikolay Mikhailovich Karamzin (1766-1826). Today, when humanities scholars are faced with the task of developing a "Russian project of civilizational development", it seems important to study the ideas and principles on which the worldview of our great historiographer was built, who, as shown in this article, was the basis for the creation of "Russia humanities". This can be done most fully by studying in detail the polemics of his supporters and opponents at different periods of the historical development of Russia. This article analyzes the controversy surrounding Karamzin's worldview among the Russian emigration. The ideas of N. M. Karamzin, which can be attributed to the layer of socio-historical and political, shows their connection with the ideas and values of the Enlightenment. The author reveals the ideas of the historiographer that were missed in the analyzed polemics, in particular, those concerning the prospects of the country's historical development.

TI  - Effect of manual lymphatic drainage on upper limb lymphedema after surgery for breast cancer
T2  - CESKA GYNEKOLOGIE-CZECH GYNAECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Evaluation of the effect of manual lymphatic drainage on lymphedema of the upper limb after previous axillary lymphadenectomy/ sentinel node bio psy during the maintenance phase of lymphedema after the breast cancer surgery. Material and methods: A total of 30 patients after surgical treatment of unilateral breast cancer underwent 10 manual lymphatic drainages within 8 consecutive weeks. All patients underwent upper limb circumference measurements before and after the study and completed two specialized EORTC questionnaires (QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23). Results: The average time between surgery and admission into this study was 32.5 months. In the beginning of the study, lymphedema was present for an average of 19.8 months. At the end of a series of manual lymphatic drainages, the average volume decrease of the limb with lymphedema was 3% (1.5-5.6%). In contrary, the average loss of volume on the healthy (control) upper limb was only 0.4%. The average reduction of lymphedema volume after therapy achieved 57% (37-88%). After a series of manual lymphatic drainages, the results of the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire showed a statistically significant improvement in physical and role functions, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnea and constipation, while the results of the EORTC QLQ-BR23 questionnaire showed a statistically significant improvement in the arm and breast symptoms. There was no statistically significant deterioration in any of the monitored parameters. Conclusion: The results of the study showed a positive eff ect of manual lymphatic drainage on the maintenance phase of lymphedema in patients after breast cancer surgery. The questionnaires showed a significant improvement in hand and arm symptoms as well as an improvement of the other functions and symptoms affecting quality of life. Further studies should be performed on groups of patients with the maintenance phase of upper limb lymphedema to confirm or disprove our results.

AB  - Over the past decades, scholars have excavated the Mongol Empire’s far-reaching legacy in shaping the world’s subsequent history. A new historiographical development has argued that the early Ming rulers aimed to succeed the Mongol world empire by incorporating neighboring polities through rituals. Korean elites allegedly corresponded to the Ming advances by internalizing the Sinocentric worldview and Korea’s predetermined position as a vassal of the world empire in China. This article critically examines this position by first raising the following two points. First, arguments for the Ming's integration of Korea through rituals may have overstated their case, as some relevant rituals appear to do the opposite. Second, this group of scholars seems to ignore that the Sinocentric worldview did not allow “private interaction” for its vassals and that Korea’s “autonomy” in its foreign policy could not be justified. This article elaborated on this point by exemplifying Choson Korea’s foreign policies during the reign of king Injo. This article then critically examines the definition of Sinocentrism itself, which numerous scholars have misleadingly interpreted as a universal cultural or intellectual paradigm. As a related point, this article argues that Sinocentrism’s universal aspect is rooted in China’s need as a historical empire to assimilate its ethnic minorities. Contrary to the argument that Korea fully accepted the Sinocentric worldview as a vassal of the Chinese empire, this article concludes that Korea’s endorsement of Sinocentrism had little to do with China itself and involved significant alteration per the political and intellectual context of Choson Korea.

CP  - 24th ISPRS Congress on Imaging Today, Foreseeing Tomorrow

AB  - The latest IPCC report clearly stated that the human influence is the main reason of sea ice reduction in the Arctic. Importance of sea ice monitoring from space is increasing. In addition, the heat flux of ice in thin ice areas is strongly affected by the ice thickness difference. Therefore, ice thickness is one of the important parameters of sea ice. The authors have been studying on extracting thin ice areas using optical sensor such as MODIS for years. In this paper, the authors summarized the procedure of our study starting from comparing in-situ measurement of ice thickness with high resolution optical sensor RSI data, and finally developing the thin ice area extraction algorithm using MODIS. Estimating ice thickness from optical sensor data is not easy. However, through our study, the authors have verified the possibility of extracting thin ice areas using optical sensor data observed from satellites. In this study, the authors define "thin ice areas" as ice which thickness is less than about 30cm with reflectance much lower than thick ice. The basic idea of the algorithm is to use the scatterplots of MODIS band 1 & 2 reflectance and extract thin ice areas using the distribution difference of thin ice against water, thick ice, clouds. Not all but most of the thin ice areas could be extracted using the algorithm.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to inquire into the themes of war and nature seen from the perspective of the anti-war peace thought by L. Tolstoy. To this end, as a result of having examined the key message of the anti-war pacifist ideal that was shown in Tolstoy’s later persuasive writing, it is clarified that his non-violent and non-resistance ideology is closely associated with his life thought and ecological thought. It analyzes a short novel titled “The Raid”(1852) and finds out with what kind of critical mind Tolstoy’s anti-war thought in the latter part appeared and was expressed in the early creation. And the themes in war & nature, which were demonstrated in this work, are checked from the viewpoint of the intertextuality with the later persuasive writing. In the chapter of having addressed the issues of war and nature shown in “The Raid”, it parses the shape of the war from the perspective of the volunteer speaker and the captain Kholokhov, and displays how ‘courage,’ which is the main concept that penetrates the whole work, is connected with the will of a human to save lives. In this work, the natural world appears in stark contrast to the human world. The natural world is a symbol of beauty and goodness that seek for the harmony of all beings. On the other hand, the human world is a symbol of evil that is marked by revenge and a desire for murder. Nature is presented as an alternative plan of purifying and saving an evil person who indulges in war and commits violence. In this regard, this work can be prescribed as a work that proved Tolstoy’s anti-war thought through the ecological worldview.

AB  - Among the discourses on worldview and social sciences, discussions focused on the traditional view of the relationship between worldview and philosophy and the history of the concept of worldview have not been conducted today. This is a regrettable point in relation to the long history of the Christian worldview movement, and this paper aims to examine the relationship between worldview and philosophy from a conceptual historical point of view. The history or conceptual history of concepts refers to historical methods that examine the understanding of the matrix that the important idea or concept first started and the concept afterwards. In other words, the study of conceptual history is an attempt to reconstruct the progression and semantic history of a concept by combining the diachronic and public dimensions together.This is of particular significance in the tradition of neo-Calvinism, which argues that there is a close relationship between intellectual history and the spiritual and spiritual struggles involving Christian scholars.

AB  - This study attempts to shed light on the relations between the liberal international order and the roles and responsibility of great power, the US. It firstly reviewed the conceptual characteristics of liberal ideology and then discussed natures of the liberal international order that the United States has planned and operated since the end of WWII. Liberalism has long been projected and functioned in the human community as a philosophical worldview centered on human rationality, a system that seeks to protect political, economic, and religious freedom. Law-based governance, separation of powers, protection of private property, freedom of speech and representation based on free and fair elections are among the most positive achievements liberalism has achieved in human history. These liberal principles and values provided an action plan that allowed the war to end in the war-torn history of mankind, as shown in ‘the Perpetual Peace.’ However, liberalism has a theoretically contradictory in terms of being difficult to succeed in reality. Also, even the US led-liberal international order is declining. Therefore, this article analyzed the responsibilities and obligations of the U.S. powers as factors and conditions for the liberal international order to work properly. As a result, it showed that the liberal international order can work sustainable only if the liberal principles and values of the United States are applied appropriately to reality without dogmatic use.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXVII
CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - Landsat 9 (L9) was launched on September 27, 2021, from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. The U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) released Level-1 data, geometrically orthorectified and radiometrically calibrated imagery in digital numbers that can be scaled to Top-of-Atmosphere reflectance, and Level-2 data, geometrically orthorectified and radiometrically calibrated surface reflectance imagery, to the public on February 10, 2022. From September 27, 2021 to early January of 2022, the satellite and its two instruments, the Operational Land Imager (OLI) and the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS), were in their commissioning phase, updating key radiometric and geometric calibration parameters for both the spacecraft and the instruments. The data acquired during the commissioning phase of the spacecraft and instruments were reprocessed with the newly determined post-launch calibration parameters prior to the releasing of the data to the public. After the public release of the data, the calibration parameters of the sensors and the spacecraft continue to be monitored to ensure the data released to the public is of the same high quality as previous Landsat data products. This paper discusses three key geometric performance aspects of the L9 spacecraft and its instruments during its early mission time frame (September 27, 2021 to June 27, 2022) including geodetic accuracy, geometric accuracy, and within band registration accuracy of the L9 products generated.

AB  - The goal of this study is to find the fundamental factors of the crisis facing classical poetry research and education from an internal level, and based on this, suggest the direction of change by revealing the structure and reality of self-reflection and world perspective through classical poetry. In the midst of essential skepticism about responding to the needs of the present and preparing for the changing environment of the future through classical poetry of the past, it is possible to rediscover the essence of classical poetry through examination and reflection on the academic character of the humanities.From this awareness of the problem, ‘insight’ and ‘criticism’ were derived as a response to the scientific nature of science and the indifference of art. Criticizing the existing research methodologies that were overwhelmed by positivism according to the scientific worldview, insight was suggested as a holistic view and comprehensive wisdom for reflection on human life and values. In addition, according to the indifference of art and the objectivist approach to literature, criticism was explored as an alternative, paying attention to the problem of separation from reality. Then, by restoring the relationship between the subject and the object based on humanistic thinking, which is distinct from scientific thinking, the structure of human understanding was established in the special relationship between text and subject.Chapter 3 explores the possibility of ‘self-reflection through text’, as the essence of classical poetry lies in the special relationship between text and subject. The text of classical poetry works as a medium to bring the subject’s self-reflection, and the subject can renew his understanding of himself in the experience of other relationships and ways of being provided through the text. Next, the realization and possibility of self-reflection through texts were examined based on the contents generated by students in university lectures.Chapter 4 explored the possibility of ‘perspecting the world through texts’ by noting that the texts of the classical poetry there at that time can become the channel and methodology for reading the modern society here and now. The text of classical poetry works as a window to capture and reveal the hidden problems of the present, and through this, the subject has an opportunity to see through and criticize modern society. As in the case of self-reflection, the realization aspects of social perspective through text were checked for contents produced in university lectures.In this way, this study attempted to solve the problem in the direction of recovering and realizing the original value of the humanities in the reality that the entire humanities are being pushed to the brink of extinction. In response to the humanities’ inherent task of understanding human beings, we tried to come up with a concrete plan through the methods of self-reflection and world perspective, and to convey the possibility of change in both classical poetry and modern society.

AB  - The status or existence of the game within cultural content is never behind comparing with other ones. However, the researches on games in Korea are prejudiced, and, especially, a cultural discourse that recognizes and criticizes games as cultural texts in humanistic perspective is very absent. Therefore, in this study, it selected the research object which is recognized as well-made game and applied Roman Jacobson's communication theory to analyze its success factors. <The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt>, which was recorded high sales and won the most GOTY awards in 2015, was selected as an object of the study. Roman Jacobson mentioned that it needs six components, which consists of addresser, context, message, code, contact, and addressee, for taking place communication. When applying it to the game, each can be responded to that the addresser is a producer or game title, the addressee is a user, context is worldview or story, the message is a gameplay and subject consciousness, the contact is game device, the code is narrative. Excluding the addresser and addressee, the rest of them is as follows.

AB  - As a person who studies and teaches the philosophy of education, it is difficult to tell the so-called MZ generation that ancient Plato’s ideas remain valid for education. Plato asserts the theory of Ideas, which is a philosophical concept according to which the world we live in today is merely a reflection of some essential world and that life in this world must constantly seek what is real and essential. However, there seems to be no reason for today’s young people to be interested in what lies behind this phenomenon or transcendence. This is because to today’s young people who have learned the grammars of life according to which it is difficult to have their hard work rewarded adequately, who are accustomed to the way of survival and recognition through competition since childhood, the present happiness is their reality. This is because it is real to be faithful to and enjoy the present. However, when seeing ourselves living in the present, following the behavior of Deokhu while pursuing something, we can see the unique desire of human beings to assume a worldview that surpasses reality while enjoying the present. This article explores the cultural characteristics and worldview of generations indulging in subculture or B-class culture through Azuma Hiroki's database consumption generation analysis. Furthermore, it attempts to interpret human desires as existential desires and to connect them to the pursuit of a good life according to Plato’s dialogue <Protagoras>. Thus, while exploring whether this surveying technique can be valid for today's younger generation, which still desires to become a more valuable self, this article suggests a point that can be referred to in the teaching philosophy of education related to the value of life.

AB  - Agricultural reservoirs are an important water resource nationwide and vulnerable to abnormal climate effects such as drought caused by climate change. Therefore, it is required enhanced management for appropriate operation. Although water-level tracking is necessary through continuous monitoring, it is challenging to measure and observe on-site due to practical problems. This study presents an objective comparison between multiple AI models for water-body extraction using radar images that have the advantages of wide coverage, and frequent revisit time. The proposed methods in this study used Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images, and unlike common methods of water extraction based on optical images, they are suitable for long-term monitoring because they are less affected by the weather conditions. We built four AI models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) using drone images, sentinel-1 SAR and DSM data. There are total of 22 reservoirs of less than 1 million tons for the study, including small and medium-sized reservoirs with an effective storage capacity of less than 300,000 tons. 45 images from 22 reservoirs were used for model training and verification, and the results show that the AutoML model was 0.01 to 0.03 better in the water Intersection over Union (IoU) than the other three models, with Accuracy=0.92 and mIoU=0.81 in a test. As the result, AutoML performed as well as the classical machine learning methods and it is expected that the applicability of the water-body extraction technique by AutoML to monitor reservoirs automatically.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to compare the philosophy of Abraham Kuyper (1837–2020) and the German Catholic philosopher Franz von Baader (1765–1841), who provided the basis for Kuyper’s theory of Christian worldview. A recent study by J. Glenn Friesen highlighted von Baarder's philosophy in the study of Kuyper as one of his philosophical sources. First, in this paper, I summarize the characteristics of von Baarder's philosophy and then examine how Baarder's philosophy influenced Kuyper's ideas. Here, I pay attention to the 19th century Dutch Mediation theology to explain the relationship between von Baarder and Kuyper. Mediation theology, influenced by Schleiermacher and Kierkegaard, emphasized the inner dimension of faith rather than doctrine and church system, and argued that the Bible became the living word of God by reaching the inner side of the believer. Just as the Neoplatonism that led Augustine to Christianity, there was Mediation theology that led Kuyper to Calvinism. It was von Baarder who provided the philosophical foundation for this Mediation theology. In this respect, von Baader can be said to have provided an important source for the formation of Kuyper's unique Neo-Calvinist theology and Christian worldview. The conclusion of this paper comparing the ideas of von Baarder and Kuyper shows that Baarder's influence appears to Kuyper on three subjects. The themes are: first, Sphere sovereignty and an organic view of society, second, criticism of the autonomy of reason and the need for dualistic confrontation(Antithesis), and third, the need for Christian studies/university.

M3  - research-article
AB  - A world where the contradiction of the metaverse becomes non-contradiction has arrived. However, there is a tendency to ignore the metaverse because there is no place to learn the nature of the metaverse, the philosophy of the metaverse, or the ethics of the metaverse. Since the metaverse is not a simple device, it should not be approached from an instrumental point of view, but rather it should be understood from a conceptual point of view. Therefore, the role of literature is greater than ever. However, it would be more effective to go through other media with literary quality rather than simply the form of literature. It is Jazz. Because jazz, like the metaverse, is a contradiction in itself. Jazz improvisation makes us experience the virtuality, and jazz's impromptu performance becomes a level-shifting ability called contradiction practice, where one can understand ‘This side soon becomes the other, so the life of one of them is the life of the other’. The metaverse has its potential in the human brain's ability to form relationships that will be activated by recognizing these technological structures as natural and social environments. Since the brain's cognitive ability to displace real-simulation, this side-that side, and inside-outside is the key, the dichotomous worldview that has dominated mankind so far will be neutralized in the world of metaverse. In this paper, I suggest we need the power of the human brain to replace it. Consequently, I assert Jazz fosters this power.

M3  - research-article
AB  - This article is a research on postmodernism from the Christian worldview. Postmodernism has appeared as the alternative of modernism which has lost its credibility. In order to replace modernism, postmodernism came without losing the basic human centered ideal. It includes various expressions in culture, arts, philosophy, history, economics, architecture and literature, etc. By eliminating religious root and transcendent character, it also emphasizes more fragmented, subjective morality instead of consistent, objective one. Postmodernists have a special concern for the alienated and disregarded people who are poor and oppressed. Nevertheless, this worldview has many problems. This article, therefore, by using Herman Dooyeweerd’s transcendental critical method, takes a careful look at the background and the contents of this worldview and then mentions some representative thinkers. After that, not only its strong aspects but also its weak and self-contradictory points will be critically investigated. In conclusion, an attempt is made to offer alternatives to the weak points from the Christian worldview.

AB  - With the considerable advancement of remote sensing technology and computer vision, automatic scene understanding for very high-resolution aerial (VHR) imagery became a necessary research topic. Semantic segmentation of VHR imagery is an important task where context information plays a crucial role. Adequate feature delineation is difficult due to high-class imbalance in remotely sensed data. In this work, we proposed a variant of encoder-decoder-based architecture where residual attentive skip connections are incorporated. We added a multi-context block in each of the encoder units to capture multi-scale and multi-context features and used dense connections for effective feature extraction. A comprehensive set of experiments reveal that the proposed scheme outperformed recently published work by 3% in overall accuracy and F1 score for ISPRS Vaihingen and ISPRS Potsdam benchmark datasets.

AB  - The recent advances in machine learning and the availability of free and open big Earth data (e.g., Sentinel missions), which cover large areas with high spatial and temporal resolution, have enabled many agriculture monitoring applications. One example is the control of subsidy allocations of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Advanced remote sensing systems have been developed towards the large-scale evidencebased monitoring of the CAP. Nevertheless, the spatial resolution of satellite images is not always adequate to make accurate decisions for all fields. In this work, we introduce the notion of space-to-ground data availability, i.e., from the satellite to the field, in an attempt to make the best out of the complementary characteristics of the different sources. We present a space-toground dataset that contains Sentinel-1 radar and Sentinel-2 optical image time-series, as well as street-level images from the crowdsourcing platform Mapillary, for grassland fields in the area of Utrecht for 2017. The multifaceted utility of our dataset is showcased through the downstream task of grassland classification. We train machine and deep learning algorithms on these different data domains and highlight the potential of fusion techniques towards increasing the reliability of decisions.

AB  - Modern Earth Observation optical satellite systems, such as Airbus's Pleiades Neo (PNeo) push the boundaries of high spatial resolution by providing commercial imagery products with up to 30cm ground sampling distance (GSD). To further enhance the quality of the images, the in-space imaging system is usually complemented by on-ground image restoration processing, such as deconvolution and denoising (Latry et al., 2012). Recent advances leverage Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to improve the image restoration quality (K. Zhang et al., 2021a).Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR), or Zoom, the process of obtaining a higher resolution (HR) image from a lower resolved (LR) source, has recently gained traction for both medium resolution sensors such as Sentinel 2 (Lanaras et al., 2018) and high resolution such as Pleiades and GeoEye-1 (Zhu et al., 2020). This process further enhances the resolution of the image to improve downstream applications such as mapping (L. Zhang et al., 2021) and small objects recognition (Shermeyer and Van Etten, 2019). While SISR for remote sensing has been successfully tackled using CNNs (Rohith and Kumar, 2021) the main challenge for reaching acceptable image quality performance lies in the generation of realistic LR/HR training pairs (K. Zhang et al., 2021b).In this paper, we propose:a dedicated simulation chain leveraging extremely-high-resolution (EHR) aerial imagery to generate realistic 30cm Pleiades Neo images and their corresponding fully restored HR equivalent at 15cm GSDA residual-based CNN architecture which we train to jointly restore and zoom the imagesAll contributions are assessed on real PNEO images. We deployed the trained models in a production context, to enhance the full Pleiades Neo products - with a swath of 47k pixels - in an efficient and scalable manner.

The method considers a set of multitemporal images in a given region of interest together with the corresponding cloud masks, and delivers a cloud-free image for a specific day of the year. We propose the combination of an encoder-decoder model employing axial attention layers for the estimation of the low-resolution cloud-free image, together with a fully parallel upsampler that reconstructs the image at full resolution. The method is compared with various baselines and state-of-the-art methods on two Sentinel-2 datasets, showing significant improvements across multiple standard metrics used for image quality assessment.

TI  - CANCEL CULTURE IN WORLD POLITICS: HISTORICAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL ROOTS
T2  - POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - In the West, 'cancel culture,' which is spreading at the speed of an epidemic, has been turned into a mechanism for applying a 'new ethics.' Despite the fact that the concept of 'cancel culture' remains opportunistic, it has become necessary to identify the subject of research of this phenomenon from the standpoint of political science and methods of historical and philosophical deconstruction in order to understand: what is the genesis and true meaning of the cancel culture and why it has so widely and promptly acquired such an influence on world politics? The hypothesis is that cancel culture is connected by a sociogenetic code with the evolution (moreover, mutation) of the deep meanings of European culture, dating back to the sacralization of antique rituals, Aristotelian 'tertium non datur' principle, the ideology of the Crusades, to the 'contractual truth' of Karl Popper's positivist 'contractual truth' that gave rise to Soros-type 'open society' cultural universalism. New media, and social networking par excellence, have become instruments of pressure through a cancel culture at the international level. The coronavirus pandemic has highlighted the depth of the crisis of the Open society social project and globalization, understood as leveling the values of national cultures, including political ones, in congruency with the standards of the American worldview. The measures taken by Russia, China, and a number of other countries to protect their axiological sovereignty led to a tough reaction from the West in the form of 'fencing off' and a scheme of 'punishment' similar to the 'canceling of Hollywood movie stars,' that is, treating the 'dissident' countries as rogue states, interfering with the 'effective' project of 'democratic globalization up to the declaration of 'dissident countries' as rogue states interfering with the 'effective' project of 'democratic globalization'. In this discussion article, the author considers ways to neutralize attempts to 'cancel Russian culture' and proves that Russia has a 'firewall' in the form of traditional values opposing the 'new ethics' as well as in the form of creating new ties and open platforms for interaction at the international level. At the same time, it is in Russia's interests to avoid self-isolation from the West and build relations with it, combining the protection of value sovereignty and the media environment with balanced strategic empathy in order to avoid a catastrophic escalation of events towards nuclear war threshold.

AB  - Tombs, the resting places of the dead, are significant sites that reflect the wealth, power, religious beliefs, ideas, and events of the people related to life and death at the time. From this perspective, this study examined Neolithic burial remains in the Maritime Territory(Primorsky Kray), Sanjiang Plain (Lake Xingkai; Khanka), and the east coast area of the Korean Peninsula, and then inferred social aspects for each site and region.First, it is estimated that in the remains of Maritime Territory and the Lake Xingkai basin, an afterlife worldview that was more faithful to human or group norms than nature was established, whereas, in the Korean Peninsula, a notion that valued nature, especially the sea, was formed. In addition, the burial remains generally fulfilled functions such as marking territory, creating a sanctuary, and maintaining the unity and identity of the community, but it is considered that in the northeastern region, they were focused on remembrance and worship for ancestors, whereas in the Korean peninsula, an emphasis was put on worship for or praying for good luck to the living base (the sea). It is likely that each group had evolved a similar but different aspect depending on the situation and adaptation process they were in.Next, in the society at that time, it seems that roles were divided between men and women or between members, and a group or community was led by a person or people who had the upper hand in a specific ability or blood relationship, in a relatively equal structure without a hierarchy.Finally, the burial remains from the early phase to the first phase in the Neolithic period in Far East Asia adjacent to the East Sea are judged to be the outcome of the acceptance and change of the burial customs of the previous period according to the circumstances of each group, with the establishment of the tradition of Northeast Asian flat-bottomed pottery with pressed patterns and raised patterns.

AB  - There is a need in the oceanographic community for a generalized data collocation capability for satellite and/or in situ observations that is publicly accessible and provides flexibility and reproducibility for use cases ranging from open science to satellite retrieval calibration and validation. The Cloud-based Data Match-Up Service (CDMS) is a collaborative effort between NASA JPL, COAPS, NCAR, and Saildrone to address this need. With an exponential increase in the volume of satellite data, the CDMS architecture is designed to be scalable and to leverage the elasticity of the cloud. The differences between remote sensing data at various data processing levels and the heterogeneous nature of in situ data makes developing a generic system challenging, but CDMS is designed with the consideration of making it possible to efficiently onboard new datasets. This paper describes the architecture and technologies behind CDMS and provides details on how the data match-up implementation is validated.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing technology has been a popular tool with high potential to measure chlorophyll-a concentration in inland waters. This study proposed the band ratio algorithm to estimate the chlorophyll-a concentration in inland water using a machine learning approach. The blue-green, NIR-red band ratios, and the three-band models were sensitive to chlorophyll-a concentration in various water bodies. Various band ratio variables were used to obtain the optimum model for chlorophyll-a estimation in multiple tropical reservoirs. The spectral reflectance in the tropical reservoirs was derived from Sentinel-2 Level 2A. The corresponded reflectance of band ratios and in-situ chlorophyll-a data (N = 109) were applied to identify the correlation and thus justified its potential as appropriate inputs in the machine learning model. Result shows that the NIR-red band ratios are strongly correlated with chlorophyll-a concentration. These spectral band ratios are appropriate inputs for the machine learning model. The effective multiple band ratios are determined from correlation (r > 0.5 between ratios and concentrations) and collinearity test (variance inflation factor, VIF<3). Result confirms that the multiple band ratio algorithm represents a superior performance in increasing the accuracy of each machine learning model. Overall, the random forest provides a robust and reliable estimation using the three-band NIR-red, and blue-green band ratios (RMSE = 2.963 mu g/L, r(2) = 0.955).

This paper presents the results of a case study focused on exploring how the meanings of nature and socioecological relationships relate to each other in an indigenous population. The first part of the article explains the theoretical scaffolding used to collect and analyse data, based on ecological anthropology and Ogden and Richards' semiotic scheme. The second part describes the methodological procedures and the first findings, that is, the elements and dimensions that integrate the meanings of nature and land for the inhabitants of this population. It is also explained how those meanings are built and how they are fused to local socioecological relationships in an ontological way. The findings reveal that the inhabitants of this community configure their meanings of 'nature' from multiple references of biological, spiritual, axiological, and cultural character, often represented by its referent 'land'. The notion of 'nature' (as land) is created from subjective and social experiences with the environment and the territory, and in turn provides meaning to the biocultural identity of the population. However, historical learning, worldview, and social organization also emerge as the main structuring elements of the social meanings of nature and land.

AB  - This work describes the design, implementation and validation of the Black Sea physics analysis and forecasting system, developed by the Black Sea Physics production unit within the Black Sea Monitoring and Forecasting Center as part of the Copernicus Marine Environment and Monitoring Service. The system provides analyses and forecasts of the temperature, salinity, sea surface height, mixed layer depth and currents for the whole Black Sea basin, excluding the Azov Sea, and has been operational since 2016. The system is composed of the NEMO (v 3.4) numerical model and an OceanVar scheme, which brings together real time observations (in-situ temperature and salinity profiles, sea level anomaly and sea surface temperature satellite data). An operational quality assessment framework is used to evaluate the accuracy of the products which set the basic standards for the future upgrades, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of the model and the observing system in the Black Sea.

AB  - In this work is presented a new adversarial training framework for deep learning neural networks for super-resolution of Sentinel 2 images, exploiting the data fusion techniques on 10 and 20 meters bands. The proposed scheme is fully convolutional and tries to answer the need for generalization in scale, producing realistic and detailed accurate images. Furthermore, the presence of a L-1 loss limits the instability of GAN training, limiting possible problems of spectral distortion. In our preliminary experiments, the GAN training scheme has shown comparable results in comparison with the baseline approach.

TI  - Pansharpening by Convolutional Neural Networks in the Full Resolution Framework
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, there has been a growing interest in deep learning-based pansharpening. Thus far, research has mainly focused on architectures. Nonetheless, model training is an equally important issue. A first problem is the absence of ground truths, unavoidable in pansharpening. This is often addressed by training networks in a reduced-resolution domain and using the original data as ground truth, relying on an implicit scale invariance assumption. However, on full-resolution images, results are often disappointing, suggesting such invariance not to hold. A further problem is the scarcity of training data, which causes a limited generalization ability and a poor performance on off-training-test images. In this article, we propose a full-resolution training framework for deep learning-based pansharpening. The framework is fully general and can be used for any deep learning-based pansharpening model. Training takes place in the high-resolution domain, relying only on the original data, thus avoiding any loss of information. To ensure spectral and spatial fidelity, a suitable two-component loss is defined. The spectral component enforces consistency between the pansharpened output and the low-resolution multispectral input. The spatial component, computed at high resolution, maximizes the local correlation between each pansharpened band and the panchromatic input. At testing time, the target-adaptive operating modality is adopted, achieving good generalization with a limited computational overhead. Experiments carried out on WorldView-3, WorldView-2, and GeoEye-1 images show that methods trained with the proposed framework guarantee a pretty good performance in terms of both full-resolution numerical indexes and visual quality.

CP  - 47th IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)

AB  - The massive development of remote sensing allowed many novel applications which bring new challenges. In particular, some applications such as marine observation require a good spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution. In order to tackle the last issue, spatio-temporal fusion of remote sensing data allows to complete a time series of multispectral images from, e.g., hyperspectral images. In this paper, we propose a new deep learning approach to that end. Our main contribution lies in the error completion task which allows to improve the completion performance. We show that our proposed method is able to produce high fidelity predictions with better quality indices than state-of-the-art methods on true images taken from the CIA / LGC database and Sentinel-2 / Sentinel-3 data.

TI  - Using Sentinel 2 satellite images for estimating the spatial and altitudinal distribution of the coniferous and deciduous species of the Eastern Carpathians of Romania
T2  - PRESENT ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The morphometric characteristics of the terrestrial surface -especially the terrain elevation -are a determining climatogenetic factor, especially in the areas with a high degree of fragmentation such as mountainous areas. Terrain elevation and fragmentation, slope, as well as the orientation of the slopes have an important impact on the local climate. Thus, the morphoclimatic variability is reflected in the stratified distribution of the vegetation, determining the existence of the vegetal associations specific to each climatic area, more thermophilic species being specific to low terrain elevations. Using high resolution satellite images such as Sentinel 2, the spatial distribution of the tree species can be mapped, for very large areas of interest. State of the art classification algorithms were used to extract and classify the forest cover. The resulted layer was used to determine the preferred morphometric conditions for the deciduous and the coniferous tree species within the study area.

TI  - Axillary Reverse Mapping in the Prevention of Lymphoedema: A Systematic Review and Pooled Analysis
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: This is a systematic review of randomized controlled tr ials (RCT) compar ing the use of axillary reverse mapping (ARM) with conventional technique for axillary dissection (AD) in breast cancer surgery. Methods: This review was written in line with the PRISMA protocol. Articles were retrieved from PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL and Cochrane databases, using keywords "axillary reverse mapping" and "axillary lymph node dissection". Non-RCT were excluded. Abstracts were screened independently by 2 reviewers. Data from eligible studies were retrieved for qualitative synthe-sis and pooled analysis. 73 publications were identified for initial screening. Results: 68 articles were excluded from analysis according to the pre-defined systematic review protocol. 5 RCTS with 1696 subjects were included for analy-sis. 802 patients received ARM, 894 patients received AD. Pooled ARM node detection rate was 84.9% (Range 79.2 -94.9%). There was a lower rate of post-operative lymphedema in ARM group patients across all 5 RCTs. The pooled lymphedema incidence in the ARM group was 4.8% (37/766) when compared to 18.8% (164/873) in the AD group ( P < .0001). Axillary recurrence rate with median followof 37 months was 1.03% (8/778) in the ARM group, which was identical to 1.03% (9/870) in the AD group ( P = 1). Conclusion: ARM resulted in decreased incidence of lymphedema. There was no significant increase in axillary recurrence at 37 months post-operation.

TI  - Hybrid DNN-Dirichlet Anomaly Detection and Ranking: Case of Burned Areas Discovery
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the past decade, anomaly detection has experienced an expanding attraction in satellite data analysis. Monitoring wildfire dynamics plays a substantial part in global land management, i.e., to detect and determine the expansion of such areas, estimate the deterioration of forest regions, and assist the intervention plan. In this article, we proposed an approach for Sentinel-2 scenes that detects anomalies in burned area contexts using a rank-ordered method on a single post-event image. We adopted a self-supervised paradigm in learning image representations by training a deep convolutional model to differentiate in a series of geometric transformations. Dirichlet distributions are selected as priors to characterize the variability of the random multinomial distribution in multispectral data. Dirichlet precision parameters are computed from observed data and are used to construct a ranking function that quantifies the degree of anomaly in data based on the softmax responses given by the trained classifier. We evaluated the performance of the proposed method through a cumulative effort of two remote sensing tasks, namely, open-set detection (i.e., test datasets contain classes unseen at the training time) and location separation (i.e., test datasets include images from distinct spatial location than the training images). The experiments were performed on three different datasets, BigEarthNet, and two actual burned area Sentinel-2 datasets from predisposed zones to fire events, Australia and Bolivia. We achieved in all test datasets state-of-the-art performance, considering the substantial and diversified types of natural anomalies in multispectral data.

AB  - Precipitation measurement is an important prior for several operational and scientific applications, including weather forecasting, hazard prevention, agriculture, etc. Weather radars, such as NEXRAD, observe the air volume reflectivity and infer precipitation intensity at high resolution. However, their capabilities are limited over the ocean. C-band SAR imagery, which is sensitive to ocean surface roughness, is known to be sensitive to the effect of rain. In this study, we improve existing NEXRAD/Sentinel-1 collocations and train a U-Net deep learning model to estimate NEXRAD radar reflectivity from Sentinel-1 observations. Precipitation forecasts are returned as segmentations with thresholds at 1, 3 and 10 mm/hr. The results indicate high performance over a wide range of wind speeds and thus can provide an accurate estimate of precipitation in the absence of weather radar.

AB  - The issue of accurate identification of the Earth's surface features from the very high spatial resolution (VHSR) satellite imagery has been a major area of interest within the field of remote sensing. Vegetation indices obtained from the remotely sensed imagery have long been used as a simple but effective tool for quantitative and qualitative identification of land surface materials. In this study, a new vegetation index called Poplar Tree Index (PTI) was introduced for the identification of poplar (Populus) tree cultivated field from the WorldView-3 imagery having unique features including 31cm panchromatic resolution and super-spectral resolutions. To test its capability in distinguishing poplar cultivated fields from the other cultivated fields, four well-known vegetation indices were also utilized, and their performances were quantitatively analyzed based on the separability measures (i.e., Bhattacharyya Distance and M-Statistic). Results revealed that the use of PTI significantly increased the discrimination level of pixels representing poplar planted areas from maize and hazelnuts.

TI  - Validation of Soil Moisture Data Products From the NASA SMAP Mission
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission has been validating its soil moisture (SM) products since the start of data production on March 31, 2015. Prior to launch, the mission defined a set of criteria for core validation sites (CVS) that enable the testing of the key mission SM accuracy requirement (unbiased root-mean-square error <0.04 m(3)/m(3)). The validation approach also includes other ("sparse network") in situ SM measurements, satellite SM products, model-based SM products, and field experiments. Over the past six years, the SMAP SM products have been analyzed with respect to these reference data, and the analysis approaches themselves have been scrutinized in an effort to best understand the products' performance. Validation of the most recent SMAP Level 2 and 3 SM retrieval products (R17000) shows that the L-band (1.4 GHz) radiometer-based SM record continues to meet mission requirements. The products are generally consistent with SM retrievals from the European Space Agency Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity mission, although there are differences in some regions. The high-resolution (3-km) SM retrieval product, generated by combining Copernicus Sentinel-1 data with SMAP observations, performs within expectations. Currently, however, there is limited availability of 3-km CVS data to support extensive validation at this spatial scale. The most recent (version 5) SMAP Level 4 SM data assimilation product providing surface and root-zone SM with complete spatio-temporal coverage at 9-km resolution also meets performance requirements. The SMAP SM validation program will continue throughout the mission life; future plans include expanding it to forested and high-latitude regions.

TI  - A Deep Learning Approach to Mapping Irrigation Using Landsat: IrrMapper U-Net
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate maps of irrigation are essential for understanding and managing water resources. We present a new method of mapping irrigation based on an ensemble of convolutional neural networks that use reflectance information from Landsat imagery to classify irrigated pixels. The methodology does not rely on extensive feature engineering and does not condition the classification with land-use information from existing geospatial datasets. The ensemble does not need exhaustive hyperparameter tuning, and the analysis pipeline is lightweight enough to be implemented on a personal computer. Furthermore, the proposed methodology provides an estimate of the uncertainty associated with the classification. We evaluated our methodology and the resulting irrigation maps using a highly accurate novel spatially explicit ground-truth dataset, using county-scale United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) surveys of irrigation extent, and using cadastral surveys. We demonstrate the accuracy of the method by mapping irrigation over the state of Montana from 2000 to 2019. We found that our method outperforms other methods that use satellite remote-sensing information in terms of overall accuracy (OA) and precision. We found that our method agrees better statewide with the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Survey estimates of irrigated areas compared to other methods and has far fewer errors of commission in rainfed agriculture areas. This methodology has the potential to be applied across the entire United States and for the complete Landsat record.

AB  - Coastal interfaces are subject to an unprecedented rate of risks, gathering waves and rainfalls' hazards, human assets' densification, sea-level rise and precipitation intensification. Their sound management requires iterative observation at the highest possible spatial resolution. Sentinel-2 (S-2), provided with 13 spectral bands, datasets leverage high temporal resolution (one week) but spatial resolution (from 60 to 10 m) often remains too coarse to finely classify and monitor the coastal patches. PlanetScope-2 (PS-2) imagery benefits from very high temporal resolution (<one week) and high spatial resolution (3 m) for its blue-green-red-near-infrared dataset.This research paper proposes to, first, downscale 12 S-2 bands (cirrus S10 being evicted) by using neural network (NN) regressions built on the 4 PS-2 bands following two methods, and second, evaluate the NN classification performance of the 12-band datasets at 3 m for mapping 8 common coastal classes on a representative site (Brittany, France). Straightforward and stepwise downscaling procedures, respectively based on 12 and 22 NN regressions, generated very good performances (R-test(2) =0.92 +/- 0.02 and 0.95 +/- 0.01, respectively). The 3-m NN classifications were considerably improved by the number of spectral bands (overall accuracy, OA, of the 4 bands: 48.12%) but also the precision of the downscaling (OA of the straightforward and stepwise downscaling: 75.25% and 93.57%, respectively). For the best classification, examination of the contribution of the individual bands revealed that S5, S7, S1, S9, S6 and S8A were meaningful (62.42, 55.02, 50.82, 46.4, 45.1, 31.02%, respectively), contrary to S12, S11 and S12 (12.47, 0 and 0%, respectively).

AB  - This study aims to introduce a semi-automatic classification workflow for the production of a land use/land cover (LULC) map of the island of Sardinia (Italy) following the CORINE legend schema, and a ground spatial resolution compatible with a scale of 1:25.000. The classification is based on free high-resolution satellite imagery from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 collected in 2020, ancillary data derived from Sardinian Geoportal, Joint Research Centre (JRC) and OpenStreetMap. The LULC map production includes three steps: 1) pixel-based classification, realized with two different approaches, that use i) information derived from existing thematic maps eventually re-coded in case of incoherencies observed between datasets and/or satellite data products, and ii) spectral indices and parameter thresholds defined on the basis of multitemporal analysis; 2) segmentation of Sentinel-1 and 2 annual composites, and pre-labelling of segments with the pixel-based classified map, obtaining the preliminary map; 3) visual inspection procedure in order to confirm, or re-assign, classes to polygons. The accuracy of the preliminary map was tested in a sample area and on specific class of non-irrigated crops through ground truth data collected from a detailed photo-interpretation, estimating 97% of overall accuracy. The results show a great improvement from existing thematic maps in terms of detail, with the possibility of a yearly updating of the map via automatic processes. However, some limitations were found, due to the high fragmentation of Sardinian landscape and the high variety of crop types and agricultural practices, that could affect the efficiency of the classifier.

TI  - Reduction in Vaccine HPV Type Infections in a Young Women Group (18-25 Years) Five Years after HPV Vaccine Introduction in Colombia
T2  - CANCER PREVENTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In Colombia, the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine was launched in 2012 in the context of a school-based national vaccination program targeting girls ages 9 to 14 and offering catch-up vaccination for girls ages 14 to 17. In this study, we evaluated the program's impact on typespecific HPV infection by comparing HPV cervical prevalence among vaccinated and nonvaccinated women. This is a comparative cross-sectional study conducted 5 years after the quadrivalent HPV vaccination implementation in a sentinel Colombian City. This study included young women (18-25 years old) who had been vaccinated in the catch-up group and were attending universities and technical institutions, and women who attended primary health care facilities for Pap smear screening. The HPV prevalence of 1,287 unvaccinated women was compared with the prevalence of 1,986 vaccinated women. The prevalence of HPV16/18 infections was significantly lower in vaccinated compared with unvaccinated women (6.5% vs. 15.4%; P < 0.001), whereas for HPV6/11 infections, a decrease of 63.7% in vaccinated women (1.02% vs. 2.81%) was observed. The adjusted effectiveness to HPV16/18 was 61.4%; 95% CI, 54.3%67.6%. However, the effectiveness against HPV16/18 was significantly higher among women vaccinated before their sexual debut 91.5%; 95% CI, 86.8-94.5, compared with effectiveness for vaccination after their sexual debut, 36.2%; 95% CI, 23.6-46.7. Five years after the introduction of HPV vaccines in Colombia, high effectiveness of HPV to prevent HPV16/18 infections is observed in the catch-up cohorts including virgin and sexually active women.Prevention Relevance: Monitoring HPV vaccines post-licensure plays an important role in assessing the progress of immunization programs, demonstrating the impact of vaccines on the population, and providing data for policy needs. In Colombia, HPV vaccines showed effectiveness when administered before start of sexual activity, and two doses are sufficient to achieve good protection.

AB  - This contribution presents preliminary results of a reflectarray antenna to generate a multi-spot coverage from a LEO satellite for 5G and Beyond-5G communications. The reflectarray is proposed to generate the complete multi-spot coverage at 18.2 GHz for the user's downlinks The phase distributions on the reflectarray surface have been optimized to broaden the beams at the same time as reducing the distortion of the beams at the edge of the coverage. The antenna performance of a standard reflectarray (with a conventional phase distribution to focus pencil beams) and the proposed reflectarray have been compared by simulated results. The simulations show that the proposed reflectarray can generate a continuous coverage of 36 beams with an End-Of-Coverage level of 26 dBi.

T2  - EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - State and local health departments established the California Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Respiratory Virus Sentinel Surveillance System to conduct enhanced surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens at sentinel outpatient testing sites in 10 counties throughout California, USA. We describe results obtained during May 10, 2020-June 12, 2021, and compare persons with positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR results by using Poisson regression. We detected SARS-CoV-2 in 1,696 (19.6%) of 8,662 specimens. Among 7,851 specimens tested by respiratory panel, rhinovirus/enterovirus was detected in 906 (11.5%) specimens and other respiratory pathogens in 136 (1.7%) specimens. We also detected 23 co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 and another pathogen. SARS-CoV-2 positivity was associated with male participants, an age of 35-49 years, Latino race/ethnicity, obesity, and work in transportation occupations. Sentinel surveillance can provide useful virologic and epidemiologic data to supplement other disease monitoring activities and might become increasingly useful as routine testing decreases.

AB  - Access to electricity is crucial for poverty reduction and economic growth. However, almost 759 million people still do not have access to electricity. More than 90% are located in the global South, where low-income countries struggle to provide clean, reliable, and affordable energy sources to ameliorate the basic living standards. Even though there are many opportunities to provide basic electrification in these settings, the lack of reliable and updated information about electrification has become one of the main challenges for policymakers and developers to better plan grid extensions and prioritize communities with higher needs. The increasing availability of remote sensing data has created opportunities to obtain information about electricity access at a larger and quicker scale. Using ground truth data of 57k distribution transformer locations from Kenya, we present a processing pipeline to validate and compare state-of-the-art techniques that use very high resolution (VHR) daytime imagery (50cm. Digital Globe) or low-resolution nightlight (NTL) imagery (450m VIIRS-DNB) to identify electricity access. Further, we propose a supervised-learning approach called PowerScour that outperforms three techniques from the commercial, scientific and public fields. By assessing the trade-offs between temporal and spatial resolution and comparing population and settlement patterns, we find that PowerScour improves the F1-score of existing techniques by up to approximate to 27% in deep rural areas. In Kenya, our model correctly identified approximate to 73.4% of places with and without access to electricity between 2013 and 2017. All data processing and modeling scripts are available at https://github.com/santiagocorrea/PowerScour.

TI  - A Multi-Year Study of GOES-13 Droplet Effective Radius Retrievals for Warm Clouds over South America and Southeast Pacific
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Geostationary satellites can retrieve the cloud droplet effective radius (re) but suffer biases from cloud inhomogeneities, internal retrieval nonlinearities, and 3-D scattering/shadowing from neighboring clouds, among others. A 1-D retrieval method was applied to Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite 13 (GOES-13) imagery, over large areas in South America (5 & LCIRC; N-30 & LCIRC; S; 20 & LCIRC;-70 & LCIRC; W), the Southeast Pacific (5 & LCIRC; N-30 & LCIRC; S; 70 & LCIRC;-120 & LCIRC; W), and the Amazon (2 & LCIRC; N-7 & LCIRC; S; 54 & LCIRC;-73 & LCIRC; W), for four months in each year from 2014-2017. Results were compared against in situ aircraft measurements and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer cloud product for Terra and Aqua satellites. Monthly regression parameters approximately followed a seasonal pattern. With up to 108,009 of matchups, slope, intercept, and correlation for Terra (Aqua) ranged from about 0.71 to 1.17, -2.8 to 2.5 mu m, and 0.61 to 0.91 (0.54 to 0.78, -1.5 to 1.8 mu m, 0.63 to 0.89), respectively. We identified evidence for re overestimation (underestimation) correlated with shadowing (enhanced reflectance) in the forward (backscattering) hemisphere, and limitations to illumination and viewing configurations accessible by GOES-13, depending on the time of day and season. A proposition is hypothesized to ameliorate 3-D biases by studying relative illumination and cloud spatial inhomogeneity.

TI  - Comprehensive Direct Georeferencing of Aerial Images for Unmanned Aerial Systems Applications
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical image sensors are the most common remote sensing data acquisition devices present in Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS). In this context, assigning a location in a geographic frame of reference to the acquired image is a necessary task in the majority of the applications. This process is denominated direct georeferencing when ground control points are not used. Despite it applies simple mathematical fundamentals, the complete direct georeferencing process involves much information, such as camera sensor characteristics, mounting measurements, attitude and position of the UAS, among others. In addition, there are many rotations and translations between the different reference frames, among many other details, which makes the whole process a considerable complex operation. Another problem is that manufacturers and software tools may use different reference frames posing additional difficulty when implementing the direct georeferencing. As this information is spread among many sources, researchers may face difficulties on having a complete vision of the method. In fact, there is absolutely no paper in the literature that explain this process in a comprehensive way. In order to supply this implicit demand, this paper presents a comprehensive method for direct georeferencing of aerial images acquired by cameras mounted on UAS, where all required information, mathematical operations and implementation steps are explained in detail. Finally, in order to show the practical use of the method and to prove its accuracy, both simulated and real flights were performed, where objects of the acquired images were georeferenced.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluated the influence of the urban expansion in the socio-economic, demographic and environmental indicators in the City of Arapiraca, Brazil, based on orbital products and multivariate analysis. It was used the remote data (Land Use and Land Cover - LULC, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, and Land Surface Temperature) between 1985 and 2017 from Landsat sensors, followed by Climatologies at High Resolution product for the Earth's Land Surface Areas (CHELSA) data (temperature and rainfall), population density, per capita income, Human Development Index (HDI), and tobacco production. It was applied the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on joint data. Based on PCA results, appointed that two PC corresponds to 100% of the variance explained. The socio-economic variables (population and population density and HDI) compose the PC1, with 75.86% of the variance explained. The environmental variables (rainfall, temperature, and NDVI) compose the PC2, with 24.14% of the variance explained. Land Use Land Cover classes showed a substantial change over 30 years in agriculture and pasture classes areas of 85.93%, while the urban infrastructure jumped to 349.92% (from 8.62 km(2) to 30.16 km(2)). This decline is associated with reducing tobacco cultivation, and government programs have accentuated environmental degradation via urbanization in recent decades.

AB  - The data for this study and represented in this file were obtained from several sources. Data on reindeer populations throughout Norway were obtained from annual reports submitted by herders for 78 populations covering a majority of the Norwegian reindeer herding area (Tveraa et al., 2007). Reindeer populations were grouped into ten management regions as in Tveraa et al. (2014). Population density was included as an area-adjusted predictor, calculated as a herds population size divided by the area of that herds summer pasture land in square kilometres. The previous autumn/winter average juvenile slaughter weight was used as a measure of herd body condition previous to birth, as per Tveraa et al. (2014). Plant productivity was measured by the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for locations within the herds summer grazing land, data for which were collected by the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) instrument deployed on a satellite system and available for full years since 1982. Average altitudes of the areas from which NDVI values were taken were also recorded. NDVI values were recorded twice a month, and the average NDVI value for all pixels (each pixel is 1km2) within a herds summer pasture was calculated for each time point. The average altitude, latitude, and longitude of the summer pastures were calculated for each herd using the GRASS GIS software. Availability of high-quality forage for reindeer was measured by the day of the year (DOY) when the maximum NDVI value first occurred for each herds location and each year. Spring onset for each year and each herds location was considered as the DOY when NDVI first reached 50% of its yearly maximum. Both the DOY when maximum NDVI occurred and spring onset were calculated from the AVHRR data. Daily snow depth (mm) for each of the herding districts from 1984 to 2013 were obtained from the Norwegian Meteorological Institute. The area under the spline curve (AUC) of ground snow depth was calculated for each year at the summer grazing pastures using daily snow depth values from September to September. The onset of winter for a given year was defined as the first DOY which had at least two consecutive weeks of snow on the ground (snow depth 0 mm).

TI  - HISTORIC LAND COVER CHANGE ASSESSMENT OF CHILEAN MEDITERRANEAN COAST: DID FOREST PLANTATIONS REALLY CAUSED FRAGMENTATION?

AB  - Currently, the Mediterranean coast of Chile has large areas of commercial pine and eucalyptus plantations. Several authors have reported habitat loss and fragmentation of the original "Maulino" native forest due to the expansion of plantations. However, in the Maule coast took place a previous process that affected the native forest. This is the extensive use of forestlands with a moderate slope for the cultivation of wheat. The peak of this process occurred in the second half of the 19th century and meant a great degradation of the soil in the area. In this work, we first look for whether the overexploitation of wheat is the primary cause of the fragmentation of the Maulino forest in the study area. Secondly, we wanted to determine what proportion of the area currently occupied by plantations was previously used for growing wheat. First, using the community of Constitucion as a representative area of the central coast we use Species Distribution Modelling to identify the potential original extent of the Maulino forest. Secondly, we created a spatial model to estimate the extension of wheat production using historical data. Finally, we used Landsat-8 images to assess the actual extension of forest plantation. By comparing the three former results, we were able to quantify the effects of wheat production and forest plantation separately, for the first time. The results indicate that 41% of the original native forest was first affected by wheat production and that only 34 % was later replaced by forest plantations. Therefore, the rest of the plantations were installed in places where the forest had previously been cut down for use in wheat production. The main cause of deforestation and forest fragmentation in this landscape was originally the wheat extensive production boosted by the gold rush in California and Australia. Forest commercial plantations further augmented the Maulino forest fragmentation process by significantly reducing its mean patch size and increasing the number of patches.

TI  - Calculation of Fireline Intensity Using Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems: 2021 Milas-Karacahisar Fire
T2  - KASTAMONU UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF FORESTRY FACULTY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim of the study: The objective of this study is to calculate fireline intensity using remote sensing and geographic information systems, to investigate relationship between fireline intensity and VIIRS active fire data, and to develop a practical fireline intensity estimation model. Material and methods: The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) active fire/hotspot data provided by Suomi National Polar Orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA-20) satellites were used to estimate the rate of fire spread. Fuel consumption was estimated using Sentinel-2 images, stand type maps and surface and available crown fuel loading models for Turkish red pine (Pinus brutia Ten.). The fireline intensity was then calculated using Byram's (1959) fireline intensity equation. Main results: The results indicated that the number of VIIRS active fire data was well correlated with fireline intensity, rate of fire spread and fuel consumption. The calculated fireline intensity ranged between 175.0 and 47597.2 kW/m with an average value of 9280.4 kW/m. The number of VIIRS active fire data alone explained 72% of the variation in fireline intensity. Highlights: Satellite based products can be effectively used to calculate fireline intensity through estimating rate of fire spread and fuel consumption easily and effectively in burned areas.

AB  - Portugal produced a land cover map for 2018 based on Sentinel-2 data and represents 13 classes, including agriculture, six tree forest species, and shrubland. The map was updated for 2020. The strategy focused on three strata where annual changes occur: S1 (agriculture) due to crop rotation, S2 (forest and shrubland) due to wildfires and clear-cuts, and S3 (fire scars and clear-cuts of previous years) where vegetation regeneration occurs. The methodology included i) change detection, ii) classification, and iii) knowledge-based rules. Stratum S1 was classified with images of the entire 2020 crop year and a training dataset extracted from the national Land Parcel Identification Systems (LPIS) of 2020. The land cover nomenclature was expanded and class agriculture was split in three distinct classes, hence resulting a map with 15 classes in total. Change detection, implemented in stratum S2, analyzed the profile of NDVI since 2018 to find potential loss of vegetation. S2 and S3 were classified through two stages. First, images of the entire 2020 crop year were used and then data of October 2020 (end of crop year) to capture late changes. The training points of the 2018 land cover map were used, but only if not associated with NDVI change. For all the three strata, knowledge-based rules corrected misclassifications and ensured consistency between the maps. A comparison between 2018 and 2020 reveal important land cover dynamics related to vegetation loss and regeneration on similar to 5% of the country.

AB  - Costa, JA, Brito, J, Nakamura, FY, Figueiredo, P, and Rebelo, A. Using the rating of perceived exertion and heart rate to quantify training intensity in female soccer players: validity and utility. J Strength Cond Res 36(1): 201-206, 2022-The aims of this study were as follows: (a) to analyze associations between session rating of perceived exertion (sRPE) and training impulse (TRIMP); (b) to verify whether significantly different ranges of percentage of heart rate peak (%HRpeak) would be reached in each discrete RPE category; and (c) to investigate the amount of time spent >90% of HRpeak and associated intraplayer and interplayer variability during soccer technical training sessions with similar contents and duration. This was a single-group observational study that measured the internal training load during 6 weeks of the competitive period in 17 high-level female soccer players. All training sessions started around 9 pm. and lasted on average 94 +/- 5 minutes. During each training session, RPE, sRPE, TRIMP, HRex (%HRpeak), and time spent at >90% of HRpeak were assessed. A very large correlation was found between sRPE and TRIMP (r = 0.78; 95% confidence interval: [0.74-0.82]). Significant differences were observed between %HRpeak associated with each RPE value (i.e., RPE = 2 arbitrary unit [68%; 65-69% of %HRpeak]; RPE 3 [72%; 69-75%]; RPE 4 [79%; 76-82%]; RPE 5 [84; 81-87%]; chi(2) = 73.34; df = 3; P < 0.001). Intraplayer and interplayer coefficients of variation for the time spent >90% of HRpeak (similar to 8% of training time, similar to 7 minutes per session) during training sessions were 73 and 92%, respectively. In conclusion, it was confirmed that sRPE and TRIMP displayed good convergent validity, and different %HRpeak were observed for each discrete RPE. However, because of the high variability in the time >90% of HRpeak, careful monitoring of individual exercises should be performed to ensure the desired training stimulus for each player.

TI  - Antimicrobial resistance of enterococci isolated from food in South Brazil: Comparing pre- and post-RDC 20/2011
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance has been attributed to the overuse of antibiotics. To control the use of antibiotics, Brazil adopted the RDC 20/2011. A comparison the antibiotic-resistance profile of bacterial has provided important insights into resistance evolution. Enterococci are ubiquitous bacteria recommended to be used as a sentinel organism, in national surveillance systems, for tracking antimicrobial resistance through the food chain. The present study aimed to evaluate the diversity and antimicrobial resistance of enterococci collected from food in South Brazil in 2017 (pos-RDC 20/11) for comparison with isolated in 2007 (pre-RDC 20/11). A total of 310 enterococci were isolated from vegetables and products of animal origin, identified by PCR and MALDI-TOF, tested for antimicrobial susceptibility and screened for resistance genes. Enterococcus casseliflavus was dominant in vegetables and E. faecalis in products of animal origin. Enterococcal isolates in 2017 were mostly sensitive to ampicillin, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, and vancomycin when compared to isolated collected in 2007. While resistance levels to most compounds remained relatively stable, multidrug resistance decreased by 24% during this period. Our results suggest that RDC 20/11 had a positive outcome in controlling the spread of antimicrobial resistance. This study provides baseline data to measure future changes in the prevalence of resistant enterococci.

TI  - Sedimentary evidence of glacial entrainment at Patriot Hills and Union Glacier moraines, Ellsworth Mountains, West Antarctica
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - This work aims to analyze and compare the sedimentological data of Ellsworth Mountains, West Antarctica: Patriot/Independence Hills and Union Glacier, and how sedimentological data can be used to infer sediment entrainment. Particular attention was concentrated on morainic deposits. Remote sensing data was used in the identification of deposits and the ice flow; granulometric, morphoscopic, and geochemical analyses were applied to investigate the sedimentary origin and transport history. Sediment rich in Si Al, Fe, and Ca predominate in Independence Hills and Rossman Cove but Ca prevails in Elephant Head. CIA indicated low values, which depict low chemical weathering processes. X-ray diffraction reveals the presence of minerals that constitute the local rocks in the Union Glacier area, and from the unexposed basement rocks in Independence Hills. Principal Component Analysis and Cluster Analysis results suggest the sediment is related to the local rocks in the Union Glacier and distinct exotic sources in Independence Hills, associated with far-traveled sediment. It is also observed the influence of distinct processes of entrainment sediment on its granulometric and morphoscopic characteristics.

AB  - Satellite interferometric SAR (InSAR) has demonstrated to be a powerful technology to perform millimeter-scale precision measurements of ground motions typically caused by landslides, subsidence, earthquakes or volcanic activity, and to monitor the stability of slopes, mining areas, buildings, infrastructures, etc. This work presents the European Ground Motion Service (EGMS), funded by the European Commission as an essential element of the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS). EGMS constitutes the first application of the interferometric SAR (InSAR) technology to high-resolution monitoring of ground deformations over an entire continent, based on full-resolution processing of all Sentinel-1 (S1) satellite images over most of Europe. EGMS employs advanced persistent scatterer (PS) and distributed scatterer (DS) InSAR processing techniques. Moreover, a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) model is realized to calibrate the InSAR ground motion products. To foster as wide usage as possible, EGMS also provide tools for visualization, exploration, analysis and download of the ground deformation products, as well as elements to promote best practice applications and user uptake.

TI  - Identification of SUHI in Urban Areas by Remote Sensing Data and Mitigation Hypothesis through Solar Reflective Materials
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban heat island (UHI) is an increasingly widespread phenomenon of concern to the wellbeing and the health of populations living in urban environments. The SUHI (Surface UHI) is directly related to UHI and influences its extension and intensity. Satellite images in the thermal infrared spectral region can be used to identify and study the SUHI. In this work, Landsat 8 TIR images were acquired to study the SUHI of a medium-sized municipality of the Po valley in the northern part of Italy. An additional Worldview 3 satellite image was used to classify the study area and retrieve the surface albedo of building roofs. Using the Local Climate Zone approach, existing roof materials were virtually replaced by solar reflective materials, and the mitigation potential of the SUHI and the UHI was quantified. This virtual scenario shows a decrease in the overheating of building roofs with respect to the ambient temperature of up to 33% compared to the current situation in the industrial areas. Focusing on UHI intensity, the air temperature decrease could be up to 0.5 degrees C.

TI  - Rates of Upstaging, Between Diagnosis and Surgery, and Clinical Management of Metastatic Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma: A Case-Control Study
T2  - DERMATOLOGIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND Cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (cSCC) have upstage rates of approximately 10.3% to 11.1%. Data are currently limited on the rate of upstaging for metastatic cSCC. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to determine the rates of upstaging, between diagnosis and surgery, and differences in management for metastatic and non-metastatic high-risk cSCC. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a retrospective, case-control, single institution, multi-center study. Univariate analysis was used. RESULTS Sixty-eight subjects (34 metastatic & 34 non-metastatic) with 69 tumors were included. The overall rate of upstaging was 46.4%. The most common reasons for upstage were undocumented tumor size and under-diagnosis of poor differentiation. There were no differences in rates of upstaging. Preoperative imaging was performed in 43.6% of wide local excisions (WLE) versus 3.3% of Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS; p < .001). The median days from surgery to sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), or nodal dissection was shorter for WLE versus MMS (0 vs 221 days, p < .001). CONCLUSION Improved clinical documentation, including documenting tumor size, and the identification of pathologic risk factors, including poor differentiation and depth of invasion, are needed for proper staging. Preoperative imaging and discussion of SLNB may be beneficial for high-risk T2b and T3 tumors.

AB  - A phenology-based coherent scattering model was used to estimate terrain backscatter at the C-band for growing corn. The scattering model accounted for combined effects from row structure and phenological changes in the plant. The study was done in central Mexico in the region of Huamantla, Tlaxcala using the dataset collected during the THEXMEX19 campaigns. Model simulations showed an RMSD of 4.75 dB when compared with Sentinel-1 observations at VV- polarization and, for RADARSAT-2 observations, an RMSD of 5.76 dB at VV-pol and 7.01 dB at HH-pol.

AB  - When Aphra Behn translated Le Voyage de l'Ile d'amour de Paul Tallemant (1663) and Balthazar de Bonnecorse's La Montre (1666), respectively in 1684 and 1686, she was adapting for an English readership a model of "gallant" literature steeped in pastoral sources that was very popular in France at the time. By fusing together an urban worldview and the pastoral model, this literature invests "gallant" objects, such as maps, mirrors, boxes, fans, watches or love almanachs as visual aids for allegorical developments on new fashionable conceptions of love. The gallant objects teem in poems and fiction that are often published in collective miscellanies and perpetuate the literary model offered by Madeleine de Scudery's Map of Tender (Clelie, 1654, published in 1655 in English). This allegorical and pastoral heritage was thoroughly transformed and adapted in the second half of the century into a new aesthetics and ethos of galanterie. This article deals with Behn's translation of these texts to study the various ways in which she mediated the French pastoral and gallant influences for an English Restoration readership.

T2  - MSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel Enterocytozoon infection was identified in the intestines of sexually mature Chinook salmon. While microsporidian parasites are common across a diverse range of animal hosts, this novel species is remarkable because it demonstrates biological, pathological, and genetic similarity with Enterocytozoon bieneusi, the most common causative agent of microsporidiosis in AIDS patients. There are similarities in the immune and endocrine processes of sexually mature Pacific salmon and immunocompromised humans, suggesting possible common mechanisms of susceptibility in these two highly divergent host species. The discovery of Enterocytozoon schreckii n. sp. contributes to clarifying the phylogenetic relationships within family Enterocytozoonidae. The phylogenetic and morphological features of this species support the redescription of Enterocytozoon to include Enterospora as a junior synonym. Furthermore, the discovery of this novel parasite may have important implications for conservation, as it could be a sentinel of immune suppression, disease, and prespawning mortality in threatened populations of salmonids.IMPORTANCE In this work, we describe a new microsporidian species that infects the enterocytes of Chinook salmon. This novel pathogen is closely related to Enterocytozoon bieneusi, an opportunistic pathogen commonly found in AIDS patients and other severely immunocompromised humans. The discovery of this novel pathogen is of interest because it has only been found in sexually mature Chinook salmon, which have compromised immune systems due to the stresses of migration and maturation and which share similar pathological features with immunocompromised and senescent humans. The discovery of this novel pathogen could lead to new insights regarding how microsporidiosis relates to immunosuppression across animal hosts.

AB  - Recurrent droughts and water restrictions occur more and more often in Southeastern France. In this context, the evaluation of available resources according to the crop development and needs is becoming a priority. This study uses Sentinel data, for two main purposes: -i) evaluating the accuracy of new soil moisture products obtained from Sentinel 1 & 2 ((SMP)-M-2) delivered from the THEIA platform, by using continuous soil moisture measurements of an agricultural plot located in Avignon (France) -ii) assessing the potential of Sentinel 1 & 2 for monitoring soil moisture, irrigation and phenology of irrigated orchards. Significant correlations were found between in situ measurements and soil moisture products normalized with the yearly amplitude (r(2) =0.76 rmse=0.15%/%). Time series of the green fractional cover fCOVER and the fraction of absorbed radiation (fAPAR) computed from Sentinel 2 permitted to identify full flowering and end of flowering phenological stages when irrigation start.

AB  - We propose a weakly-supervised, multitask framework for training a convolutional neural network to solve the problem of cloud shadow mitigation given only cloud and shadow masks as labels. The network minimizes the Wasserstein distance between shadows and their proximal sunlit neighborhoods, generating a supervisory signal directly from within the input image. We extract further utility from the shadow mask through multitask learning by introducing an auxiliary task of shadow segmentation. Our approach is advantageous since it performs mitigation in an end-to-end framework which requires only a shadowed image for inference. We apply this process to the Landsat 8 OLI SPARCS validation data set and demonstrate plausible results.

AB  - The monitoring of cropland areas and in particular the capability to evaluate the performance of a field over space and time is becoming a crucial activity to schedule agronomic operations (e.g., fertilization) properly. In particular, the use of remotely sensed data opened new ways for this kind of analysis. In this work, we present a methodology based on Functional Data Analysis that starting from remotely sensed time-series data generates cluster maps of a cropland area. Starting from vegetation index time-series data, Functional Principal Component Analysis (FPCA) was applied to derive FPCA scores and components. FPCA scores are then clusterized to obtain maps that embed the dynamics of crops over space and time. The derived maps can be used to optimize agronomic tasks such as fertilization also acting as base layers to create management zones and then prescription maps.

AB  - With the increasing availability of optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images thanks to the Sentinel constellation, and the explosion of deep learning, new methods have emerged in recent years to tackle the reconstruction of optical images that are impacted by clouds. In this paper, we focus on the evaluation of convolutional neural networks that use jointly SAR and optical images to retrieve the missing contents in one single polluted optical image. We propose a simple framework that ease the creation of datasets for the training of deep nets targeting optical image reconstruction, and for the validation of machine learning based or deterministic approaches. These methods are quite different in terms of input images constraints, and comparing them is a problematic task not addressed in the literature. We show how space partitioning data structures help to query samples in terms of cloud coverage, relative acquisition date, pixel validity and relative proximity between SAR and optical images. We generate several datasets to compare the reconstructed images from networks that use a single pair of SAR and optical image, versus networks that use multiple pairs, and a traditional deterministic approach performing interpolation in temporal domain.

TI  - Automatic Detection of Low-Backscatter Targets in the Arctic Using Wide Swath Sentinel-1 Imagery
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Low backscatter signatures in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery are characteristic to surfaces that are highly smooth and specular reflective of microwave radiation. In the Arctic, these typically represent newly formed sea ice, oil spills, and localized weather phenomena such as low wind or rain cells. The operational monitoring of low backscatter targets can benefit from a stronger integration of freely available SAR imagery from Sentinel-1. We, therefore, propose a detection method applicable to Sentinel-1 extra wide-swath (EW) SAR scenes. Using intensity values coupled with incidence angle and noise-equivalent sigma zero (NESZ) information, the image segmentation method is able to detect the low backscatter targets as one segment across subswaths. We use the Barents Sea as a test site due to the abundant presence of low backscatter targets with different origins, and of long-term operational monitoring services that help cross-validate our observations. Utilizing a large set of scenes acquired in the Barents Sea during the freezing season (November-April), we demonstrate the potential of performing large-scale operational monitoring of local phenomena with low backscatter signatures.

AB  - Radar interferometry has progressed very much in the last two decades. It is now a powerful remote sensing techniques to monitor ground motion. The technique has undergone an important development in terms of processing and data analysis algorithms. This has been accompanied by an important increase of the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data acquisition capability by spaceborne sensors. A step forward was the launch of the Copernicus Sentinel-1 constellation. This has made the development of A-DInSAR (Advanced Differential Interferometric SAR) ground deformation services technically feasible. The paper is focused on the most important ground motion initiative ever conceived: the European Ground Motion Service (EGMS). This service is part of the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service managed by the European Environment Agency. EGMS involves the ground deformation monitoring at European scale. The service will deliver the first product in May 2022. In this paper we describe some preliminary examples of deformation products coming from the EGMS.

AB  - The Copernicus European Ground Motion Service (EGMS) provides consistent, regular, standardised, harmonised and reliable information regarding natural and anthropogenic ground motion phenomena over the Copernicus Participating States and across national borders, with millimetre accuracy. The EGMS is based on the multi-temporal interferometric analysis of Sentinel-1 radar images at full resolution. Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) data are used to calibrate the interferometric measurements. EGMS provides an unprecedent opportunity to study geohazards and human-induced deformation over Europe, such as slow-moving landslides, natural subsidence or due to groundwater exploitation or underground mining activities, volcanic unrests and many other phenomena. This paper offers a first look at the products distributed by EGMS through relevant case studies in different environmental contexts of Europe.

AB  - Analyzing directional data, in particular circular data, requires methods that are being available in libraries with a well-known prestige as Python including SciPy, NumPy or SciKit-Learn libs. An open-source library has been implemented to be executed by the Python interpreter, called PyCircularStats. Source code: https://github.com/mhaut/pycircularstatsThe potential of PyCircularStats is shown with an example of analyzing two-dimensional data using circular statistics. The practical case chosen is the positional accuracy analysis of a satellite image of LandSat-8 in Caceres, Spain, with 99 control points taken with GNSS systems.In this work, the possibilities of two-dimensional data analysis using circular statistics using the PyCircularStats tool with the results of this case of use is presented.

AB  - This work was conceived for assessing the potential of the Copernicus DEM (CopDEM) dataset to identify (flash) flood-prone areas by using a geomorphological approach. This dataset is distributed in different instances (named: EEA-10, GLO-30, GLO-90) characterized by different pixel sizes/spatial coverages/licenses (EEA-10: 10&12 m/European/restricted; GLO-30: 30 m/global/public; GLO-90: 90 m/global/public). The analysis compared the performances of the different instances for the abovementioned application. An exemplifying Mediterranean catchment located in Italy was used as test area. Results showed that the CopDEM dataset was successfully capable of identifying (flash) flood-prone areas. The best results were obtained by the EEA-10 and GLO-30 instances. The analysis also highlighted the importance of the GLO-30 instance to map flood prone-areas, as it is freely and globally available. Moreover, the GLO-30 instance outperformed other freely available DEMs distributed with a pixel size of 30 m (i.e., ALOS AW3D30, ASTER GDEM, SRTM) that were analyzed for comparative purposes.

TI  - Investigating the Potential of Downscaling Approaches for SMAP Radiometer Soil Moisture in Agroforestry Areas, China
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate high-spatial-resolution soil moisture content (SMC) datasets are crucial for applications, such as erosion modelling, flood forecasting, and agricultural production. Downscaling is an effective way to convert coarse satellite observations to a finer spatial resolution. Two downscaling approaches were proposed to improve the spatial resolution of the soil moisture active passive (SMAP) radiometer SMC. A downscaling method (method 1) based on the triangular feature space concept was developed to express SMAP L3 SMC as a polynomial function of the Global Land Surface Satellite leaf area index, preprocessed synthetic land surface temperature, and microwave polarization difference index. A second downscaling method (method 2) based on the simulated datasets was developed to express high-resolution SMC as a function of coarse-resolution SMC and sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar observations. Downscaled SMC (1 km) was evaluated by the in situ measurements and compared by the SMAP L2 active and passive SMC product in agroforestry areas, China. The results showed that the two downscaling methods could effectively capture the spatial variability of soil moisture at 1-km spatial scales. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) of downscaled SMC for grass, shrub, and forestland is 0.052-0.055 cm(3) cm(-3), 0.063-0.069 cm(3) cm(-3), and 0.067-0.073 cm(3) cm(-3), respectively. The accuracies of method 1, method 2, and SMAP L2 SMC in the grassland were higher than those in the shrubland and forestland. Overall, the R and RMSE between the downscaled soil moisture from method 1, method 2, and SMAP L2 SMC were 0.613, 0.626, and 0.619 and 0.051 cm(3) cm(-3), 0.041 cm(3) cm(-3), and 0.45 cm(3) cm(-3), respectively. The active and SMAP passive microwave combination method has great potential for soil moisture downscaling in agroforestry areas in China.

AB  - Rapid and accurate evaluation of ecological environmental quality and analysis of spatio-temporal changes has important practical significance for Jinan, China, which is in a critical period of rapid economic and social development, leading to the contradiction between ecological environment and urban development increasingly prominent. In this study, we utilized Landsat 5/TM and Landsat 8/ OLI images to construct the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) for evaluating and analyzing the ecological quality of Jinan from 2006 to 2018. The results indicate that the ecological environmental quality of Jinan is in a satisfied order. The RSEI of Jinan increased slightly from 2006 to 2018 and the area of improving environmental quality accounted for 32.78%. By contrast, the area of decreasing ecological environmental quality only accounted for 18.40%, indicating that the overall ecological environmental quality of Jinan was in an improving trend in recent years. The ecological quality of the southern mountainous area changed greatly and the ecological environment improved obviously, while the ecological environmental quality of the central urban area was relatively stable. The results provide a guidance for local government and data support for ecological protection in the context of rapid urbanization.

AB  - Artisanal and Small-scale Gold Mining (ASGM) is an important source of income for many households, but it can have large social and environmental effects, especially in rainforests of developing countries. The Sentinel-2 satellites collect multispectral images that can be used for the purpose of detecting changes in water extent and quality which indicates the locations of mining sites. This work focuses on the recognition of ASGM activities in Peruvian Amazon rainforests. We tested several semi-supervised classifiers based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to detect the changes of water bodies from 2019 to 2021 in the Madre de Dios region, which is one of the global hotspots of ASGM activities. Experiments show that SVM-based models can achieve reasonable performance for both RGB (using Cohen's kappa 0.49) and 6-channel images (using Cohen's kappa 0.71) with very limited annotations. The efficacy of incorporating Lab color space for change detection is analyzed as well.

TI  - Wave Height Estimation and Validation Based on the UFS Mode Data of Gaofen-3 in South China Sea
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The ultrafinestrip (UFS) of the Gaofen-3 (GF-3) satellite provides extensive ocean wave details due to the high spatial resolution of 3 m. In this article, a new empirical model is developed to estimate wave height from GF-3 UFS mode data in South China Sea (SCS). Traditional methods either have more input parameters or complex forms or complex transformations, and most of them depend on the visible wave pattern. The model has the advantages of fewer input parameters and unnecessary visual wave patterns. The wave height estimation model is developed based on the collated data pairs between GF-3 UFS data in horizontal-horizontal polarization and the ERA5 reanalysis dataset from 2018 to 2021. The datasets are randomly divided into two groups. One group (about 80%) is used to develop the empirical relation; the other group (about 20%) and some altimeter data are used for significant wave height (SWH) verification. The comparison of the model data with the remaining ERA5 (ECMWF Reanalysis v5) data and the altimeter shows that the root-mean-square error is 0.41 and 0.47 m, the scatter index is 29.24% and 29.79%, and the correlation coefficient is 0.90 and 0.82, respectively. These statistical indices suggest that the developed model is suitable for SWH retrievals. So, the study results indicate that the GF-3 UFS mode data provide valuable information about wave conditions in the SCS.

In this paper, the MODIS 1 km aerosol product over China during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic was validated against with the ground measured data collected from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET). The result shows a good agreement between the two datasets. The spatiotemporal analyses of three selected regions, which are Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Hubei and Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao, indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic has a significant impact on human activities and aerosol loadings.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Responses of Ecosystem Services to Land Use Transformation Driven by Rapid Urbanization: A Case Study of Hubei Province, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Exploring the changes of ecosystem services value caused by land use transformation driven by urbanization is crucial for ensuring the safety of the regional ecological environment and for enhancing the value of ecosystem services. Based on the land use remote sensing data during the rapid urbanization development period of Hubei Province from 1995 to 2015, this study analyzed the characteristics of land use/land cover change and land use transformation. The spatial-temporal response characteristics and evolution of ecosystem services value (ESV) to land use transformation driven by urbanization were measured by equivalent factor method, spatial autocorrelation analysis, hot spot analysis and gravity model. We found that: (1) Driven by urbanization, the most significant feature of land use transformation in Hubei Province was the expansion of the built-up land and the significant reduction of cropland and forest, among which 90% of the new built-up land was converted from cropland and forest. (2) This land use transformation became the main source of ESV losses. Especially, the sharp increase of the built-up land from 2010 to 2015, occupying cropland and forest, resulted in ESV losses of nearly USD 320 million. The service capacity of climate regulation, soil conservation, gas regulation and food production undertaken by cropland and forest decreased. (3) The ecosystem services value in the study area showed spatial distribution characteristics of high in the west and low in the middle and east regions. The center of gravity of ESV shifted from northwest to southeast. Due to the sharp increase of the built-up land from 2010 to 2015, the center of gravity shift rebounded. This study can help policymakers better understand the trade-offs between land use transformation and ecosystem services driven by urbanization.

TI  - A Case Study on the Dynamics of Phytoplankton Blooms Caused by Tropical Cyclones in the Southeastern Arabian Sea
T2  - TELLUS SERIES A-DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - A phytoplankton bloom was observed in the southeastern Arabian Sea after the passage of the anti-S-type track Tropical cyclone ARB 06 in 1998, which lasted for 22 days. The dynamic mechanism of the phytoplankton bloom was investigated with highresolution satellite remote sensing data, reanalysis data and buoy data. The results show that the double thermocline structure hindered the uplift of deep nutrients to the surface before the tropical cyclone arrival. During and after the passage of the cyclone, the shallower thermocline disappeared, the deeper thermocline changed from 45.7 m to 76.5 m, the mixed layer deepened, and the upper oceanic stratification weakened. Additionally, a weak ocean eddy pair was enhanced gradually after the passage of cyclone. The relative vorticity of the ocean eddy pair was calculated. In the oscillation with a period of two days, the vorticity of the cyclonic eddy was stronger than that of the anticyclonic eddy, which enhanced a strong upwelling at a depth of more than 55 m for more than 10 days. The vertical current shear generated by the oscillation not only enhanced the vertical mixing, but also plays an important role in the distribution of phytoplankton blooms. The phytoplankton bloom was triggered by the nutrient below the thermocline into the sea surface, where a strong upwelling and weakened oceanic stratification occurred after the passage of cyclone. This study offers new insights on the mechanism of phytoplankton bloom induced by tropical cyclones and will be helpful for evaluating tropical cyclone-induced biological responses in future.

AB  - The main payload of the Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich (S6-MF) is the Poseidon-4 Ku- and C-band Radar Altimeter launched Nov 18th 2020 was developed to continue the ocean surface topography reference data record that commenced in 1992 (TOPEX/Poseidon), was followed by Jason-1 (2001), Jason-2 (2008) and Jason-3 (2016). The satellite has been developed to, as a minimum, meet in-orbit performances of the Jason-2 and adopts, for the first time, requirements concerning estimated Global Mean Sea Level (GMSL) drift and stability. The design of S6 has also taken into account the in-orbit performances of the CryoSat-2/Sentinel-3 missions and their altimeter designs. Integrated into the design is the capability to allow for further on-ground processing enhancements that now demonstrate focused processing capabilities that can be performed globally for evolving future applications.This paper provides an overview of the key performances of the mission at the end of its commissioning and tandem phase with Jason-3, that has also allowed for the first time the characterization of both nominal and redundant chains of the altimeter.It is now demonstrated that the mission meets all its commissioning objectives and all mission level requirements are met, though long-term estimates of GMSL stability requires a longer time series of around 3 years. The Poseidon-4 design and its performances has provided the basis for future missions, such as CRISTAL and potentially for the Sentinel-3 and 6 Next Generation systems.

TI  - A GIS Based Land Suitability and Gross Value Evaluation of Mined Lands in Sanliurfa District
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES-TARIM BILIMLERI DERGISI
M3  - Article
AB  - Landmined areas are located along the borders of Sanliurfa province between Turkey and Syria with 220 km length and 400 m width. Governmental institutions attempted to determine the potential and suitability of mined lands for any agricultural activities before removing active mines. The research was conducted to estimate land suitability and gross value for irrigated agricultural production (GVIAP) of the mined areas using the database for the surrounding land and data obtained by Geographic Information Systems (GIS) techniques. The study was conducted in three steps; data including soil characteristics, digital elevation model (DEM) and orthophoto images of lands located 2 km nearby the mined land along the Turkish border were collected. The data containing DEM and orthophoto images of mined and adjacent lands were integrated in the second step. Finally, a field survey was conducted along the border district and soil samples were collected for each soil boundary nearby the mined lands. The integration of data in GIS allowed to expand the soil boundaries from adjacent lands into the mined lands. Data analysis showed that the total mined land is 6706 hectares of which 90.2% is highly and moderately suitable, 6.9% is less suitable and 2.9% is not suitable for irrigated agriculture. The gross value of irrigated agricultural production was estimated as 2212 US Dollars per hectare. The results revealed that the integration of inaccessible land database with the remote sensing data and GIS can be used to estimate the gross value which is derived from soil characteristics of the mined lands.

TI  - Honey bees as biomonitors of environmental contaminants, pathogens, and climate change
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Review
AB  - Monitoring the environment for pollution, pesticides, and pathogens is crucial for protecting human, agriculture, and overall ecosystem health. Diverse strategies ranging from physical sensors to sentinel species have been used for environmental monitoring. The European honey bee, Apis mellifera, is a globally managed pollinator that can serve as a continuous biomonitoring species. During foraging, honey bees are exposed to contaminants and pathogens and carry them to their hives where they can be detected and quantified. Although individual bees are vulnerable to environmental stressors, the honey bee colony as a whole is more resilient and can accumulate contaminants or respond to them without collapsing. This allows for long-term monitoring of the colony to map contaminants in a geographical area and study ecotoxicology gradients over space and time. In this paper, we review demonstrated and proposed uses of honey bees for environmental monitoring. We focus our discussion on heavy metals, air pollutants, pesticides, and plant pathogens that can be detected in bees and their hive materials including honey, wax, and stored pollen. We present the use of gene expression, microbiome profiling, and other high-throughput methodologies to study dose-dependent exposure and increase detection sensitivity; for example, stored pollen analysis with next generation sequencing can reveal the presence of plant viruses, fungi, and invasive species earlier than traditional detection methods. Finally, we discuss opportunities for using honey bees to monitor emerging threats such as climate change and antimicrobial resistance. This narrative review highlights the versatility and potential utility of the European honey bee as a biomonitoring species for ecosystem health.
