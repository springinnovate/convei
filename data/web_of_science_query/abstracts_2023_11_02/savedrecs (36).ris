TI  - Remotely Sensed Tree Characterization in Urban Areas: A Review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban trees and forests provide multiple ecosystem services (ES), including temperature regulation, carbon sequestration, and biodiversity. Interest in ES has increased amongst policymakers, scientists, and citizens given the extent and growth of urbanized areas globally. However, the methods and techniques used to properly assess biodiversity and ES provided by vegetation in urban environments, at large scales, are insufficient. Individual tree identification and characterization are some of the most critical issues used to evaluate urban biodiversity and ES, given the complex spatial distribution of vegetation in urban areas and the scarcity or complete lack of systematized urban tree inventories at large scales, e.g., at the regional or national levels. This often limits our knowledge on their contributions toward shaping biodiversity and ES in urban areas worldwide. This paper provides an analysis of the state-of-the-art studies and was carried out based on a systematic review of 48 scientific papers published during the last five years (2016-2020), related to urban tree and greenery characterization, remote sensing techniques for tree identification, processing methods, and data analysis to classify and segment trees. In particular, we focused on urban tree and forest characterization using remotely sensed data and identified frontiers in scientific knowledge that may be expanded with new developments in the near future. We found advantages and limitations associated with both data sources and processing methods, from which we drew recommendations for further development of tree inventory and characterization in urban forestry science. Finally, a critical discussion on the current state of the methods, as well as on the challenges and directions for future research, is presented.

TI  - Long-Term Hydrological Regime Monitoring of a Mediterranean Agro-Ecological Wetland Using Landsat Imagery: Correlation with the Water Renewal Rate of a Shallow Lake
T2  - HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Natural Park of Albufera (Valencia, Spain) is one of the Spanish Mediterranean wetlands where rice is cultivated intensively. The hydrology of the Albufera Lake, located in the center, combines natural contributions with complex human management. The aim of our study was to develop a new methodology to accurately detect the volume of flood water in complex natural environments which experience significant seasonal changes due to climate and agriculture. The study included 132 Landsat images, covering a 15-year period. The algorithm was adjusted using the NDWI index and simultaneous measurements of water levels in the rice fields. The NDVI index was applied to monitor the cultivated area during the summer. Lake inflows and residence times were also evaluated to quantify how the hydrodynamic of the lake is conditioned by the agricultural management. The algorithm developed is confirmed as a useful ecological tool to monitor the flood cycle of the wetland, being able to detect even the lowest water levels. The flood dynamics are consistent over the fifteen years, being in line with the rice cultivation cycle. Water renewal in Albufera lake is altered with respect to that expected according to the rainfall recorded in the study area, so an improvement in the water management of the hydrological basin is required to optimize the runoff during the rainiest months.

TI  - Delineation of groundwater potential zones in lower Rihand River Basin, India using geospatial techniques and AHP
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study, an attempt is made to delineate groundwater potential zones in Lower Rihand River Basin using remote sensing, GIS, and Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP). Multiple data, viz. lithology, lineament density, geomorphology, slope, soil, rainfall, drainage density, relief, landuse/landcover were considered for delineating the groundwater potential zones. All nine thematic layers were prepared using remote sensing data on GIS platform. After that, weights were assigned to different layers and the fea-tures within them using a pairwise comparison matrix through the Analytical Hierarchical Process. The weights obtained were tested for their consistency using the consistency index and consistency ratio. A final weighted map was then obtained by multiplying each thematic layer's weights with the weights of features within them and adding them. Based on this final weighted layer, the basin was categorized into very poor, poor, moderate, good, very good groundwater potential zones. The maximum area (49.22%) is under poor groundwater potential zone followed by moderate zone (26.17%), very poor (12.53%), good (11.77%), very good (0.31%). Results obtained have been validated using pre-monsoon and post-monsoon 10 years average water depth and seasonal fluctuation of various observation wells. Sensitivity analysis using map removal method is performed to assess the most influential parameters, geology, geomorphology, lineament density are the most influential. Overall results prove the efficacy of the use of geospatial technology in combination with AHP in the delineation of underground water potential zones.(c) 2021 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

TI  - Is Mastectomy a Suitable Treatment in Ductal Carcinoma <i>In Situ</i>?
T2  - CHIRURGIA
M3  - Review
AB  - In the current practice of a breast unit it is becoming more and more frequent to deal with the diagnosis of a ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Ductal carcinoma in situ is a recognized risk factor for invasive breast carcinoma and a correct management could be considered as a reward for all the patients who apply regularly screening programs. The surgical management of DCIS can be a complex challenge even more than invasive carcinoma; available data is very controversial, and a standardization of practice is needed. Here we propose a practical flow chart used at the Oncologic European Institute in Milan to face this complex and controversial theme.

TI  - Greenland ice-sheet wide glacier classification based on two distinct seasonal ice velocity behaviors
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Greenland glaciers exhibit variable seasonal velocity signals that may reflect differences in subglacial hydrology. Here, we conduct a first GrIS-wide glacier classification based on seasonal velocity patterns derived from 2017 Sentinel-1 radar data. Our classification focuses on two distinct seasonal ice velocity patterns, with the first (type-2 from Moon and others, 2014) showing periods of both speedup and slowdown during the melt season, and the second (type-3) instead showing a longer period of slowdown from elevated velocities in the winter and spring. We analyze 221 glaciers in 2017 and show that 48 exhibit type-2 behavior, and 72 exhibit type-3 behavior. We extend the classification to 2018 and 2019 and find that while the glaciers meeting each criterion vary year to year, type-2 is consistently more common in the northern regions and type-3 is more common in the south. Our results highlight the varied impact of meltwater on subglacial drainage systems and glacier flow in Greenland.

TI  - Influence of trees on landscape temperature in semi-arid agro-ecosystems of East Africa
T2  - BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Dodoma region of Tanzania, overexploitation of natural resources has led to a severe land degradation and, consequently, to the need to restore local ecosystems. Within the possible strategies, the farmer managed natural regeneration agroforestry is strongly being promoted in the area. To validate the utilisation of this practise, this research aims (i) to assess the benefits of trees on microclimate studying the relationship between land surface temperature (LST) and tree canopy cover (TCC) in farmlands and (ii) to propose an operative tree density threshold to be set as objective by restoration activities in the area. Data collected with an unmanned aerial vehicle were integrated with Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 satellite imagery. LST was retrieved through the practical single channel algorithm and TCC was calculated with a supervised classification. Pixel-based analyses at a resolution of 30 m and 10 m were performed, and the resulting data statistically analysed through the coefficient of determination, the KruskaleWallis test, and the Dunn test. Results showed that the TCC of the surveyed areas was 5.1%, and a significant decrease in LST of 1.32 degrees C (p < 0.01) was found in the areas with the highest TCC, during the late dry season. From these preliminary analyses, a threshold of 10% TCC is suggested for farmlands in this agroecological zone to bring beneficial microclimate changes in terms of temperature. Considering the average plant phenotype characteristic of the area, it corresponds to a tree density of 50 trees ha(-1). (C) 2021 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Transformative Learning in Graduate Medical Education: A Scoping Review.
T2  - Journal of graduate medical education
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - BACKGROUND: Transformative learning (TL) is an educational theory focused on deep fundamental shifts in an individual's worldview. Such shifts are well known to occur within graduate medical education (GME). However, TL in GME has yet to be formally explored.OBJECTIVE: We performed a scoping review of the literature on TL within GME to identify areas where trainees currently experience or have potential to experience TL, and to explore areas where fostering TL has been used as a pedagogical tool.METHODS: In January 2020, we searched 7 databases to identify literature on TL in GME. Additional articles were identified by hand-searching the Journal of Graduate Medical Education.RESULTS: A total of 956 articles were identified through database search with 3 unique articles found via hand-searching. Abstracts and manuscripts were screened by 2 authors and disagreements arbitrated by a third, yielding 28 articles for our analysis. The main components of TL (disorienting dilemma, reflection, discourse, action) took various forms. TL was closely linked with professionalism training and professional identity formation. Training programs in primary care fields were most frequently referenced. Often, trainees were experiencing TL without recognition of the theory by their educators. Gaps in the graduate medical education literature exist pertaining to TL in venues such as diversity, equity, and inclusion.CONCLUSIONS: Our scoping review uncovered the following themes: TL and professionalism, TL and primary care, and TL by other names. TL is likely occurring but going unrecognized in some settings.

TI  - Surface roughness characterization of the 2014-2015 Holuhraun lava flow-field in Iceland: implications for facies mapping and remote sensing
T2  - BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface roughness is a commonly used parameter for the quantitative analysis and characterization of geological terrains on Earth, as well as on other planetary bodies, particularly where detailed optical data may not be available. Here, we statistically investigate if surface roughness can be used to distinguish between different lava facies in remote sensing data by examining the entire 2014-2015 Holuhraun lava flow-field in Iceland. Root-mean-square (RMS) height deviation, Hurst exponents, and breakpoints were calculated to quantify the surface roughness characteristics of eight facies using stereo-derived topographic datasets at three different pixel scales, ranging from 0.05 to 0.5 m/pixel. We show that most of the investigated lava facies (rubbly, spiny, undifferentiated rubbly-spiny, Shelly, pahoehoe, and flat-lying-knobby) are indistinguishable by surface roughness down to the 5 cm baseline, with the exception of topography-building facies like the vent-proximal edifice and the exceptionally blocky channel interior facies. Additionally, we considered baselines corresponding to radar S-band (10 cm), L-band (20 cm), and P-band (90 cm). Our findings imply that when transitional lava types are considered in addition to traditional end-members, topographic roughness data, including RMS height deviation and Hurst exponent values alone, cannot be used to uniquely identify lava facies at these baselines.

T2  - GEOSFERNYE ISSLEDOVANIYA-GEOSPHERE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper presents icing parameters based on actual weather conditions taken from pilot reports (PIREPs) in the Tomsk aerodrome and shows the feasibility of using satellite information to identify possible in-flight icing zones (by example). From 2011 to 2018, the icing was regularly observed during the period from October to December, averaging 6-7 days per month with a maximum in December 2015 (14 days). The most frequent icing occurred with moderate (52%) and light (42 %) intensity. Days with severe accumulation of aircraft ice were observed in all seasons, excluding summer, with a maximum of November (8 cases). In more than half of the cases, icing was observed in layers up to 1,000 m thick, just 25% exceeded 1,500 m and in some cases reached more than 3,500 m. In 75% of cases, the lower boundary of the icing layer was reported directly from the underlying surface up to 1,500 m, and in some cases, icing was observed from 3 km and above. An analysis of synoptic processes on icing days revealed that approximately 65 % of cases of icing of different intensities were recorded in frontal cloud systems, of which 24% were on occluded fronts, 35% on cold fronts, and 41% on warm fronts. All cases with severe icing intensity were linked to frontal cloud systems. In homogeneous air masses, 20 percent of which are in the anticyclonic field and baric ridges, light icing was primarily observed. To identify the spatial and temporal localization of potential icing, vertical profiles of temperature and humidity are needed. Usually, these profiles are collected at most sounding stations on the basis of twice-a-day upper-air observations. The number of passes of polar-orbiting satellites over western Siberia's south-east territory ranges from 8 to 16 times a day. Schematic maps of the 2D and 3D-representation of the icing layer itself and its intensity at the same frequency can also be mapped on the basis of first-level satellite processing information and retrieved meteorological parameters in combination with computed methods of icing zone detection. The research was implemented by employing 0.8, 3.9 and 11.03 mu m of MODIS and temperature and specific humidity profiles of ATOVS radiometers. Joint study material analysis confirms identification of icing zones using by satellite remote sensing (temperature and humidity). The approach is most relevant for territories in the absence of the upper-air sounding. Given the high probability of aircraft icing conditions obtained by synoptic and statistical analysis, the proposed approach based on the involvement of satellite information will serve as an essential component in ultra-short-term forecasting and nowcasting for the territory of Western Siberia.

M3  - Article
AB  - The features of large wildfires that occurred in Russia in 2001-2020 were studied on the base of satellite monitoring data. The contribution of the regions of the European part of Russia, as well as the Ural, Siberian, and Far East federal districts, to CO, CO2, and PM2.5 emissions due to wildfires is estimated. It is established that the contribution of the Siberian Federal District into total emission volumes due to wildfires was prevailing from 2011 to 2017, and in some years it reached 60%. It is revealed that in 2020 wildfire emission volumes in the territory of the Far East Federal District exceeded 55% of the all-Russian emissions. An analysis of the features of anomalous wildfires is performed taking into account weather and climate factors. The relationship between large wildfires and weather and climatic factors, including blocking anticyclones, has been revealed. Using OMI (Aura satellite) data, it has been found that an aerosol plume due to large wildfires in Russia can spread over long distances and reach other continents.

TI  - Water Extraction from Fully Polarized SAR Based on Combined Polarization and Texture Features
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Given the limited features (for example, the backscattering coefficient threshold range) of single-channel Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images, it is difficult to distinguish ground objects similar to the backscattering coefficients of water bodies. In this paper, two representative research areas are selected (Yancheng Coastal wetland and Shijiu Lake), and the fully polarized SAR data based on Gaofen-3 are used to extract water bodies using the method of polarization decomposition and gray level co-occurrence matrix. Firstly, the multi-dimensional features of ground objects are extracted, and then the redundancy processing of multi-dimensional features is carried out by the separability index, which effectively solves the misclassification of non-water bodies and water bodies and improves the accuracy of water body extraction. The comparison between the results of full-polarization extraction and single-polarization extraction shows that both full-polarization and single-polarization extraction can extract water information, but the extraction accuracy of the full-polarization method can reach 94.74% in the area with complex wetland features, which can effectively compensate for the lack of precision of the single-polarization method. Although multi-dimensional features can be extracted from fully polarimetric SAR data, data redundancy may exist. Therefore, using the Separability index (SI) to process multi-dimensional features can effectively solve the problem of feature redundancy and improve classification accuracy.

TI  - Diversity of Remote Sensing-Based Variable Inputs Improves the Estimation of Seasonal Maximum Freezing Depth
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The maximum soil freezing depth (MSFD) is an important indicator of the thermal state of seasonally frozen ground. Its variation has important implications for the water cycle, ecological processes, climate and engineering stability. This study tested three aspects of data-driven predictions of MSFD in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), including comparison of three popular statistical/machine learning techniques, differences between remote sensing variables and reanalysis data as input conditions, and transportability of the model built by reanalysis data. The results show that support vector regression (SVR) performs better than random forest (RF), k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and the ensemble mean of the three models. Compared with the climate predictors, the remote sensing predictors are helpful for improving the simulation accuracy of the MSFD at both decadal and annual scales (at the annual and decadal scales, the root mean square error (RMSE) is reduced by 2.84 and 1.99 cm, respectively). The SVR model with climate predictor calibration using the in situ MSFD at the baseline period (2001-2010) can be used to simulate the MSFD over historical periods (1981-1990 and 1991-2000). This result indicates the good transferability of the well-trained machine learning model and its availability to simulate the MSFD of the past and the future when remote sensing predictors are not available.

TI  - Urban development analysis using built-up area maps based on multiple high-resolution satellite data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Analysis of built-up areas-the most significant artificial urban areas-reveals physical development processes. Unlike previous research involving medium-resolution remote sensing (RS) images, this study used built-up area maps generated from multiple high-resolution RS images with abundant built-up area edge information to analyze development in Zhengzhou. A transferable built-up area extraction (TBUAE) algorithm was developed to map the built-up area maps. The algorithm allows the developed deep learning model used on a certain satellite image to be eligible for other types of satellite images by altering the data distribution with adaptive Wallis filtering (DT-AWF). The proposed method alleviates the pressure of deep learning on the demand for new satellite image samples that are time-consuming and laborious. Additionally, the accuracy of built-up area mapping using this method exceeds 90%. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were conducted on the map results to observe the urban development of Zhengzhou from 2016 to 2020. We found that Zhengzhou has expanded rapidly since it was defined as a central city in central China in 2016. Additionally, the suburban built-up area has expanded rapidly and developed together with the central city. Further, affected by the policy, the built-up areas in different regions of Zhengzhou has changed differently, the urban edge is more simplified, and the urban internal structure is more compact.

TI  - An Automated Snow Mapper Powered by Machine Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow preserves fresh water and impacts regional climate and the environment. Enabled by modern satellite Earth observations, fast and accurate automated snow mapping is now possible. In this study, we developed the Automated Snow Mapper Powered by Machine Learning (AutoSMILE), which is the first machine learning-based open-source system for snow mapping. It is built in a Python environment based on object-based analysis. AutoSMILE was first applied in a mountainous area of 1002 km(2) in Bome County, eastern Tibetan Plateau. A multispectral image from Sentinel-2B, a digital elevation model, and machine learning algorithms such as random forest and convolutional neural network, were utilized. Taking only 5% of the study area as the training zone, AutoSMILE yielded an extraordinarily satisfactory result over the rest of the study area: the producer's accuracy, user's accuracy, intersection over union and overall accuracy reached 99.42%, 98.78%, 98.21% and 98.76%, respectively, at object level, corresponding to 98.84%, 98.35%, 97.23% and 98.07%, respectively, at pixel level. The model trained in Bome County was subsequently used to map snow at the Qimantag Mountain region in the northern Tibetan Plateau, and a high overall accuracy of 97.22% was achieved. AutoSMILE outperformed threshold-based methods at both sites and exhibited superior performance especially in handling complex land covers. The outstanding performance and robustness of AutoSMILE in the case studies suggest that AutoSMILE is a fast and reliable tool for large-scale high-accuracy snow mapping and monitoring.

TI  - Parameterized Modeling and Calibration for Orbital Error in TanDEM-X Bistatic SAR Interferometry over Complex Terrain Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The TerraSAR-X add-on for Digital Elevation Measurements (TanDEM-X) bistatic system provides high-resolution and high-quality interferometric data for global topographic measurement. Since the twin TanDEM-X satellites fly in a close helix formation, they can acquire approximately simultaneous synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, so that temporal decorrelation and atmospheric delay can be ignored. Consequently, the orbital error becomes the most significant error limiting high-resolution SAR interferometry (InSAR) applications, such as the high-precision digital elevation model (DEM) reconstruction, subway and highway deformation monitoring, landslide monitoring and sub-canopy topography inversion. For rugged mountainous areas, in particular, it is difficult to estimate and correct the orbital phase error in TanDEM-X bistatic InSAR. Based on the rigorous InSAR geometric relationship, the orbital phase error can be attributed to the baseline errors (BEs) after fixing the positions of the master SAR sensor and the targets on the ground surface. For the constraint of the targets at a study scene, the freely released TanDEM-X DEM can be used, due to its consistency with the TanDEM-X bistatic InSAR-measured height. As a result, a parameterized model for the orbital phase error estimation is proposed in this paper. In high-resolution and high-precision TanDEM-X bistatic InSAR processing, due to the limited precision of the navigation systems and the uneven baseline changes caused by the helix formation, the BEs are time-varying in most cases. The parameterized model is thus built and estimated along each range line. To validate the proposed method, two mountainous test sites located in China (i.e., Fuping in Shanxi province and Hetang in Hunan province) were selected. The obtained results show that the orbital phase errors of the bistatic interferograms over the two test sites are well estimated. Compared with the widely applied polynomial model, the residual phase corrected by the proposed method contains little undesirable topography-dependent phase error, and avoids unexpected height errors ranging about from -6 m to 3 m for the Fuping test site and from -10 m to 8 m for the Hetang test site. Furthermore, some fine details, such as ridges and valleys, can be clearly identified after the correction. In addition, the two components of the orbital phase error, i.e., the residual flat-earth phase error and the topographic phase error caused by orbital error, are separated and quantified based on the parameterized expression. These demonstrate that the proposed method can be used to accurately estimate and mitigate the orbital phase error in TanDEM-X bistatic InSAR data, which increases the feasibility of reconstructing high-resolution and high-precision DEM. The rigorous geometric constraint, the refinement of the initial baseline parameters, and the assessment for height errors based on the estimated BEs are investigated in the discussion section of this paper.

TI  - The Strong Precipitation of the Dry Warm Front Cyclone in Syria and Its Prediction by Data Mining Modeling
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Eastern inland of Syria has a Mediterranean climate in the north and a tropical desert climate in the south, which results in a dry south and wet north climate feature, especially in winter. The circulation dynamics analysis of 16 winter strong precipitation events shows that the key system is the dry and warm front cyclone. In most cases (81-100% of the 16 cases), the moisture content in the northern part of the cyclone is higher than that in the southern part (influenced by the Mediterranean climate zone). The humidity in the middle layer is higher than that near the surface (uplifting of the dry warm front), and the thickness of the wet layer and the vertical ascending layer obviously expands upward (as shown by the satellite cloud top reflection). These characteristics lead to the moisture thermodynamic instability in the eastern part of the cyclone (dry and warm air at low level and wet and cold air at upper level). The cyclone flow transports momentum to the local humid layer of the Mediterranean climate belt and then causes unstable conditions and strong rainfall. Considering the limitations of the Syrian ground station network, the NCEP/CFSR global reanalysis data and MODIS aqua-3 cloud parameter data are used to build a multi-source factor index of winter precipitation from 2002 to 2016. A decision tree prediction model is then established and the factors index is constructed into tree shapes by the nodes and branches through calculating rules of information entropy. The suitable tree shape models are adjusted and selected by an automated training and testing process. The forecast model can classify rainfall with a forecast accuracy of more than 90% for strong rainfall over 30 mm.

TI  - UAV- and Machine Learning-Based Retrieval of Wheat SPAD Values at the Overwintering Stage for Variety Screening
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the delay in sowing has become a major obstacle to high wheat yield in Jiangsu Province, one of the major wheat producing areas in China; hence, it is necessary to screen wheat varieties are resilient for late sowing. This study aimed to provide an effective, fast, and non-destructive monitoring method of soil plant analysis development (SPAD) values, which can represent leaf chlorophyll contents, for late-sown winter wheat variety screening. This study acquired multispectral images using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) at the overwintering stage of winter wheat growth, and further processed these images to extract reflectance of five single spectral bands and calculated 26 spectral vegetation indices. Based on these 31 variables, this study combined three variable selection methods (i.e., recursive feature elimination (RFE), random forest (RF), and Pearson correlation coefficient (r)) with four machine learning algorithms (i.e., random forest regression (RFR), linear kernel-based support vector regression (SVR), radial basis function (RBF) kernel-based SVR, and sigmoid kernel-based SVR), resulted in seven SVR models (i.e., RFE-SVR_linear, RF-SVR_linear, RF-SVR_RBF, RF-SVR_sigmoid, r-SVR_linear, r-SVR_RBF, and r-SVR_sigmoid) and three RFR models (i.e., RFE-RFR, RF-RFR, and r-RFR). The performances of the 10 machine learning models were evaluated and compared with each other according to the achieved coefficient of determination (R-2), residual prediction deviation (RPD), root mean square error (RMSE), and relative RMSE (RRMSE) in SPAD estimation. Of the 10 models, the best one was the RF-SVR_sigmoid model, which was the combination of the RF variable selection method and the sigmoid kernel-based SVR algorithm. It achieved high accuracy in estimating SPAD values of the wheat canopy (R-2 = 0.754, RPD = 2.017, RMSE = 1.716 and RRMSE = 4.504%). The newly developed UAV- and machine learning-based model provided a promising and real time method to monitor chlorophyll contents at the overwintering stage, which can benefit late-sown winter wheat variety screening.

TI  - Artificial Neural Network-Based Microwave Satellite Soil Moisture Reconstruction over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is a key parameter for land-atmosphere interaction system; however, fewer existing spatial-temporally continuous and high-quality observation records impose great limitations on the application of soil moisture on long term climate change monitoring and predicting. Therefore, this study selected the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) of China as research region, and explored the feasibility of using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to reconstruct soil moisture product based on AMSR-2/AMSR-E brightness temperature and SMAP satellite data by introducing auxiliary variables, specifically considering the sensitivity of different combination of input variables, number of neurons in hidden layer, sample ratio, and precipitation threshold in model building. The results showed that the ANN model had the highest accuracy when all variables were used as inputs, it had a network containing 12 neurons in a hidden layer, it had a sample ratio 80%-10%-10% (training-validation-testing), and had a precipitation threshold of 8.75 mm, respectively. Furthermore, validation of the reconstructed soil moisture product (named ANN-SM) in other period were conducted by comparing with SMAP (April 2019 to July 2021) for all grid cells and in situ soil moisture sites (August 2010 to March 2015) of QTP, which achieved an ideal accuracy. In general, the proposed method is capable of rebuilding soil moisture products by adopting different satellite data and our soil moisture product is promising for serving the studies of long-term global and regional dynamics in water cycle and climate.

TI  - Freeze-Thaw Deformation Cycles and Temporal-Spatial Distribution of Permafrost along the Qinghai-Tibet Railway Using Multitrack InSAR Processing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Qinghai-Tibet Railway (QTR) is the railway with the highest elevation and longest distance in the world, spanning more than 1142 km from Golmud to Lhasa across the continuous permafrost region. Due to climate change and anthropogenic activities, geological disasters such as subsidence and thermal melt collapse have occurred in the QTR embankment. To conduct the large-scale permafrost monitoring and geohazard investigation along the QTR, we collected 585 Sentinel-1A images based on the composite index model using the multitrack time-series interferometry synthetic aperture radar (MTS-InSAR) method to retrieve the surface deformation over a 3.15 x 10(5) km(2) area along the QTR. Meanwhile, a new method for permafrost distribution mapping based on InSAR time series deformation was proposed. Finally, the seasonal deformation map and a new map of permafrost distribution along the QTR from Golmud to Lhasa were obtained. The results showed that the estimated seasonal deformation range of the 10 km buffer zone along the QTR was -50-10 mm, and the LOS deformation rate ranged from -30 to 15 mm/yr. In addition, the deformation results were validated by leveling measurements, and the range of absolute error was between 0.1 and 4.62 mm. Most of the QTR was relatively stable. Some geohazard-prone sections were detected and analyzed along the QTR. The permafrost distribution results were mostly consistent with the simulated results of Zou's method, based on the temperature at the top of permafrost (TTOP) model. This study reveals recent deformation characteristics of the QTR, and has significant scientific implications and applicational value for ensuring the safe operation of the QTR. Moreover, our method, based on InSAR results, provides new insights for permafrost classification on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP).

TI  - ACFNet: A Feature Fusion Network for Glacial Lake Extraction Based on Optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacial lake extraction is essential for studying the response of glacial lakes to climate change and assessing the risks of glacial lake outburst floods. Most methods for glacial lake extraction are based on either optical images or synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Although deep learning methods can extract features of optical and SAR images well, efficiently fusing two modality features for glacial lake extraction with high accuracy is challenging. In this study, to make full use of the spectral characteristics of optical images and the geometric characteristics of SAR images, we propose an atrous convolution fusion network (ACFNet) to extract glacial lakes based on Landsat 8 optical images and Sentinel-1 SAR images. ACFNet adequately fuses high-level features of optical and SAR data in different receptive fields using atrous convolution. Compared with four fusion models in which data fusion occurs at the input, encoder, decoder, and output stages, two classical semantic segmentation models (SegNet and DeepLabV3+), and a recently proposed model based on U-Net, our model achieves the best results with an intersection-over-union of 0.8278. The experiments show that fully extracting the characteristics of optical and SAR data and appropriately fusing them are vital steps in a network's performance of glacial lake extraction.

TI  - Long-Term Lake Area Change and Its Relationship with Climate in the Endorheic Basins of the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes are sensitive indicators of climate change in the Tibetan Plateau (TP), which have shown high temporal and spatial variability in recent decades. The driving forces for the change are still not entirely clear. This study examined the area change of the lakes greater than 1 km(2) in the endorheic basins of the Tibetan Plateau (EBTP) using Landsat images from 1990 to 2019, and analysed the relationships between lake area and local and large-scale climate variables at different geographic scales. The results show that lake area in the EBTP has increased significantly from 1990 to 2019 at a rate of 432.52 km(2)center dot year(-1). In the past 30 years, lake area changes in the EBTP have mainly been affected by local climate variables such as precipitation and temperature. At a large scale, Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) has correlations with lake area in western sub-regions in the Inner Basin (IB). While Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) has a significant connection with lake area, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) does not. We also found that abnormal drought (rainfall) brought by the El Nino/La Nina events are significantly correlated with the lake area change in most sub-regions in the IB.

TI  - High-Resolution LiDAR Digital Elevation Model Referenced Landslide Slide Observation with Differential Interferometric Radar, GNSS, and Underground Measurements
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Featured Application Verification of DInSAR analysis results, Ascending or Descending solution for better aspect, GNSS verification method, underground to ground surface measurement, and landslide mapping based on deformation map. The area of Taiwan is 70% hillsides. In addition, the topography fluctuates wildly, and it is active in earthquakes and young orogenic movements. Landslides are a widespread disaster in Taiwan. However, landslides are not a disaster until someone enters the mountain area for development. Therefore, landslide displacement monitoring is the primary task of this study. Potential landslide areas with mostly slate geological conditions were selected as candidate sites in this study. The slate bedding in this area is approximately 30 to 75 degrees toward the southeast, which means that creep may occur due to gravity deformation caused by high-angle rock formation strikes. In addition, because the research site is located in a densely vegetated area, the data noise is very high, and it is not easy to obtain good results. This study chose ESA Sentinel-1 data for analysis and 1-m LiDAR DEM as reference elevation. The 1-m LiDAR DEM with high accuracy can help to detect more complex deformation from DInSAR. The Sentinel-1 series of satellites have a regular revisit period. In addition, the farm areas of roads, bridges, and buildings in the study area provided enough reflections to produce good coherence. Sentinel-1 images from March 2017 to June 2021 were analyzed, obtaining slope deformation and converting it to the vertical direction. Deformation derived from SAR is compared with other measurements, including GNSS and underground slope inclinometer. The SBAS solution process provides more DInSAR pairs to overcome the problem of tremendous noise and has increased accuracy. Moreover, the SBAS method's parameter modification derives more candidate points in the vegetated area. The vertical deformation comparison between the GNSS installation location and the ascending SBAS solution's vertical deformation is consistent. Moreover, the reliable facing of the slope toward the SAR satellite is discussed. Due to the limitations of the GNSS stations, this study proposes a method to convert the observed deformation from the slope inclinometer and convert it to vertical deformation. The displacement of the slope indicator is originally a horizontal displacement. It is assumed that it is fixed at the farthest underground, and the bottom-to-top movement is integrated with depth. The results show that the proposed equation to convert horizontal to vertical displacement fits well in this condition. The activity of landslides within the LiDAR digital elevation model identified as scars is also mapped.

TI  - Orbit Simulator for Satellite and Near-Space Platforms Supporting Observing System Simulation Experiments
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Developed at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Joint Center for Satellite Data Assimilation (JCSDA), the Community Global Observing System Simulation Experiment (OSSE) Package (CGOP) provides a vehicle to quantitatively evaluate the impacts of emerging environmental observing systems or emerging in situ or remote sensing instruments on NOAA numerical weather prediction (NWP) forecast skill. The typical first step for the OSSE is to simulate observations from the so-called nature run. Therefore, the observation spatial, temporal, and view geometry are needed to extract the atmospheric and surface variables from the nature run, which are then input to the observation forward operator (e.g., radiative transfer models) to simulate the new observations. This is a challenge for newly proposed systems for which instruments are not yet built or platforms are not yet deployed. To address this need, this study introduces an orbit simulator to compute these parameters based on the specific hosting platform and onboard instrument characteristics, which has been recently developed by the NOAA Center for Satellite Applications and Research (STAR) and added to the GCOP framework. In addition to simulating existing polar-orbiting and geostationary orbits, it is also applicable to emerging near-space platforms (e.g., stratospheric balloons), cube satellite constellations, and Tundra orbits. The observation geometry simulator includes not only passive microwave and infrared sounders but also global navigation satellite system/radio occultation (GNSS/RO) instruments. For passive atmospheric sounders, it calculates the geometric parameters of proposed instruments on different platforms, such as time varying location (latitude and longitude), scan geometry (satellite zenith and azimuth angles), and ground instantaneous field of view (GIFOV) parameters for either cross-track or conical scanning mechanisms. For RO observations, it determines the geometry of the transmitters and receivers either on satellites or stratospheric balloons and computes their slant paths. The simulator has been successfully applied for recent OSSE studies (e.g., evaluating the impacts of future geostationary hyperspectral infrared sounders and RO observations from stratospheric balloons).& nbsp;

AB  - This paper aims to explore how the Jesuit missionaries and their Chinese supporters negotiated the tension between mechanical knowledge, along with its embedded theological implications and the Chinese worldview by examining the Yuanxi qiqi tushuo luzui and the biography of a Chinese inventor Huang Luzhuang in the context of the polemical debates on Christianity in seventeenth century China. Centring on the concept of creation, I demonstrate how the understanding of machine or automata relates to broader questions regarding the natural world and human agency at the juncture of intellectual transformations in both Europe and China: While some European thinkers, inspired by machines, promoted the worldview of a passive nature analogous to machine, concepts of unity and spontaneity provided the Chinese with an opportunity to account for the autonomy of the machine as something operating in accordance with the self-generating natural world.

TI  - Centroid Extraction Method of Gaofen-7 Satellite Footprint Spots and Stability Monitoring
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The laser altimeter of the Gaofen-7 satellite is equipped with a laser surveillance camera and a laser footprint camera to obtain laser spots and optical footprint images, so as to assist laser positioning. In this paper, we proposed a method of extracting the footprint spot centroid that took into account the influence of the external environment on the image quality of the footprint spot. The least squares image matching between the footprint spot and the surveillance spot was carried out to obtain the conversion model. Then, the surveillance spot centroid was extracted by the gray centroid method. Finally, the surveillance spot centroid was converted to the footprint spot centroid by the conversion model. The data of 100 groups of simulated spots and 1 track of Gaofen-7 satellite footprint spot were used for the test. The results show that the offset standard deviation of the spot centroid extracted by the proposed method was less than 0. 08 pixel and 0. 1 pixel larger than those of the gray centroid method and the Gaussian fitting method. 30 tracks of Gaofen-7 satellite footprint spots over a time span of seven months were tested. The results show that both the two footprint spot centroids have a jitter scope of fewer than 1.2 m on the ground, with good long-term stability. The experimental results demonstrate that there is a stable geometrical relationship between the Gaofen-7 laser altimeter laser and the optical footprint image and that the optical footprint image can be used to assist the in-orbit pointing calibration and geometric positioning processing.

TI  - Mapping Abandoned Cropland Changes in the Hilly and Gully Region of the Loess Plateau in China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - As a form of land marginalization, abandoned cropland has an important impact on food security and the effective supply of agricultural products. With rapid urbanization across the world, large areas of cropland are abandoned in some regions, especially in mountainous and hilly areas with poor terrain. Due to the fine fragmentation and scattered distribution of abandoned cropland, and considering differences in the abandoned and fallow time of cropland, it is difficult to extract information using remote sensing technology. Therefore, this paper proposes a change in the detection method for extracting abandoned cropland information based on identifying the annual land use trajectory. Based on Landsat satellite data, annual land use was mapped from 2011 to 2020 in Gaolan County, which is located in the hilly and gully region of the Loess Plateau of China, using the random forest classification method. Subsequently, abandoned cropland information in Gaolan County was extracted, based on the land use change trajectory and analysis of the influencing factors of abandoned land. The results showed that: (1) The overall accuracy of land use interpretation in Gaolan County ranged from 86.44% to 95.45%, from 2011 to 2020, with a kappa coefficient of up to 0.93, and the classification results were ideal. (2) The recall of extracted abandoned cropland was 81%, the extraction accuracy of which was relatively high. (3) From 2013 to 2020, the cropland abandonment rate in Gaolan County ranged from 8.41% to 19.65%, with an average of 14.55%, which increased and then decreased. The abandonment rate was highest in 2015 but it then decreased year by year. The average period of abandoned cropland was 4.2 years. (4) The influence factors of the plot scale explain the difference in the spatial distribution of cultivated land abandonment. The higher the slope condition, the lower the soil nutrient content and the greater the possibility of abandonment.

TI  - Planar Six-Axis Force and Torque Sensors
T2  - IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel planar six-axis force and torque (F/T) sensor is proposed, inspired by a 3-RRR compliant mechanism, and having three limbs, each of which has three revolute joints. This design innovatively employs strain gauges on the top and bottom surfaces only, which reduces not only the number of required fabrication processes but also the labor costs associated with attaching strain gauges onto positions that are difficult to access. In this study, the stiffness of the planar F/T sensor associated with F-x, F-y, and T-z are formulated using inverse kinematics and coordinate transformation methods. For T-x, T-y, and F-z, the equivalent cantilever beam method is adopted to derive the relationships between loads and strains. Moreover, optimization is performed to determine the optimal design parameters of the FIT sensor. The calibration error using the cubic transformation matrix is 0.29% in the measurement range F-x = F-y = F-z = +/- 100 N, T-z = +/- 10 Nm, T-x = T-y = +/- 6 Nm.

TI  - Lithological Mapping Based on Fully Convolutional Network and Multi-Source Geological Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep learning algorithms have found numerous applications in the field of geological mapping to assist in mineral exploration and benefit from capabilities such as high-dimensional feature learning and processing through multi-layer networks. However, there are two challenges associated with identifying geological features using deep learning methods. On the one hand, a single type of data resource cannot diagnose the characteristics of all geological units; on the other hand, deep learning models are commonly designed to output a certain class for the whole input rather than segmenting it into several parts, which is necessary for geological mapping tasks. To address such concerns, a framework that comprises a multi-source data fusion technology and a fully convolutional network (FCN) model is proposed in this study, aiming to improve the classification accuracy for geological mapping. Furthermore, multi-source data fusion technology is first applied to integrate geochemical, geophysical, and remote sensing data for comprehensive analysis. A semantic segmentation-based FCN model is then constructed to determine the lithological units per pixel by exploring the relationships among multi-source data. The FCN is trained end-to-end and performs dense pixel-wise prediction with an arbitrary input size, which is ideal for targeting geological features such as lithological units. The framework is finally proven by a comparative study in discriminating seven lithological units in the Cuonadong dome, Tibet, China. A total classification accuracy of 0.96 and a high mean intersection over union value of 0.9 were achieved, indicating that the proposed model would be an innovative alternative to traditional machine learning algorithms for geological feature mapping.

TI  - A Four-Step Method for Estimating Suspended Particle Size Based on In Situ Comprehensive Observations in the Pearl River Estuary in China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The suspended particle size has great impacts on marine biology environments and biogeochemical processes, such as the settling rates of particles and sunlight transmission in marine water. However, the spatial-temporal variations in particle sizes in coastal waters are rarely reported due to the paucity of appropriate observations and the limitations of particle size retrieval methods, especially in areas with complex optical properties. This study proposed a remote sensing-based method for estimating the median particle size D-v(50) (calculated with a size range of 2.05-297 mu m) that correlates D-v(50) with the inherent optical properties (IOPs) retrieved from in situ remote sensing reflectance above the water's surface (R-rs(lambda)) in the Pearl River estuary (PRE) in China. R-rs(lambda) was resampled to simulate the Multispectral Instrument (MSI) onboard Sentinel-2A/B, and the wavebands in 490, 560, and 705 nm were utilized for the retrieval of the IOPs. The results of this method had a statistical performance of 0.86, 18.52, 21.28%, and -1.85 for the R-2, RMSE, MAPE, and bias values, respectively, in validation, which indicated that D-v(50) could be estimated by R-rs(lambda) with the proposed four-step method. Then, the proposed method was applied to Sentinel-2 MSI imagery, and a clear difference in D-v(50) distribution which was retrieved from a different time could be seen. The proposed method holds great potential for monitoring the suspended particle size of coastal waters.

TI  - TOWARD AN ECOCENTRIC CHRISTIAN ECOLOGY An Interreligious Case Study in Indigenous and Christian Eco-Activism
T2  - JOURNAL OF RELIGIOUS ETHICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropocentrism is an old and persisting problem for Christian ecology. This article argues that one way Christian ecological ethics can begin moving beyond anthropocentrism is by looking outside itself to other traditions that practice and observe a more ecocentric ethic. Specifically, it suggests an engagement with indigenous traditions of North America. Holding up the ecocentric tactics and discursive strategies employed by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe (SRST) during the 2016 Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) protests the article shows how American Indian ecologies can help move Christians toward a more ecocentric worldview. It then examines the ways certain Christian groups approached their allyship with the SRST during the DAPL protests and asks which of these groups approached this case of interreligious, ecological resistance most effectively as allies. That is, it asks which Christian groups partnered with the SRST in ways that actually aided the protests and, additionally, fostered the possibility of learning from the SRST's ecocentric, indigenous religious ecology. The aim is to provide an example of how collaborative, respectful, anticolonial dialogue and allyship can happen between Christian and indigenous eco-activists in a way that is mutually beneficial.

TI  - Global Intercomparison of Hyper-Resolution ECOSTRESS Coastal Sea Surface Temperature Measurements from the Space Station with VIIRS-N20
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The ECOSTRESS multi-channel thermal radiometer on the Space Station has an unprecedented spatial resolution of 70 m and a return time of hours to 5 days. It resolves details of oceanographic features not detectable in imagery from MODIS or VIIRS, and has open-ocean coverage, unlike Landsat. We calibrated two years of ECOSTRESS sea surface temperature observations with L2 data from VIIRS-N20 (2019-2020) worldwide but especially focused on important upwelling systems currently undergoing climate change forcing. Unlike operational SST products from VIIRS-N20, the ECOSTRESS surface temperature algorithm does not use a regression approach to determine temperature, but solves a set of simultaneous equations based on first principles for both surface temperature and emissivity. We compared ECOSTRESS ocean temperatures to well-calibrated clear sky satellite measurements from VIIRS-N20. Data comparisons were constrained to those within 90 min of one another using co-located clear sky VIIRS and ECOSTRESS pixels. ECOSTRESS ocean temperatures have a consistent 1.01 degrees C negative bias relative to VIIRS-N20, although deviation in brightness temperatures within the 10.49 and 12.01 mu m bands were much smaller. As an alternative, we compared the performance of NOAA, NASA, and U.S. Navy operational split-window SST regression algorithms taking into consideration the statistical limitations imposed by intrinsic SST spatial autocorrelation and applying corrections on brightness temperatures. We conclude that standard bias-correction methods using already validated and well-known algorithms can be applied to ECOSTRESS SST data, yielding highly accurate products of ultra-high spatial resolution for studies of biological and physical oceanography in a time when these are needed to properly evaluate regional and even local impacts of climate change.

TI  - Impacts of Forest Fire on Understory Species Diversity in Canary Pine Ecosystems on the Island of La Palma
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires are drivers of spatial patterns and temporal dynamics of vegetation and biodiversity. On the Canary Islands, large areas of pine forest exist, dominated by the endemic Canary Island pine, Pinus canariensis C. Sm. These mostly natural forests experience wildfires frequently. P. canariensis is well-adapted to such impacts and has the ability to re-sprout from both stems and branches. In recent decades, however, anthropogenically caused fires have increased, and climate change further enhances the likelihood of large forest fires. Through its dense, long needles, P. canariensis promotes cloud precipitation, which is an important ecosystem service for the freshwater supply of islands such as La Palma. Thus, it is important to understand the regeneration and vegetation dynamics of these ecosystems after fire. Here, we investigated species diversity patterns in the understory vegetation of P. canariensis forests after the large 2016 fire on the southern slopes of La Palma. We analyzed the effect of fire intensity, derived from Sentinel-2 NDVI differences, and of environmental variables, on species richness (alpha diversity) and compositional dissimilarity (beta diversity). We used redundancy analysis (dbRDA), Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, and variance partitioning for this analysis. Fire intensity accounted for a relatively small proportion of variation in alpha and beta diversity, while elevation was the most important predictor. Our results also reveal the important role of the endemic Lotus campylocladus ssp. hillebrandii (Christ) Sandral & D.D.Sokoloff for understory diversity after fire. Its dominance likely reduces the ability of other species to establish by taking up nutrients and water and by shading the ground. The mid- to long-term effects are unclear since Lotus is an important nitrogen fixer in P. canariensis forests and can reduce post-fire soil erosion on steep slopes.

TI  - Remotely Sensed Fine-Fuel Changes from Wildfire and Prescribed Fire in a Semi-Arid Grassland
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The spread of flammable invasive grasses, woody plant encroachment, and enhanced aridity have interacted in many grasslands globally to increase wildfire activity and risk to valued assets. Annual variation in the abundance and distribution of fine-fuel present challenges to land managers implementing prescribed burns and mitigating wildfire, although methods to produce high-resolution fuel estimates are still under development. To further understand how prescribed fire and wildfire influence fine-fuels in a semi-arid grassland invaded by non-native perennial grasses, we combined high-resolution Sentinel-2A imagery with in situ vegetation data and machine learning to estimate yearly fine-fuel loads from 2015 to 2020. The resulting model of fine-fuel corresponded to field-based validation measurements taken in the first (R-2 = 0.52, RMSE = 218 kg/ha) and last year (R-2 = 0.63, RMSE = 196 kg/ha) of this 6-year study. Serial prediction of the fine-fuel model allowed for an assessment of the effect of prescribed fire (average reduction of -80 kg/ha 1-year post fire) and wildfire (-260 kg/ha 1-year post fire) on fuel conditions. Post-fire fine-fuel loads were significantly lower than in unburned control areas sampled just outside fire perimeters from 2015 to 2020 across all fires (t = 1.67, p < 0.0001); however, fine-fuel recovery occurred within 3-5 years, depending upon burn and climate conditions. When coupled with detailed fuels data from field measurements, Sentinel-2A imagery provided a means for evaluating grassland fine-fuels at yearly time steps and shows high potential for extended monitoring of dryland fuels. Our approach provides land managers with a systematic analysis of the effects of fire management treatments on fine-fuel conditions and provides an accurate, updateable, and expandable solution for mapping fine-fuels over yearly time steps across drylands throughout the world.

TI  - Pure and Mixed Tubular Carcinoma of the Breast: Mammographic Features, Clinicopathological Characteristics and Prognostic Analysis
T2  - TECHNOLOGY IN CANCER RESEARCH & TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the mammographic features, clinicopathological characteristics, treatments, and prognosis of pure and mixed tubular carcinomas of the breast. Materials and methods: Twenty-five tubular carcinomas were pathologically confirmed at our hospital from January 2011 to May 2019. Twenty-one patients underwent preoperative mammography. A retrospective analysis of mammographic features, clinicopathological characteristics, treatment, and outcomes was performed. Results: Altogether, 95% of the pure tubular carcinomas (PTCs) and mixed tubular carcinomas (MTCs) showed the presence of a mass or structural distortions on mammography and the difference was not statistically significant (P = .373). MTCs exhibited a larger tumor size than PTCs (P = .033). Lymph node metastasis was more common (P = .005) in MTCs. Patients in our study showed high estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor positivity rates, but low human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positivity rate. The overall survival rate was 100% in both PTC and MTC groups and the 5-year disease-free survival rates were 100% and 75%, respectively with no significant difference between the groups (P = .264). Conclusion: Tubular carcinoma of the breast is potentially malignant and has a favorable prognosis. Digital breast tomosynthesis may improve its detection. For patients with PTC, breast-conserving surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy are recommended based on the low rate of lymph node metastasis and good prognosis. MTC has a relatively high rate of lymph node metastasis and a particular risk of metastasis. Axillary lymph node dissection should be performed for MTC even if the tumor is smaller than 2 cm.

TI  - Enhancing Gonococcal Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance in Cisgender Women, Strengthening the US Response to Resistant Gonorrhea, 2018 to 2019
T2  - SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Cisgender women have been underrepresented in antibiotic-resistant gonorrhea (ARGC) surveillance systems. Three of 8 project sites (City of Milwaukee [MIL], Guilford County [GRB], Denver County [DEN]), funded under the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Strengthening the US Response to Resistant Gonorrhea (SURRG), focused efforts to better include cisgender women in ARGC surveillance. Methods MIL, GRB, and DEN partnered with diverse health care settings and developed gonorrhea culture criteria to facilitate urogenital specimen collection in cisgender women and men. Regional laboratories within the Antibiotic Resistance Laboratory Network performed agar dilution antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) of gonococcal isolates. Data from 2018 and 2019 were analyzed. Results In SURRG, 90.5% (11,464 of 12,667) of the cisgender women from whom urogenital culture specimens were collected were from MIL, GRB, and DEN. Of women in SURRG whose gonococcal isolates underwent AST, 70% were from these 3 sites. In these 3 sites, a substantial proportion of cisgender women with positive urogenital cultures and AST were from health care settings other than sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics (non-STD clinics; MIL, 56.0%; GRB, 80.4%; and DEN, 23.5%). Isolates with AST were obtained from 5.1%, 10.2%, and 2.4% of all diagnosed gonorrhea cases among cisgender women in MIL, GRB, and DEN, respectively, and were more often susceptible to all antibiotics than those from cisgender men from each of these sites. Conclusions With focused efforts and partnerships with non-STD clinics, 3 SURRG sites were able to include robust ARGC surveillance from cisgender women. These findings may guide further efforts to improve gender equity in ARGC surveillance.

TI  - Pathway modeling applied to TREAT-AD proteomic targets demonstrates linkages between AD endophenotypes.
T2  - Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: The poor success rate of therapeutic targeting in Alzheimer's disease necessitates the explorations of new biological areas and hypotheses of disease mechanism. The TREAT-AD Consortium is an international group of academic researchers dedicated to identifying novel targets for AD from under-explored areas of disease-linked pathology. However, target identification from genomic and proteomic studies is extremely challenging.METHOD: Toward that end, we identified 13 core biological domains associated with AD, and created a gene ontology (GO) mapping to each in order to automatically identify genes associated with each endophenotype. The TREAT-AD hits coming from large scale brain proteomic studies were then mapped onto the core biological domains. A novel system of dynamic data driven pathway reconstruction was applied that draws binary relationships from the Pathway Commons data store and builds AD-weighted pathways around the proteomic targets linked to the 13 core biological domains of AD.RESULT: The dynamic data-driven pathway reconstruction application developed large network objects around the submitted proteomic targets that create hypothetical linkage points across discrete areas of disease biology. The network objects represent a holistic pathway linking the submitted TREAT-AD proteomic hits to each other, through missing elements and disease sentinel genes, to create an interlinked pathway model. This model can be shared and community-mined for significant AD-linked hypotheses. Using this approach, we identified numerous interactions between AD endophenotypes, such as neuroinflammation and endocytosis.CONCLUSION: One of the primary difficulties with therapeutic target identification is understanding the biological network within which any particular gene resides. The tools we have developed may help examine the biological neighborhood more robustly, as well as assess specific hypothetical mechanist connections between genes that may help identify and optimized AD-drug targets in the future.

TI  - High Chlorophyll-a Areas along the Western Coast of South Sulawesi-Indonesia during the Rainy Season Revealed by Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The southern coast of South Sulawesi-Indonesia is known as an upwelling area occurring during dry season, which peaks in August. This upwelling area is indicated by high chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations due to a strong easterly wind-induced upwelling. However, the investigation of Chl-a variability is less studied along the western coast of South Sulawesi. By taking advantages of remote sensing data of Chl-a, sea surface temperature, surface wind, and precipitation, the present study firstly shows that along the western coast of South Sulawesi, there are two areas, which have high primary productivity occurring during the rainy season. The first area is at 119.0 degrees E-119.5 degrees E; 3.5 degrees S-4.0 degrees S, while the second area is at 119.0 degrees E-119.5 degrees E; 3.5 degrees S-4.0 degrees S. The maximum primary productivity in the first (second) area occurs in April (January). The generating mechanism of the high primary productivity along the western coast of South Sulawesi is different from its southern coast. The presence of river runoff in these two areas may bring anthropogenic organic compounds during the peak of rainy season, resulting in increased Chl-a concentration.

TI  - Mapping Urban Excavation Induced Deformation in 3D via Multiplatform InSAR Time-Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Excavation of a subway station and rail crossover cavern in downtown Los Angeles, California, USA, induced over 1.8 cm of surface settlement between June 2018 and February 2019 as measured by a ground-based monitoring system. Point measurements of surface deformation above the excavation were extracted by applying Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) time-series analyses to data from multiple sensors with different wavelengths. These sensors include C-band Sentinel-1, X-band COSMO-SkyMed, and L-band Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle SAR (UAVSAR). The InSAR time-series point measurements were interpolated to continuous distribution surfaces, weighted by distance, and entered into the Minimum-Acceleration (MinA) algorithm to calculate 3D displacement values. This dataset, composed of satellite and airborne SAR data from X, C, and L band sensors, revealed previously unidentified deformation surrounding the 2nd Street and Broadway Subway Station and the adjacent rail crossover cavern, with maximum vertical and horizontal deformations reaching 2.5 cm and 1.7 cm, respectively. In addition, the analysis shows that airborne SAR data with alternative viewing geometries to traditional polar-orbiting SAR satellites can be used to constrain horizontal displacements in the North-South direction while maintaining agreement with ground-based data.

However, while ground-based meteorological data has limitations in identifying all the complex droughts in Korea, satellite remote sensing data can be effectively used to identify the spatial characteristics of drought in a wide range of regions and to detect drought. This study attempted to analyze the possibility of using remote sensing data for drought identification in South Korea. In order to monitor various aspects of drought, remote sensing and ground observation data of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration, which are major variables affecting drought, were collected. The evaluation of the applicability of remote sensing data was conducted focusing on the comparison with the observation data. First, to evaluate the applicability and accuracy of remote sensing data, the correlations with observation data were analyzed, and drought indices of various aspects were calculated using precipitation and potential evapotranspiration for meteorological drought monitoring. Then, to evaluate the drought monitoring ability of remote sensing data, the drought reproducibility of the past was confirmed using the drought index. Finally, a high-resolution drought map using remote sensing data was prepared to evaluate the possibility of using remote sensing data for actual drought in South Korea. Through the application of remote sensing data, it was judged that it would be possible to identify and understand various drought conditions occurring in all regions of South Korea, including unmeasured watersheds in the future.

TI  - Vegetation Drought Vulnerability Mapping Using a Copula Model of Vegetation Index and Meteorological Drought Index
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Since vegetation is closely related to a variety of hydrological factors, the vegetation condition during a drought is greatly affected by moisture supply or moisture demand from the atmosphere. However, since feedback between vegetation and climate in the event of drought is very complex, it is necessary to construct a joint probability distribution that can describe and investigate the interrelationships between them. In other words, it is required to understand the interaction between vegetation and climate in terms of joint probability. In this study, the possibility of drought stress experienced by vegetation under various conditions occurring during drought was investigated by dividing drought into two aspects (atmospheric moisture supply and moisture demand). Meteorological drought indices that explain different aspects of drought and vegetation-related drought indexes that describe the state of vegetation were estimated using data remotely sensed by satellites in parts of Far East Asia centered on South Korea. Bivariate joint probability distribution modeling was performed from vegetation drought index and meteorological drought index using Copula. It was found that the relationship between the vegetation drought index and the meteorological drought index has regional characteristics and there is also a seasonal change. From the copula-based model, it was possible to quantify the conditional probability distribution for the drought stress of vegetation under meteorological drought scenarios that occur from different causes. Through this, by mapping the vulnerability of vegetation to meteorological drought in the study area, it was possible to spatially check how the vegetation responds differently depending on the season and meteorological causes. The probabilistic mapping of vegetation vulnerability to various aspects of meteorological drought may provide useful information for establishing mitigation strategies for ecological drought.

TI  - Factors Affecting Accuracy of Stereotactic Radioisotope-guided Occult Lesion Localisation for Breast Lesions
T2  - HONG KONG JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: To assess the surgical success rate of stereotactic radioisotope-guided occult lesion localisation (ROLL) and to identify factors affecting its accuracy.Methods: We retrospectively identified all stereotactic ROLL procedures from June 2017 to August 2018 at a regional hospital in Hong Kong. Demographic data, imaging results, previous biopsy records, surgical records, and pathology results were reviewed. Independent-sample t tests and Fisher's exact test were used to assess the association of multiple factors (including age, breast thickness, depth of lesion, type of target, approach direction, pathology, operator experience) with localisation accuracy using a 5-mm deviation between the centres of the mammographic targets and the scintigraphic image as the threshold.Results: A total of 77 ROLL procedures were identified. Of them, 55 were localisations of nonpalpable lesions and 22 were combined radioisotope-guided sentinel node and occult breast lesion localisations. The overall surgical success rate for removal of the target lesion was 85.7%, and for excision of malignant nonpalpable breast lesions with clear margins the success rate was 83.9%. Specimen mammogram and scintigraphic images were available in 68 cases for subsequent analysis for factors affecting localisation accuracy. A preoperative diagnosis of invasive carcinoma was associated with poorer target localisation (p = 0.015). Injection of radioisotope via a lateromedial direction was associated with better target localisation (p = 0.044).Conclusion: Stereotactic ROLL is effective in localising nonpalpable breast lesions with a high surgical success rate. There is a significant association between invasive carcinoma with worse localisation. Injection of radioisotope in lateromedial directions is associated with better localisation accuracy.

TI  - A Comparative Errors Assessment Between Surface Albedo Products of COMS/MI and GK-2A/AMI
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global satellite observation surface albedo data over a long period of time are actively used to monitor changes in the global climate and environment, and their utilization and importance are great. Through the generational shift of geostationary satellites COMS (Communication, Ocean and Meteorological Satellite)/MI (Meteorological Imager sensor) and GK-2A (GEO-KOMPSAT-2A)/AMI (Advanced Meteorological Imager sensor), it is possible to continuously secure surface albedo outputs. However, the surface albedo outputs of COMS/MI and GK-2A/AMI differ between outputs due to differences in retrieval algorithms. Therefore, in order to expand the retrieval period of the surface albedo of COMS/MI and GK-2A/AMI to secure continuous climate change monitoring linkage, the analysis of the two satellite outputs and errors should be preceded. In this study, error characteristics were analyzed by performing comparative analysis with ground observation data AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network) and other satellite data GLASS (Global Land Surface Satellite) for the overlapping period of COMS/MI and GK-2A/AMI surface albedo data. As a result of error analysis, it was confirmed that the RMSE of COMS/MI was 0.043, higher than the RMSE of GK-2A/AMI, 0.015. In addition, compared to other satellite (GLASS) data, the RMSE of COMS/MI was 0.029, slightly lower than that of GK-2A/AMI 0.038. When understanding these error characteristics and using COMS/MI and GK-2A/AMI's surface albedo data, it will be possible to actively utilize them for long-term climate change monitoring.

TI  - Application of Spectral Index-Based Logistic Regression to Detect Inland Water in the South Caucasus
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Caucasus is a diverse region with many climate zones that range from subtropical lowlands to mountainous alpine areas. The region is marked by irrigated croplands fed by irrigation canals, heavily vegetated wetlands, lakes, and reservoirs. In this study, we demonstrate the development of an improved surface water map based on a global water dataset to get a better understanding of the spatial distribution of small water bodies. First, we used the global water product from the European Commission Joint Research Center (JRC) to generate training data points by stratified random sampling. Next, we applied the optimal probability cut-off logistic regression model to develop surface water datasets for the entire Caucasus region, covering 19 Landsat tiles from May to October 2019. Finally, we used 6745 manually classified points (3261 non-water, 3484 water) to validate both the newly developed water dataset and the JRC global surface water dataset using an estimated proportion of area error matrix to evaluate accuracy. Our approach produced surface water extent maps with higher accuracy (89.2%) and detected 392 km(2) more water than the global product (86.7% accuracy). We demonstrate that the newly developed method enables surface water detection of small ponds and lakes, flooded agricultural fields, and narrow irrigation channels, which are particularly important for mosquito-borne diseases.

TI  - Analyzing Pixel-Level Relationships between Luojia 1-01 Nighttime Light and Urban Surface Features by Separating the Pixel Blooming Effect
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Nighttime light (NTL) remote sensing data can effectively reveal human activities in urban development. It has received extensive attention in recent years, owing to its advantages in monitoring urban socio-economic activities. Due to the coarse spatial resolution and blooming effect, few studies can explain the factors influencing NTL variations at a fine scale. This study explores the relationships between Luojia 1-01 NTL intensity and urban surface features at the pixel level. The Spatial Durbin model is used to measure the contributions of different urban surface features (represented by Points-of-interest (POIs), roads, water body and vegetation) to NTL intensity. The contributions of different urban surface features to NTL intensity and the Pixel Blooming Effect (PIBE) are effectively separated by direct effect and indirect effect (pseudo-R-2 = 0.915; Pearson correlation = 0.774; Moran's I = 0.014). The results show that the contributions of different urban surface features to NTL intensity and PIBE are significantly different. Roads and transportation facilities are major contributors to NTL intensity and PIBE. The contribution of commercial area is much lower than that of roads in terms of PIBE. The inhibitory effect of water body is weaker than that of vegetation in terms of NTL intensity and PIBE. For each urban surface feature, the direct contribution to NTL intensity is far less than the indirect contribution (PIBE of total neighbors), but greater than the marginal indirect effect (PIBE of each neighbor). The method proposed in this study is expected to provide a reference for explaining the composition and blooming effect of NTL, as well as the application of NTL data in the urban interior.

TI  - A Novel Method for Layover Detection in Mountainous Areas with SAR Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is well known that there are geometric distortions in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images when the terrain undulates. Layover is the most common one, which brings challenges to the application of SAR remote sensing. This study proposes a novel detection method that is mainly aimed at the layover caused by mountains and can be performed with only medium-resolution SAR images and no other auxiliary data. The detection includes the following four stages: initial processing, difference image calculation and rough and fine layover detection. Initial processing mainly obtains the potential layover areas, which are mixed with the built-up areas after classification. Additionally, according to the analysis of the backscatter coefficient (BC) of various ground objects with different polarization images, the layover areas are detected step-by-step from the mixed areas, in which the region-based FCM segmentation algorithm and spatial relationship criteria are used. Taking the Danjiangkou Reservoir area as the study area, the relevant experiments with Sentinel-1A SAR images were conducted. The quantitative analysis of detection results adopted the figure of merit (FoM), and the highest accuracy was up to 87.6% of one selected validation region. Experiments in the South Taihang area also showed the satisfactory effect of layover detection, and the values of FoM were all above 85%. These results show that the proposed method can do well in the layover detection caused by mountains. Its simplicity and effectiveness are helpful in removing the influence of layover on SAR image applications to a certain extent and improving the development of SAR remote sensing technology.

TI  - Spatio-temporal changes in urban green space in 107 Chinese cities (1990-2019): The role of economic drivers and policy
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban green space (UGS) has gained increasing attention due to its environmental and social functions. However, the compound effects of climate change, population growth and economic development on UGS are largely unknown. We selected 107 medium-sized and large cities in China to investigate dynamics in the spatial pattern of UGS in relation to government policy and other drivers based on remote sensing data for the period 1990 to 2019. To explore the effect of different levels of urbanization on changes in green space, we develop a new Normalized Urban Development Index (NUDI) to classify urban-suburban-rural gradients, viz. Long-term Builtup, New Built-up and Non-Built-up. Then, we analysed changes over time in the annual peak value of fraction of vegetation cover (FVC) for 380,000 cloud-free Landsat images, and regional UGS dynamics were evaluated using the proposed Regional Greenness Dynamic Index (RGDI). Finally, to reveal the major driver(s) of changes in UGS and estimate the extent to which patterns of urban greening are due to differences in economic development, we compared the observed UGS spatio-temporal dynamics with data on several climatic, social-economic and land use related factors for the same period. The NUDI are shown to be highly effective in mapping urban development gradients, with overall accuracy in the identified classes of 89%. Annual maximum FVC analysis indicates that there was significant greening between 1990 and 2019 in both the long-term built up (10,667.52 km(2)) and the non-built up areas (529,310.47 km(2)), while there was a major increase in browning (25,110.43 km(2)) in the newly built-up areas. The RGDI results indicate that 65% (71/107) of long-term built-up areas in cities trended greener over 2010 to 2019 under consideration. At the whole city scale, RGDI is negatively correlated with gross domestic product (GDP), although when considering the long-term built-up areas only, economic growth exhibits a significant positive correlation during 2010 to 2019 (R = 0.62, p < 0.01). This study offers important insights as to the patterns of change in urban greening extent over time and its underyling drivers across urban-suburbanrural gradients against the background of urban expansion, afforestation, climate change and economic development.

TI  - Development of a global annual land surface phenology dataset for 1982-2018 from the AVHRR data by implementing multiple phenology retrieving methods
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The land surface phenology (LSP) associated with vegetation dynamics plays an important role in influencing the land surface processes and land-atmosphere interactions. Satellite observations have been widely used in studies for the monitoring of LSP across large areas based on different phenology retrieval algorithms and the routine production of LSP from remote sensing data has yet come to fruition. Here we used six phenology retrieval methods, including the amplitude threshold (AT), first-order derivative (FOD), second-order derivative (SOD), relative changing rate (RCR), third-order derivative (TOD), and curvature change rate (CCR), to retrieve the start of the growing season (SOS) and the end of the growing season (EOS) from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data. We improved the curve fitting method to reduce uncertainties owing to data preprocessing. The results indicated that both SOS and EOS retrieved by six different methods had similar spatial distribution and the retrieved dates could vary largely at the pixel level. In the Northern Hemisphere, from 1982 to 2018, the trends of SOS retrieved vary across methods and only the EOS extracted by the relative change curvature method had a significant advanced trend. In the Southern Hemisphere, from 1982 to 2018, SOS results derived from four methods (i.e., AT, SOD, TOD, and CCR) showed significantly delayed trends, EOS results extracted by all the methods demonstrated insignificant trends. The phenology retrieval methods were assessed using the field observation data from the Pan European Phenology Project (PEP725) and from time series of leaf area index (LAI) measured at flux towers. The satellite-retrieved dates of both SOS and EOS were positively correlated with field observation and the relationships are largely dependent on how field phenology metrics are defined. We presented longer time series (1982-2018) data of phenology metrics with fewer gaps and multiple phenology retrieving methods as compared to the MODIS land cover dynamics product. Based on our assessments, one might use the SOS generated by FOD and the EOS generated by RCR as they provide results the most consistent with field data among all the tested methods. If studies aim to use the earliest SOS (or latest EOS) in a year, one might use the data retrieved based on TOD or CCR. The global dataset is delivered for uses in studies and applications associated with LSP.

TI  - A Remote Sensing Image Destriping Model Based on Low-Rank and Directional Sparse Constraint
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Stripe noise is a common condition that has a considerable impact on the quality of the images. Therefore, stripe noise removal (destriping) is a tremendously important step in image processing. Since the existing destriping models cause different degrees of ripple effects, in this paper a new model, based on total variation (TV) regularization, global low rank and directional sparsity constraints, is proposed for the removal of vertical stripes. TV regularization is used to preserve details, and the global low rank and directional sparsity are used to constrain stripe noise. The directional and structural characteristics of stripe noise are fully utilized to achieve a better removal effect. Moreover, we designed an alternating minimization scheme to obtain the optimal solution. Simulation and actual experimental data show that the proposed model has strong robustness and is superior to existing competitive destriping models, both subjectively and objectively.

T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The GaoFen-7 satellite (GF-7) is the first 1: 10, 000 scale stereo satellite independently developed by China. The full-waveform laser altimeter and dual-linear array camera carried by the GF-7 provide a new way of establishing worldwide digital elevation models. The active and passive composite mapping function of the laser footprint and dual-linear array stereo image can be fulfilled when the position of the laser footprint in the dual-linear array stereo image is determined. To this end, the laser footprint camera monitoring the laser pointing needs to work simultaneously with the dual-linear array camera in the daytime to determine the laser spot position in the image coordinate system of the dual-linear array camera. Due to the operating characteristics of the laser footprint camera in the synchronous exposure mode, the spot image overlaps with those of ground objects or clouds. With strong background noise, either the spot center position obtained from an image captured by the laser footprint camera is poor in accuracy, or no spot center position is obtained. According to an analysis of multi-track images captured by the laser footprint camera, when the laser works continuously, the spot center shifts in the positive X direction with the increase in working time and presents linear characteristics that are affected by fluctuation of laser output energy. In contrast, it is stable in the Y direction. Piecewise linear fitting and data interpolation can be used to obtain the spot center position under strong background noise and thus to greatly improve the utilization efficiency of laser data. The variation law of laser pointing not only serves as a reference for later calibration and calculation of systematic errors in laser pointing but also provides a new idea for the analysis and processing of laser altimeter data in the future.

TI  - Augmenting Landsat time series with Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 data products: Assessment of spectral correspondence
T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An increase in the temporal revisit of satellite data is often sought to increase the likelihood of obtaining cloudand shadow-free observations as well as to improve mapping of rapidly- or seasonally-changing features. Currently, as a tandem, Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and -8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) provide an acquisition opportunity on an 8-day revisit interval. Sentinel-2A and -2B MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI), with a wider swath, have a 5-day revisit interval at the equator. Due to robust pre- and postlaunch cross-calibration, it has been possible for NASA to produce the Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) data product from Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI: L30 and S30, respectively. Knowledge of the agreement of HLS outputs (especially S30) with historic Landsat surface reflectance products will inform the ability to integrate historic time-series information with new and more frequent measures as delivered by HLS. In this research, we control for acquisition date and data source to cross-compare the HLS data (L30, S30) with established Landsat-8 OLI surface-reflectance measures as delivered by the USGS (hereafter BAP, Best Available Pixel). S30 and L30 were found to have high agreement (R = 0.87-0.96) for spectral channels and an r = 0.99 for Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) with low relative root-mean-square difference values (1.7%-3.3%). Agreement between L30 and BAP was lower, with R values ranging from 0.85 to 0.92 for spectral channels and R = 0.94 for NBR. S30 and BAP had the lowest agreement, with R values ranging from 0.71 to 0.85 for spectral channels and r = 0.90 for NBR. Comparisons indicated a stronger agreement at latitudes above 55 degrees N. Some dependency between spectral agreement and land cover was found, with stronger correspondence for non-vegetated cover types. The level of agreement between S30 and BAP reported herein would enable integration of HLS outputs with historic Landsat data. The resulting increased temporal frequency of data allows for improvements to current cloud screening practices and increases data density and the likelihood of temporal proximity to target date for pixel compositing approaches. Furthermore, additional within-year observations will enable change products with a higher temporal fidelity and allow for the incorporation of phenological trends into land cover classification algorithms.

TI  - Landslide Extraction from High-Resolution Remote Sensing Imagery Using Fully Convolutional Spectral-Topographic Fusion Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Considering the complexity of landslide hazards, their manual investigation lacks efficiency and is time-consuming, especially in high-altitude plateau areas. Therefore, extracting landslide information using remote sensing technology has great advantages. In this study, comprehensive research was carried out on the landslide features of high-resolution remote sensing images on the Mangkam dataset. Based on the idea of feature-driven classification, the landslide extraction model of a fully convolutional spectral-topographic fusion network (FSTF-Net) based on a deep convolutional neural network of multi-source data fusion is proposed, which takes into account the topographic factor (slope and aspect) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as multi-source data input by which to train the model. In this paper, a high-resolution remote sensing image classification method based on a fully convolutional network was used to extract the landslide information, thereby realizing the accurate extraction of the landslide and surrounding ground-object information. With Mangkam County in the southeast of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau China as the study area, the proposed method was evaluated based on the high-precision digital elevation model (DEM) generated from stereoscopic images of Resources Satellite-3 and multi-source high-resolution remote sensing image data (Beijing-2, Worldview-3, and SuperView-1). Results show that our method had a landslide detection precision of 0.85 and an overall classification accuracy of 0.89. Compared with the latest DeepLab_v3+, our model increases the landslide detection precision by 5%. Thus, the proposed FSTF-Net model has high reliability and robustness.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Evolution of Wetland Eco-Hydrological Connectivity in the Poyang Lake Area Based on Long Time-Series Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrological connectivity is important for maintaining the stability and function of wetland ecosystems. Small-scale hydrological connectivity restricts large-scale hydrological cycle processes. However, long-term evolutionary studies and quantitative evaluation of the hydrological connectivity of wetlands in the Poyang Lake area have not been sufficiently conducted. In this study, we collected 21 Landsat remote sensing images and extracted land use data from 1989 to 2020, introducing a morphological spatial pattern analysis model to assess the wetland hydrological connectivity. A comprehensive method for evaluating the hydrological connectivity of wetlands was established and applied to the Poyang Lake area. The results showed that, over the course of 31 years, the wetland landscape in the Poyang Lake area changed dramatically, and the wetland area has generally shown a decreasing and then increasing trend, among which the core wetland plays a dominant role in the hydrological connectivity of the Poyang Lake area. In addition, the hydrological connectivity decreases as the core wetland area decreases. From 1989 to 2005, the landscape in the Poyang Lake area focused mainly on the transition from wetland to non-wetland. From 2005 to 2020, the conversion of wetland landscape types shows a clear reversal compared to the previous period, showing a predominant shift from non-wetland to wetland landscapes. The eco-hydrological connectivity of the wetlands in the Poyang Lake area from 1989 to 2020 first decreased, and then increased after 2005. In the early stage of the study (1989-2005), we found that the connectivity of 0.3444 in 2005 was the lowest value in the study period. A resolution of 30 m and an edge effect width of 60 m were optimal for studying the hydrological connectivity of wetlands in the Poyang Lake area. The main drivers of the changes in hydrological connectivity were precipitation and the construction of large-scale water conservation projects, as well as changes in land use. This study provides a good basis for assessing hydrological connectivity in a meaningful way, and is expected to provide new insights for maintaining and restoring biodiversity and related ecosystem services in the Poyang Lake area.

TI  - Inversion of Low-Grade Copper Mining Areas Based on Spectral Information and Remote Sensing Data Using Vis-NIR
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY
M3  - Article
AB  - With the continuous exploitation and utilization of mineral resources, the mineral reserves of all countries in the world are decreasing. In this case, the boundary grades and industrial grades of ore are bound to be adjusted downward along with the decrease of mineral resources. Low-grade ore will have mining value and bring economic benefits to enterprises. For low-grade ore, the traditional content determination has the disadvantages of high cost and long time consumption. Therefore, it needs a method that can quickly identify the content of low-grade ore. In addition, mining will destroy the surrounding ecological environment and cause heavy metals in the land to exceed the standard. This paper proposes a method of using spectral information and remote sensing data to determine copper content in mining areas. We trained the calibration model with spectral data as input, and the copper content of the ore as output. Finally, through the remote sensing information of the mining area, the metal content of the entire mining area is inverted. This provides guidance for the later beneficiation technology of ore, and the reclamation of the land after mining.

TI  - Direction-dominated change vector analysis for forest change detection
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - As forest is under increasing pressure, the rapid conversion or degradation of forest has attracted strong concern. Obtaining quantitative information of forest change based on satellite imagery becomes necessary and urgent, especially the detailed "from-to" information. In this study, a semi-automatic method called direction-dominated change vector analysis (DCVA) was proposed to detect "from-to" information of forest change. DCVA is composed of three steps: (1) determining candidate changed pixels, (2) determining direction ranges for different forest change types, and (3) determining final changed pixels for each forest change type. Like the classic change vector analysis (CVA), the magnitude and direction of change vector (CV) are used to detect the changed areas and types in DCVA, respectively. However, CVA is "magnitude-dominated" by setting only one magnitude threshold for different change types, while DCVA is "direction-dominated" by determining change types according to change direction at first, followed by setting different magnitude threshold for each change type. In this case, DCVA holds the advantage of accurately detecting changed areas for different change types by considering the specific characteristics of each change type. Experiments are performed with Sentinel-2A satellite images to demonstrate the advantages of DCVA for forest change detection. The changed areas with four types of forest change were successfully extracted by DCVA. The comparison of both geometric and thematic accuracies between DCVA and CVA further indicates the effectiveness of the proposed method for forest change detection.

TI  - Human Activities Introduced Degenerations of Wetlands (1975-2013) across the Sanjiang Plain North of the Wandashan Mountain, China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Human-induced dramatic loss and fragmentation of wetlands need further understanding through historical backtracking analysis at a geographical landscape scale. In this study, we investigated time-series wetlands maps from 1975, 1983, 1989, 2000, 2006, and 2013 derived from Landsat images based on the object-oriented classification of wetlands across the Sanjiang Plain north of the Wandashan Mountains. The spatial and temporal changes in the wetlands that occurred at different time periods and the Euclidean distances between artificial land-use types and natural land-cover areas were evaluated for their impact. Our results showed that wetland was the dominant landscape in 1975; however, arable land became the main land coverage in 2013 owing to severe changes in agricultural development over the past decades. The closer to arable land, the greater the wetland loss during the entire investigated period; agriculture activities were the dominant driving force for the degradation of wetlands based on landscape changes; secondary was the rapid expansion in building land use (i.e., human settlement, transportation, and establishment of irrigation canals). More specifically, the rapid loss of wetland areas over 1975-2000 was mainly owing to extensive agricultural reclamation. The mitigated loss of wetland areas over 2000-2013 was because of the protection and restored implementation of wetlands under governmental policies. The wetlands of the study area suffered severe human disturbance, and our analysis may help explain the loss process of wetlands, but more effective management and administration is still needed to address the issues around the balance between agricultural production and wetland protection for further sustainable development.

TI  - In-Orbit Calibration Uncertainty of the Microwave Radiation Imager on board <i>Fengyun-3C</i>
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluates the in-orbit calibration uncertainty (CU) for the microwave radiation imager (MWRI) on board the Chinese polar-orbiting meteorological satellite Fengyun-3C (FY-3C). Uncertainty analysis of the MWRI provides a direct link to the calibration system of the sensor and quantifies the calibration confidence based on the prelaunch and postlaunch measurements. The unique design of the sensor makes the uncertainty in the calibration of the sensor highly correlate to the uncertainty in the brightness temperature (TB) measured at the hot view, while the cold view has negligible impacts on the calibration confidence. Lack of knowledge on the emission of the hot-load reflector hampers the MWRI calibration accuracy significantly in the descending passes of the orbits when the hot-load reflector is heated nonuniformly by the solar illumination. Radiance contamination originating from the satellite and in-orbit environments could enter the primary reflector via the hot view and further impinge on the CU, especially at the 10.65-GHz channels where the main-beam width is much broader than that of higher-frequency channels. The monthly-mean CU is lower than 2 K at all channels, depending on the observed earth scenes and in-orbit environments, and the month-to-month variation of CU is also noticed for all channels. Due to the uncertainty in the emissive hot-load reflector, CU in the descending passes is generally larger than that in the ascending orbits. Moreover, up to 1-K CU difference between the ocean and land scenes is found for the 10.65-GHz channels, while this difference is less than 0.1 K at the 89-GHz channels.

TI  - A practical topographic correction method for improving Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer gross primary productivity estimation over mountainous areas
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Time-series Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) gross primary productivity (GPP) has been served as an effective tool to assess the terrestrial carbon budget for the entire globe since 2000. However, the current MODIS GPP product neglects the surface heterogeneity in the modeling process and is always generated at 500 m or 1 km resolution, which could cause errors to these estimates over mountainous areas. In this work, the MODIS GPP model (MOD17) was applied to obtain 1 km GPP estimates at eleven mountainous sites. Then, a topographic correction method based on three indexes associated with the spatial heterogeneity of received radiation (TCIAPAR), temperature (TCITMIN), and water (TCIVPD) stresses was developed to reduce GPP errors in these MOD17-simulated estimates. Results showed that a closer relationship between tower-based GPP and MOD17-simulated GPP was achieved after applying the proposed topographic correction method, with the determination coefficient (R2) increased from 0.61 to 0.74 and root mean square error (RMSE) reduced from 24.24 to 14.56 gC m-2 8d-1 at all the eleven mountainous sites. As for the effectiveness of each topographic correction index, an obvious improvement of MOD17-simulated GPP was observed after TCIAPAR correction (increasing R2 by 0.09 and decreasing RMSE by 8.75 gC m-2 8d-1), TCITMIN correction (increasing R2 by 0.05 and decreasing RMSE by 7.80 gC m-2 8d- 1), and TCIVPD correction (increasing R2 by 0.06 and decreasing RMSE by 7.89 gC m-2 8d-1), indicating that the spatial heterogeneity information of radiation, temperature, and water within coarse pixels is necessary for improving the MODIS GPP over mountainous areas. It is notable that the combination of the TCIAPAR, TCITMIN, and TCIVPD corrections was found to have the largest improvement for MOD17-simulated GPP (increasing R2 by 0.13 and decreasing RMSE by 9.68 gC m-2 8d-1), indicating that the combined consideration of topographic factors in the correction process might achieve a larger improvement. This study highlights the feasibility of incorporating surface topographic characteristics into current coarse resolution GPP products in obtaining large-scale mountain GPP estimates.

TI  - Synthesis of True Color Images from the Fengyun Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The production of true color images requires observational data in the red, green, and blue (RGB) bands. The Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI) onboard China's Fengyun-4 (FY-4) series of geostationary satellites only has blue and red bands, and we therefore have to synthesize a green band to produce RGB true color images. We used random forest regression and conditional generative adversarial networks to train the green band model using Himawari-8 Advanced Himawari Imager data. The model was then used to simulate the green channel reflectance of the FY-4 AGRI. A single-scattering radiative transfer model was used to eliminate the contribution of Rayleigh scattering from the atmosphere and a logarithmic enhancement was applied to process the true color image. The conditional generative adversarial network model was better than random forest regression for the green band model in terms of statistical significance (e.g., a higher determination coefficient, peak signal-to-noise ratio, and structural similarity index). The sharpness of the images was significantly improved after applying a correction for Rayleigh scattering, and the images were able to show natural phenomena more vividly. The AGRI true color images could be used to monitor dust storms, forest fires, typhoons, volcanic eruptions, and other natural events.

TI  - Consistency Analysis and Accuracy Assessment of Eight Global Forest Datasets over Myanmar
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and up-to-date forest monitoring plays a significant role in the country's society and economy. Many open-access global forest datasets can be used to analyze the forest profile of countries around the world. However, discrepancies exist among these forest datasets due to their specific classification systems, methodologies, and remote sensing data sources, which makes end-users difficult to select an appropriate dataset in different regions. This study aims to explore the accuracy, consistency, and discrepancies of eight widely-used forest datasets in Myanmar, including Hansen2010, CCI-LC2015, FROM-GLC2015/2017, FROM-GLC10, GLC-FCS2015/2020, and GlobeLand30-2020. Firstly, accuracy assessment is conducted by using 934 forest and non-forest samples with four different years. Then, spatial consistency of these eight datasets is compared in area and spatial distribution. Finally, the factors influencing the spatial consistency are analyzed from the aspects of terrain and climate. The results indicate that in Myanmar the forest area derived from GlobeLand30 has the best accuracy, followed by FROM-GLC10 and FROM-GLC2017. The eight datasets differ in spatial detail, with the mountains of northern Myanmar having the highest consistency and the seaward areas of southwestern Myanmar having the highest inconsistency, such as Rakhine and the Ayeyarwady. In addition, it is found that the spatial consistency of the eight datasets is closely related to the terrain and climate. The highest consistency among the eight datasets is found in the range of 1000-3500 m above sea level and 26 degrees-35 degrees slope. In the subtropical highland climate (Cwb) zone, the percentage of complete consistency among the eight datasets is as high as 60.62%, which is the highest consistency among the six climatic zones in Myanmar. Therefore, forest mapping in Myanmar should devote more effort to low topography, seaward areas such as border states like Rakhine, Irrawaddy, Yangon, and Mon. This is because these areas have complex and diverse landscape types and are prone to confusion between forest types (e.g., grassland, shrub, and cropland). The approach can also be applied to other countries, which will help scholars to select the most suitable forest datasets in different regions for analysis, thus providing recommendations for relevant forest policies and planning in different countries.

TI  - Contrasting Lake Ice Phenology Changes in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau Revealed by Remote Sensing
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake ice phenology is regarded as a good proxy for the past and present climates. Long time series passive microwave radiometry data are used to estimate lake ice phenology variations in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), and a contrasting pattern of phenology change trend is found that the time series trend of lake ice freeze-up or break-up time is obviously reversed for lakes in the QTP. The reason for this contrasting trend of lake ice phenology is discussed based on factors such as salinity, water volume change, and air temperature change. Lake ice phenology data are separated based on lake salinity for the climate study: lake ice phenology of lakes with low salinity can be used as air temperature and climate change indicator, whereas lake ice phenology of lakes with high salinity and a low water volume can be used as an indicator of water volume variation under climate change. Correlation analysis of air temperature and the lake ice phenology show that air temperature is the main driving factor behind lake ice phenology variations. The lake ice phenology results suggest overall rising air temperatures during the period 1987-2017 in all regions of the QTP.

TI  - SafeNet: SwArm for Earthquake Perturbations Identification Using Deep Learning Networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Low Earth orbit satellites collect and study information on changes in the ionosphere, which contributes to the identification of earthquake precursors. Swarm, the European Space Agency three-satellite mission, has been launched to monitor the Earth geomagnetic field, and has successfully shown that in some cases it is able to observe many several ionospheric perturbations that occurred as a result of large earthquake activity. This paper proposes the SafeNet deep learning framework for detecting pre-earthquake ionospheric perturbations. We trained the proposed model using 9017 recent (2014-2020) independent earthquakes of magnitude 4.8 or greater, as well as the corresponding 7-year plasma and magnetic field data from the Swarm A satellite, and excellent performance has been achieved. In addition, the influence of different model inputs and spatial window sizes, earthquake magnitudes, and daytime or nighttime was explored. The results showed that for electromagnetic pre-earthquake data collected within a circular region of the epicenter and with a Dobrovolsky-defined radius and input window size of 70 consecutive data points, nighttime data provided the highest performance in discriminating pre-earthquake perturbations, yielding an F1 score of 0.846 and a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.717. Moreover, SafeNet performed well in identifying pre-seismic ionospheric anomalies with increasing earthquake magnitude and unbalanced datasets. Hypotheses on the physical causes of earthquake-induced ionospheric perturbations are also provided. Our results suggest that the performance of pre-earthquake ionospheric perturbation identification can be significantly improved by utilizing SafeNet, which is capable of detecting precursor effects within electromagnetic satellite data.

TI  - The 2020 <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> 6.4 Petrinja earthquake: a dextral event with large coseismic slip highlights a complex fault system in northwestern Croatia
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - On 2020 December 29, the M-w 6.4 Petrinja earthquake hit the Kupa Valley region and set a record for the largest earthquake in northwestern (NW) Croatia. The coseismic surface displacements are well obtained on three pairs of interferometric synthetic aperture radar images from Sentinel-1 satellites. The interferograms exhibit coseismic ground deformation with a maximum line-of-sight displacement of 0.4 m. Based on the coseismic deformation field, we investigate both the fault geometry and the coseismic slip distribution. The results show a dextral event with a peak slip of 3.50 m at a depth of 3.47 km. The shallow depth and unusually large coseismic slip correspond to obvious ground deformation and serious damage in the epicentral zone. The 2020 earthquake highlights an unmapped, steeply dipping strike-slip fault, which possibly enabled a potential 'curve cut-off' process on the bending segment of the Pokupsko fault in the context of similar to N-S compression in NW Croatia. The large coseismic slip and high stress drop associated with the M-w 6.4 Petrinja earthquake are likely products of the geometrically complex fault zones and immature seismotectonic environment in NW Croatia.

TI  - Long Term Post-Fire Vegetation Dynamics in North-East Mediterranean Ecosystems. The Case of Mount Athos Greece
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is an ecological and disturbance factor with a significant historical role in shaping the landscape of fire-prone environments. Despite the large amount of literature regarding post-fire vegetation dynamics, the north-east Mediterranean region is rather underrepresented in the literature. Studies that refer to the early post fire years and long term research are rather scarce. The current study is conducted in the socially and geographically isolated peninsula of Mount Athos (Holly Mountain) in northern Greece, and it studies vegetation dynamics over a period of 30 years since the last fire. Field data were collected 11 years since the event and were used to identify the present plant communities in the area, using TWINSPAN, and the factors affecting their distribution using CART. Four Landsat (TM, ETM, OLI) images are employed for the calculation of NDVI, which was found effective in detecting the intercommunity variation in the study area, and it is used for long term monitoring. The study includes four communities, from maquis to forest which are common in the Mediterranean region covering a wide altitudinal range. The results suggest that fire affects the various communities in a different way and their recovery differs significantly. While forest communities recover quickly after fire, maintaining their composition and structure, the maquis communities may need several years before reaching the pre-fire characteristics. The dry climatic conditions of the study area are probably the reason for the slow recovery of the most fire prone communities. Given that climate change is expected to make the conditions even drier in the region, studies like this emphasize the need to adopt measures for controlling wildfires and preventing ecosystem degradation.

TI  - Application of training data affects success in broad-scale local climate zone mapping
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite imagery has been widely used to map urbanization processes. To address the urgent need for urban landscape mapping that goes beyond urban footprint analysis, the local climate zone (LCZ) scheme has been increasingly used to reveal the urban forms and functions important to urban heat islands and micro-climates across the globe. As with most supervised classification strategies, proper application of training data is critical for the success of LCZ classification models. However, the collection and application of LCZ training areas brings with it two challenges that may affect mapping success. First, because digitizing training areas is a timeconsuming task, there is a broad effort in the LCZ mapping community to create a crowdsourced data collection among different experts. However, this strategy likely leads to inconsistencies in labels that could weaken models. Second, the LCZ labeling process typically involves the delineation of large zones from which multiple training samples are drawn, but those samples are likely spatially autocorrelated and lead to overly optimistic estimates of model accuracy. Although both effects - inconsistent labeling and spatial autocorrelation - are theoretically possible, it is unknown whether they substantially affect accuracy. We investigated both issues, specifically asking: (i) how do the discrepancies of LCZ labeling by different experts impact broad-scale LCZ mapping? (ii) to what extent does spatial correlation affect model prediction power? We used two classifiers (Random Forests and ResNets) to map eight metropolitan areas in the US into LCZs, comparing training areas drawn by different or consistent interpreters, and data splitting strategy using rules that allow or reduce spatial autocorrelation. We found large discrepancies among results built from crowdsourced training areas digitized by different experts; improving the consistency of labels can lead to substantial improvements in LCZ classification accuracy. Second, we found that spatial autocorrelation can boost the apparent accuracy of the classifier by 16% to 21%, leading to erroneous interpretation of mapping results. The two effects interplay as well: spatial auto correlation in the raw data can lead to an underestimation of the model's predictive error when modeling with crowdsourced training areas of high inconsistency. Due to the uncertainty in the labeling process and spatial autocorrelation in derived training data, broad-scale LCZ mapping results should be interpreted with caution.

TI  - Monitoring three-decade dynamics of citrus planting in Southeastern China using dense Landsat records
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Across Southeastern China, the expansion of citrus plantation has underpinned substantial economic development at the expense of forest cover and associated ecosystem services. The high-order complexity of citrus planting dynamics requires more detailed observations. To achieve this goal, we developed a novel monitoring scheme by integrating multi-epoch land cover classification and continuous change detection on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform using all available Landsat archives (1986-2018). First, a stable/changed area masking approach was adopted. Then, the GEE-based Continuous Change Detection and Classification (GEE-CCDC) algorithm was applied to detect the timing and position of citrus planting-related land cover changes. Finally, the effectiveness of the scheme was validated both spatially and temporally. We applied the proposed scheme in Xunwu, a typical County in Southeastern China where continuous expansion was disrupted by an outbreak of Huanglongbing (HLB, a destructive citrus disease). The validation results indicate that the multiepoch classification effectively identified the stable, abandoned, and newly cultivated areas related to citrus planting. Within these areas, our monitoring of citrus planting dynamics had an overall temporal accuracy of 90.59% and a mean detection date deviation of 13.21 days (leading). Based on the change detection results, we found a two-stage change pattern, namely a continuous expansion period (1986-2016) followed by a disturbance period (2017-2018). Moreover, almost half of the orchards were cultivated in regions with an elevation and slope of 301-400 m and 11-20 degrees. During the continuous expansion period, a total of 497.85 km(2) natural lands were converted for citrus planting. Affected by the HLB outbreak, both orchard abandonment (114.66 km(2)) and new orchard cultivation (36.87 km(2)) were detected during the disturbance period. The proposed scheme offers a useful tool for cash crops management, and highlights the value of dense satellite data in monitoring the extent of ongoing human appropriation of natural ecosystems at a large scale and long-term.

TI  - An Integrated Approach for Mapping Three-Dimensional CoSeismic Displacement Fields from Sentinel-1 TOPS Data Based on DInSAR, POT, MAI and BOI Techniques: Application to the 2021 Mw 7.4 Maduo Earthquake
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-1 Terrain Observation by Progressive Scans (TOPS) data have been widely applied in earthquake studies due to their open-source policy, short revisit cycle and wide coverage. However, significant near-fault displacement gradients and the moderate azimuth resolution of TOPS data make achieving high-precision along-track measurements challenging, which prevents the generation of high-quality three-dimensional (3D) displacement maps. Here, we propose an integrated method to retrieve high-quality 3D displacements based on the differential interferometric SAR (DInSAR), burst-overlap interferometry (BOI), multiple-aperture InSAR (MAI) and pixel offset tracking (POT) techniques, which are achieved to use only two track Sentinel-1 TOPS data with different viewing geometries. The key step of this method is using a weighted fusion algorithm with the interpolated BOI-derived and MAI-derived 3D displacements. In a case study of the 2021 Maduo earthquake, the calculated root mean square errors (RMSEs) from global navigation satellite system (GNSS) data and the InSAR-derived 3D displacement fields were found to be 6.3, 5.8 and 1.7 cm in north-south, east-west and up-down components, respectively. Moreover, the slip model of the 2021 Maduo earthquake jointly estimated by DInSAR and BOI measurements indicates that this seismic event was dominated by sinistral strike-slip motion mixed with some dip-slip movements; the estimated seismic moment was 1.75 x 10(20) Nm, corresponding to a Mw 7.44 event.

TI  - Monitoring coastal reclamation changes across Jiangsu Province during 1984-2019 using landsat data
T2  - MARINE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Owing to sufficient sediment from the abandoned Yellow River and the Yangtze River, large scale tidal flats have been developed along the Jiangsu coast. To obtain more space for urban expansion, economic growth and food security, many coastal reclamation projects have been conducted around the Jiangsu tidal flats in recent years. Coastal reclamation in Jiangsu dramatically altered the environment and ecosystem in coastal zones. Hence, detailed information on coastal reclamation is urgently required for better implementation of sustainable coastal planning and management. In this study, we adopted Landsat series images to monitor the temporal changes of coastal reclamation across Jiangsu Province from 1984 to 2019. First, we integrated water index, edge detection and visual interpretation to obtain artifical shorelines over different years from Landsat data. Then, these multi-year shorelines were stacked to extract coastal reclamation area over different periods. Finally, we analyzed the spatial-temporal pattern and types of coastal reclamation in Jiangsu. The total amount of coastal reclamation area in Jiangsu has reached 16.61 x 10(4) hm(2) since 1984. Across Jiangsu Province, Yancheng had the largest amount of coastal reclamation of 10.11 x 10(4) hm(2), accounting for 61% of the total coastal reclamation area, and the areas of coastal reclamation in Nantong and Lianyungang were 5.42 x 10(4) hm(2) (33%) and 1.07 x 10(4) hm(2) (6%), respectively. After 1993, coastal reclamation in Jiangsu grew rapidly, with the highest growth rate of 0.65 x 10(4) hm(2) per year over 1993-2011. During 1984-2019, water body, which was the major coastal reclamation type, decreased by 16.65%, while construction and agricultural land increased by 18.98% and 5.29%. Moreover, the proportion of unused land decreased by 7.48%, and still accounted for 21.87% of the total reclamation area. This study demonstrated the availability of remote sensing data in large-scale coastal zone monitoring and assessed the temporal changes of coastal reclamation across Jiangsu Province during 1984-2019, which can deepen our understanding of the impact of coastal reclamation on landscape changes along the Jiangsu coast. In the future, the utilization rate of coastal reclamation needs to be improved and the benefit and the negative effect from coastal reclamation should be balanced to promote the sustainable development of tidal flat resources in Jiangsu Province.

TI  - Global Vegetation Photosynthetic Phenology Products Based on MODIS Vegetation Greenness and Temperature: Modeling and Evaluation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface phenology (LSP) products that are derived from different data sources have different definitions and biophysical meanings. Discrepancies among these products and their linkages with carbon fluxes across plant functional types and climatic regions remain somewhat unclear. In this study, to differentiate LSP related to gross primary production (GPP) from LSP related to remote sensing data, we defined the former as vegetation photosynthetic phenology (VPP), including the starting and ending days of GPP (SOG and EOG, respectively). Specifically, we estimated VPP based on a combination of observed VPP from 145 flux-measured GPP sites together with the vegetation index and temperature data from MODIS products using multiple linear regression models. We then compared VPP estimates with MODIS LSP on a global scale. Our results show that the VPP provided better estimates of SOG and EOG than MODIS LSP, with a root mean square error (RMSE) for SOG of 12.7 days and a RMSE for EOG of 10.5 days. The RMSE was approximately three weeks for both SOG and EOG estimates of the non-forest type. Discrepancies between VPP and LSP estimates varied across plant functional types (PFTs) and climatic regions. A high correlation was observed between VPP and LSP estimates for deciduous forest. For most PFTs, using VPP estimates rather than LSP improved the estimation of GPP. This study presents a useful method for modeling global VPP, investigates in detail the discrepancies between VPP and LSP, and provides a more effective global vegetation phenology product for carbon cycle modeling than the existing ones.

TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in<i> Enterococcus</i> faecium and Enterococcus faecalis isolates of swine origin from eighteen provinces in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF VETERINARY MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis are important human pathogens and also served as sentinel organisms for monitoring systems of antimicrobial resistance in both animals and humans. In this study, 106 E. faecium and 56 E. faecalis isolates were collected from 61 pig farms in 18 proveinces of China. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined for 9 clinically important antibiotics and 3 antimicrobial growth promoters. The Enterococcus isolates showed high prevalence of resistance to medically important antibiotics, such as ampicillin (50.9% for E. faecium and 19.6% for E. faecalis), chloramphenicol (24.5% for E. faecium and 41.1% for E. faecalis), erythromycin (83.0% for E. faecium and 91.1% for E. faecalis), tetracycline (79.2% for E. faecium and 100% for E. faecalis), quinupristin/dalfopristin (26.4% for E. faecium) and ciprofloxacin (73.6% for E. faecium and 66.1% for E. faecalis). Resistance to tigecycline, linezolid and vancomycin was very rare. The resistance status of three representative in-feed antibiotics bacitracin, nosiheptide and enramycin was firstly investigated with Enterococcus as indicator bacteria. The Enterococcus isolates showed extremely high frequency of bacitracin resistance (96.7% for E. faecium and 87.8% for E. faecalis), while no nosiheptide and enramycin resistance was observed. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis showed that a majority of E. faecium and E. faecalis strains showed unrelated profiles, indicating high heterogeneity among the Enterococcus isolates. Our study provided basic data on the antimicrobial resistance of E. faecium and E. faecalis isolates.

TI  - Prediction of Crop Yield for New Mexico Based on Climate and Remote Sensing Data for the 1920-2019 Period
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural production systems in New Mexico (NM) are under increased pressure due to climate change, drought, increased temperature, and variable precipitation, which can affect crop yields, feeds, and livestock grazing. Developing more sustainable production systems requires long-term measurements and assessment of climate change impacts on yields, especially over such a vulnerable region. Providing accurate yield predictions plays a key role in addressing a critical sustainability gap. The goal of this study is the development of effective crop yield predictions to allow for a better-informed cropland management and future production potential, and to develop climate-smart adaptation strategies for increased food security. The objectives were to (1) identify the most important climate variables that significantly influence and can be used to effectively predict yield, (2) evaluate the advantage of using remotely sensed data alone and in combination with climate variables for yield prediction, and (3) determine the significance of using short compared to long historical data records for yield prediction. This study focused on yield prediction for corn, sorghum, alfalfa, and wheat using climate and remotely sensed data for the 1920-2019 period. The results indicated that the use of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) alone is less accurate in predicting crop yields. The combination of climate and NDVI variables provided better predictions compared to the use of NDVI only to predict wheat, sorghum, and corn yields. However, the use of a climate only model performed better in predicting alfalfa yield. Yield predictions can be more accurate with the use of shorter data periods that are based on region-specific trends. The identification of the most important climate variables and accurate yield prediction pertaining to New Mexico's agricultural systems can aid the state in developing climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies to enhance the sustainability of these systems.

TI  - Data Driven for Early Breast Cancer Staging using Integrated Mammography and Biopsy.
T2  - Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Breast cancer patients who have a rapid diagnosis have been better prognosis than late diagnosis. The popular screening is mammogram or ultrasound. In recent years, researchers try to develop data driven models to predict early cancer staging from the first screening. However, data elements are not complete such as lymph node status. Therefore, the Integrated dataset approach will be challenging.METHODS: Because the data elements are not collected from the same source, joining between mammography and biopsy data were performed using latent variables that determine by tumor severity. The datasets consist of 445 mammography reports and 183 pathological reports. The latent variables of the mammogram dataset were determined by the severity of mass, while latent variables of the pathological dataset were determined by TNM Staging. The latent variables were used to join between two datasets. Then, the prediction models were built using the machine learning technique. The modeling is divided into three steps; staging prediction, lymph node prediction, and prognosis.RESULTS: Integrated dataset from mammography and biopsy extend more factors and built the models to predict breast cancer staging in the mammography process. The staging prediction is 100% accuracy. The lymph node prediction are 72.47% accuracy, 73.94% specificity, and 72.5% sensitivity. An area under ROC curve is 0.74. The prognosis model prediction are 72.72% accuracy, 80% specificity, and 77% sensitivity. An area under ROC curve is 0.87. There are also built the rule for early staging, diagnosis, and prognosis. Conclusion: This study aims to build the models for early staging, diagnosis, and prognosis using the less aggressive method. The advantages are (1) predict staging from the first screening (2) estimate the lymph node metastases for planning to ALND or SLNB (3) evaluate overall survival time. These advantages help the physician planning the best treatment for cancer patients.

TI  - Practical Dynamical-Statistical Reconstruction of Ocean's Interior from Satellite Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The algorithms based on Surface Quasi-Geostrophic (SQG) dynamics have been developed and validated by many researchers through model products, however it is still doubtful whether these SQG-based algorithms are worth using in terms of observed data. This paper analyzes the factors impeding the practical application of SQG and makes amends by a simple "first-guess (FG) framework". The proposed framework includes the correction of satellite salinity and the estimation of the FG background, making the SQG-based algorithms applicable in realistic circumstances. The dynamical-statistical method SQG-mEOF-R is thereafter applied to satellite data for the first time. The results are compared with two dynamical algorithms, SQG and isQG, and three empirical algorithms, multivariate linear regression (MLR), random forest (RF), and mEOF-R. The validation against Argo profiles showed that the SQG-mEOF-R presents a robust performance in mesoscale reconstruction and outperforms the other five algorithms in the upper layers. It is promising that the SQG-mEOF-R and the FG framework are applicable to operational reconstruction.

TI  - Large-scale crop mapping from multi-source optical satellite imageries using machine learning with discrete grids
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial distribution of crops is an important agricultural parameter, which is used to derive important information about crop productivity and food security. However, crop mapping on a large scale is challenging due to the low spatio-temporal information of satellite data, sparse sampling, and poor computational efficiency for massive data. To alleviate these problems, this study proposes a method based on discrete grids with machine learning to integrate GaoFen-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery. First, the proposed method fuses multi-source satellite data with similar observation characteristics to improve the spatial and temporal coverage of satellites. Second, a data augmentation technique based on a discrete grid framework was proposed to solve the problem of sparse samples. Finally, a machine learning algorithm in a discrete grid was introduced to improve processing efficiency and ensure the crop classification precision of large-scale remote sensing images. An experiment in the Sanjiang Plain area (approximately 108900 km2) of Northeast China showed that the proposed scheme benefited from a high spatio-temporal multi-source dataset and achieved good performance. Compared with a single data source, the accuracy of crop mapping using multi-source optical remote sensing data is higher, attaining up to 86 and 88 % in 2017 and 2018, respectively. Furthermore, the advantages of machine learning in discrete grids over largescale areas are validated by evaluating the accuracy of different classifiers, which indicates the suitability of discrete grids in data augmentation and large-scale crop mapping. Finally, discrete grid technology offers a possibility for crop mapping over large-scale areas, and improves the processing efficiency of remote sensing big data. The findings in this study can contribute to studies on large-scale crop classification and serve as a reference to them.

AB  - An 89-year-old woman presented to our clinic with a complaint of a wound in the left nipple. The pathological diagnosis via skin biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma. A physical examination, mammography, ultrasonography, and CT scan revealed a mass in the left nipple. However, a definite diagnosis could not be established by skin biopsy. Left breast-conserving surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed for diagnosis and treatment. Histological examination revealed a scirrhous type invasive ductal carcinoma in the left nipple and areola with skin invasion and lymph node metastasis. Radiation and hormone therapy were used as adjuvant therapy. She is alive with no local recurrence for 5 months post surgery. Since ductal carcinoma of the nipple is uncommon, we present this case report along with a review of the relevant literature.

TI  - InSAR measurements of surface deformation over permafrost on Fenghuoshan Mountains section, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS ENGINEERING AND ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The permafrost development in the Qinghai-Tibet Engineering Corridor (QTEC) is affected by natural environment changes and human engineering activities. Human engineering activities may damage the permafrost growing environment, which in turn impact these engineering activities. Thus high spatial-temporal resolution monitoring over the QTEC in the permafrost region is very necessary. This paper presents a method for monitoring the frozen soil area using the intermittent coherence-based small baseline subset (ICSBAS). The method can improve the point density of the results and enhance the interpretability of deformation results by identifying the discontinuous coherent points according to the coherent value of time series. Using the periodic function that models the seasonal variation of permafrost, we separate the long wavelength atmospheric delay and establish an estimation model for the frozen soil deformation. Doing this can raise the monitoring accuracy and improve the understanding of the surface deformation of the frozen soil. In this study, we process 21 PALSAR data acquired by the Alos satellite with the proposed ICSBAS technique. The results show that the frozen soil far from the QTR in the study area experiences frost heave and thaw settlement (4.7 cm to 8.4 cm) alternatively, while the maximum settlement along the QTR reaches 12 cm. The interferomatric syntnetic aperture radar (In-SAR)-derived results are validated using the ground leveling data nearby the Beiluhe basin. The validation results show the InSAR results have good consistency with the leveling data in displacement rates as well as time series. We also find that the deformation in the permafrost area is correlated with temperature, human activities and topography. Based on the interfering degree of human engineering activities on the permafrost environment, we divide the QTEC along the Qinghai-Tibet Railway into engineering damage zone, transition zone and natural permafrost.

TI  - Estimating PM<sub>2.5</sub> Concentrations in Contiguous Eastern Coastal Zone of China Using MODIS AOD and a Two-Stage Random Forest Model
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The coarse Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth (AOD) product (spatial resolution: 3 km) retrieved by the dark-target algorithm always generates the missing values when being adopted to estimate the ground-level PM2.5 concentrations. In this study, we developed a two-stage random forest using MODIS 3-km AOD to obtain the PM2.5 concentrations with full coverage in a contiguous coastal developed region, i.e., Yangtze River delta-Fujian-Pearl River delta (YRD-FJ-PRD) region of China. A first-stage random forest-integrated six meteorological fields was employed to predict the missing values of AOD product, and the combined AOD (i.e., random forest-derived AOD and MODIS 3-km AOD) incorporated with other ancillary variables were developed for predicting PM2.5 concentrations within a second-stage random forest model. The results showed that the first-stage random forest could explain 94% of the AOD variability over YRD-FJ-PRD region, and we achieved a site-based cross validation (CV) R-2 of 0.87 and a time-based CV R-2 of 0.85. The full-coverage PM2.5 concentrations illustrated a spatial pattern with annual-mean PM2.5 of 46, 40, and 35 mu g m(-3) in YRD, PRD, and FJ, respectively, sharing the same trend with previous studies. Our results indicated that the proposed two-stage random forest model could be effectively used for PM2.5 estimation in different areas.

TI  - Atmospheric Correction of Airborne Hyperspectral CASI Data Using Polymer, 6S and FLAASH
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Airborne hyperspectral data play an important role in remote sensing of coastal waters. However, before their application, atmospheric correction is required to remove or reduce the atmospheric effects caused by molecular and aerosol scattering and absorption. In this study, we first processed airborne hyperspectral CASI-1500 data acquired on 4 May 2019 over the Uljin coast of Korea with Polymer and then compared the performance with the other two widely used atmospheric correction approaches, i.e., 6S and FLAASH, to determine the most appropriate correction technique for CASI-1500 data in coastal waters. Our results show the superiority of Polymer over 6S and FLAASH in deriving the R-rs spectral shape and magnitude. The performance of Polymer was further evaluated by comparing CASI-1500 R-rs data with those obtained from the MODIS-Aqua sensor on 3 May 2019 and processed using Polymer. The spectral shapes of the derived R-rs from CASI-1500 and MODIS-Aqua matched well, but the magnitude of CASI-1500 R-rs was approximately 0.8 times lower than MODIS R-rs. The possible reasons for this difference were time difference (1 day) between CASI-1500 and MODIS data, higher land adjacency effect for MODIS-Aqua than for CASI-1500, and possible errors in MODIS R-rs from Polymer.

TI  - Study on the Ground-Based FTS Measurements at Beijing, China and the Colocation Sensitivity of Satellite Data
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) at the Beijing Satellite Meteorological Ground Station observed XCO2 (the dry carbon dioxide column) from 2 March 2016 to 4 December 2018. The validation results of ground-based XCO2, as well as GOSAT, OCO-2, and TanSat XCO2, show that the best temporal matching setting for ground-based XCO2 and satellite XCO2 is +/- 1 h, and the best spatial matching setting for GOSAT is 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees. Consistent with OCO-2, the best spatial matching setting of TanSat is 5 degrees x 5 degrees or 6 degrees x 6 degrees. Among GOSAT, OCO-2, and TanSat, the satellite observation validation characteristics near 5 degrees x 5 degrees from the ground-based station are obviously different from other spatial matching grids, which may be due to the different observation characteristics of satellites near 5 degrees x 5 degrees. To study the influence of local CO2 sources on the characteristics of satellite observation validation, we classified the daily XCO2 observation sequence into concentrated, dispersive, increasing, and decreasing types, respectively, and then validated the satellite observations. The results showed that the concentrated and decreasing sub-datasets have better validation performance. Our results suggest that it is best to use concentrated and decreasing sub-datasets when using the Beijing Satellite Meteorological Ground Station XCO2 for satellite validation. The temporal matching setting should be +/- 1 h, and the spatial matching setting should consider the satellites observation characteristics of 5 degrees x 5 degrees distance from the ground-based station.

TI  - An Improved Fmask Method for Cloud Detection in GF-6 WFV Based on Spectral-Contextual Information
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - GF-6 is the first optical remote sensing satellite for precision agriculture observations in China. Accurate identification of the cloud in GF-6 helps improve data availability. However, due to the narrow band range contained in GF-6, Fmask version 3.2 for Landsat is not suitable for GF-6. Hence, this paper proposes an improved Fmask based on the spectral-contextual information to solve the inapplicability of Fmask version 3.2 in GF-6. The improvements are divided into the following six aspects. The shortwave infrared (SWIR) in the "Basic Test" is replaced by blue band. The threshold in the original "HOT Test" is modified based on the comprehensive consideration of fog and thin clouds. The bare soil and rock are detected by the relationship between green and near infrared (NIR) bands. The bright buildings are detected by the relationship between the upper and lower quartiles of blue and red bands. The stratus with high humidity and fog_W (fog over water) are distinguished by the ratio of blue and red edge position 1 bands. Temperature probability for land is replaced by the HOT-based cloud probability (LHOT), and SWIR in brightness probability is replaced by NIR. The average cloud pixels accuracy (TPR) of the improved Fmask is 95.51%.

TI  - Testing Accuracy of Land Cover Classification Algorithms in the Qilian Mountains Based on GEE Cloud Platform
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Qilian Mountains (QLM) are an important ecological barrier in western China. High-precision land cover data products are the basic data for accurately detecting and evaluating the ecological service functions of the QLM. In order to study the land cover in the QLM and performance of different remote sensing classification algorithms for land cover mapping based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform, the higher spatial resolution remote sensing images of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2; digital elevation data; and three remote sensing classification algorithms, including the support vector machine (SVM), the classification regression tree (CART), and the random forest (RF) algorithms, were used to perform supervised classification of Sentinel-2 images of the QLM. Furthermore, the results obtained from the classification process were compared and analyzed by using different remote sensing classification algorithms and feature-variable combinations. The results indicated that: (1) the accuracy of the classification results acquired by using different remote sensing classification algorithms were different, and the RF had the highest classification accuracy, followed by the CART and the SVM; (2) the different feature variable combinations had different effects on the overall accuracy (OA) of the classification results and the performance of the identification and classification of the different land cover types; and (3) compared with the existing land cover products for the QLM, the land cover maps obtained in this study had a higher spatial resolution and overall accuracy.

TI  - Integrating multiple semantics data to assess the dynamic change of urban green space in Beijing, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Information regarding the dynamic change of urban green space (UGS) at fine spatiotemporal resolutions is important for developing sustainable urban environments and understanding urban ecosystems in the future. As the capital of China, due to population explosion, economic growth, and redevelopment of inner-city areas, Beijing underwent extremely rapid urbanization in the past few years, which is intensifying the contradiction between human activities and UGS. Timely monitoring of Beijing's dynamic change of UGS is very important for the planning of the capital's living environment. Hence, a novel framework was proposed to map the dynamic change of UGS from 2000 to 2018 by integrating social sensing data and time series remote sensing data. First, we generated a dynamic mapping of the vegetation and a mapping of the annual maximum value of the Nominalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVImax), using time series Landsat images on a Google Earth Engine platform. Then, a temporal segmentation approach was implemented to identify the turning years and using a decision tree approach determine the historical time of social sensing data. Finally, the UGS mapping and its dynamics were generated according to the identified time parameter of social sensing data, as well as remote sensing data. Our results showed that the temporal segmentation approach is reliable for detecting urban changes and identifying the historical time of social sensing data, with an overall accuracy of 90%. The overall classification accuracies of UGS are 0.87 (both Level 1 and Level 2). Moreover, the UGS area continuously increased from 2000 to 2018, of which the dominant types are residential green space and theme parks. The proposed framework provides an effective tool for better understanding the dynamic change of UGS, and the results from this work present vital insights for planners and government departments to develop targeted measures and protect UGS effectively.

TI  - A Robust Hybrid Deep Learning Model for Spatiotemporal Image Fusion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Dense time-series remote sensing data with detailed spatial information are highly desired for the monitoring of dynamic earth systems. Due to the sensor tradeoff, most remote sensing systems cannot provide images with both high spatial and temporal resolutions. Spatiotemporal image fusion models provide a feasible solution to generate such a type of satellite imagery, yet existing fusion methods are limited in predicting rapid and/or transient phenological changes. Additionally, a systematic approach to assessing and understanding how varying levels of temporal phenological changes affect fusion results is lacking in spatiotemporal fusion research. The objective of this study is to develop an innovative hybrid deep learning model that can effectively and robustly fuse the satellite imagery of various spatial and temporal resolutions. The proposed model integrates two types of network models: super-resolution convolutional neural network (SRCNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM). SRCNN can enhance the coarse images by restoring degraded spatial details, while LSTM can learn and extract the temporal changing patterns from the time-series images. To systematically assess the effects of varying levels of phenological changes, we identify image phenological transition dates and design three temporal phenological change scenarios representing rapid, moderate, and minimal phenological changes. The hybrid deep learning model, alongside three benchmark fusion models, is assessed in different scenarios of phenological changes. Results indicate the hybrid deep learning model yields significantly better results when rapid or moderate phenological changes are present. It holds great potential in generating high-quality time-series datasets of both high spatial and temporal resolutions, which can further benefit terrestrial system dynamic studies. The innovative approach to understanding phenological changes' effect will help us better comprehend the strengths and weaknesses of current and future fusion models.

TI  - A Robust Method for Filling the Gaps in MODIS and VIIRS Land Surface Temperature Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived land surface temperatures (LSTs) are a critical parameter in various fields. Unfortunately, there are numerous gaps in LST products due to cloud contamination and orbital gaps. In previous studies, various gapfilling methods have been developed. However, most of those methods use only spatiotemporal information to fill gaps. In this study, a gapfilling method called the enhanced hybrid (EH) method that integrates spatiotemporal information and information from other similar LST products was proposed. The accuracy of the EH method was compared with the accuracies of three other gapfilling methods that only use spatiotemporal information: Remotely Sensed DAily land Surface Temperature reconstruction (RSDAST), interpolation of the mean anomalies (IMAs), and Gapfill. It was found that the correlations between the four LST products were strong, indicating that using information from other products may improve the accuracy of gapfilling. On average, the mean absolute errors (MAEs) of the data filled using the EH method were 23.7%-52.7% lower than those of RSDAST, 35.4%-38.7% lower than those of IMA, and 38.5%-46.9% lower than those of the Gapfill method. The usage of information from other similar LST products was the main reason for the high accuracy observed for the EH method. In addition, the LST images filled using the RSDAST and IMA methods had some outliers, while there were fewer obvious outliers in the LST images filled with the EH method. It was concluded that the EH method is a robust gapfilling method with a high accuracy.

TI  - Analysis on Land-Use Change and Its Driving Mechanism in Xilingol, China, during 2000-2020 Using the Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale, long time-series, and high-precision land-use mapping is the basis for assessing the evolution and sustainability of ecosystems in Xilingol, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China. Based on Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Landsat satellite remote-sensing images, the random forest (RF) classification algorithm was applied to create a yearly land-use/land-cover change (LULC) dataset in Xilingol during the past 20 years (2000-2020) and to examine the spatiotemporal characteristics, dynamic changes, and driving mechanisms of LULC using principal component analysis and multiple linear stepwise regression methods. The main findings are summarized as follows. (1) The RF classification algorithm supported by the GEE platform enables fast and accurate acquisition of the LULC dataset, and the overall accuracy is 0.88 +/- 0.01. (2) The ecological condition across Xilingol has improved significantly in the last 20 years (2000-2020), and the area of vegetation (grassland and woodland) has increased. Specifically, the area of high-coverage grass and woodland increases (+13.26%, +1.19%), while the area of water and moderate- and low-coverage grass decreases (-15.96%, -7.23%, and -3.27%). Cropland increases first and then decreases (-34.85%) and is mainly distributed in the southeast. The area of deserted land decreases in the south and increases in the center and north, but the total area still decreases (-13.74%). The built-up land expands rapidly (+108.45%). (3) In addition, our results suggest that regional socioeconomic development factors are the primary causes of changes in built-up land, and climate-related factors are the primary causes of water changes, but the correlations between other land-use types and relevant factors are not significant (cropland and grassland). We conclude that the GEE+RF method is capable of automated, long time-series, and high-accuracy land-use mapping, and further changes in climatic, environmental, and socioeconomic development factors, i.e., climate warming and rotational grazing, might have significant implications on regional land surface morphology and landscape dynamics.

TI  - Global Ocean Chlorophyll-a Concentrations Derived From COCTS Onboard the HY-1C Satellite and Their Preliminary Evaluation
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Chinese ocean color and temperature scanner (COCTS) onboard the HY-1C satellite was launched on September 7, 2018, and has been providing global multispectral Earth observation data as a new spaceborne sensor for ocean color detection since September 10, 2018. In this study, an atmospheric correction algorithm using a composite of the algorithms developed by Wang and Gordon (1994) and He et al. (2004) and a chlorophyll-a concentration retrieval method that is a composite of the OC4 and color index (CI) algorithms are used to derive the global chlorophyll-a concentration from COCTS. The retrieval products are validated against in situ data measured in the East China Sea and the South China Sea during the in-orbit testing activity for the HY-1C satellite with an unbiased percentage difference (UPD) of 39%, and the data are also validated against the Aerosol Robotic Network-Ocean Color (AERONET-OC) data with a UPD of 39%. The daily global chlorophyll-a concentration from COCTS with a gridded resolution of 9.2 km and a time period from September 10, 2018 to February 29, 2020 is compared with the same products from MODIS and VIIRS. The UPDs of COCTS against MODIS onboard Terra are approximately 20%, and the mean biases (in logarithm form) are approximately zero. Examples of chlorophyll-a concentration retrieval results in specific cases along the eastern coast of China and the Kuroshio Current are also presented to show the performance of the algorithms used in this study. The retrieval and evaluation results show that COCTS onboard HY-1C demonstrates satisfactory performance for global chlorophyll-a concentration observations.

TI  - Using Machine Learning Algorithms Based on GF-6 and Google Earth Engine to Predict and Map the Spatial Distribution of Soil Organic Matter Content
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The prediction of soil organic matter is important for measuring the soil's environmental quality and the degree of degradation. In this study, we combined China's GF-6 remote sensing data with the organic matter content data obtained from soil sampling points in the study area to predict soil organic matter content. To these data, we applied the random forest (RF), light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), gradient boosting tree (GBDT), and extreme boosting machine (XGBoost) learning models. We used the coefficient of determination (R-2), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) to evaluate the prediction model. The results showed that XGBoost (R-2 = 0.634), LightGBM (R-2 = 0.627), and GBDT (R-2 = 0.591) had better accuracy and faster computing time than that of RF (R-2 = 0.551) during training. The regression model established by the XGBoost algorithm on the feature-optimized anthrosols dataset had the best accuracy, with an R-2 of 0.771. The inversion of soil organic matter content based on GF-6 data combined with the XGBoost model has good application potential.

TI  - Monitoring loss of tropical forest cover from Sentinel-1 time-series: A CuSum-based approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The forest decline in tropical areas is one of the largest global environmental threats as the growth of both global population and its needs have put an increasing pressure on these ecosystems. Efforts are ongoing to reduce tropical deforestation rates. Earth observations are increasingly used to monitor deforestation over the whole equatorial area. Change detection methods are mainly applied to satellite optical images which face limitations in humid tropical areas. For instance, due to frequent cloud cover in the tropics, there are often long delays in the detection of deforestation events. Recently, detection methods applied to Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) have been developed to address the limitations related to cloud cover. In this study, we present an application of a recently developed change detection method for monitoring forest cover loss from SAR time-series data in tropical zone. The method is based on the Cumulative Sum algorithm (CuSum) combined with a bootstrap analysis. The method was applied to time-series of Sentinel-1 ground range detected (GRD) dual polarization (VV, VH) images forming a dataset of 60 images to monitor forest cover loss in a legal forest concession of the Democratic Republic of Congo during the 2018-2020 period. A cross-threshold recombination was then conducted on the computed maps. Evaluated against reference forest cut maps, an overall accuracy up to 91% and a precision up to 75% in forest clear cut detection was obtained. Our results show that more than 60% of forest disturbances were detected before the PlanetScope-based estimated date of cut, which may suggest the capacity of our method to detect forest degradation.

TI  - Evaluation of the Reliability of Preoperative Ultrasonography and Ultrasonography-guided Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy in Axillary Staging in Patients With Breast Cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF ACADEMIC RESEARCH IN MEDICINE-JAREM
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective: Our study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of axillary ultrasonography (AUS) and ultrasonography-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy (US-FNAB) methods in patients diagnosed with breast cancer. In addition, to investigate the group that does not need sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and/or axillary lymph node dissection among the clinically negative axilla patients.Methods: The patients diagnosed with breast cancer and an AUS scan with US-FNAB to the suspected lymph node between January 2013 and April 2020 were included, and the patients whose treatment started with neoadjuvant chemotherapy were excluded. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPD), negative predictive value (NPD), and accuracy of AUS and US-FNAB were calculated, and the factors affecting were evaluated.Results: The mean age of the patients in the study was 51.1 +/- 10.76 years. The mean tumor size was 18.84 +/- 9.87 mm. While 14 of 95 patients (14.74%) considered benign with AUS had macrometastases in the final evaluation. In addition, 8 (40%) of 20 patients with suspicious or malignant image features had macrometastases. Twenty-five patients evaluated with US-FNAB but did not detect metastasis were included. However, 8 (32%) of these patients who were not initially considered for metastasis by FNAB had macrometastases in the final pathology. While US sensitivity was 36.36%, specificity: 87.10%, PPD: 40%, NPV: 85.26%, and accuracy: 77.39%, specificity for US-FNAB was 100%, NPV: 68.00%, and accuracy: 68%. The presence of palpable lymph nodes was observed as a factor in false positivity (p<0.05).Conclusion: AUS and US-FNAB applied by experienced staff are valuable methods in excluding axillary disease. However, SLNB remains the standard method to evaluate the axilla nowadays.

TI  - Randomised controlled study of seroma rates after mastectomy with and without quilting the skin flap to pectoralis muscle
T2  - NIGERIAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims: The aim of this study was to determine whether seroma formation was affected by reduction of the potential dead space with the flap fixation method and obliteration of the axillary region in patients with breast cancer who underwent either mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection or sentinel lymph node biopsy. A total of 105 patients with breast cancer were divided into two groups according to wound closure patterns. Patients and Methods: The operating time, postoperative pain and complications, time to drain removal, seroma formation, amount of fluid aspirated and number of aspirations were recorded prospectively. Results: No significant difference was found between groups in the rates of seroma development (P = 0.7), complication rates (P = 0.6), time to drain removal (P = 0.5), length of hospital stay (P = 0.3) or numbers of aspiration (P = 0.7). The operating time for fixation was determined to be longer than that of the classic procedure (P = 0.02). Conclusions: Reducing potential dead space with flap fixation and obliteration of the axillary region may be useful in decreasing the development of seroma in patients who have undergone mastectomy because of breast cancer. However, surgical technique must be careful, and appropriate patient follow-up must be conducted.

TI  - Spatial-temporal Distribution of Spawning Grounds in the Western Guangdong Waters Based on Habitat Suitability Index Model
T2  - PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The western Guangdong Waters (WGW) locates in the northern South China Sea (SCS), and is an important area for fishes spawning, feeding, breeding, and migrating. This study built the Suitability Index (SI) Model for the spatial-temporal distribution of spawning grounds in the WGW based on the simple non-linear regression, using satellite remote sensing and investigation data during April to June in 2014 and 2015. Satellite data including Sea Surface Temperature (SST), Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) and water Depth from Digital Elevation Model (DEM) were used to build the Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) model, based on Maximum Model (MAXM), Minimum Model (MINM), Arithmetic Mean Model (AMM), and Geometric Mean Model (GMM). Results showed that the accuracy of the HSI model was 80%. HSI model built for fish-egg density during April, May and June based on GMM and MINM had the highest accuracy. High HSI area was mainly distributed in the eastern Leizhou Peninsula. HSI distribution was similar to the investigation of spawning grounds, indicating the good performance of the HSI model based on GMM and MINM in forecasting spawning grounds in the Western Guangdong Waters.

TI  - Spatial Representativeness of Gross Primary Productivity from Carbon Flux Sites in the Heihe River Basin, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Studying the spatial representativeness of carbon flux measurement data for typical land cover types can provide important information for benchmarking Earth system models and validating multiple-scale remote sensing products. In our study, daily gross primary productivity (GPP) was firstly derived from eddy covariance observation systems and seasonal variations in field GPP were analyzed at nine flux tower sites for typical land cover types in the Heihe River Basin, China. Then, the real-time footprint distance and climate footprint distance of the field GPP were obtained by using a footprint source area model. Lastly, multiple-scale GPP products were validated at footprint scale, and the impacts (measurement height, surface roughness and turbulent state of the atmosphere) on the footprint distance of field GPP were analyzed. The results of this paper demonstrated that climate footprint distances ranged from about 500 m to 1500 m for different land cover types in the Heihe River Basin. The accuracy was higher when validating MODIS GPP products at footprint scale (R-2 = 0.56, RMSE = 3.07 g C m(-2) d(-1)) than at field scale (R-2 = 0.51, RMSE = 3.34 g C m(-2) d(-1)), and the same situation occurred in the validation of high-resolution downscaled GPP (R-2 = 0.85, RMSE = 1.34 g C m(-2) d(-1) when validated at footprint scale; R-2 = 0.82, RMSE = 1.47 g C m(-2) d(-1) when validated at field scale). The results of this study provide information about the footprints of field GPP for typical land cover types in arid and semi-arid areas in Northwestern China, and reveal that precision may be higher when validating multiple-scale remote sensing GPP products at the footprint scale than at the field scale.

TI  - Tree-based ensemble deep learning model for spatiotemporal surface ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) prediction and interpretation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Tree-based machine learning and deep learning approaches are widely applied in ozone (O-3) retrieval, but they cannot achieve high accuracy and interpretability simultaneously. To overcome this limitation, a tree-based ensemble deep learning model, named semi-SILDM, was proposed for O-3 prediction at both national (5 km) and urban scales (250 m) in China. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Top of Atmosphere (TOA) measurements were first investigated through significant linear and nonlinear relationships with surface O-3. To examine the actual predictive ability of the semi-SIDLM, time-based validation was employed to divide data chronologically by year into training (2018), validation (2017), and test data (2019). The semi-SIDLM predicted O-3 in 2019 showed a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.71 (0.69) and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 21.88 (26.59) mu g/m(3) at the national (urban) scale in China. In addition to its high accuracy, the semi-SIDLM has interpretability for retrieval results, which indicates the strong influence of the Fangshan and Tongzhou districts on the principle O-3 Beijing urban area; the temporal characteristics reveal the higher contributions of May-July to O-3 pollution compared to other months. The proposed model of this study will benefit further studies on O-3 monitoring and deepen the understanding of its spatiotemporal characteristics.

TI  - Comparative Study of Factors Contributing to Land Surface Temperature in High-Density Built Environments in Megacities Using Satellite Imagery
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the root sources contributing to the urban heat island (UHI) effect between megacities, such as Hong Kong and Shenzhen, were integrated and compared using satellite remote sensing data. Classification and multilayer perceptron regression tree (CARTMLP) algorithms were used to classify land use. The radiative transfer equation method was applied to retrieve the land surface temperatures (LSTs) in the study area. Multiple linear regression analysis was applied to determine the relationship between land-use types and UHIs. The experimental results show a large area of relatively high temperature dispersed within Shenzhen, and comparatively small areas highly centralized in Hong Kong, with the retrieved LST in Hong Kong lower than that in Shenzhen. In addition, the surface temperature of large complex buildings decorated with high-albedo materials in Hong Kong was higher than in Shenzhen (e.g., Hong Kong International Airport, 25.12 degrees C; Shenzhen Bao'an International Airport, 23.38 degrees C), with artificial heat being an important contributor to these differences. These results also imply that high-albedo materials are sufficient to alleviate high temperatures. These findings are integrated to propose an organic combination strategy for reducing UHI effects in urban areas in megacities worldwide, such as Hong Kong and Shenzhen in China.

TI  - Controllably Deep Supervision and Multi-Scale Feature Fusion Network for Cloud and Snow Detection Based on Medium- and High-Resolution Imagery Dataset
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds and snow in remote sensing imageries cover underlying surface information, reducing image availability. Moreover, they interact with each other, decreasing the cloud and snow detection accuracy. In this study, we propose a convolutional neural network for cloud and snow detection, named the cloud and snow detection network (CSD-Net). It incorporates the multi-scale feature fusion module (MFF) and the controllably deep supervision and feature fusion structure (CDSFF). MFF can capture and aggregate features at various scales, ensuring that the extracted high-level semantic features of clouds and snow are more distinctive. CDSFF can provide a deeply supervised mechanism with hinge loss and combine information from adjacent layers to gain more representative features. It ensures the gradient flow is more oriented and error-less, while retaining more effective information. Additionally, a high-resolution cloud and snow dataset based on WorldView2 (CSWV) was created and released. This dataset meets the training requirements of deep learning methods for clouds and snow in high-resolution remote sensing images. Based on the datasets with varied resolutions, CSD-Net is compared to eight state-of-the-art deep learning methods. The experiment results indicate that CSD-Net has an excellent detection accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, the mean intersection over the union (MIoU) of CSD-Net is the highest in the corresponding experiment. Furthermore, the number of parameters in our proposed network is just 7.61 million, which is the lowest of the tested methods. It only has 88.06 GFLOPs of floating point operations, which is less than the U-Net, DeepLabV3+, PSPNet, SegNet-Modified, MSCFF, and GeoInfoNet. Meanwhile, CSWV has a higher annotation quality since the same method can obtain a greater accuracy on it.

TI  - Estimating Leaf Area Index with Dynamic Leaf Optical Properties
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) plays an important role in models of climate, hydrology, and ecosystem productivity. The physical model-based inversion method is a practical approach for large-scale LAI inversion. However, the ill-posed inversion problem, due to the limited constraint of inaccurate input parameters, is the dominant source of inversion errors. For instance, variables related to leaf optical properties are always set as constants or have large ranges, instead of the actual leaf reflectance of pixel vegetation in the current model-based inversions. This paper proposes to estimate LAI with the actual leaf optical property of pixels, calculated from the leaf chlorophyll content (Chl(leaf)) product, using a three-dimensional stochastic radiative transfer model (3D-RTM)-based, look-up table method. The parameter characterizing leaf optical properties in the 3D-RTM-based LAI inversion algorithm, single scattering albedo (SSA), is calculated with the Chl(leaf) product, instead of setting fixed values across a growing season. An algorithm to invert LAI with the dynamic SSA of the red band (SSA(red)) is proposed. The retrieval index (RI) increases from less than 42% to 100%, and the RMSE decreases to less than 0.28 in the simulations. The validation results show that the RMSE of the dynamic SSA decreases from 1.338 to 0.511, compared with the existing 3D-RTM-based LUT algorithm. The overestimation problem under high LAI conditions is reduced.

TI  - Leaf area index retrieval with ICESat-2 photon counting LiDAR
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This is the first study to inverse leaf area index (LAI) with photon counting LiDAR (i.e., Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2/Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System, ICESat-2/ATLAS). A new framework composed of three major steps was applied: noise removal algorithm, photon classification algorithm, and the LAI estimation model. To evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of ICESat-2 derived LAI, the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) LAI product at the spatial resolution of 500-m over two sites (Amazon rainforest and Daxing'an mountains forests) were selected for comparison purpose. The results show satisfactory agreements (Amazon: R=0.693, RMSE=2.545; Daxing'an: R=0.626, RMSE=1.893; Two sites together: R=0.667, RMSE=2.433) between MODIS LAI and ICESat-2 derived LAI. Moreover, we also selected the LAI derived from Sentinel-2 to further validate the ICESat-2 derived LAI, and got better results than MODIS LAI (Amazon: R=0.752, RMSE=2.329; Daxing'an: R=0.704, RMSE=1.724). Our study found that: (1) The new applied framework can effectively inverse LAI with ICESat-2. (2) The ICESat-2 derived LAI are reliable. (3) ICESat-2 exists many advantages over MODIS in terms of LAI estimation, for example, it not only can alleviate the issue of saturation of MODIS when LAI is high, but also can mitigate the problem of poor inversion effect of MODIS where the vegetation types are diversity.

TI  - Glacier Area and Snow Cover Changes in the Range System Surrounding Tarim from 2000 to 2020 Using Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier and snow are sensitive indicators of regional climate variability. In the early 21st century, glaciers in the West Kunlun and Pamir regions showed stable or even slightly positive mass budgets, and this is anomalous in a worldwide context of glacier recession. We studied the evolution of snow cover to understand whether it could explain the evolution of glacier area. In this study, we used the thresholding of the NDSI (Normalized Difference Snow Index) retrieved with MODIS data to extract annual glacier area and snow cover. We evaluated how the glacier trends related to snow cover area in five subregions in the Tarim Basin. The uncertainty in our retrievals was assessed by comparing MODIS results with the Landsat-5 TM in 2000 and Landsat-8 OLI in 2020 glacier delineation in five subregions. The glacier area in the Tarim Basin decreased by 1.32%/a during 2000-2020. The fastest reductions were in the East Tien Shan region, while the slowest relative reduction rate was observed in the West Tien Shan and Pamir, i.e., 0.69%/a and 1.08%/a, respectively, during 2000-2020. The relative glacier stability in Pamir may be related to the westerlies weather system, which dominates climate in this region. We studied the temporal variability of snow cover on different temporal scales. The analysis of the monthly snow cover showed that permanent snow can be reliably delineated in the months from July to September. During the summer months, the sequence of multiple snowfall and snowmelt events leads to intermittent snow cover, which was the key feature applied to discriminate snow and glacier.

AB  - In order to design a fast and accurate short-distance localization system to supplement the gap of Global Position System (GPS) in a toll station, in this paper, an IEEE 802.11p module driver is modified to provide channel state information (CSI), and the signal processing techniques are leveraged in both time-domain and frequency-domain to mitigate multi-path effect. An effective CSI vector provided by a roadside unit (RSU) transceiver (RX) array is treated as the fingerprint of a transmitting spot, the spatial diversities of the multiple antennas are leveraged to highlight its position feature. The position similarity degree of a reference point with regard to the measured vehicle position is proposed and treated as weight to calculate vehicle coordinate, the low variability of CSI-fingerprint is alleviated. A filter is designed to cut off the dataset of remote reference points in localization algorithm, traffic noises are reduced. Finally, the accuracy and performance are verified in enforcement, autopilot and navigation applications. The effects of grid size, speed, traffic and weather are evaluated.

TI  - Dynamic Lake Ice Movement on Lake Khovsgol, Mongolia, Revealed by Time Series Displacements from Pixel Offset with Sentinel-2 Optical Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the most sensitive indicators of global climate change, seasonal ice-covered lakes are attracting gaining attention worldwide. As a large seasonal ice-covered lake located in Northern Mongolia, Lake Khovsgol not only provides important freshwater resources for the local population but also serves as a means of water transportation in summer and an important land-based activity for residents in winter. In this study, we used the sub-pixel offset technique with multi-temporal Sentinel-2 optical images to estimate the time-series displacement of lake ice in Lake Khovsgol from 7 December 2020 to 17 June 2021. With the processing of 112 Sentinel-2 images, we obtained 27 pairs of displacement results at intervals of 5, 10, and 15 days. These lake ice movement results covered three stages from ice-on to ice-off. The first stage was the lake ice growth period, which lasted 26 days from 7 December 2020 to 3 January 2021. Ice formation started from the south and extended northward, with a displacement of up to 10 m in 5 days. The second stage was the active phase of the ice cover, which took place from 3 January 2021 to 18 April 2021. Maximum displacement values reached 12 m in the east and 11 m in the north among all observations. The value of the lake ice movement in the north-south direction (NS) was found to be larger than in the east-west direction (EW). The third stage was the melting period, which closed on 17 June 2021. In comparison to the freezing date of November in past years, our results demonstrate the ice-on date of Lake Khovsgol has been delayed to December, suggesting a possible reason that the seasonal ice-covered lake located at the middle latitude has been affected by global warming. In addition, the lake ice movement of our results can reveal the regional climate characteristic. This study is one of the few cases to reveal the distribution characteristics and changing trends of lake ice on the Mongolia Plateau, providing a rare reference for lake ice research in this region.

TI  - Evaluating the impacts of models, data density and irregularity on reconstructing and forecasting dense Landsat time series
T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluated the performance of a variety of time series models, that include the harmonic (HR) model, autoregressive (AR) model, linear Gaussian state-space (LGSS) model, cubic spline (SP) model, double logistic (DL) model, and asymmetric Gaussian (AG) model, for reconstructing (all six models) and forecasting (HR, AR, and LGSS models) dense Landsats 5-7 time series based on 4562 samples. To remove the impact of land change and human interventions on data reconstruction and forecasting, this evaluation excluded croplands and samples changed between 2000 and 2011. Results show that the widely used HR model is not a good model for data reconstruction but outperforms other models in data forecasting. The DL and AG models have the best performance in data reconstruction but cannot forecast Landsat observations. The AR and LGSS models shared similar performance in reconstructing Landsat data but are less ideal for data forecasting, particularly for the LGSS model. Integrating the HR (for forecasting) and DL or AG (for reconstruction) is recommended to improve land change detection and land cover classification results. We also evaluated the impact of data density and irregularity on reconstructing and forecasting Landsat observations. When the data density is low (<7 clear observations per year), the increase of data density can substantially improve the performance of data reconstruction and forecasting, but when the data density is higher than 7 and less than 17, the noise in the data dominates the results, and slightly lower reconstruction and forecasting accuracy is observed. When the data density is higher than 17, model performance improves with the increase of data density again. Therefore, we recommend analyzing Landsat time series for places with data density higher than 7 clear observations per year if possible. On the other hand, data irregularity has a moderate impact on data reconstruction and forecasting. When the irregularity is less than 1, the smaller the irregularity the better the performance in both data reconstruction and forecasting, and when the irregularity is higher than 2.5, it will have a more substantial negative impact. Therefore, time series analysis using Landsat data with an irregularity less than 1 is generally recommended, and time series with an irregularity larger than 2.5 should be avoided if possible.

TI  - Towards a Deep-Learning-Based Framework of Sentinel-2 Imagery for Automated Active Fire Detection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes an automated active fire detection framework using Sentinel-2 imagery. The framework is made up of three basic parts including data collection and preprocessing, deep-learning-based active fire detection, and final product generation modules. The active fire detection module is developed on a specifically designed dual-domain channel-position attention (DCPA)+HRNetV2 model and a dataset with semi-manually annotated active fire samples is constructed over wildfires that commenced on the east coast of Australia and the west coast of the United States in 2019-2020 for the training process. This dataset can be used as a benchmark for other deep-learning-based algorithms to improve active fire detection accuracy. The performance of active fire detection is evaluated regarding the detection accuracy of deep-learning-based models and the processing efficiency of the whole framework. Results indicate that the DCPA and HRNetV2 combination surpasses DeepLabV3 and HRNetV2 models for active fire detection. In addition, the automated framework can deliver active fire detection results of Sentinel-2 inputs with coverage of about 12,000 km(2) (including data download) in less than 6 min, where average intersections over union (IoUs) of 70.4% and 71.9% were achieved in tests over Australia and the United States, respectively. Concepts in this framework can be further applied to other remote sensing sensors with data acquisitions in SWIR-NIR-Red ranges and can serve as a powerful tool to deal with large volumes of high-resolution data used in future fire monitoring systems and as a cost-efficient resource in support of governments and fire service agencies that need timely, optimized firefighting plans.

TI  - Characterization of a seasonally snow-covered evergreen forest ecosystem
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - It remains challenging to interpret seasonal profile of vegetation dynamics from empirical indices NDVI and EVI for boreal forests due to confounding impacts of snow, soil and snowmelt in winter and spring. This work aims to characterize the seasonally snow-covered Howland boreal forest ecosystem in Maine, USA with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) images. Vegetation cover fraction (VGCF), fractional absorption of photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) by all canopy components (fAPARcanopy), fAPAR by canopy chlorophyll (fAPARchl) and fAPAR by canopy non-chlorophyll components (fAPARnon-chl) were extracted from MODIS images in multiple years (2001 - 2014). Snow exposed during December to April. Top of canopy viewable snow cover fraction in April of multiple years varied between 0.02 and 0.16 (0.06 +/- 0.04). Seasonal VGCF and fAPARcanopy showed a summer plateau (VGCF: 0.97 +/- 0.01; fAPARcanopy: 0.90 +/- 0.01). Both seasonal fAPARchl and fAPARnon-chl changed with time, and seasonal fAPARnon-chl had a bimodal shape. Spring VGCF varied between 0.54 and 0.69 (0.61 +/- 0.04). Spring fAPARchl and fAPARnon-chl were 0.22 +/- 0.03 and 0.21 +/- 0.02, respectively. Peak summer fAPARchl was 0.58 +/- 0.02. The lowest summer fAPARnon-chl was 0.32 +/- 0.02. Replacing fAPARcanopy with fAPARchl to simulate boreal forest ecosystem gross primary production (GPP) could reduce uncertainties in GPP simulations.

TI  - Interferometric coherence and seasonal deformation characteristics analysis of saline soil based on Sentinel-1A time series imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS ENGINEERING AND ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Affected by the natural environmental and human activity factors, significant seasonal differences appear on the regional scattering characteristic and ground deformation of saline soil. Interferometric decorrelation due to season replacement limits the conventional multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MT-InSAR) technique and its application in such areas. To extend the monitoring capability in the salt desert area, we select a vast basin of saline soil around Howz-e-Soltan Salt Lake of Iran as the study area and present an improved MT-InSAR for experimental research. Based on 131 C-band Sentinel-1A images collected between October 2014 to July 2020,1896 refined interferograms in total are selected from all interfero-gram candidates. Interferometric coherence analysis shows that the coherence in the saline soil area has an apparent seasonal variation, and the soil moisture affected by the precipitation may be the main factor that leads to the seasonal variation. Subsequently, the deformation characteristics of saline soil under different environmental conditions and human activity factors are compared and analyzed in detail. Related deformation mechanisms of different saline soil types are initially revealed by combining interferometric coherence, meteorological data, and engineering geological characteristics of saline soil. Related results would provide reference for the large-scale infrastructure construction engineering in similar saline soil areas.

TI  - Landsat Image-Based Retrieval and Analysis of Spatiotemporal Variation of Total Suspended Solid Concentration in Jiaozhou Bay, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The total suspended solid (TSS) concentration (mg/L) is an important parameter of water quality in coastal waters. It is of great significance to monitor the spatiotemporal distribution and variation of TSS as well as its influencing factors. In this study, a quantitative retrieval model of TSS in Jiaozhou Bay (JZB) was established based on Landsat images from 1984 to 2020 (coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.77, root mean square error (RMSE) = 1.82 mg/L). In this paper, first, the long-term spatiotemporal variation of TSSs in JZB is revealed and, next, its influencing factors are further analyzed. The results show that the annual average TSSs in JZB reached their highest level in 1993 and their lowest level in 2016, showing a decreasing trend during the past decades. The TSSs were high in spring and winter and low in summer and autumn. The spatial distribution of the TSSs in JZB was similar at different timepoints, i.e., high in the northwest and gradually decreasing to the southeast. Tidal elevation exerted a significant influence on the daily variation of TSSs, and wind speed had a significant influence on the seasonal variation of TSSs. The Dagu River's discharge only affected the TSSs at the river mouth. Tidal elevation, river discharge, and wind speed were major influence factors for TSSs' variation in JZB. The results showed that the empirical model based on Landsat satellite data could be used to effectively monitor the long-term variation of TSSs in JZB.

TI  - Potential Game-Based Radio Resource Allocation in Uplink Multibeam Satellite IoT Networks
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AEROSPACE AND ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we introduce a potential game-based approach to implement collaborative user scheduling and power allocation in the uplink multibeam satellite-based Internet of things (S-IoT) networks. First of all, a framework of the multibeam uplink S-IoT system is proposed, where full frequency reuse and co-channel interference among different spot beams are considered. To provide broadband S-IoT service effectively, we formulate an initial optimization problem of maximizing uplink sum transmission capacity and then transform it into an interference avoidance problem to address the mathematical intractability. Specifically, a game-theoretic model is implemented to solve the transformed optimization problem, which is proved to be a potential game and existence of Nash equilibriums (NEs). Moreover, an iterative algorithm with low computational complexity, motivated by the finite improvement property, is designed to implement collaborative user scheduling and power allocation to NE point. Finally, the simulation results prove the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed potential game-based approach.

TI  - Retrieval of Leaf Area Index by Linking the PROSAIL and Ross-Li BRDF Models Using MODIS BRDF Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Canopy structure parameters (e.g., leaf area index (LAI)) are key variables of most climate and ecology models. Currently, satellite-observed reflectances at a few viewing angles are often directly used for vegetation structure parameter retrieval; therefore, the information content of multi-angular observations that are sensitive to canopy structure in theory cannot be sufficiently considered. In this study, we proposed a novel method to retrieve LAI based on modelled multi-angular reflectances at sufficient sun-viewing geometries, by linking the PROSAIL model with a kernel-driven Ross-Li bi-directional reflectance function (BRDF) model using the MODIS BRDF parameter product. First, BRDF sensitivity to the PROSAIL input parameters was investigated to reduce the insensitive parameters. Then, MODIS BRDF parameters were used to model sufficient multi-angular reflectances. By comparing these reference MODIS reflectances with simulated PROSAIL reflectances within the range of the sensitive input parameters in the same geometries, the optimal vegetation parameters were determined by searching the minimum discrepancies between them. In addition, a significantly linear relationship between the average leaf angle (ALA) and the coefficient of the volumetric scattering kernel of the Ross-Li model in the near-infrared band was built, which can narrow the search scope of the ALA and accelerate the retrieval. In the validation, the proposed method attains a higher consistency (root mean square error (RMSE) = 1.13, bias = -0.19, and relative RMSE (RRMSE) = 36.8%) with field-measured LAIs and 30-m LAI maps for crops than that obtained with the MODIS LAI product. The results indicate the vegetation inversion potential of sufficient multi-angular data and the ALA relationship, and this method presents promise for large-scale LAI estimation.

TI  - A Rapid Model (COV_PSDI) for Winter Wheat Mapping in Fallow Rotation Area Using MODIS NDVI Time-Series Satellite Observations: The Case of the Heilonggang Region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid and accurate monitoring of spatial distribution patterns of winter wheat over a long period is of great significance for crop yield prediction and farmland water consumption estimation. However, weather conditions and relatively long revisit cycles often result in an insufficient number of continuous medium-high resolution images over large areas for many years. In addition, the cropland pattern changes frequently in the fallow rotation area. A novel rapid mapping model for winter wheat based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time-series coefficient of variation (NDVI_COVfp) and peak-slope difference index (PSDI) is proposed in this study. NDVI_COVfp uses the time-series index volatility to distinguish cultivated land from background land-cover types. PSDI combines the key growth stages of winter wheat phenology and special bimodal characteristics, substantially reducing the impact of abandoned land and other crops. Taking the Heilonggang as an example, this study carried out a rapid mapping of winter wheat for four consecutive years (2014-2017), and compared the proposed COV_PSDI with two state-of-the-art methods and traditional methods (the Spectral Angle Mapping (SAM) and the Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique Algorithm (ISODATA)). The verification results revealed that the COV_PSDI model improved the overall accuracy (94.10%) by 4% compared with the two state-of-art methods (90.80%, 89.00%) and two traditional methods (90.70%, 87.70%). User accuracy was the highest, which was 93.74%. Compared with the other four methods, the percentage error (PE) of COV_PSDI for four years was the lowest in the same year, with the minimum variation range of PE being 1.6-3.6%. The other methods resulted in serious overestimation. This demonstrated the effectiveness and stability of the method proposed in the rapid and accurate extraction of winter wheat in a large area of fallow crop rotation region. Our study provides insight for remote sensing monitoring of spatiotemporal patterns of winter wheat and evaluation of "fallow rotation" policy implementation.

TI  - Greening-induced increase in evapotranspiration over Eurasia offset by CO<sub>2</sub>-induced vegetational stomatal closure
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET), as a key exchanging component of the land energy, water and carbon cycles, is expected to increase in response to greening land under a warming climate. However, the relative importance of major drivers (e.g. leaf area index (LAI), climate forcing, atmospheric CO2, etc) to long-term ET change remain largely unclear. Focusing on the Eurasia which experienced the strong vegetational greening, we aim to estimate the long-term ET trend and its drivers' relative contributions by applying a remote sensing-based water-carbon coupling model- Penman-Monteith-Leuning version 2 (PML-V2) driven by observational climate forcing and CO2 records, and satellite-based LAI, albedo and emissivity. The PML-V2 estimated an increasing ET trend (6.20 +/- 1.13 mm year(-1) decade(-1), p < 0.01) over Eurasia during 1982-2014, which is close to the ensemble mean (6.51 +/- 3.10 mm year(-1) decade(-1)) from other three ET products (GLEAMv3.3a, ERA5 and CRv1.0). The PML-based ET overall agrees well with water-balance derived ET in detecting the trend directions. We find that the Eurasian ET increasing trend was mostly from vegetated regions over central and eastern Europe, Indian and southeast China where ET trends were larger than 20 mm year(-1) decade(-1). Modeling sensitivity experiments indicate that the Eurasian ET trend was mainly dominated by positive contributions from climate forcing change (40%) and increased LAI (22%), but largely offset by a negative contribution of increased CO2 (26%). Our results highlight the importance of the suppression effect of increasing CO2-induced stomatal closure on transpiration. This effect was rarely considered in diagnostic ET products but plays a key role to ensure that the long-term ET trend should not be overestimated by only accounting for greening-induced increases in transpiration and rainfall interception.

TI  - Detecting Rock Glacier Displacement in the Central Himalayas Using Multi-Temporal InSAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rock glaciers represent typical periglacial landscapes and are distributed widely in alpine mountain environments. Rock glacier activity represents a critical indicator of water reserves state, permafrost distribution, and landslide disaster susceptibility. The dynamics of rock glacier activity in alpine periglacial environments are poorly quantified, especially in the central Himalayas. Multi-temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (MT-InSAR) has been shown to be a useful technique for rock glacier deformation detection. In this study, we developed a multi-baseline persistent scatterer (PS) and distributed scatterer (DS) combined MT-InSAR method to monitor the activity of rock glaciers in the central Himalayas. In periglacial landforms, the application of the PS interferometry (PSI) method is restricted by insufficient PS due to large temporal baseline intervals and temporal decorrelation, which hinder comprehensive measurements of rock glaciers. Thus, we first evaluated the rock glacier interferometric coherence of all possible interferometric combinations and determined a multi-baseline network based on rock glacier coherence; then, we constructed a Delaunay triangulation network (DTN) by exploiting both PS and DS points. To improve the robustness of deformation parameters estimation in the DTN, we combined the Nelder-Mead algorithm with the M-estimator method to estimate the deformation rate variation at the arcs of the DTN and introduced a ridge-estimator-based weighted least square (WLR) method for the inversion of the deformation rate from the deformation rate variation. We applied our method to Sentinel-1A ascending and descending geometry data (May 2018 to January 2019) and obtained measurements of rock glacier deformation for 4327 rock glaciers over the central Himalayas, at least more than 15% detecting with single geometry data. The line-of-sight (LOS) deformation of rock glaciers in the central Himalayas ranged from -150 mm to 150 mm. We classified the active deformation area (ADA) of all individual rock glaciers with the threshold determined by the standard deviation of the deformation map. The results show that 49% of the detected rock glaciers (monitoring rate greater than 30%) are highly active, with an ADA ratio greater than 10%. After projecting the LOS deformation to the steep slope direction and classifying the rock glacier activity following the IPA Action Group guideline, 12% of the identified rock glaciers were classified as active and 86% were classified as transitional. This research is the first multi-baseline, PS, and DS network-based MT-InSAR method applied to detecting large-scale rock glaciers activity.

TI  - Simulation of External Stray Light for FY-3C VIRR Combined with Satellite Orbit Attitude Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical imaging systems mounted on a Sun-synchronous satellite are probably disturbed by stray light when working in the space environment. Existing research has shown that the Visible Infrared Radiometer (VIRR) onboard the FY-3C satellite is affected by external solar stray light radiation when imaging the ground. In this paper, based on analyzing the solar stray light generation mechanism, we propose a simulation and analysis method combined with the given satellite orbit attitude model to investigate the influence of external solar stray light on VIRR's imaging quality. We use the FY-3C orbit parameters to obtain the variation pattern of the angles between the solar vector and the payload. Based on the VIRR mechanical structure and optical scattering model, light tracing is performed to investigate the spatial distribution of irradiation on the primary mirror. The results of the occurrence time and intensity of stray light obtained by the simulation are consistent with the actual data when imaging the ground, which verifies that the proposed method is a correct and effective way to investigate the regularity of the external stray light of on-orbit payload.

TI  - Multigranularity Multiclass-Layer Markov Random Field Model for Semantic Segmentation of Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Semantic segmentation is one of the most important tasks in remote sensing. However, as spatial resolution increases, distinguishing the homogeneity of each land class and the heterogeneity between different land classes are challenging. The Markov random field model (MRF) is a widely used method for semantic segmentation due to its effective spatial context description. To improve segmentation accuracy, some MRF-based methods extract more image information by constructing the probability graph with pixel or object granularity units, and some other methods interpret the image from different semantic perspectives by building multilayer semantic classes. However, these MRF-based methods fail to capture the relationship between different granularity features extracted from the image and hierarchical semantic classes that need to be interpreted. In this article, a new MRF-based method is proposed to incorporate the multigranularity information and the multilayer semantic classes together for semantic segmentation of remote sensing images. The proposed method develops a framework that builds a hybrid probability graph on both pixel and object granularities and defines a multiclass-layer label field with hierarchical semantic over the hybrid probability graph. A generative alternating granularity inference is suggested to provide the result by iteratively passing and updating information between different granularities and hierarchical semantics. The proposed method is tested on texture images, different remote sensing images obtained by the SPOT5, Gaofen-2, GeoEye, and aerial sensors, and Pavia University hyperspectral image. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method shows a better segmentation performance than other state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - Refined segmentation method based on U-ASPP-Net for Arctic independent sea ice
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFRARED AND MILLIMETER WAVES
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the characteristics of the FY-3 MERSI II images, an algorithm of independent sea ice segmentation based on U-ASPP-Net is proposed. The algorithm introduces the Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling module and Atrous Depthwise Separable Convolution on the basis of U - Net to develop a new independent sea ice segmentation network U-ASPP-Net. Meanwhile, FDWloss is used as the loss function at the back end of the network. Finally, the overlap elimination strategy is used to generate the final independent sea ice segmentation map. In order to verify the accuracy and effectiveness of U-ASPP-Net, U-Net, Deeplab v3' and partition gradient difference and bimodal threshold segmentation method are selected as control methods for experiments. The experimental results show that the independent seaice fine segmentation method based on U-ASPP-NET is superior to the other methods in the four indexes of OA, Kappa coefficient, IOU, Dice coefficient. It has a strong ability to extract details and edges, and has a high degree of reduction to tiny sea ice. In addition, this algorithm can solve the problem of thin cloud interference that cannot be solved when extracting independent sea ice based on medium-resolution remote sensing images to a certain extent. It still has a good ability to extract sea ice under thin clouds and can provide more accurate technical support for the dynamic planning of the Arctic route.

TI  - A New Decorrelation Phase Covariance Model for Noise Reduction in Unwrapped Interferometric Phase Stacks
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accuracy of geophysical parameter estimation made with interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) time-series techniques can be improved with rapidly increasing available data volumes and with the development of noise covariance matrices applicable to joint analysis of networks of interferograms. In this article, we present a new decorrelation phase covariance model and discuss its role in noise reduction in unwrapped interferometric phase stacks. We demonstrate with an example in which we average unwrapped interferogram phase stacks that span over a transient event how a noise covariance model can aid in noise reduction. Our model suggests that, for rapidly decorrelating surfaces (i.e., surfaces with much shorter correlation time than SAR acquisition intervals), it is preferable to incorporate all available interferograms from long observation windows. For slowly decorrelating surfaces (i.e., surfaces with longer correlation time than SAR acquisition intervals), our model suggests that a small subset of interferometric pairs is sufficient. We validate our model and three existing models of decorrelation phase covariance matrices in both Cascadia, a region with heavy vegetation cover, and Death Valley, a desert region with C-band Sentinel-1 A observations. Our proposed model matches observations with the smallest average discrepancy between theory and observations.

TI  - DELINEATIONRADAR ZONES OF GLACIERS IN THE ALA-ARCHA VALLEY OF KYRGYZ REPUBLIC
T2  - GEOGRAPHIA TECHNICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers are a critical source of freshwater, especially during the lean season. Globally, the glaciers are losing their mass balance rapidly under the influence of climate change. In view of this, the regular study of these glaciers is very vital. However, field-based studies of most of the glaciers is a daunting task. On the contrary, emerging geospatial technology may play an important role in the studies of glaciers. The equilibrium line altitude (ELA) of the glaciers has been considered an essential indicator of climate change. There are numerous methods to delineate the equilibrium line of a glacier; however, each has its own merits and demerits. In the present study, the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing-based approach has been used for identifying the ELA of glaciers in the Ala-Archa River catchment of Kyrgyzstan from 2015 - 2019. Initially, the glacier radar zonesweremapped using the Sentinel-1 SAR datasets of each year under consideration. It was found that mainly the middle percolation, lower percolation, and bare-ice zones along with debris cover-ice are present in the glaciers. It was observed that the percolation refreeze zone covers approximately 40%, and the Bare-Ice zone covers 48% of the total area. Considering the boundary of lower percolation and bare-ice zone as ELA, the ELA of each glacier in each year was estimated. The lowest ELA of 3462 m was observed in 2018, whereas the highest (4309 m) was recorded in 2019. It was noticed that the trend of ELA is consistently increased from 3839.25 m in 2015 up to in 3868.29 m 2019. The temporal analysis of glacier radar zone estimation and ELA may help in studying the impact of climate change on glacier retreat and mass balance change. It can be concluded that geospatial techniques can make the glacier change studies possible without field survey. However, to validate the results of the study, field observations are a must.

TI  - Improved Intra-Pixel Sensitivity Characterization Based on Diffusion and Coupling Model for Infrared Focal Plane Array Photodetector
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The high-precision characterization of the intra-pixel sensitivity (IPS) for infrared focal plane array (FPA) photodetector is of great significance to high-precision photometry and astrometry in astronomy, as well as target tracking in under-sampled remote sensing images. The discrete sub-pixel response (DSPR) model and fill factor model have been used for IPS characterization in some studies. However, these models are incomplete and lack the description of physical process of charge diffusion and capacitance coupling, leading to the inaccuracy of IPS characterization. In this paper, we propose an improved IPS characterization method based on the diffusion and coupling physical (DCP) model for infrared FPA photodetector, which considering the processes of generation and collection of the charge, can improve the accuracy of IPS characterization. The IPS model can be obtained by convolving the ideal rectangular response function with the charge diffusion function and the capacitive coupling function. Then, the IPS model is convolved with the beam spot profile to obtain the beam spot scanning response model. Finally, we calculate the parameters of IPS by fitting the beam spot scanning response map with the proposed DCP model based on the Trust-Region-Reflective algorithm. Simulated results show that when using a 3 mu m beam spot to scan, the error of IPS characterization based on DCP model is 0.63%, which is better than that of DSPR model's 3.70%. Experimental results show that the fitting error of the beam spot scan response model based on DCP model is 4.29%, which is better than that of DSPR model's 8.31%.

TI  - Applicability of multiple remotely sensed vegetation indices for extracting key phenological metrics of <i>Tamarix chinensis</i> shrubs based on CO<sub>2</sub> flux observation and Sentinel-2 data.
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyzed the relationship between gross primary productivity (GPP) and environmental factors at Sidaoqiao Superstation of the Ejina Oasis in China's Gobi Desert, by combining eddy flux and meteorological data from 2018 to 2019 and Sentinel. 2 remote sensing images from 2017 to 2020. We evaluated the applicability of 12 remote sensing vegetation indices to simulate the growth of Tamarix chinensis and extract key phenological metrics. A seven-parameter double-logistic function (DL-7) + global model function (GMF) was used to fit the growth curves of GPP and vegetation indices. Three key phenological metrics, i.e., the start of the growing season (SOS), the peak of the growing season (POS), and the end of the growing season (EOS), were extracted for each year. Growing season degree days (GDD) and soil water content were the main environmental factors affecting the phenological dynamics of T. chinensis. Compared with 2018, the lower temperatures in 2019 resulted in slower accumulation rate of accumulated temperature before the SOS. T. chinensis required longer heat accumulation to enter growing season, which might cause later SOS in 2019. The hydrothermal conditions between SOS and POS were similar for 2018 and 2019. However, the POS in 2019 was 8 days later than that in 2018, because of the late SOS in 2019. Following the POS in 2019, high GDD and low soil water content caused the T. chinensis to suffer from water stress, resulting in a shortened late growing season. The linear regression between the standardized Sentinel-2 vegetation index and the average value of GPP between 10:00 and 14:00 indicated that the enhanced vegetation index of the broadband vegetation index and the chlorophyll red edge index, inverted red edge chlorophyll index, and red-edge normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI705) of the narrowband vegetation index were highly consistent with the GPP of T. chinensis. Remote sensing extraction of SOS and POS of T. chinensis suggested that the Sentinel-2 narrowband vegetation index was more accurate than the broadband vegetation index. The modified chlorophyll absorption in reflectance index provided the most accurate extraction of SOS, while the MERIS terrestrial chlorophyll index provided the most accurate extraction of EOS. Conversely, the Sentinel-2 broadband vegetation index was the most accurate for extracting POS, especially the 2-band enhanced vegetation index and the near. infrared reflectance of vegetation. Overall, NDVI705 was the best index to estimate phenological metrics.

TI  - A geometric misregistration resistant data fusion approach for adding red-edge (RE) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) bands to high spatial resolution imagery
T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High spatial resolution images have been widely applied to the monitoring of land surfaces during the past decades. However, satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) sensors (e.g., IKONOS, and QuickBird) usually only provide visible and near-infrared spectral bands with a high spatial resolution. Such limited spectral bands at a high spatial resolution are not adequate for crucial environmental and agricultural studies that require essential bands (e.g., the red-edge (RE) and the short-wave infrared (SWIR)), such as land cover classification and the estimation of plant physiological parameters. On the contrary, abundant spectral information is commonly available on sensors with a medium spatial resolution (e.g., Landsat, and Sentinel-2). Existing spatial-spectral fusion methods can leverage the unique advantages of these two types of sensors, and produce synthesized images with both spatial and spectral detail. However, most spatial-spectral methods ignore the inherent geometric registration errors when using multi-source data, inevitably introducing the errors into the fusion result. To address the limitation, this study presents a new spatial-spectral fusion method, the Misregistration-Resistant Data Fusion approach (MRDF), to add new spectral bands to the high spatial resolution images from medium resolution images. The proposed method is composed of a local-model-based similar pixel searching and a global partial least square (PLS) regression, and has the following advantages: (1) the local model utilizes neighborhood similar pixels to generate predictions robust against geometric misregistration; (2) the combined model integrates a global PLS regression to improve fusion accuracy for the SWIR bands; (3) the extended-box strategy and spatial filtering can relieve geometric errors when minimizing residuals for the SWIR bands. Satellite and airborne data from three sites were used to compare the performance of MRDF with seven other typical methods. Results showed that MRDF not only produced accurate fusion results with above-average efficiency but also improved the classification accuracy, which substantiated its great potential for various applications.

TI  - Business Circle Identification and Spatiotemporal Characteristics in the Main Urban Area of Yiwu City Based on POI and Night-Time Light Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The activity of the urban night-time economy is one of the most important indicators reflecting the prosperity of an urban economy. The business circle is an important carrier of urban commercial activities and the core area of urban nightlife. This paper takes the main urban area of Yiwu city as the research object. Based on POI data and night-time light remote sensing data, two-factor mapping, kernel density analysis, DBSCAN clustering, and local contour tree methods are adopted to identify the business circle structure of the main urban area of Yiwu city and analyse the relationship between business circle characteristics and the night-time economy. The following conclusions can be drawn. (1) The spatial superimposition relationship between the night-time remote sensing data and points of interest (POI) data in the main urban area of Yiwu city is good, and the overall coupling results show obvious circle structure characteristics. (2) The spatial distribution of different business combinations has obvious regularity: comprehensive shopping business shows a multicentre distribution pattern and has a hierarchical feature. In contrast, professional food and beverage and leisure and entertainment businesses are close to urban residential areas, and different groups of people live in different places with their own characteristics. (3) From 2015 to 2019, the brightness value of each business circle showed a continuously increasing trend. In 2020, due to the impact of COVID-19, most of them declined. (4) Overall, the difference in business circle tiers reflects the difference in the level of night-time economic activities.

TI  - Object-Based Wetland Vegetation Classification Using Multi-Feature Selection of Unoccupied Aerial Vehicle RGB Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland vegetation is an important component of wetland ecosystems and plays a crucial role in the ecological functions of wetland environments. Accurate distribution mapping and dynamic change monitoring of vegetation are essential for wetland conservation and restoration. The development of unoccupied aerial vehicles (UAVs) provides an efficient and economic platform for wetland vegetation classification. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of RGB imagery obtained from the DJI Mavic Pro for wetland vegetation classification at the species level, with a specific application to Honghu, which is listed as a wetland of international importance. A total of ten object-based image analysis (OBIA) scenarios were designed to assess the contribution of five machine learning algorithms to the classification accuracy, including Bayes, K-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), and random forest (RF), multi-feature combinations and feature selection implemented by the recursive feature elimination algorithm (RFE). The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient were compared to determine the optimal classification method. The main results are as follows: (1) RF showed the best performance among the five machine learning algorithms, with an overall accuracy of 89.76% and kappa coefficient of 0.88 when using 53 features (including spectral features (RGB bands), height information, vegetation indices, texture features, and geometric features) for wetland vegetation classification. (2) The RF model constructed by only spectral features showed poor classification results, with an overall accuracy of 73.66% and kappa coefficient of 0.70. By adding height information, VIs, texture features, and geometric features to construct the RF model layer by layer, the overall accuracy was improved by 8.78%, 3.41%, 2.93%, and 0.98%, respectively, demonstrating the importance of multi-feature combinations. (3) The contribution of different types of features to the RF model was not equal, and the height information was the most important for wetland vegetation classification, followed by the vegetation indices. (4) The RFE algorithm effectively reduced the number of original features from 53 to 36, generating an optimal feature subset for wetland vegetation classification. The RF based on the feature selection result of RFE (RF-RFE) had the best performance in ten scenarios, and provided an overall accuracy of 90.73%, which was 0.97% higher than the RF without feature selection. The results illustrate that the combination of UAV-based RGB imagery and the OBIA approach provides a straightforward, yet powerful, approach for high-precision wetland vegetation classification at the species level, in spite of limited spectral information. Compared with satellite data or UAVs equipped with other types of sensors, UAVs with RGB cameras are more cost efficient and convenient for wetland vegetation monitoring and mapping.

TI  - Using Sentinel-2 to Track Field-Level Tillage Practices at Regional Scales in Smallholder Systems
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Zero tillage is an important pathway to sustainable intensification and low-emission agriculture. However, quantifying the extent of zero tillage adoption at the field scale has been challenging, especially in smallholder systems where field sizes are small and there is limited ground data on zero tillage adoption. Remote sensing offers the ability to map tillage practices at large spatio-temporal scales, yet to date no studies have used satellite data to map zero tillage adoption in smallholder agricultural systems. In this study, we use Sentinel-2 satellite data, random forest classifiers, and Google Earth Engine to map tillage practices across India's main grain producing region, the Indo-Gangetic Plains. We find that tillage practices can be classified with moderate accuracy (an overall accuracy of 75%), particularly in regions with relatively large field sizes and homogenous crop management practices. We find that models that use satellite data from only the first half of the growing season perform as well as models that use data throughout the growing season, allowing for the creation of within-season tillage maps. Finally, we find that our model can generalize well through time in the western IGP, with reductions in accuracy of only 5-10%. Our results highlight the ability of Sentinel-2 satellite data to map tillage practices at scale, even in smallholder systems where field sizes are small and cropping practices are heterogeneous.

TI  - Numerical simulation on the mechanism of the Madoi, Qinghai <i>M</i><sub>s</sub>7. 4 earthquake constrained by InSAR deformation
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Madoi M(S)7.4 earthquake occurred in Qinghai Province on 22 May 2021, which caused serious damage on the surface. In this work, using the interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technology, coseismic surface deformation in ascending and descending directions of Sentinel-1, east-west and vertical directions were obtained, and the segmented structure of earthquake rupture surface was delineated. Constrained by the observed surface deformation from InSAR, a 3D viscoelastic finite element model considering the rupture characteristics of the Madoi earthquake was constructed. Then the 3D coseismic deformation and stress field of the Madoi earthquake were simulated. Results show that the Madoi earthquake is a typical left-lateral strike-slip faulting, in which the fault slip in the east is relatively large. The aftershocks of the Madoi earthquake are all distributed in the area where the Coulomb stress variation is negative, which indicates that the Madoi earthquake has fully released the accumulated strain on the fault and the occurrence of aftershocks in the future will spread towards the southwest and northeast. The occurrence of the Madoi earthquake has formed several stress enhancement areas, which indicates that the Madoi event has greatly increased the possibility of sliding of some other fault zones. The projection of Coulomb stress variation caused by the 2010 Yushu M7.3 earthquake on the main rupture surface of the Madoi earthquake is positive, which permits to speculate that the Yushu earthquake may have promoted the Madoi shock. This study can provide a quantitative reference for the judgment of aftershocks and possible surface damage following big earthquakes.

TI  - Tropical Forests Classification Based on Weighted Separation Index from Multi-Temporal Sentinel-2 Images in Hainan Island
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forests play a vital role in biodiversity conservation and the maintenance of sustainability. Although different time-series spatial resolution satellite images have provided opportunities for tropical forests classification, the complexity and diversity of vegetation types still pose challenges, especially for distinguishing different vegetation types. In this paper, we proposed a Spectro-Temporal Feature Selection (STFS) method based on the Weighted Separation Index (WSI) using multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data for mapping tropical forests in Jianfengling area, Hainan Province. The results showed that the tropical forests were classified with an overall accuracy of 93% and an F1 measure of 0.92 with multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data. As our results also revealed, the WSI based STFS method could be efficient in tropical forests classification by using a fewer feature subset compared with Variable Selection Using Random Forest (14 features and all 40 features, respectively) to achieve the same accuracy. The analysis also showed it was not advisable to only pursue a higher WSI value while ignoring the heterogeneity and diversity of features. This study demonstrated that the WSI can provide a new feature selection method for multi-temporal remote sensing image classification.

TI  - Characterization of Dry-Season Phenology in Tropical Forests by Reconstructing Cloud-Free Landsat Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fine-resolution satellite imagery is needed for characterizing dry-season phenology in tropical forests since many tropical forests are very spatially heterogeneous due to their diverse species and environmental background. However, fine-resolution satellite imagery, such as Landsat, has a 16-day revisit cycle that makes it hard to obtain a high-quality vegetation index time series due to persistent clouds in tropical regions. To solve this challenge, this study explored the feasibility of employing a series of advanced technologies for reconstructing a high-quality Landsat time series from 2005 to 2009 for detecting dry-season phenology in tropical forests; Puerto Rico was selected as a testbed. We combined bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) correction, cloud and shadow screening, and contaminated pixel interpolation to process the raw Landsat time series and developed a thresholding method to extract 15 phenology metrics. The cloud-masked and gap-filled reconstructed images were tested with simulated clouds. In addition, the derived phenology metrics for grassland and forest in the tropical dry forest zone of Puerto Rico were evaluated with ground observations from PhenoCam data and field plots. Results show that clouds and cloud shadows are more accurately detected than the Landsat cloud quality assessment (QA) band, and that data gaps resulting from those clouds and shadows can be accurately reconstructed (R-2 = 0.89). In the tropical dry forest zone, the detected phenology dates (such as greenup, browndown, and dry-season length) generally agree with the PhenoCam observations (R-2 = 0.69), and Landsat-based phenology is better than MODIS-based phenology for modeling aboveground biomass and leaf area index collected in field plots (plot size is roughly equivalent to a 3 x 3 Landsat pixels). This study suggests that the Landsat time series can be used to characterize the dry-season phenology of tropical forests after careful processing, which will help to improve our understanding of vegetation-climate interactions at fine scales in tropical forests.

AB  - This paper presents the results of the analysis of the archive of radar images of Envisat Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) and Radarsat-1,2 for the warm period of 2009-2012. For the first time surface manifestations of submesoscale eddies are mapped in the White Sea.The areas of persistent eddy activity as well as eddy characteristics are determined using the statistical analysis. According to in situ observations some of the observed small eddies are generated due to a strong tidal flow around the underwater hills. A significant part of the observed eddies have been detected in the straits and near hydrological fronts, which indicates their important contribution to the processes of water exchange and mixing.

TI  - Relational beings modeled in clay within the depths of the Sierra Mixe of Oaxaca, Mexico Bridging Indigenous knowledge and archaeology
T2  - HAU-JOURNAL OF ETHNOGRAPHIC THEORY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article examines the possible roles of exceptionally preserved clay reliefs and sculptures within a cave in the Mixe (Ayuujk) territory of Oaxaca, Mexico, a region where early researchers proposed that no art existed. Deploying conceptual tools offered by the reactivation of ontological studies, it is suggested here that these multilayered things acted as a dynamic relational web between beings co-responsible for the world's prosperity, social reproduction, and the fertility of the land. Early ethnographic accounts, anthropological work, historical documents, and first-hand interviews with Indigenous people provide an initial explanatory platform for investigating those figures' functions in the past while also understanding their agentive nature, thus enriching our current knowledge of Ayuujk worldview and rituals. Ayuujk's participation and collaboration in this research offers a glimpse into their values, culture, and practices today, and an opportunity to give members of the descendant community a voice in this archaeological inquiry.

TI  - CORRECTING THE TOPOGRAPHIC EFFECT ON SPOT-6/ 7 MULTISPECTRAL IMAGERIES: A COMPARISON OF DIFFERENT DIGITAL ELEVATION MODELS
T2  - GEOGRAPHIA TECHNICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The topographic effect on satellite imagery has long been acknowledged and several methods have been proposed to address it. These methods mostly employ a digital elevation model to identify topographic conditions. The availability of various digital elevation models (DEMs) with different spatial resolutions prompts a thorough investigation to select suitable data for use when correcting the topographic effect on high-resolution satellite imagery. The release of Digital Elevation Model Nasional (DEMNAS) with its 8-meter spatial resolution provides a similar spatial resolution with SPOT-6/7 multispectral data (6 meters). This study presents our results for topographic correction performed using three different DEMs on orthorectified SPOT-6/7 multispectral data. These DEMs are Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and ALOS World 3D 30 meters (AW3D30), as well as DEMNAS. All three DEMs were resampled to match SPOT-6/7 spatial resolution (6 meters). Atmospheric correction using the MODTRAN-4 algorithm was conducted on the SPOT-6/7 multispectral images. Our study was conducted on two test sites located in the mountainous region over South Sulawesi Province, Indonesia. The Minnaert correction was chosen as the correction algorithm with the k constant calculated for each band over forest land cover. To evaluate the performance of each DEM, visual evaluation and statistical assessment were employed. Pixel values before and after topographic correction were compared over sunlit as well as shaded forest. Coefficient of variation (CV) was used as the statistical assessment tool. Our results show that AW3D30 is able to reduce the topographic effect on SPOT-6/7 multispectral images. The correlation (r) between image surface reflectance value and local illumination were reduced from 0.78 to -0.06 for the best performer on the NIR infrared band. CV was also reduced from 24.46 to 19.02 for the same NIR band. AW3D30 performed the best without the apparent under-and over-correction produced by the two other DEMs. Tweaks and modifications are found to be necessary to resolve the under-correction encountered when using SRTM and the over-correction associated with using DEMNAS on SPOT-6/7 multispectral imagery.

TI  - Urban expansion and differential accessibility by car and public transport in the Greater Kumasi city-region, Ghana-A geospatial modelling approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a growing recognition of the worsening problems of accessibility in Africa's major urban centres and cityregions. Yet, research assessing differential accessibility in these contexts is limited, partly because of the lack of population and land-use data at granular spatial resolutions. In this paper, we contribute to addressing the existing challenges by presenting a geospatial modelling approach that combines historical urban physical development data extracted from Landsat satellite images, travel time data from Openrouteservice and Google Maps API services, and relevant transport infrastructure data. We apply the approach to analyse place-based (100 m2) accessibility in the Greater Kumasi city-region of Ghana. The analysis reveals a strong coevolutionary relationship between physical development and geographical accessibility, with an estimated 83% of the emergent physical development located within half-a-kilometre distance of a primary road. First-andlast-mile accessibility in terms of walking time to public transport stations and public transport service routes are quantified. We reveal huge first-and-last-mile accessibility deficits, with an estimated 14% and 33% of the cityregion's built-up area having a 5-minute and 10-minute walking time reachability to a public transport station, as a critical node of accessibility. Differential accessibility by car and public transport is analysed, focusing on the city-region's most important functional centre (i.e. CBD). The results show that the CBD is within 15 min and nearly 30 min reach by car and public transport respectively, for only 1% of the city-region's built-up area. This implies that overall accessibility is poor regardless of mode choice, due to congestion. The findings underscore the need for integrative urban development and accessibility planning in the city-region for equitable transport and mobility outcomes.

TI  - Human trafficking, information campaigns and public awareness in Moldova: Why do anti-trafficking organizations operate under inaccurate assumptions?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The assumption that the rural public lacks sufficient knowledge about human trafficking and that providing more awareness will reduce it still dominates the anti-trafficking field. However, relying on original empirical data from Moldova, I found that rural people are more informed about this problem than other surveyed groups. First, they became more knowledgeable about trafficking precisely because of organizations' targeting strategies. Second, they are more incentivized to learn about this problem because it happens in proximity, and the information spreads easier in rural places. This paper challenges the organizational assumptions in Moldova, relying on Grunig and Miller's theory on organizations with an asymmetrical worldview. I argue that anti-trafficking institutions' asymmetry leads to inaccurate assumptions and eventually can lead to flawed anti-trafficking policies.

TI  - Performance analysis of regional AquaCrop (v6.1) biomass and surface soil moisture simulations using satellite and in situ observations
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The current intensive use of agricultural land is affecting the land quality and contributes to climate change. Feeding the world's growing population under changing climatic conditions demands a global transition to more sustainable agricultural systems. This requires efficient models and data to monitor land cultivation practices at the field to global scale.This study outlines a spatially distributed version of the field-scale crop model AquaCrop version 6.1 to simulate agricultural biomass production and soil moisture variability over Europe at a relatively fine resolution of 30 arcsec (similar to 1 km). A highly efficient parallel processing system is implemented to run the model regionally with global meteorological input data from the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2), soil textural information from the Harmonized World Soil Database version 1.2 (HWSDv1.2), and generic crop information. The setup with a generic crop is chosen as a baseline for a future satellite-based data assimilation system. The relative temporal variability in daily crop biomass production is evaluated with the Copernicus Global Land Service dry matter productivity (CGLS-DMP) data. Surface soil moisture is compared against NASA Soil Moisture Active-Passive surface soil moisture (SMAP-SSM) retrievals, the Copernicus Global Land Service surface soil moisture (CGLS-SSM) product derived from Sentinel-1, and in situ data from the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN). Over central Europe, the regional AquaCrop model is able to capture the temporal variability in both biomass production and soil moisture, with a spatial mean temporal correlation of 0.8 (CGLS-DMP), 0.74 (SMAP-SSM), and 0.52 (CGLS-SSM). The higher performance when evaluating with SMAP-SSM compared to Sentinel-1 CGLS-SSM is largely due to the lower quality of CGLS-SSM satellite retrievals under growing vegetation. The regional model further captures the short-term and inter-annual variability, with a mean anomaly correlation of 0.46 for daily biomass and mean anomaly correlations of 0.65 (SMAP-SSM) and 0.50 (CGLS-SSM) for soil moisture. It is shown that soil textural characteristics and irrigated areas influence the model performance. Overall, the regional AquaCrop model adequately simulates crop production and soil moisture and provides a suitable setup for subsequent satellite-based data assimilation.

TI  - Enhanced chlorophyll-<i>a</i> concentration in the wake of Sable Island, eastern Canada, revealed by two decades of satellite observations: a response to grey seal population dynamics?
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Elevated surface chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration ([chl-a]), an index of phytoplankton biomass, has been previously observed and documented by remote sensing in the waters to the southwest of Sable Island (SI) on the Scotian Shelf in eastern Canada. Here, we present an analysis of this phenomenon using a 21-year time series of satellite-derived [chl-a], paired with information on the particle backscattering coefficient at 443 nm (b(bp)(443), a proxy for particle suspension) and the detritus/gelbstoff absorption coefficient at 443 nm (a(dg)(443), a proxy to differentiate water masses and presence of dissolved organic matter) in an attempt to explain some possible mechanisms that lead to the increase in surface biomass in the surroundings of SI. We compared the seasonal cycle, 8 d climatology and seasonal trends of surface waters near SI to two control regions located both upstream and downstream of the island, away from terrigenous inputs. Application of the self-organising map (SOM) approach to the time series of satellite-derived [chl-a] over the Scotian Shelf revealed the annual spatio-temporal patterns around SI and, in particular, persistently high phytoplankton biomass during winter and spring in the leeward side of SI, a phenomenon that was not observed in the control boxes. In the vicinity of SI, a significant increase in [chl-a] and a(dg)(443) during the winter months occurred at a rate twice that of the ones observed in the control boxes, while no significant trends were found for the other seasons. In addition to the increase in [chl-a] and a(dg)(443) within the plume southwest of SI, the surface area of the plume itself expanded by a factor of 5 over the last 21 years. While the island mass effect (IME) explained the enhanced biomass around SI, we hypothesised that the large increase in [chl-a] over the last 21 years was partly due to an injection of nutrients by the island's grey seal colony, which has increased by 200 % during the same period. This contribution of nutrients from seals may sustain high phytoplankton biomass at a time of year when it is usually low following the fall bloom. A conceptual model was developed to estimate the standing stock of chl-a that can be sustained by the release of nitrogen (N) by seals. Comparison between satellite observations and model simulations showed a good temporal agreement between the increased abundance of seal on SI during the breeding season and the phytoplankton biomass increase during the winter. We found that about 20 % of chl-a standing stock increase over the last 21 years could be due to seal N fertilisation, the remaining being explained by climate forcing and oceanographic processes. Although without in situ measurements for ground truthing, the satellite data analysis provided evidence of the impact of marine mammals on lower trophic levels through a fertilisation mechanism that is coupled with the IME with potential implications for conservation and fisheries.

TI  - Land cover transitions and effects of transhumance on available forage biomass of rangelands in Benin
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examined the effects of transhumance pressure on total abavoe-ground biomass and forage availability on rangelands in Benin. We also investigated the implications of land cover transitions on rangelands over a 31-year period. Our work was carried out in three regions of Benin representing distinct phytogeographic regimes: Ketou, Tchaourou, and Sinende. Ground-truthing and biomass sampling of the herbaceous and phanaerophyte strata were carried out between the 2016 peak vegetation period and the onset of the 2017 rainy season. Herbaceous biomass was determined by destructive sampling, and biomass of shrub and trees was estimated using non-destructive sampling and allometric equations. Historical and present-day Landsat data allowed an analysis of land cover change for the 1986-2002 and 2002-2017 periods. Land cover analyses yielded evidence of significant expansion of agricultural areas, especially in the latter period. The data also revealed progressive landscape fragmentation and transformations to a land cover of reduced total phytomass. There were no long-term effects of transhumance on trees, but likely on herbaceous biomass. Land cover changes in the study regions seem primarily the result of population pressure, infrastructural changes, persisting norms, and traditions regarding environmental management and the increasing popularity of livestock keeping as an insurance strategy. Rangeland transformations had negative impacts on transhumant herds' mobility and forage availability. As rangeland stability and consent between agricultural and pastoral land users are at a tipping point, informed policies, and land use planning that foster compromises among all stakeholders are needed.

TI  - Nutritional Regulation of Hepatic FGF21 by Dietary Restriction of Methionine
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENDOCRINOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - FGF21 is a potent metabolic regulator of energy balance, body composition, lipid metabolism, and glucose homeostasis. Initial studies reported that it was increased by fasting and the associated increase in ketones, but more recent work points to the importance of dietary protein and sensing of essential amino acids in FGF21 regulation. For example, dietary restriction of methionine produces a rapid transcriptional activation of hepatic FGF21 that results in a persistent 5- to 10-fold increase in serum FGF21. Although FGF21 is a component of a complex transcriptional program activated by methionine restriction (MR), loss-of-function studies show that FGF21 is an essential mediator of the resulting effects of the MR diet on energy balance, remodeling of adipose tissue, and enhancement of insulin sensitivity. These studies also show that FGF21 signaling in the brain is required for the MR diet-induced increase in energy expenditure (EE) and reduction of adiposity. Collectively, the evidence supports the view that the liver functions as a sentinel to detect and respond to changes in dietary amino acid composition, and that the resulting mobilization of hepatic FGF21 is a key element of the homeostatic response. These findings raise the interesting possibility that therapeutic diets could be developed that produce sustained, biologically effective increases in FGF21 by nutritionally modulating its transcription and release.

TI  - Climate Change in the Hydrometeorological Parameters of the Black and Azov Seas (1980-2020)
T2  - OCEANOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To study the nature of climate change in the hydrometeorological parameters of the Black and Azov Seas-surface air temperature (SAT), sea surface temperature (SST), ice cover, and sea level-under conditions of ongoing global warming, we used reanalyses and remote sensing data, as well as information from known publications of recent years. It was found that against an increase in SAT over the Black-Azov Sea region (+0.053 degrees C/year in 1980-2020) and SST of the Black Sea (+0.052 degrees C/year in 1982-2020), the values of these parameters in the 2000s differ significantly from those in the 1980s-1990s: the maximum average monthly summer and minimum average monthly winter temperatures have increased, as well as the number of mild winters. The average annual SST of the Black Sea, which practically did not exceed 15 degrees C in the 1980s-early 1990s, has exceeded 16 degrees C in most cases since 2010 (maximum 16.71 degrees C in 2018). In the 2010s, the average monthly winter minima, with the exception of the winters of 2011/2012 and 2016/2017, did not fall below 8 degrees C. A consequence of the increase in winter temperatures was a decrease in the ice concentration in the Sea of Azov (the trend of the mean monthly concentration is -1.2%/10 years). From about 2004-2010 in the Black Sea and since 2004 in the Sea of Azov, the tendency towards increase in their levels (on average) has been replaced by a slight decrease, so that the average positive trends for the period 1993-2020 (+0.32 +/- 0.16 cm/year in the Black Sea and +0.21 +/- 0.05 cm/year in the Sea of Azov) were approximately 2.5 times less than in 1993-2012. The reason for this decrease in levels (on average) in the last 10-15 years was apparently a decrease in the incoming part of the freshwater balance of both seas, which is indirectly confirmed by the observed increase in salinity of their waters.

TI  - Systematic review and <i>meta</i>-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing elective neck dissection versus sentinel lymph node biopsy in early-stage clinically node-negative oral and/or oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma: Evidence-base for practice and implications for research
T2  - ORAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose: Management of clinically node-negative (N0) neck in early-stage (T1-T2) oral and/or oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OOSCC) has been controversial. The purpose of this systematic review and meta analysis was to compare sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) with elective neck dissection (END) in early-stage OOSCC.Methods: Studies comparing SLNB versus END in early-stage clinically node-negative OOSCC were identified using validated search strategy. To be considered eligible, trials had to include patients with early-stage, clinically node-negative OOSCC who had been randomly assigned to either SLNB or END. Primary outcome of interest was overall survival (OS), while secondary outcomes included isolated neck nodal recurrence (NNR), loco regional recurrence (LRR), and neck-shoulder function. Outcome data was pooled using random-effects model and reported as hazard ratio (HR) or risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Any p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.Results: A total of 608 patients from three trials comparing SLNB versus END in early-stage clinically node-negative OOSCC were included. The pooled HR of death for SLNB versus END was 1.18 (95% CI: 0.79-1.78, p = 0.41) which was not statistically significant. The rates of isolated NNR (pooled RR = 1.11, 95% CI: 0.69-1.80, p = 0.66) and LRR (pooled RR = 1.18, 95% CI: 0.81-1.72, p = 0.39) were also similar. Pooled analysis of the neck-shoulder function significantly favoured SLNB arm (pooled RR = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.12-1.32, p < 0.00001).Conclusion: There is low-certainty evidence that SLNB is oncologically non-inferior to END and is associated with potentially lesser functional morbidity making it an emerging alternative standard of care in patients with early stage clinically node-negative OOSCC.

TI  - TROPOMI tropospheric ozone column data: geophysical assessment and comparison to ozonesondes, GOME-2B and OMI
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Ozone in the troposphere affects humans and ecosystems as a pollutant and as a greenhouse gas. Observing, understanding and modelling this dual role, as well as monitoring effects of international regulations on air quality and climate change, however, challenge measurement systems to operate at opposite ends of the spatio-temporal scale ladder. Aboard the ESA/EU Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) satellite launched in October 2017, the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) aspires to take the next leap forward by measuring ozone and its precursors at unprecedented horizontal resolution until at least the mid-2020s. In this work, we assess the quality of TROPOMI's first release (V01.01.05-08) of tropical tropospheric ozone column (TrOC) data. Derived with the convective cloud differential (CCD) method, TROPOMI daily TrOC data represent the 3 d moving mean ozone column between the surface and 270 hPa under clear-sky conditions gridded at 0.5 degrees latitude by 1 degrees longitude resolution. Comparisons to almost 2 years of co-located SHADOZ ozonesonde and satellite data (Aura OMI and MetOp-B GOME-2) conclude to TROPOMI biases between -0.1 and +2.3 DU (< +13 %) when averaged over the tropical belt. The field of the bias is essentially uniform in space (deviations < 1 DU) and stable in time at the 1.5-2.5 DU level. However, the record is still fairly short, and continued monitoring will be key to clarify whether observed patterns and stability persist, alter behaviour or disappear. Biases are partially due to TROPOMI and the reference data records themselves, but they can also be linked to systematic effects of the nonperfect co-locations. Random uncertainty due to co-location mismatch contributes considerably to the 2.6 11.6 DU (similar to 14 %-23 %) statistical dispersion observed in the difference time series. We circumvent part of this problem by employing the triple co-location analysis technique and infer that TROPOMI single-measurement precision is better than 1.5-2.5 DU (similar to 8 %-13 %), in line with uncertainty estimates reported in the data files. Hence, the TROPOMI precision is judged to be 20 %-25 % better than for its predecessors OMI and GOME-2B, while sampling at 4 times better spatial resolution and almost 2 times better temporal resolution. Using TROPOMI tropospheric ozone columns at maximal resolution nevertheless requires consideration of correlated errors at small scales of up to 5 DU due to the inevitable interplay of satellite orbit and cloud coverage. Two particular types of sampling error are investigated, and we suggest how these can be identified or remedied. Our study confirms that major known geophysical patterns and signals of the tropical tropospheric ozone field are imprinted in TROPOMI's 2-year data record. These include the permanent zonal wave-one pattern, the pervasive annual and semiannual cycles, the high levels of ozone due to biomass burning around the Atlantic basin, and enhanced convective activity cycles associated with the Madden-Julian Oscillation over the IndoPacific warm pool. TROPOMI's combination of higher precision and higher resolution reveals details of these patterns and the processes involved, at considerably smaller spatial and temporal scales and with more complete coverage than contemporary satellite sounders.If the accuracy of future TROPOMI data proves to remain stable with time, these hold great potential to be included in Climate Data Records, as well as serve as a travelling standard to interconnect the upcoming constellation of air quality satellites in geostationary and low Earth orbits.

TI  - GNSS-GPS derived integrated water vapor and performance assessment of ERA-5 data over India
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Integrated Water Vapor (IWV) is an important parameter that influences a wide variety of atmospheric processes such as the earth's radiation budget, cloud formation, and the hydrological cycle. IWV derived from 18 GNSSbased GPS locations in India at hourly intervals for a period of one year are analyzed for diurnal, seasonal, and spatial variability. Diurnal variation in IWV anomaly range from -0.25 - 0.3 cm with a peak in the afternoon hours and has seasonal dependence at the majority of the stations. Seasonal variation of IWV suggests a maximum in summer monsoon in the range 3.88-6.29 cm and a minimum in winter in the range 0.94-3.76 cm. This is due to the transport of the high amount of moisture from the Arabian Sea during the summer monsoon, and in winter low temperature (low wind speeds) inhibits the moisture convection (advection). IWV displays significant spatial variability at inter-and intra-seasonal timescales. Evaluation of ECMWF reanalysis (ERA5) IWV using GPS IWV, carried out first time over India using hourly comparison data sets, reveals a high correlation coefficient within the range 0.93-0.99, indicating its ability to capture the variation in IWV very well. RMSE is observed to be in the range 0.21-0.38 cm and mean RMSE is observed to be 0.28 +/- 0.04 cm. Bias (GPS IWV - ERA-5 IWV) is observed to be in the range -0.49 to 0.24 cm, and the mean bias is observed to be - 0.15 +/- 0.21 cm. GPS IWV registers a sharp rise before the rainfall event and indicates a strong correlation between them. Evaluation of ERA-5 IWV data suggests its great application prospects in the tropical Indian region, including its use in the improvement of rainfall prediction in the absence of a dense GPS network.

TI  - Hydrological Analysis Using Observed and Satellite-Based Estimates: Case Study of a Lake Catchment in Raipur, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rainfall plays an essential role in different water management sectors ranging from industries, farming, livestock, and domestic utilization both in rural and urban areas. The surface water bodies like rivers, lakes, ponds, and reservoirs hold a huge proportion of the rainfall. However, due to spatio-temporal variability of rainfall and limited availability of meteorological stations, accurate estimation of the hydrological components such as surface runoff, evaporation, and baseflow is a challenging task. In this study, we have used hydrological information, Soil Conservation Service Curve Number method to develop an empirical relationship between rainfall and runoff in the Telibandha Lake Catchment (TLC), situated in Raipur district of Chhattisgarh, central India. Further, we have used Landsat derived remote sensing product, Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) to understand its temporal variation of water spread in the TLC over the fifteen years (2001-2015). The water spread areas are assessed by using the mean monthly NDWI data set and analyzing its seasonal and annual patterns. It is found that Telibandha Lake has a maximum depth of 2.9 m and its surface area is 0.12 km(2). Apart from that, the annual runoff is around 232.28 mm, which accounts for almost 22% of the estimated rainfall. The monthly runoff coefficient varies from 0 to 0.25 in TLC. Both the temporal and spatial NDWI plots show that July-September months have high NDWI values in the TLC. The seasonal NDWI showed a good relationship with mean monthly rainfall data and depicts r(2) = 0.78. The findings from this study helps in determining the temporal changes of water spread within the TLC and supports in understanding the lake characteristics.

TI  - An autonomous buoy system for observing spring freshet plumes under landfast sea ice
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS
M3  - Article
AB  - An ice buoy system was developed to measure oceanographic properties of freshwater plumes that occur in Arctic coastal oceans under landfast sea ice during the spring freshet. By implanting such systems into sea ice weeks or months in advance of the freshet event, sensors can be located immediately underneath the sea ice layer in situ at depths that riverine freshwater will occupy later when the freshet arrives. This observing approach is modular, can accommodate a wide range of sensors, is designed intentionally for use in remote regions, and can be readily deployed in any nearshore region that can be accessed by snowmachine. The buoy system incorporates an integral floatation collar that allows it to continue sampling as the coastal ocean becomes progressively ice free in the months after the freshet event. Automated sampling and telemetry via a satellite data network provide near-real-time observations of the timing and character of under-ice freshet plumes. An assessment study was done with an array of these ice buoy systems, outfitted with basic hydrographic and optical sensors and deployed in advance of the 2018 and 2019 freshets in landfast sea ice near the mouths of three coastal rivers in Stefansson Sound, Alaska.

TI  - The Impact of Genomic Profiling on Adjuvant Therapy Recommendation in Postmenopausal Women with ER-Positive, T1-2 Breast Cancer: Can Genomic Profiling Eliminate the Need for Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy?
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) guides recommendations for chemotherapy but increases surgical risk. We found that for postmenopausal early-stage, estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer, SLNB changed the decision to recommend/consider chemotherapy in 4.8% of patients when a genomic assay was used to guide chemotherapy for N0-N1 disease. Physicians should use these data to inform decisions about selective omission of SLNB.Introduction: With the advent of genomic assays, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) may be less impactful in determining adjuvant breast cancer therapy. We evaluated the influence of SLNB on adjuvant therapy recommendation when the Oncotype DX recurrence score (RS) is known. Methods: We reviewed postmenopausal women with ERpositive/HER2-negative, pT1-2 breast cancers with non-suspicious axillary ultrasound treated with SLNB at the time of cancer resection, from 2011 to 2015. For each case, the recommended adjuvant therapy based on the actual SLNB was compared with recommendations if SLNB had been omitted (presumed negative). Results: Surgical nodal status was N0 in 184 patients (84.8%), Nmi-N1 in 29 patients (13.4%), and N2-3 in 4 patients (1.8%). SLNB resulted in a recommendation for axillary lymph node dissection in 4.1% (n = 9). Axillary surgery resulted in a change in radiation recommendation (nodal radiation considered or recommended) in 15.2% (n = 33). Of the 147 patients with known RS, 95 patients had RS > 18, 29 had RS 18-25, and 23 had RS < 25. When chemotherapy was only recommended for RS > 25, or N2-3 disease, SLNB changed the recommendation to have chemotherapy in one patient (0.7%), and the recommendation of which chemotherapy regimen (second- vs. third-generation) in an additional 5 patients. Conclusion: SLNB changed the recommendation for/against chemotherapy, or the chemotherapy regiment recommended, in 4.8% of postmenopausal women with early-stage, ER-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer, and sonographically negative axilla when using RS > 25 or N2-3 disease as an indication for chemotherapy. Preoperative genomic profiling can guide de-escalation of axillary surgery. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Seasonal and interannual variations of MODIS Aqua chlorophyll-<i>a</i> (2003-2017) in the Upper Gulf of Thailand influenced by Asian monsoons
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal and interannual variations of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) in the upper Gulf of Thailand (uGoT) were obtained using new regionally tuned algorithms applied to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-Aqua. This long time-series (2003-2017) data were analyzed in the context of variations in environmental conditions associated with the Southeast Asian Monsoon. Chl-a distribution patterns were distinct for the non-monsoon (NOM), southwest-monsoon (SWM), and northeast-monsoon (NEM) seasons. During the SWM/NEM, high/low chl-a concentrations were associated with high/low precipitation and river discharge. During the NOM chl-a concentrations were generally low, because of low precipitation. In general, chl-a variability was tightly coupled to discharge from the Chao Phraya and Tha Chin rivers. Chl-a concentrations were generally higher in the north, but chl-a accumulation in the east/west of the uGoT could be linked to piling of freshwater to the east/west during the SWM/NEM caused by changes in wind direction and the reversal of currents. Interannual changes in chl-a were attributed to El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) rather than Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) driven changes in precipitation, river discharge, and wind patterns. During the SWM, positive/negative chl-a anomalies coincided with high/low precipitation and river discharge during La Nina/El Nino. During the NEM, positive/negative chl-a anomaly coincided with high/low river discharge and strong/weak wind during La Nina/El Nino. Meanwhile, during NOM, positive chl-a anomaly could be attributed to anomalous high wind speed and precipitation during El Nino.

TI  - Surgical and radiotherapy patterns of care in the management of breast cancer in NSW and ACT Australia
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL IMAGING AND RADIATION ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction This study aims to report on the surgical and radiotherapy patterns of breast cancer care in New South Wales (NSW) and Australian Capital Territory (ACT) in Australia, to identify factors that impact on utilisation of evidence-based treatment and to report on the overall survival (OS) rate and the influencing factors on OS. Methods Cancer registry data linked to hospital records for all patients with breast cancer diagnosis in NSW and ACT between 2009 and 2014 were used to calculate rates of breast conserving surgery (BCS), mastectomy, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) and radiotherapy. Multivariate analysis used to identify factors that led to variations in care. 5-year OS was calculated and cox regression model assessed factors that influenced survival. Results Data for 30,337 patients were analysed. BCS and mastectomy rates were 64% and 36%, respectively. The SLNB, ALND and ALND after SLNB rates were 61.5%, 32.1% and 6.4%, respectively. Radiotherapy was utilised in 63%. Younger age, socio-economic disadvantage, longer distance to a radiotherapy facility and overseas place of birth were factors that predicted for increased rates of mastectomy and ALND. Radiotherapy was more likely to be utilised in later years of diagnosis, patients between 40-69 years old, and those who lived in major cities and closer to a radiotherapy facility. 5-year OS was 80.5%. Older patients, the socioeconomically disadvantaged and those advanced tumours had worse survival. Conclusion Variations in breast cancer care continue to exist in certain patient groups that we identified. Targeted strategic planning and further research to identify other drivers of existing disparities remain a priority.

TI  - Assessment of the ParFlow-CLM CONUS 1.0 integrated hydrologic model: evaluation of hyper-resolution water balance components across the contiguous United States
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent advancements in computational efficiency and Earth system modeling have awarded hydrologists with increasingly high-resolution models of terrestrial hydrology, which are paramount to understanding and predicting complex fluxes of moisture and energy. Continental-scale hydrologic simulations are, in particular, of interest to the hydrologic community for numerous societal, scientific, and operational benefits. The coupled hydrology-land surface model ParFlow-CLM configured over the continental United States (PFCONUS) has been employed in previous literature to study scale-dependent connections between water table depth, topography, recharge, and evapotranspiration, as well as to explore impacts of anthropogenic aquifer depletion to the water and energy balance. These studies have allowed for an unprecedented process-based understanding of the continental water cycle at high resolution. Here, we provide the most comprehensive evaluation of PFCONUS version 1.0 (PFCONUSv1) performance to date by comparing numerous modeled water balance components with thousands of in situ observations and several remote sensing products and using a range of statistical performance metrics for evaluation. PFCONUSv1 comparisons with these datasets are a promising indicator of model fidelity and ability to reproduce the continental-scale water balance at high resolution. Areas for improvement are identified, such as a positive streamflow bias at gauges in the eastern Great Plains, a shallow water table bias over many areas of the model domain, and low bias in seasonal total water storage amplitude, especially for the Ohio, Missouri, and Arkansas River basins. We discuss several potential sources for model bias and suggest that minimizing error in topographic processing and meteorological forcing would considerably improve model performance. Results here provide a benchmark and guidance for further PFCONUS model development, and they highlight the importance of concurrently evaluating all hydrologic components and fluxes to provide a multivariate, holistic validation of the complete modeled water balance.

TI  - Rates and predictors of child maltreatment re-perpetration against new victims and prior victims
T2  - CHILD ABUSE & NEGLECT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Limited prior research has examined the rates or predictors of re-perpetration of child maltreatment. Yet, perpetrators may have multiple victims, and perpetrators, rather than their victims, are often the primary focus of child welfare services. Objective: We examine rates of child maltreatment re-perpetration of repeat and new victims, and test perpetrator demographics and maltreatment index incident case characteristics as predictors of re-perpetration. Participants and setting: We use a sample of 285,245 first-time perpetrators of a substantiated maltreatment incident in 2010 from the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System. Methods: We use linear probability models with full information maximum likelihood to test new victim and same victim perpetration by the end of FY 2018. Results: Fifteen percent of perpetrators re-maltreated one or more of their original victims ("same victim re-perpetration"); 12% maltreated a new victim. Overall, re-perpetration was more com-mon among younger, female, and White perpetrators. Perpetrators who were the biological or adoptive parent of their initial victim(s) had higher rates of same victim re-perpetration; new victim re-perpetration was more common among perpetrators who initially victimized an adop-tive or stepchild. Same victim re-perpetration was less common among perpetrators of physical abuse than other types of maltreatment, and new victim re-perpetration was more common among perpetrators of sexual abuse and neglect than physical abuse. Conclusions: Child welfare agencies should track re-perpetration in addition to revictimization as part of agency evaluations and risk assessments.

TI  - Arctic sea surface height maps from multi-altimeter combination
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a new Arctic sea level anomaly dataset based on the combination of three altimeter missions using an optimal interpolation scheme. Measurements from SARAL/AltiKa, CryoSat-2 and Sentinel-3A are blended together, providing an unprecedented resolution for this type of product. Such high-resolution products are necessary to tackle some contemporaneous science questions in the basin. We use the adaptive retracker to process both open ocean and lead echoes on SARAL/AltiKa, thus removing the need to estimate a bias between open ocean and ice-covered areas. The usual processing approach, involving an empirical retracking algorithm on specular echoes, is applied on CryoSat-2 and Sentinel-3A synthetic aperture radar (SAR) mode echoes. SARAL/AltiKa also provides the baseline for the cross-calibration of CryoSat-2 and Sentinel-3A data. The final gridded fields cover all latitudes north of 50 degrees N, on a 25 km EASE2 grid, with one grid every 3 d over 3 years from July 2016 to April 2019. When compared to tide gauge measurements available in the Arctic Ocean, the combined product exhibits a much better performance than mono-mission datasets with a mean correlation of 0.78 and a mean root-mean-square deviation (RMSd) of 5 cm. The effective temporal resolution of the combined product is 3 times better than a single mission analysis. This dataset can be downloaded from https://doi.org/10.24400/527896/a01-2020.001 (Prandi, 2020).

TI  - Using remote sensing to forecast forage quality for cattle in the dry savannas of northeast Australia
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the dry savannas of northeast Australia, forage quality is just as important for cattle production as forage quantity. The seasonal trend of forage quality is broadly predictable by land managers, but it is more difficult to predict the point when quality-which depends on local climate, management, and pasture condition-falls below the requirement for animal maintenance. In this study we use statistical modelling to forecast how forage quality might change at the crucial time of year, i.e., as the summer wet season transitions to the dry winter. We do this with the aid of historical information associated with a long-term cattle-grazing trial in the dry savannas. We combined multiple years of two measures of forage quality (dietary crude protein and in vivo dry-matter digestibility; respectively DCP and DMD) and ground cover information (specifically the ratio of 'green grass' cover to 'dead (i.e., non-photosynthetic) grass' cover, derived from an archive of Landsat satellite imagery) into a linear mixed model that explicitly considered the correlations with time and between variables. DCP and DMD were estimated by near-infrared spectroscopy of fresh faecal samples; values did not have to be temporally coincident with the satellite imagery. With the end of May considered a nominal decision-point, we forecast monthly averages of forage quality for June to August, over a 12-year period at the study site. Over all months and all years, the median absolute error of the forecasts was DCP = 0.86%, and DMD = 0.95%. The remote sensing information served as a correlated, oft-sampled covariate that helped to guide the forecasts of forage quality. We propose summarising the forecasts (and their uncertainty) as a near-real-time graphical tool for decision-support. Such a product could potentially benefit cattle-grazing enterprises in the northeast of Australia, enabling more timely management of herds through the dry season.

TI  - Spatial variability in the community structure of microphytoplankton along the southeastern Arabian sea during an unusually warm winter monsoon season
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The microphytoplankton community structure and composition were investigated along the South Eastern Arabian Sea (SEAS) during the late winter monsoon season (January 2020). A total of 186 species of phytoplankton were identified, with cyanobacteria Trichodesmium erythraeum (72%) being the most dominant, followed by diatoms (11%) and dinoflagellates (2.7%). Major blooms of T. erythraeum were observed towards the southern region of SEAS characterised by high SST (28.75 +/- 0.7 degrees C), high surface salinity (34.6 +/- 1.2 psu) and low wind speed (similar to 3.6 m s-1). The T. erythraeum bloom areas generally observed high nitrate and low silicate and phosphate concentrations with high chlorophyll a concentration (8.96 +/- 2.92 mg m-3). In non-bloom regions, centric diatoms like Chaetoceros spp., Bacteriastrum spp. and Leptocylindrus sp. dominated. The abundance of diatoms observed a decreasing trend towards the southern extend of SEAS. The remote sensing data derived for the area observed sea surface temperatures are about 1.0 degrees C higher than the climatological mean of January. The higher temperatures (29 degrees C-32 degrees C) are clearly visible in the Indian coastal region from Kanyakumari to the Gujarat coast, suggesting unusual warming in the eastern coast of the Arabian Sea in January 2020. This warming which was more prominent towards the southern extend of SEAS, might have augmented the proliferation of T. erythraeum along the surface waters of SEAS. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Morphometric characterization of sub-basins in a hard-rock aquifer system of Maharashtra, India, using geospatial and geostatistical tools
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The presence of groundwater in the Deccan Traps of Maharashtra is governed by the heterogeneities in the basaltic flow morphology, weathered thickness, and morphological features. The rapid growth of population has led to a rise in water demand vis-a-vis severe water scarcity, especially in drought-prone regions. An attempt has been made to locate the areas that are favorable for groundwater recharge by analyzing various morphometric indices for nine sub-basins of Mann River basin in south-eastern Maharashtra, derived using satellite data and geographical information system (GIS). Eleven influential morphometric parameters are considered to prioritize these sub-basins performing the weighted sum analysis (WSA) technique, wherein weights are assigned to individual morphometric parameters based on their importance. The analysis reveals that out of nine sub-basins, sub-basin 6 (SB-6) with suitability index value 2.8 is most favorable whereas, SB-1 with index value 7.48 is least suitable due to its high undulation, greater runoff, poor vegetation cover, and steeper slopes. Furthermore, these sub-basins have been categorized into five classes of groundwater recharge on the basis of prioritization index values. These suggest that 42% of the area spread over sub-basins is of very good to good priority type. Subsequently, principal component analysis (PCA) has been performed to identify the most influencing morphometric parameters for groundwater recharge in basaltic aquifers. The PCA results show that the first principal component (PC1) accounting for 37.44 has preferred the relief ratio, basin relief, and ruggedness number showcasing the relief aspect of morphometry dominates the groundwater recharge process. Principal component PC2 accounts for 29.74 of total variation with stream frequency and drainage density parameters that are inversely related to groundwater recharge. The third principal component PC3 holds account for 26.31 that is strongly loaded with form factor, elongation ratio, and circularity ratio revealing the significance of the shape of the watershed in generating the surface runoff and increasing the amplitude of hydrograph. Thus, it is suggested to adopt conservation measures in high priority areas, like rainwater harvesting, aquifer recharge, and resource management for effective land and water management.

TI  - Satellite radar interferometry: Potential and limitations for structural assessment and monitoring
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The present paper analyzes potential and limitations of multi-temporal Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (DInSAR) techniques applied for the structural monitoring and assessment of constructions affected by different external actions. A comprehensive approach for the processing, interpretation and proper use of satellite radar interferometry data for structural analyses at urban and single-construction scales is proposed. Following a brief literature review, highlighting the most relevant applications in this field, some aspects concerning DInSAR techniques are shortly summarized, particularly focusing on the Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) approach applied to perform advanced analyses at structural level. Then, the main issues of the DInSAR measurements exploitation for structural applications are discussed, focusing on the use of both one or two datasets relevant to ascending and descending satellite passes. Analysis at the scale of single construction (i.e., building, bridge, etc.) of displacements time series and mean deformation velocities is discussed, in order to identify scenarios that may become potentially critical for the structures. Some application examples are provided, employing COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) datasets relative to the urban area of Rome (Italy), acquired during the 2011-2019 time interval and processed through the SBAS algorithm. Specific considerations related to the use of DInSAR measurements for structural monitoring and assessment are then proposed, also discussing possible approaches for preliminary and detailed evaluation of structural damages.

TI  - Deep chlorophyll maximum and nutricline in the Mediterranean Sea: emerging properties from a multi-platform assimilated biogeochemical model experiment
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Data assimilation has led to advancements in biogeochemical modelling and scientific understanding of the ocean. The recent operational availability of data from BGC-Argo (biogeochemical Argo) floats, which provide valuable insights into key vertical biogeochemical processes, stands to further improve biogeochemical modelling through assimilation schemes that include float observations in addition to traditionally assimilated satellite data. In the present work, we demonstrate the feasibility of joint multi-platform assimilation in realistic biogeochemical applications by presenting the results of 1-year simulations of Mediterranean Sea biogeochemistry. Different combinations of satellite chlorophyll data and BGC-Argo nitrate and chlorophyll data have been tested, and validation with respect to available independent non-assimilated and assimilated (before the assimilation) observations showed that assimilation of both satellite and float observations outperformed the assimilation of platforms considered individually. Moreover, the assimilation of BGC-Argo data impacted the vertical structure of nutrients and phytoplankton in terms of deep chlorophyll maximum depth, intensity, and nutricline depth. The outcomes of the model simulation assimilating both satellite data and BGC-Argo data provide a consistent picture of the basin-wide differences in vertical features associated with summer stratified conditions, describing a relatively high variability between the western and eastern Mediterranean, with thinner and shallower but intense deep chlorophyll maxima associated with steeper and narrower nutriclines in the western Mediterranean.

TI  - Dynamic monitoring of urban built-up object expansion trajectories in Karachi, Pakistan with time series images and the LandTrendr algorithm
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the complex process of urbanization, retrieving its dynamic expansion trajectories with an efficient method is challenging, especially for urban regions that are not clearly distinguished from the surroundings in arid regions. In this study, we propose a framework for extracting spatiotemporal change information on urban disturbances. First, the urban built-up object areas in 2000 and 2020 were obtained using object-oriented segmentation method. Second, we applied LandTrendr (LT) algorithm and multiple bands/indices to extract annual spatiotemporal information. This process was implemented effectively with the support of the cloud computing platform of Earth Observation big data. The overall accuracy of time information extraction, the kappa coefficient, and average detection error were 83.76%, 0.79, and 0.57 a, respectively. These results show that Karachi expanded continuously during 2000-2020, with an average annual growth rate of 4.7%. However, this expansion was not spatiotemporally balanced. The coastal area developed quickly within a shorter duration, whereas the main newly added urban regions locate in the northern and eastern inland areas. This study demonstrated an effective framework for extract the dynamic spatiotemporal change information of urban built-up objects and substantially eliminate the salt-and-pepper effect based on pixel detection. Methods used in our study are of general promotion significance in the monitoring of other disturbances caused by natural or human activities.

TI  - How can urban parks be planned to mitigate urban heat island effect in "Furnace cities" ? An accumulation perspective
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban parks are a major blue-green infrastructure in urban ecosystems, and they are widely regarded as being extremely effective in mitigating the urban heat island (UHI) effect caused by extensive urbanization and high temperatures associated with climate change. A scientific understanding of the cooling effects of urban parks can assist urban planning and decision makers in mitigating the UHI effect and improving urban sustainability. However, little is known about the cooling effects of parks from an accumulation-impact perspective resulting from spatial continuity. In this study, 31 urban parks in Fuzhou, China, were identified using Landsat data, and the land surface temperature was calculated using the radiative transfer equation (RTE) algorithm. Two accumulation-impact cooling indices, the park cooling intensity (PCI) and the park cooling gradient (PCG), and two maximum-impact cooling indices, the park cooling area (PCA) and the park cooling efficiency (PCE), were then used to explore the park cooling effects. The park area and park perimeter were found to be positively and significantly correlated with the PCA, PCI, and PCG and negatively and significantly correlated with the PCE. The results showed that 61% of urban park areas were situated within "cold-spot areas" with respect to the land surface temperature. A ward system cluster analysis showed that the 31 urban parks could be classified into three cooling capacity bundles based on the four normalized park cooling indices, each of which exhibited different cooling effects. The concept of the threshold value of efficiency (TVoE) based on the park cooling gradient was then calculated to determine the optimal park size. The TVoE was determined as 1.08 ha, which implies that urban park planning should consider designing urban parks of this size because they provide the most effective improvement in urban thermal comfort. These findings are valuable for providing a comprehensive understanding of the cooling effects of urban parks and providing implications for sustainable urban planning and design.

TI  - Discrimination Is Not Just Black and White in Romantic Relationships: A Consideration of Perspective Taking and Self-Expansion
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Interracial relationships can satisfy our human need for interpersonal bonds, but face adversity due to racial discrimination. This adversity is not parallel for the involved partners, however, in ways that have implications for relationship outcomes. As such, in the current research, we considered that discrimination may provide an avenue for positive self-expansion for a White partner, insofar as they use it to learn more about their partner's worldview and experience. This is important, as facing racial discrimination could be a reason White partners think about ending their relationship. Thus, identifying processes that mitigate adversity for the White partner could bolster relationship outcomes for both partners and enhance persistence in interracial relationships. Specifically, we tested whether White partners engaging in perspective taking could buffer against the negativity of discrimination. In Study 1 (N = 260), we found that perspective taking was associated with feeling the relationship expanded one's worldview for White partners in interracial relationships (but not for Black or non-White Hispanic partners). In Studies 2-4 (N = 531), we found that partners who engaged in perspective taking when discrimination was salient experienced greater positive self-expansion, which in turn led to greater reports of relationship quality. Collectively, these results suggest that perspective taking provides one process by which interracial relationships can be fortified against the adversity of racial discrimination.

TI  - Lateral detrital C transfer across a <i>Spartina alterniflora</i> invaded estuarine wetland
T2  - ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The lateral movements of mass and energy across the terrestrial-aquatic interface are being increasingly recognized for their importance in the carbon (C) balance of coastal/estuarine wetlands. We quantified the lateral flux of detrital C in the Yangtze estuary where invasive Spartina alterniflora has substantially and extensively altered the ecosystem structure and functions. Our overall objective was to close the C budget of estuarine wetlands through field sampling, tower-based measurements, and modeling. Methods A lateral detrital C exchange evaluation platform was established in a case study of the Yangtze River Estuary to investigate the effect of ecosystem structural changes on lateral detrital C transfer processes. This study estimated the lateral detrital C exchange based on the gross primary production (GPP) by performing coupled modeling and field sampling. Tower-based measurements and MODIS time series and CH4 outgassing and biomass simultaneously measured the lateral detrital C flux to characterize the relative contributions of lateral (i.e., detritus) C fluxes to the annual marsh C budget. Results The C pools in the plants and soil of Spartina marshes were significantly higher than those of the native community dominated by Phragmites australis. The GPP based on MODIS (GPP(MODIS)) was 472.6 g C m(-2) year(-1) and accounted for 73.0% of the GPP estimated from eddy covariance towers (GPP(EC)) (646.9 +/- 70.7 g C m(-2) year(-1)). We also detected a higher GPP(MODIS) during the pre-growing season, which exhibited a similar lateral detrital C flux magnitude. On average, 25.8% of the net primary production (NPP), which ranged from 0.21 to 0.30 kg C m(-2) year(-1), was exported during lateral exchange. The annual C loss as CH4 was estimated to be 17.9 +/- 3.7 g C m(-2) year(-1), accounting for 2.8% of the GPP(EC). The net positive detrital C flux (i.e., more detritus leaving the wetlands), which could exceed 0.16 kg C m(-2) day(-1), was related to daily tides. However, the observed lateral detrital C flux based on monthly sampling was 73.5% higher than that based on daily sampling (i.e., the sum of daily sampling), particularly in March and October. In addition, spatiotemporal granularities were responsible for most of the uncertainty in the lateral detrital C exchange. Conclusion This research demonstrated that an integrated framework incorporating modeling and field sampling can quantitatively assess lateral detrital C transport processes across the terrestrial-aquatic interface in estuarine wetlands. However, we note some limitations in the application of the light-use efficiency model to tidal wetlands. Spartina invasion can turn the lateral C balance from a C source (209.0 g C m(-2) year(-1)) of Phragmites-dominated marshes into a small C sink (-31.0 g C m(-2) year(-1)). Sampling over a more extended period and continuous measurements are essential for determining the contribution of different lateral detrital C flux processes to closing the ecosystem C budgets. The sampling spatiotemporal granularities can be key to assessing lateral detrital C transfer.

TI  - Tropical Dry Forest Resilience to Fire Depends on Fire Frequency and Climate
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires are becoming increasingly frequent and devastating in many tropical forests. Although seasonally dry tropical forests (SDTF) are among the most fire-threatened ecosystems, their long-term response to frequent wildfires remains largely unknown. This study is among the first to investigate the resilience in response to fire of the Chiquitano SDTF in Bolivia, a large ecoregion that has seen an unprecedented increase in fire intensity and frequency in recent years. We used remote sensing data to assess at a large regional and temporal scale (two decades) how fire frequency and environmental factors determine the resilience of the vegetation to fire disturbance. Resilience was measured as the resistance to fire damage and post-fire recovery. Both parameters were monitored for forested areas that burned once (F1), twice (F2), and three times (F3) between 2000 and 2010 and compared to unburned forests. Resistance and recovery were analyzed using time series of the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) index derived from Landsat satellite imagery, and climatic, topographic, and a human development-related variable used to evaluate their influence on resilience. The overall resilience was lowest in forests that burned twice and was higher in forests that burned three times, indicating a possible transition state in fire resilience, probably because forests become increasingly adapted during recurrent fires. Climatic variables, particularly rainfall, were most influential in determining resilience. Our results indicate that the Chiquitano dry forest is relatively resilient to recurring fires, has the capacity to recover and adapt, and that climatic differences are the main determinants of the spatial variation observed in resilience. Nevertheless, further research is needed to understand the effect of the higher frequency and intensity of fires expected in the future due to climate change and land use change, which may pose a greater threat to forest resilience.

TI  - Long-term surface water mapping in the Pearl River Delta based on multiple satellite images
T2  - RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Research on surface water (SW) dynamics is important for understanding climate change and the impacts of human activities on water resources. This article assesses the extent and direction of SW changes in the Pearl River Delta (PRD). Landsat images were used to determine the area of SW based on the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI); the center of gravity was used to map the shifting distribution of SW dynamics; and landscape indices and potential causes of the observed SW changes were explored. Although the PRD has experienced high-intensity economic development for 30 years, the total SW areas in 1988, 1998, 2008, and 2018 were 2,608, 3,154, 3,521, and 3,613 km(2), respectively. The center of gravity of SW was in Shunde, Foshan (FS), which exhibited a trend of westward expansion. Over time, the landscape pattern of SW in the PRD became increasingly fragmented, and its shape tended to be complex. The growth of fish ponds was the most obvious change, as illustrated by the increase in aquatic product production. These and other findings highlight the importance of patterns, structures, and policies in SW dynamic analyses. Wetland and agricultural policies will likely cause the maintenance or continued expansion of SW areas.

TI  - A damage-based crop insurance system for flash flooding: a satellite remote sensing and econometric approach
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF REGIONAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This research attempted to develop a damage-based crop insurance model using satellite remote sensing imagery and field surveys of flash flood regions in Bangladesh. A normalized difference water index (NDWI) was prepared from Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data, and inundated areas were delineated using a very high-resolution land use/land cover (LULC) map of a Survey of Bangladesh (SoB) to generate an accurate damage map for boro rice. The boro rice area damaged by flash floods in 2017 was estimated for the three most vulnerable flash flood-prone areas and sorted into high, moderate and marginal damage categories. The results of the accuracy assessment showed excellent classification performance for all classes of LULC. Analysis of the classification of the damaged area showed that the Gowainghat (44.60%) and Kulaura (69.80%) subdistricts were in the highest marginal damage category and that Tahirpur (52.92%) was in the moderate damage category. The future value of expected losses was calculated to be $536.25, $442.00, and $416.00 per hectare (ha) for high, moderate and marginal damage areas, respectively. Moreover, findings concerning the damaged-based crop insurance premium rate suggested that the higher the coverage levels were, the lower the insurance premium, and the lower the damaged class was, the lower the insurance premium rate. The lowest insurance premium rate was observed for areas with high coverage and moderate damage and was $23.82/ha, and the highest insurance premium rate was observed for areas with marginal coverage and high damage and was $39.49/ha. Evidence from the classification of damaged areas and from regression findings suggests that farmers' socioeconomic features and environmental awareness (occupation, educational level, total income, bank account ownership and awareness of climate change) are relevant to the decision to adopt a damaged-based crop insurance system. The overall results show an empirical model for flash flood occurrence over both the temporal and spatial domains, which offers an effective measure for adopting a damaged-based crop insurance model.

TI  - Relationship Between Active and Passive Microwave Signals Over Vegetated Surfaces
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite mission aims to produce enhanced resolution surface soil moisture products by combining coincident but multiresolution L-band active and passive microwave measurements. Since the SMAP radar ceased operations early in the mission, Copernicus Sentinel-1 C-band radar observations are used in the combined product. The synergy is built on two basic foundations: first, active and passive signals covary in a known and systematic fashion, and second, measurements are available at multiple resolutions. In this study, we perform numerical simulations and assess global satellite observations to test the first foundation (covariation). Specific focus lies on the role of the vegetation canopy in modulating the active-passive relationship. We use a discrete radiative transfer model to simulate the slope beta and coefficient of determination R-2 of the relationship between active and passive signals, considering three vegetation types for which the model has been extensively assessed in previous experimental studies. We find that a linear relationship between backscatter and emissivity can be established over a range of vegetation conditions. The coupling between active and passive signals decreases with increasing vegetation water content, such that moderate or higher correlations (nonzero slopes) are retained up to 4 kg/m(2) (6.3 kg/m(2)) for L-band/L-band and 1.5 kg/m(2) (2 kg/m(2)) for the C-band/L-band configuration. We decompose the effects of different soil-vegetation scattering mechanisms, such as double-bounce, and different measurement error levels on the active-passive relationship. Comparisons with satellite data confirm that our simulations capture magnitudes and major trends found across global vegetated land masses.

TI  - Safety of PRRSV-2 MLV vaccines administrated via the intramuscular or intradermal route and evaluation of PRRSV transmission upon needle-free and needle delivery
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Two distinct experiments (Exp) were conducted to evaluate the shedding and efficacy of 2 modified live porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) type 2 vaccines (MLV) when administered intramuscularly (IM) or intradermally (ID) (Exp A), and the potential of PRRSV transmission using a needle-free device (Exp B). One-hundred fifty-four, 3-week-old castrated-male, pigs were procured from a PRRSV-free herd. In Exp A, 112 pigs were randomly allocated into 4 groups of 21 pigs including IM/Ingelvac MLV (G1), IM/Prime Pac (G2), ID/Prime Pac (G3), and non-vaccination (G4). Twenty-eight remaining pigs were served as non-vaccination, age-matched sentinel pigs. G1 was IM vaccinated once with Ingelvac PRRS MLV (Ing) (Boehringer Ingelheim, Germany). G2 and G3 were IM and ID vaccinated once with a different MLV, Prime Pac PRRS (PP) (MSD Animal Health, The Netherlands), respectively. Following vaccination, an antibody response, IFN-gamma-SC, and IL-10 secretion in supernatants of stimulated PBMC were monitored. Sera, tonsils, nasal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage, urines, and feces were collected from 3 vaccinated pigs each week to 42 days post-vaccination (DPV) and assayed for the presence of PRRSV using virus isolation and qPCR. Age-matched sentinel pigs were used to evaluate the transmission of vaccine viruses and were introduced into vaccinated groups from 0 to 42 DPV. Seroconversion was monitored. In Exp B, 42 pigs were randomly allocated into 5 groups of 3 pigs each including IM/High (T1), ID/High (T2), IM/Low (T3), ID/Low (T4), and NoChal. Twenty-seven remaining pigs were left as non-challenge, age-matched sentinel pigs. The T1 and T2, and T3 and T4 groups were intranasally challenged at approximately 26 days of age with HP-PRRSV-2 at high (10(6)) and low (10(3) TCID50/ml) doses, respectively. At 7 days post-challenge, at the time of the highest viremia levels of HP-PRRSV-2, T1 and T2, and T3 and T4 groups were IM and ID injected with Diluvac Forte using needles and a need-less device (IDAL 3G, MSD Animal Health, The Netherlands), respectively. Same needles or needle-less devices were used to inject the same volume of Diluvac Forte into sentinel pigs. Seroconversion of sentinels was evaluated. The results demonstrated that PP vaccinated groups (G2 and G3), regardless of the route of vaccination, had ELISA response significantly lower than G1 at 7 and 14 DPV. PP-vaccinated groups (G2 and G3) had significantly higher IFN-gamma-SC and lower IL-10 secretion compared to the Ing-vaccinated group (G1). The two different MLV when administered intramuscularly demonstrated the difference in virus distribution and shedding patterns. PP-vaccinated pigs had significantly shortened viremia than the Ing-vaccinated pigs. However, ID-vaccinated pigs had lower virus distribution in organs and body fluids without virus shedding to sentinel pigs. In Exp B, regardless of the challenge dose, sentinel pigs intradermally injected with the same needle-less device used to inject challenged pigs displayed no seroconversion. In contrast, sentinel pigs intramuscularly injected with the same needle used to inject challenged pigs displayed seroconversion. The results demonstrated the transmission of PRRSV by using a needle, but not by using a needle-less device.In conclusion, our results demonstrated that ID vaccination might represent an alternative to improve vaccine efficacy and safety, and may be able to reduce the shedding of vaccine viruses and reduce the iatrogenic transfer of pathogens between animals with shared needles.

M3  - Article
AB  - Human being migrates from village to city in search of gaining better life standards such as better health, Good education, better employments and greater access to social and cultural activities. Due to Urbanisation, Udham Singh Nagar a populated district of the Uttarakhand State, India has experienced rapid variations in the land use land cover (LULC) specially with reference to built-up areas when Uttarakhand state, India was not separated from Uttar Pradesh, India and after to form a new state (Uttarakhand) for a period of more than two decades. The present study reveals impact of urbanisation on various LULC classes (such as forest, agriculture, built-up area, water bodies and barren land) and land surface temperature (LST) by using GIS and remote sensing technologies. Landsat satellite imageries of two different years April 2000 and April 2020 were received by USGS Earth Explorer and evaluated the change detection in Udham Singh Nagar a district of Uttarakhand State, India by using Maximum likelihood classification technique. In addition, an algorithm is implemented for retrieval of LST. It is found that significant built-up expansions (formation of urban sprawl in LULC) have taken place area change in 223.28 percentages from 2000 to 2020. Notably, the built-up expansions have taken place along the national highway NH 9 and NH 309 in the study area over the last 20 years as a result, there has been a notable reduction in water bodies, dense forest declined in north-west region of the study area and average LST is significantly increased by 1 degrees C in urban area.

TI  - The role of tree landscape to reduce effects of urban heat islands: a study in two Brazilian cities
T2  - TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The growth of large cities has, in its relationship with the natural environment, caused environmental impacts that have severely transformed the local climate and influenced human well-being. The purpose of this research was to examine the variation of temperature using remote sensing, seeking to identify urban heat islands and the spatial distribution of the green infrastructure, focusing on urban trees. Curitiba was selected for this study, because the city received in 1990 the United Nations Environment Program award and is considered the "Ecological Capital" of Brazil. On the other hand, Sao Paulo was selected, because it is the largest city in South America. Landsat satellite images on vegetation coverage and urban thermic comfort index methods were used to track the hotter regions and greenery all over the cities. The benefits of urban trees were also estimated by i-Tree Canopy with regard to improve air quality. Besides protected areas, mainly where there are urban fragments of forest, some high-income neighborhoods are benefited by the green cover. The results highlighted that both cities, Curitiba and Sao Paulo, require effective governance practices to produce patterns of environmental justice, implementing green spaces in a balanced way for the population.

T2  - ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Context. In space and astrophysical plasmas, turbulence leads to the development of coherent structures characterized by a strong current density and important magnetic shears. Aims. Using hybrid-kinetic simulations of turbulence (3D with different energy injection scales), we investigate the development of these coherent structures and characterize their shape. Methods. First, we present different methods to estimate the overall shape of the 3D structure using local measurements, foreseeing an application on satellite data. Then we study the local magnetic configuration inside and outside current peak regions, comparing the statistics in the two cases. Last, we compare the statistical properties of the local configuration obtained in simulations with the ones obtained analyzing an MMS (Magnetospheric MultiScale mission) dataset having similar plasma parameters. Results. Thanks to our analysis, (1) we validate the possibility of studying the overall shape of 3D structures using local methods, (2) we provide an overview of a local magnetic configuration emerging in different turbulent regimes, (3) we show that our 3D-3V simulations can reproduce the structures that emerge in MMS data for the periods considered.

AB  - Determination of the spatio-temporal distribution of Land use and Land cover (LU/LC) is important to understand the dynamics of urbanization, agricultural abandonment, and industrialization. This study aims to create multi-temporal high-resolution LU/LC maps and analyze thematically extensive LU/LC changes using Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) and Landscape Metrics for the selected study region in the Istanbul metropolitan city of Turkey. HR SPOT 6/7 images acquired in 2009, 2013, and 2019 were used as main Earth Observation data to create LU/LC maps. Open-source geospatial data were also integrated into classification to better identify some LU/LC classes to increase total classification accuracy. Overall classification accuracy of 2009, 2013, and 2019 dated LU/LC maps are 87.45%, 88.16%, 90.74% respectively. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Pearson correlation were used to selecting the landscape metrics and evaluate the results. PCA resulted in three principal components and the total variance was found as 87.3%.

TI  - Development characteristics, influencing mechanism and coping strategies of resource-based cities in developing countries: a case study of urban agglomeration in Northeast China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The transformation of resource-based cities and coordinated regional development are of great value to global urbanization and sustainable economic development in developing countries. Based on Landsat satellite monitoring data and urban economic data, statistical analysis and geospatial model were used to analyze the characteristics of urban development in urban agglomeration in Northeast China from 2000 to 2020, and the influencing mechanism was quantitatively revealed. The results show that the expansion of urban agglomerations rate reached its peak from 2005 to 2010, and then the expansion rate continued to decline. The resources of central cities were concentrated, while the development of sub-central cities was weak. The overall urbanization rate slows down, the scale difference between high-order cities and low-order cities expands, and the regional urban system shifts from balanced development to polarized development. The overall development of urban agglomerations shows a centripetal agglomeration characteristic centered on the Harbin Changchun-Daqing and Central and southern Liaoning Economic belt. Its west expands faster than the East, and its south expands faster than the north. The driving factors of urban agglomeration development are mainly administrative power, followed by market power, external power and weak internal power. From the point of time and space, the external power is on the rise, while the internal power is affected by the industrial adjustment and lacks the staying power. In view of the coordinated development of resource-based cities, this paper proposes to establish the linkage and coordination mechanism of integrated development of urban agglomeration, speed up the construction of unified market system, carry out transformation positioning according to market demand and implement differentiation policy.

TI  - The diversity of aphid parasitoids in East Africa and implications for biological control
T2  - PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND Hymenopteran parasitoids provide key natural pest regulation services and are reared commercially as biological control agents. Therefore, understanding parasitoid community composition in natural populations is important to enable better management for optimized natural pest regulation. We carried out a field study to understand the parasitoid community associated with Aphis fabae on East African smallholder farms. Either common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) or lablab (Lablab purpureus) sentinel plants were infested with Aphis fabae and deployed in 96 fields across Kenya, Tanzania, and Malawi. RESULTS A total of 463 parasitoids emerged from sentinel plants of which 424 were identified by mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) barcoding. Aphidius colemani was abundant in Kenya, Tanzania and Malawi, while Lysiphlebus testaceipes was only present in Malawi. The identity of Aphidius colemani specimens were confirmed by sequencing LWRh and 16S genes and was selected for further genetic and population analyses. A total of 12 Aphidius colemani haplotypes were identified. Of these, nine were from our East African specimens and three from the Barcode of Life Database (BOLD). CONCLUSION Aphidius colemani and Lysiphlebus testaceipes are potential targets for conservation biological control in tropical smallholder agro-ecosystems. We hypothesize that high genetic diversity in East African populations of Aphidius colemani suggests that this species originated in East Africa and has spread globally due to its use as a biological control agent. These East African populations could have potential for use as strains in commercial biological control or to improve existing Aphidius colemani strains by selective breeding.

TI  - The June 2020 Aniangzhai landslide in Sichuan Province, Southwest China: slope instability analysis from radar and optical satellite remote sensing data
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - A large, deep-seated ancient landslide was partially reactivated on 17 June 2020 close to the Aniangzhai village of Danba County in Sichuan Province of Southwest China. It was initiated by undercutting of the toe of this landslide resulting from increased discharge of the Xiaojinchuan River caused by the failure of a landslide dam, which had been created by the debris flow originating from the Meilong valley. As a result, 12 townships in the downstream area were endangered leading to the evacuation of more than 20000 people. This study investigated the Aniangzhai landslide area by optical and radar satellite remote sensing techniques. A horizontal displacement map produced using cross-correlation of high-resolution optical images from Planet shows a maximum horizontal motion of approximately 15 meters for the slope failure between the two acquisitions. The undercutting effects on the toe of the landslide are clearly revealed by exploiting optical data and field surveys, indicating the direct influence of the overflow from the landslide dam and water release from a nearby hydropower station on the toe erosion. Pre-disaster instability analysis using a stack of SAR data from Sentinel-1 between 2014 and 2020 suggests that the Aniangzhai landslide has long been active before the failure, with the largest annual LOS deformation rate more than 50 mm/yr. The 3-year wet period that followed a relative drought year in 2016 resulted in a 14% higher average velocity in 2018-2020, in comparison to the rate in 2014-2017. A detailed analysis of slope surface kinematics in different parts of the landslide indicates that temporal changes in precipitation are mainly correlated with kinematics of motion at the head part of the failure body, where an accelerated creep is observed since spring 2020 before the large failure. Overall, this study provides an example of how full exploitation of optical and radar satellite remote sensing data can be used for a comprehensive analysis of destabilization and reactivation of an ancient landslide in response to a complex cascading event chain in the transition zone between the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and the Sichuan Basin.

TI  - Extraction and analysis of geological lineaments by combining ASTER-GDEM and Landsat 8 image data in the central high atlas of Morocco
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The present work focuses on using remote sensing techniques and geographical information system (GIS) to automatically extract lineaments in the southeast of Morocco, which is one of the most important segments of the Moroccan Atlas system, especially between the southern border of the Central High Atlas and the northern part of the Anti-Atlas. For this purpose, we used Landsat 8 OLI multispectral image processing and the mosaic of two ASTER GDEM images covering the field of study. To achieve this objective, basic pre-processing was applied to our satellite images for the automatic extraction of lineaments, by applying the mathematical algorithm Line Module of the software Geomatica 2016 of PCI. The processing used included principal component analysis (PCA), shading at different angles of the GDEM, and 7 x 7 matrix directional filters, followed by the extraction of the lineament steps. The lineament extraction obtained results from the PC1 image, derived from the panchromatic band satellite image and the GDEM, proving that each produced map had a strong similarity in terms of concentration and orientation in two major directions: WSW-ENE and SW-NE, with a concentration of these lineaments in the northeastern part of the southern part of the Central High Atlas. This concentration was also clearly observed in the southeastern part at the Precambrian bedrock of Saghro. The results obtained from the automatic extraction of the lineaments revealed 18,450 lineaments, with sizes varying from a few meters to 7.5 km, with an average length of 902 m. The lineaments of small extensions were the most numerous, having intervals included between 458 and 2972 m. The projection of these lineaments on a directional diagram revealed a predominance of the NE-SW direction. To improve our results, multisource data such as the mosaic of two geological maps at a scale of 1:100,000, covering the complete study area, as well as a calibrated high-resolution field imagery backgrounds from the environmental systems research institute (ESRI) were used to validate our automatic lineament mapping results. As a conclusion of this investigation, we discovered that the automatic extraction provides a more accurate means of mapping structural lineaments, showing a good accordance with and more information than previous geological data, and confirming the efficiency of the techniques applied in geological studies.

TI  - Satellite monitoring of surface water variability in the drought prone Western Cape, South Africa
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface water plays a fundamental role in supporting life and the functioning of various ecosystems. In this regard, its availability and variability influence the functioning of various ecosystems and most importantly human livelihoods. This becomes critical in drought prone and water-scarce areas of sub-Saharan Africa. The use of satellite remote sensing is increasingly becoming the primary data source for water resources monitoring. However, with emerging and advances in satellite remote sensing data, their ability in monitoring water resources remains uncertain. In addition, the remote sensing of surface water mapping has been limited to specific periods, which undermines the influence of seasonality on their spatial variability. This study therefore assessed the potential of Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager and Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument derived Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI), Modified Normalised Difference Water Index Land Surface Water Index (LSWI+5) and Modified Normalised Difference Index (MNDVI), for monitoring seasonal surface waterbodies in the Western Cape, South Africa. The derived remote sensing estimates were assessed using the Producers', User's, Overall accuracies as well the Kappa coefficient. The spatial variations were also linked to monthly evapotranspiration, rainfall and temperature. These climatic factors all contribute to seasonal surface water availability. Further, the satellite-derived estimates were compared using the analysis of variance (ANOVA), to test whether there were any significant differences (alpha = 0.05) in their and mapping detection abilities. The results indicated that both sensors managed to detect and map surface water variations and it was observed that surface waterbodies varied spatially over time. During the wet season, more surface waterbodies were detected than during the dry season. The majority of waterbodies were detected by both sensors. Most of these waterbodies were found in the south western part of the study area and all the indices showed similar sizes and presence of seasonal surface waterbodies. Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI) performed the best and yielded the highest accuracy, however, the Land Surface Water Index VI (LSWI+5) results overestimated the size and occurrence of surface waterbodies, when compared to other indices, especially during the wet season. The derived waterbodies followed a similar pattern with the observed climate data and evapotranspiration rates during the study period. Landsat 8 derived Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI) performed slightly better when compared to other indices, with 92.33% and a Kappa coefficient of 84.67% in detecting and mapping surface waterbodies. On the other hand, Sentinel-2 produced lower classification estimates. Statistical analysis results demonstrated significant differences (alpha = 0.05) in the detection and mapping ability of different satellitederived indices. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of using Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 data in understanding spatial variations in surface water.

TI  - A novel approach to the use of earth observation to estimate daily evaporation in a sugarcane plantation in Xinavane, Mozambique
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Efficient irrigation water management for an 18,000 ha sugarcane plantation in Xinavane in southern Mozambique is a challenge. Sugarcane is an irrigation intensive crop and its productivity is sensitive to water stress. Options to adopt field water management best practices and proper irrigation scheduling are limited due to the lack of plot-level information on the actual crop water use and stress levels throughout the growing season. Due to heterogeneity in cropping calendar within the sugarcane plantation, at a certain point of time, different plots are at different growth stages. This makes scheme level irrigation scheduling complex and calls for frequent crop water use information. To fill this gap, this study presents a novel approach where a combination of satellite imagery with local weather data is used to provide daily evaporation rates. The Priestley-Taylor equation is applied to quantify evaporation (soil evaporation + transpiration) using radiation and temperature data from a meteorological station and spatial albedo estimates derived from the Sentinel-2 satellites. The results show 20 meter resolution maximum crop evaporation estimates can be derived with the proposed methodology. Additionally, the results show NDVI in the last two crop stages is able to distinguish between poor and good performing fields. Therefore, NDVI can be a useful index to estimate actual evaporation. First, the evaporation estimates were corrected for the crop stage using NDVI proxies and an additional stress indicator was used to calculate the actual evaporation flux spatially. The spatial evaporation estimates provide the water manager with information on actual crop water use and biomass development, which is relevant to both crop monitoring and irrigation management water management when drought-related stress is filtered.

T2  - AMERICAN EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explores how the college-going culture at a no-excuses charter school with high college enrollment rates shaped students' worldviews and trajectories. Drawing on 7 months of ethnographic fieldwork, I found that the school boosted college enrollment through student compliance to the college accountability policies rather than through the transmission of dominant cultural resources. Alignment between a student's worldview and the school's approach mediated their ability to draw on their full range of resources to participate in the college choice process and forge postsecondary trajectories they believed in. These findings foreshadow the potential impacts of "College for All" accountability structures and underscore the importance of cultural congruence in college-going cultures.

TI  - Predicting land degradation using Sentinel-2 and environmental variables in the Lepellane catchment of the Greater Sekhukhune District, South Africa
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Land degradation is defined as the reduction of biological and economic productivity, which impedes the capacity of the land to provide ecosystem services. There is a need to move towards near real-time monitoring of land degradation using new sensors to detect degraded landscapes. Recently launched Sentinel-2 sensor presents the opportunity to collect high-resolution data regularly. Multi-temporal datasets provide crucial information to isolate evidence of land degradation from temporal changes in vegetation cover incurred as a result of climatic and phenological variability. This study applied an integrated approach involving multi-seasonal Sentinel-2 data with environmental variables (i.e. soil moisture, rainfall, slope, evapotranspiration, elevation, soil temperature, rainfall, soil temperature, aspect and albedo). A stratified random sampling approach based on dominant land cover types were used to assess land degradation. Field plots of 20 m x 20 m were setup with three 50 cm x 50 cm quadrants inside. In each quadrant, the percentage estimation of vegetation cover and Leaf Area Index was measured. The model training and validation was implemented using the Random Forest algorithm based on default parameters. The pooled model represents the dry and wet seasons combined. Results showed that pooled model had higher accuracies for Photosynthetic vegetation (PV) (R2 of 0.89, RMSE-11.46%, relRMSE-8.7%), Non-Photosynthetic Vegetation (NPV) (R2 of 0.93, RMSE-5.64%, relRMSE% 17.72) and Bare Soil (BS) (R2 of 0.92, RMSE 8.7% and relRMSE 11.46%). The pooled environmental model achieved accuracy of PV (R2 of 0.42, RMSE-20.67%, relRMSE 4.83%), NPV (R2 of 0.90, RMSE 6.50% and relRMSE 15%) and (BS R2 of 0.85, RMSE 8.64% and relRMSE% 11.5) in estimating vegetation cover.

TI  - Forecasting the near future of rainfall in humid tropics using the high-resolution satellite precipitation data
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper utilized the Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) technique to forecast the near future rainfall using the long-term satellite rainfall data. At present, many of the future rainfall and climate forecast was conducted for a long-term period (>10 years) at the macroscale (similar to 1000 km and above) level. Those forecasts are inappropriate to meet the demand for the short-term action (1-3 years). In addition, the macroscale information is unsuitable and too general for the local administrative council and water resources stakeholders to make the adaptation plan, mitigation action, and preventive measures at smaller scale (10-50 km). Many developing countries were facing hydrological data conflict (scarcity, sparse, etc.) and utilizing the publicly accessed satellite data could be useful alternatives. Therefore, sound evidence is required to validate the hypothesis where the use of ARIMA and the long-term satellite rainfall data could provide near future rainfall forecast. Prior to that, the southern part of Johor in Malaysia is selected as the experimental site for this study. To perform the task, 204 of monthly gridded of satellite rainfall from 1998 to 2014 is utilized. In implementing the ARIMA, the standard seasonal lag based on local monsoon period is chosen. The auto-regression co-efficient is computed for each individual grid based on the time series of monthly rainfall, as well as the forecasted rainfall. To determine the ideal duration of historical rainfall for the best near-future forecasted rainfall, the rainfall datasets are divided into decadal and semi-decadal (epoch is every 5 years). The results showed that the satellite based forecasted rainfall based on ARIMA (SAFORA) using half-decadal datasets able to forecast the 2015 rainfall at average temporal correlation of 0.703. Measurement biases range from 5 to 70%, depending on monsoon season. The SAFORA tends to overestimate low rainfall months. The output of this experiment proved that SAFORA able to forecast the monthly-scale rainfall at reliable accuracy and could be useful for hydrological data conflict situation catchment or location in the humid tropics.

TI  - Investigating the impact of remediation efforts on<i> Hedistediversicolor</i> in the Seine estuary using multiple levels of biological organization
T2  - MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Seine Estuary is historically one of the most contaminated estuaries in Europe. In 2002 the estuary underwent major redevelopment which emphasized environmental remediation to measure biological effects. The present study investigated the health status of the sentinel species Hediste diversicolor in the Seine estuary by comparing data from a sampling campaign immediately after the Seine underwent reconstruction and 10 years afterward. Both studies implemented multiple levels of biological organization ranging from enzymatic biomarkers to population density. Integrative modeling was used to establish a holistic status assessment for H. diversicolor in the Seine. H. diversicolor populations in the Seine estuary were impacted in both campaigns suggesting no significant improvements over the 10-year period. This interpretation however can be improved by increasing the number of reference sites used to establish the baseline natural variation, integrating additional environmental parameters into the model and measuring additional biological endpoints, such as reproductive status.

TI  - The impact of land consolidation on arable land productivity: A differentiated view of soil and vegetation productivity
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in agricultural land productivity have become a crucial criterion for assessing the effectiveness of land consolidation (LC). In this study, agricultural land productivity under LC was observed and monitored in terms of two important factors: vegetation productivity and soil productivity, which were represented by net primary productivity (NPP) and soil organic matter (SOM), respectively. Based on spatial and temporal variations before and after the implementation of LC, the response of vegetation and soil productivity to LC was further discussed. The main results are as follows: (1) The effectiveness of LC could be quantitatively confirmed in terms of both vegetation and soil productivity. Compared with vegetation productivity, soil productivity had stronger and more positive response to LC. (2) The effectiveness of LC was characterized by temporal attenuation, which specifically showed that the improvement of vegetation and soil productivity followed a trajectory of "increase-stability" after the implementation of LC. (3) The effectiveness of LC was seasonal, coinciding with the farming period. In other words, the effectiveness of LC became completely prominent with the implementation of agricultural activities. This phenomenon was particularly more pronounced from the aspect of soil productivity.

TI  - Dashboards to reduce inappropriate prescribing of metformin and aspirin: A quality assurance programme in a primary care sentinel network
T2  - PRIMARY CARE DIABETES
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims: To pilot two dashboards to monitor prescribing of metformin and aspirin according to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Do-Not-Do' recommendations.Methods: This quality assurance programme was conducted in twelve general practices of the Oxford-Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) network. We developed dashboards to flag inappropriate prescribing of metformin and aspirin to people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In Phase 1, six practices (Group A) received a dashboard flagging suboptimal metformin prescriptions in people with reduced renal function. The other six practices (Group B) were controls. In Phase 2, Group B were provided a dashboard to flag inappropriate aspirin prescribing and Group A were controls. We used logistic regression to explore associations between dashboard exposure and inappropriate prescribing.Results: The cohort comprised 5644 individuals (Group A, n = 2656; Group B, n = 2988). Half (51.6%, n = 2991) were prescribed metformin of which 15 (0.5%) were inappropriate (Group A, n = 10; Group B, n = 5). A fifth (17.6%, n = 986) were prescribed aspirin of which 828 (84.0%) were inappropriate. During Phase 1, metformin was stopped in 50% (n = 5) of people in Group A, compared with 20% (n = 1) in the control group (Group B); in Phase 2, the odds ratio of inappropriate aspirin prescribing was significantly lower in practices that received the dashboard versus control (0.44, 95%CI 0.27-0.72).Conclusions: It was feasible to use a dashboard to flag inappropriate prescribing. Whilst underpowered to report a change in metformin, we demonstrated a reduction in inappropriate aspirin prescribing. (C) 2021 Primary Care Diabetes Europe. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Total suspended solids characterization and management implications for lakes in East China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we empirically developed a robust model (the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), bias, NSE and RE were 26.63 mg/L, -4.86 mg/L, 0.47 and 16.47%, respectively) for estimating the total suspended solids (TSS) concentrations in lakes and reservoirs (Hereinafter referred to as lakes) across the Eastern Plain Lake (EPL) Zone. The model was based on 700 in-situ TSS samples collected during 2007-2020 and logarithmic transformed red band reflectance of Landsat data. Based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE), the TSS concentrations in 16,804 lakes were mapped from 1984 to 2019. The results demonstrated a decreasing tendency of TSS in 82.2% of the examined lakes (72.5% of the basins) indicating that the pollutants carried by TSS flowing into the lakes were decreasing. Statistically significant variation (p < 0.05) was found in half of these lakes (28.6% of the basins). High TSS level (>100 mg/L) was observed in 0.31% of lakes (1.1% of the basins). The changing rates of TSS in 47.8% of the lakes (52.7% of the basins) ranged between -50 mg/L/yr and 0. We found high and significantly increased relative spatial heterogeneity of TSS in 4.6% and 6.5% of lakes, respectively. Likewise, the environmental factors, i.e., fertilizer usage, domestic wastewater, industrial wastewater, precipitation, wind speed and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) exhibited a significant correlation with interannual TSS in 38, 21, 20,11,17 and 15 of the 91 basins, respectively. This analysis indicated that only precipitation and fertilizer usage were signifi-cantly (p < 0.05) related to the spatial distribution of TSS. The relative contributions of the six factors to the interannual TSS changes were varied in different basins. Overall, the NDVI (the representation of vegetation cover) had a high mean contribution to the interannual TSS changes with an average contribution of 7.2%, and contributions of fertilizer were varied greatly among the basins (0.01%-68%). Human activities (fertilizer usage, domestic wastewater, industrial wastewater) and natural factors (precipitation, wind speed and NDVI) played relatively important roles to TSS changes in 14 and 15 of the 91 basins, respectively. Beyond the six factors in this study, other unanalyzed factors (such as lake depth and soil texture) also had some impacts on the distribution of TSS in the study area. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - A functional seasonal thermal hot-spot classification: Focus on industrial sites
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was focused on the metropolitan area of Florence in Tuscany (Italy) with the aim to provide a functional spatial thermal anomaly indicator obtained throughout a thermal summer and winter hot-spot detection. The hot-spot analysis was performed by applying Getis-Ord Gi* spatial statistics to Land Surface Temperature (LST) layers, obtained from Landsat 8 remote sensing data during the 2015-2019 daytime summer and winter period, to delimitate summer hot- and cool-spots, and winter warm- and cold-spots. Further, these ones were spatially combined thus obtaining a comprehensive summer-winter Thermal Hot-Spot (THSSW) spatial indicator. Winter and summer mean daily thermal comfort profiles were provided for the study area assessing the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) by using meteorological data available from seven local weather stations, located at a maximum distance of 350 m from industrial sites. A specific focus on industrial sites was carried out by analyzing the industrial buildings characteristics and their surrounding areas (50 m buffer), through the following layers: industrial building area (BA), surface albedo of buildings (ALB), impervious area (IA), tree cover (TC), and grassland area (GA). The novel THSSW classification applied to industrial buildings has shown that about 50% of the buildings were located in areas characterized by summer hot-spots. Increases in BA and IA revealed warming effects on industrial buildings, whereas increases in ALB, TC, and GA disclosed cooling effects. A decrease of about 10% of IA replaced by TC and GA was associated with about 2 degrees C decrease of LST. Very strong outdoor heat stress conditions were observed during summer daytime, whereas moderate winter outdoor cold stress conditions were recorded during nighttime until the early morning. The thermal spatial hot-spot classification in industrial areas provides a very useful source of information for thermal mitigation strategies aimed to reduce the heat-related health risk for workers.

TI  - Delineation of groundwater potential zones, groundwater estimation and recharge potentials from Mahoba district of Uttar Pradesh, India
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mahoba district comes under Uttar Pradesh, India, and is a hard rock area overlain by the recent alluvium. Most of the agricultural activities were present in such alluvium. However, they are shallow which were deteriorating with time. The severe scarcity and sudden spreading of groundwater in the region directed us to study the potential groundwater zones. In the current study, groundwater potential zones using multi-criteria evaluation techniques were carried out. Various thematic maps such as landuse/landcover, geomorphology, lithology, soil, slope, lineament, and drainage maps were considered to demarcate potential zones. Approximately 0.7% belongs to 'very good to good' groundwater potential zones, 2.4% for 'moderate to good', carefully followed by 83% for 'low to moderate' groundwater potential zones and roughly around 12%, 0.7%, and 0.9% falls under the 'very low to low', 'nil to very low', and 'no potential zones' zones, respectively. The majority of the district suggests a low to moderate potential groundwater zone. The validation of results was in agreement with the evidence obtained as area under curve (AUC) was calculated to be 85.99%. Groundwater estimation for present and prospects was also carried out and shows that two blocks, namely Panwari and Jaitpur, show a decline in groundwater prospects. The other two blocks, namely Charkhari and Kabrai, also offer a declining trend, but the possibilities are better than the other two. Hence, the results from this study will be beneficial in enhanced groundwork and managing the groundwater resources for present and prospects in the entire district.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The amount of water taken from non-renewable resources such as aquifers to fulfill irrigation requirements is rarely monitored, putting sustainable agriculture under threat in the face of changing climate. In the present research, an attempt was made to apply multi-sensor (Landsat suite, GRACE, GRACE-FO) satellite data to monitor spatiotemporal evolution of agriculture for the Al-Qassim region, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). For this purpose, time series of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), SAVI (Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index), and MSAVI2 (Modified Soil-Adjusted Vegetation 2) was utilized to assess vegetation pattern change in the study area. The present investigation used High-resolution Planetscope (PS) nanosatellite data to validate the vegetation results. Mann Kendall trend analysis and linear regression were performed to study the temporal pattern, and the relationship between vegetation, GRACE, and climate variables was performed from 1984 to 2020. Water extraction based on the averaged value of JPL GWS and CSR GWS showed a decreasing trend of -10.24 +/- 1.4 mm/year from 2003-2020. The annual rainfall showed a decreasing trend, while the annual temperature showed an increasing trend from 1982-2020. The correlation of vegetation indices with rainfall of one-month lag showed a significantly better relationship of 0.74, 0.74, and 0.75, respectively, for NDVI, SAVI, and MSAVI2. The correlation between temperature and all three vegetation indices is a strong negative correlation: -0.85 for NDVI and -0.9 for SAVI and MSAVI.

TI  - Relationship between sea surface temperature anomalies in the Southwestern Atlantic Continental Shelf and atmospheric variability on intraseasonal timescales
T2  - CLIMATE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The intraseasonal (IS) variability of the sea surface temperature (SST) in the Southwestern Atlantic Continental Shelf (SWACS, 45-33 degrees S-70-50 degrees W), and its relationship with that in the atmosphere, was studied for the austral warm season. SST satellite data (11-km resolution NOAA CoastWatch Program) and data of different atmospheric variables (Reanalysis1 NCEP/NCAR and ERA-Interim) were used. Data were filtered using a 10-90 day filter to isolate the IS variability. A Principal Component analysis was applied then to the filtered SST anomalies (SSTA) and the activity of the leading modes was described through the corresponding temporal series. The first three modes are significant. EOF1 (25.7% of variance) exhibits SSTA of opposite sign to the north/south of 42 degrees S. EOF2 (9.0%) and EOF3 (5.1%) are related with centers of SSTA of opposite sign located off the Uruguayan coast and in the middle shelf. Composites of SSTA and of key atmospheric variables were made considering the days in which the main modes were active. They show that the SSTA described by the three modes are associated with distinctive regional sea level pressure anomalies that, in turn, seem to be related to atmospheric Rossby wave trains extending from the Australia area towards South America. The corresponding atmospheric wave sources vary depending on the mode. These results show, therefore, that the SSTA in the SWACS exhibit significant IS variability that is, in part, locally and remotely influenced by atmospheric anomalies oscillating on similar timescales. These ocean-atmosphere teleconnections could help to improve ocean predictability at those timescales in the future.

TI  - High-Cadence Lidar Observations of Middle Atmospheric Temperature and Gravity Waves at the Southern Andes Hot Spot
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Southern Andes are the strongest hot spot for atmospheric gravity waves (GWs) in the stratosphere. Yet, until recently, no high-cadence measurements of GWs within the middle atmosphere were available in this region. Therefore, the COmpact Rayleigh Autonomous Lidar (CORAL) was deployed to the Estacion Astronomica Rio Grande (53.7 degrees S, 67.7 degrees W), Argentina, to obtain temperature profiles up to 100 km altitude. CORAL operates autonomously and obtained measurements during roughly two thirds of all nights between November 2017 and October 2020. The excellent measurement coverage allows for the quantification of GW properties at the hot spot with great detail. The hot spot nature of this region is reflected in nightly mean temperature profiles showing deviations from the monthly mean in the order of 25-55 K in each winter month. This is connected to winter mean growth rates of GW potential energy (E-p), which are to our knowledge the largest ever reported in the stratosphere. The monthly mean E-p profiles show a mesospheric limit of similar to 100 Jkg(-1), indicating a saturated GW spectrum at altitudes above 60 km. The winter mean power spectral density also reaches the saturation limit here. Moreover, we investigated the distribution of vertical wavelengths using our novel diagnostic technique WAVELET-SCAN. It reveals waves with vertical wavelengths that are mostly between 10 and 16 km but also can exceed 25 km in rare occasions.

TI  - Convergence in critical fuel moisture and fire weather thresholds associated with fire activity in the pyroregions of Mediterranean Europe
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires are becoming an increasing threat to many communities worldwide. There has been substantial progress towards understanding the proximal causes of increased fire activity in recent years at regional and national scales. However, subcontinental scale examinations of the commonalities and differences in the drivers of fire activity across different regions are rare in the Mediterranean zone of the European Union (EUMed). Here, we first develop a new classification of EUMed pyroregions, based on grouping different ecoregions with similar seasonal patterns of burned area. We then examine the thresholds associated with fire activity in response to different drivers related to fuel moisture, surface meteorology and atmospheric stability. We document an overarching role for variation in dead fuel moisture content (FMd), or its atmospheric proxy of vapor pressure deficit (VPD), as the major driver of fire activity. A proxy for live fuel moisture content (EVI), wind speed (WS) and the Continuous Haines Index (CH) played secondary, albeit important, roles. There were minor differences in the actual threshold values of FMd (10-12%), EVI (0.29-0.36) and CH (4.9-5.5) associated with the onset of fire activity across pyroregions with peak fire seasons in summer and fall, despite very marked differences in mean annual burned area and fire size range. The average size of fire events increased with the number of drivers exceeding critical thresholds and reaching increasingly extreme values of a driver led to disproportionate increases in the likeli-hood of a fire becoming a large fire. For instance, the percentage of fires >500 ha increased from 2% to 25% as FMd changed from the wettest to the driest quantile. Our study is among the first to jointly address the roles of fuel moisture, surface meteorology and atmospheric stability on fire activity in EUMed and provides novel insights on the interactions across fire activity triggers.

However, the use of MBD alone is hampered by the high false-negative rate; thus, it requires coupling with other mapping methods if the appropriate infrastructure and services are available. In this article, we present two prospective cases detailing our initial experience using the gold-standard dual tracer technique (DTT: MBD and Tc-99m-nanocolloid radioisotope) in combination with hybrid single-photon emission computed-tomography/computed-tomography (SPECT/CT) preoperative mapping for image-guided SLN biopsy (SLNB). Overall, both studies were successful in identifying the SLNs, which aided in mapping the possible anatomical spread of the disease.

TI  - A parallel SP-DBSCAN algorithm on spark for waiting spot recommendation
T2  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - It is challenging for complex urban transportation networks to recommend taxi waiting spots for mobile passengers because the traditional centralized mining platform cannot address the storage and calculation problems of GPS trajectory big data, and especially the boundary identification of DBSCAN is difficult on the Spark parallel processing framework. To this end, we propose a parallel DBSCAN optimization algorithm with the silhouette coefficient and the pickup rate on Spark in this paper, named SP-DBSCAN, where users merely input one parameter to complete the distributed recommendation of the best waiting spot. Specifically, under the Hadoop distributed computing platform, a general framework of distributed modeling for waiting spot recommendation on Spark is developed to solve the distributed storage and parallel computing issues of the serial algorithm in handling data partition and clustering of large-scale traffic data on a single machine. Moreover, we put forward a parallel SP-DBSCAN algorithm on Spark to recommend the best waiting spot for passengers, where the traditional DBSCAN algorithm is optimized via the silhouette coefficient and the boarding ratio to address the parameter sensitive problem and the issue of the center of the non-convex clustering graph is solved by giving one cluster with two centroids in the clustering hotspot areas. Finally, experimental results on four groups of real-world taxi GPS trajectory data sets demonstrate that compared with C-DBSCAN and P-DBSCAN, the recognition rate of SP-DBSCAN is increased by 1.6%, 6.2%, 3.47%, and 5.8%, respectively. The empirical study indicates that the clustering region generated by our SP-DBSCAN algorithm can satisfy the requirements that passengers can ride in the hotspot area when they have not successfully hitchhiked at a specific location and turned to the next spot randomly.

TI  - Surface Warming Trend Analysis Based on MODIS/Terra Land Surface Temperature Product at Gongga Mountain in the Southeastern Tibetan Plateau
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - As the highest mountain in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau, Gongga Mountain is highly sensitive to climate change which is hardly assessed with limited meteorological stations in this region. To analyze the warming trend of Gongga Mountain, the mean annual surface temperature (MAT) was extracted based on an annual temperature cycle model with the MODIS/Terra daily land surface temperature (LST) product and used to identify the MAT trends from 2000 to 2018 using the Mann-Kendall trend test. The results indicate that almost all the pixels passing a significance test with the confidence level of 95% show an increasing trend, and the daytime MAT exhibited a stronger warming trend with the mean rate of 0.11 K/yr than the nighttime MAT (0.07 K/yr). However, more pixels (30.2%) exhibited significant warming trends at night than during the daytime (21.6%). Additionally, the significant warming pixels were mainly distributed above 3,200 m, and the number of pixels increased with elevation. Most importantly, the statistics of the daytime and nighttime changing rates at different elevation ranges support elevation-dependent warming (EDW). These warming patterns are connected to changes in snow and cloud cover and the rate shows good correlations with the changes in clear-sky days and vegetation cover conditions. In general, this study verifies that remotely sensed LST can be used to analyze the warming trends in mountain areas and identifies the presence of EDW at Gongga Mountain. This trend could result in a strong influence on the local mountain ecosystem functions, water resources, and glacial changes.

TI  - Effect of non-sentinel metastasis on adjuvant treatment decisions and survival in Z0011 eligible non-screened detected breast cancer population
T2  - ECANCERMEDICALSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The Z0011 trial results have shown that axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) can be avoided in cT1-2 patients undergoing breast conservation surgery with 1-2 metastatic sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). We compared the clinicopathological characteristics of the Z0011 eligible non-screen detected breast cancer patients' cohort with the Z0011 trial study population. Additionally, we have explored the effect of non-sentinel metastasis on adjuvant treatment decisions and survival.Methods: The details of early breast cancer (EBC) patients fulfilling Z0011 eligibility criteria were retrieved from a prospectively maintained database (2013-2017) and electronic medical records. We used Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 25 and Stata V15 for the data analysis.Results: 128/194 (66%) sentinel lymph node biopsy positive patients had fulfilled the Z0011 inclusion criteria. Compared to the Z0011 study, our cohort patients were younger, with more aggressive disease (higher T2, Grade 3), had a higher rate of macrometastasis (82.8% versus 58.8%) and non-SLN metastasis (48% versus 27%). The information gained by ALND had changed decisions for chemotherapy in 3% and no change of radiotherapy in Z0011 eligible patients. Further nodal positivity in completion ALND was not significantly associated with overall survival (p = 0.86) and disease-free survival (p = 0.5).Conclusion: Z0011 eligible Indian EBC patients are significantly different from the Z0011 study population, with younger age of presentation, higher grade, a higher rate of both SLN macro metastasis and non-SLN positivity. The impact of non-sentinel metastasis on adjuvant treatment decisions and survival is minimal.

TI  - Lymphadenectomy, obesity and open surgery are associated with surgical complications in endometrial cancer
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To investigate surgical complications related to the staging procedure for endometrial cancer (EC) and to explore complication associations towards patient characteristics and survival. Methods: A population-based cohort study of women diagnosed with EC where primary surgery was performed at a tertiary centre between 2012 and 2016. The Swedish Quality Registry for Gynecological Cancer was used for identification, medical records reviewed and surgical outcomes, including complications according to Clavien-Dindo (CD), and comorbidity (Charlson's index) registered. Uni-and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed with complications as outcome and multi variable Cox regression analysis with overall survival (OS) as endpoint. Results: In total 549 women were identified where 108 (19.7%) had CD grade II-V complications. In the multivariable regression analysis; surgical technique, BMI and lymph node dissection, but not comorbidity or age, were found to be risk factors for complications CD grade II-V, with OR of 0.32 (95%CI:0.18-0.56) for minimalinvasive surgery (MIS) compared to open, OR 2.18 (95%CI:1.37-3.49) for BMI >30 and OR 2.63 (95%CI:1.32-5.31) for pelvic and paraaortic lymphnode dissection. In Cox regression analysis, a significant lower OS was found within the first 1.5 years for the cohort of complications (CD II-V) compared to no complications. Conclusion: Surgical staging with lymphadenectomy was found a risk factor for complications together with high BMI in EC. Using MIS was significantly associated with less complications. Overall survival was found to be negatively affected within the first years after complications. Our results may be taken into consideration when performing updated treatment guidelines including surgical staging. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Intra-operative assessment of sentinel lymph nodes for breast cancer surgery: An update
T2  - SURGICAL ONCOLOGY-OXFORD
M3  - Review
AB  - Lymph node (LN) involvement is the strongest prognostic factor in operable breast cancer (BC). Therefore, accurate assessment of LN status is essential for management of BC patients. The introduction of sentinel LN approach reduced the need for extensive axillary surgery to achieve accurate staging. However, positive sentinel LN as determined on postoperative histological examination often leads to a second axillary operation to ensure an accurate staging and that positive non-sentinel LNs are removed. Although preoperative assessment of LN has improved significantly, its accuracy remains insufficient to avoid further axillary surgery and is not sufficient to predict the status of the LN. Therefore, intraoperative evaluation of the sentinel LN to determine the need for completing lymph node dissection in case of metastasis can provide an important approach to guide BC management decision making. This article reviews the techniques available and under development for intraoperative detection of sentinel LN metastasis in BC surgery. The key features of each technique are described in detail, emphasising the benefits offered by label-free optical techniques: minimal sample preparation, high spatial resolution, and immediate on-site implementation. Optical techniques have the potential to provide a cost-effective and accurate intraoperative platform for the assessment of SLN within the operating theatre.

TI  - An approach to extracting digital elevation model for undulating and hilly terrain using de-noised stereo images of Cartosat-1 sensor
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - A digital elevation model (DEM) is established as an essential geospatial dataset requisite for many topographical and environmental applications. The freely available DEMs have low spatial resolution (SR >= 30 m) and comprise considerable vertical errors. The vertical errors are worsened in the undulating and hilly or rugged terrain regions. In this research, we introduced a study to investigate the effect of the noise reduction filters on the accuracy and quality of the DEMs for undulating and hilly terrain regions. The main objectives are to extract a high-quality DEM without collecting physical data like ground control points. DEM generation using de-noised stereo images is carried out using Rational Polynomial Coefficients of Cartosat-1 sensor and Automated Tie Point (ATP) selection. The ATP selection and distribution on the stereo images play a significant role in the DEM accuracy. The present paper also provides information about the optimum number of ATPs used for different topographic conditions. The altitude value of extracted DEM through de-noised stereo images and freely accessible DEMs is compared with reference to the ground truth value of the study region. The 3-D surface profile map of the DEM is used for visual interpretation.

TI  - Predictive Score of Nodal Involvement in Endometrial Cancer Patients: A Large Multicentre Series
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is considered the standard of care in early-stage endometrial cancer (EC). For SLN failure, a side-specific lymphadenectomy is recommended. Nevertheless, most hemipelvises show no nodal involvement. The authors previously published a predictive score of lymphovascular involvement in EC. In case of a negative score (value 3-4), the risk of nodal metastases was extremely low. This multicenter study aimed to analyze a predictive score of nodal involvement in EC patients. Methods The study enrolled patients with EC who had received comprehensive surgical staging with nodal assessment. A preoperative predictive score of nodal involvement was calculated for all the patients before surgery. The score included myometrial infiltration, tumor grading (G), tumor diameter, and Ca125 assessment. The STARD (standards for Reporting Diagnostic accuracy studies) guidelines were followed for score accuracy. Results The study analyzed 1038 patients and detected 155 (14.9%) nodal metastases. The score was negative (3 or 4) for 475 patients and positive (5-7) for 563 of these patients. The score had a sensitivity of 83.2%, a specificity of 50.8%, a negative predictive value of 94.5%, and a diagnostic value of 55.7%. The area under the curve was 0.75. The logistic regression showed a significant correlation between a negative score and absence of nodal metastasis (odds ration [OR], 5.133, 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.30-7.98; p < 0.001). Conclusion The proposed predictive score is a useful test to identify patients at low risk of nodal involvement. In case of SLN failure, the application of the current score in the SLN algorithm could allow avoidance of unnecessary lymphadenectomies.

M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Remote sensing satellite imagery has the potential to monitor and understand dynamic environmental phenomena by retrieving information about Earth's surface. Marine ecosystems, however, have been studied with less intensity than terrestrial ecosystems due, in part, to data limitations. Data on sea surface temperature (SST) and Chlorophyll-a (Chlo-a) can provide quantitative information of environmental conditions in coastal regions at a high spatial and temporal resolutions. Using the exclusive economic zone of coastal regions as the study area, we compiled monthly and annual statistics of SST and Chlo-a globally for 2003 to 2020. This ready-to-use dataset aims to reduce the computational time and costs for local-, regional-, continental-, and global-level studies of coastal areas. Data may be of interest to researchers in the areas of ecology, oceanography, biogeography, fisheries, and global change. Target applications of the database include environmental monitoring of biodiversity and marine microorganisms, and environmental anomalies.

TI  - Assessment of seasonal and spatial variation responses of integrated biomarkers in two marine sentinel bivalve species: Agadir Bay (Southern of Morocco)
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aims to assess the effects of contamination of the Agadir bay coasts using bivalves as a biomonitoring sentinel species. Seasonal variations of biochemical composition in terms of total protein content and oxidative stress biomarkers including glutathione-S-transferase, malondialdehyde, catalase and acetylcholinesterase were evaluated in the soft tissues of Scrobicularia plana and Donax trunculus specimens. The latter were collected from two sites in Agadir bay during two-year span (2018-2020). The Integrated Biomarker Response Index (IBR) was performed to classify the stress response in both species and to assess the level of exposure to xenobiotics. The data showed maximum annual values of acetylcholinesterase and malondialdehyde for Donax trunculus in Agadir beach (AG) with 6.25 nmol/mn/mg and 3 nmol/mg of protein, respectively. Those of catalase and glutathione-S-transferase for Scrobicularia plana in Oued Souss estuary (OS) were of 4.41 mu mol/mn/mg and 14.43 nmol/mn/mg of protein, respectively. The studied species are considered good indicators in aquatic ecosystems.

TI  - Application of C-band sentinel-1A SAR data as proxies for detecting oil spills of Chennai, East Coast of India
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the utilization of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data for monitoring and detection of oil spills. In this work, a case study of an oil spill has been investigated using C-band Sentinel-1A SAR data to detect the oil spill that occurred on 28 January 2017, near Ennore port, Chennai, India. Oil spill damages marine ecosystems causing serious environmental effects. Quite often, oil spills on the sea/ocean surface are seen nowadays, mainly in major shipping routes. They are caused due to tanker collisions, illegal discharge from the ships, etc. An oil spill can be monitored and detected using various platforms such as vessel-based, airbornebased and satellite-based. Vessel based and airborne methods are expensive with less area coverage. This process also consumes more time. For ocean applications such as oil spill and Ship detection, optical sensors cannot image during bad weather. As SAR is an active sensor, weather independent, and has cloud penetrating capability, the images can be acquired during the day as well as at night. Radar Remote Sensing (RRS) has rapidly gained popularity for monitoring and detection of oil spills and ships for more than a decade. With the availability of the satellite images, detection of oil spill has improved due to its wide coverage and less revisit time. The present paper gives an overview of the methodologies used to detect oil spills on the SAR images using dualpol Sentinel-1A Level 1 SLC data. This work clearly demonstrates the preprocessing steps of the Sentinel 1A data for oil spill detection. The oil spill was only visible in the VV channel, therefore, for ocean application VV channel image is preferred. SEASAT was the first space-borne SAR mission launched in 1978 by NASA to observe sea surface. The preprocessing was carried out at the European Space Agency (ESA), the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) toolbox and Envi 5.1 toolbox. Based on the Sigma naught values, oil spill can be discriminated with the ocean surface. The results obtained with the VV channel are satisfactory and one could map out the oil spill very well. Supervised classifiers SVM and NN were applied on the boxcar filtered 3 x 3 VV channel image to delineate the oil spill. The result of oil spill detection mapping is validated with Supervised SVM and Neural Network classifiers. The results show there is a good agreement between oil spill mapping and classified image using SVM and NN classified images. The Overall Accuracy (OA) obtained using SVM classifier is 98.13% with kappa coefficient as 0.95 and using NN classifier is 98.11% with kappa coefficients 0.95. This technique is considered to be a potential proxy for the detection and monitoring of Oil spills on water bodies. Application of SAR data for oil spill detection is considered to be first of its kind from Indian coasts. This study aims to detect the oil spill occurred due to collision of two LPG tankers with Sentinel-1A SLC data in Chennai coast area.

TI  - Supervised classification of slush and ponded water on Antarctic ice shelves using Landsat 8 imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface meltwater is becoming increasingly widespread on Antarctic ice shelves. It is stored within surface ponds and streams, or within firn pore spaces, which may saturate to form slush. Slush can reduce firn air content, increasing an ice-shelf's vulnerability to break-up. To date, no study has mapped the changing extent of slush across ice shelves. Here, we use Google Earth Engine and Landsat 8 images from six ice shelves to generate training classes using a k-means clustering algorithm, which are used to train a random forest classifier to identify both slush and ponded water. Validation using expert elicitation gives accuracies of 84% and 82% for the ponded water and slush classes, respectively. Errors result from subjectivity in identifying the ponded water/slush boundary, and from inclusion of cloud and shadows. We apply our classifier to the Roi Baudouin Ice Shelf for the entire 2013-20 Landsat 8 record. On average, 64% of all surface meltwater is classified as slush and 36% as ponded water. Total meltwater areal extent is greatest between late January and mid-February. This highlights the importance of mapping slush when studying surface meltwater on ice shelves. Future research will apply the classifier across all Antarctic ice shelves.

TI  - Convection of waters in Lakes Maninjau and Singkarak, tropical oligomictic lakes
T2  - LIMNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The ecology of a lake is mainly controlled by mixing processes; particularly, in tropical oligomictic lakes, the occurrence frequency and magnitude of convection govern the vertical mixing of chemicals and organisms. In this study, vertical profiles of water temperature, dissolved oxygen, electric conductivity, turbidity, and chlorophyll a were measured in 2014, 2015, 2017, and 2018 in two Sumatran deep lakes, Lakes Maninjau and Singkarak. In Lake Maninjau, intensive surveys on the profiles were also conducted in three different seasons in 2018. The comparison of the profiles between 2015 and 2017 indicated the events of large convection down to the lake bottoms happened in both of the lakes. Similarly, small convection down to around 30 m depth was found in the period between May and Jul, 2018. Air temperature drops up to five degrees centigrade were observed in these periods, confirmed by the changes in lake surface temperature estimated by MODIS imagery for the lakes. The magnitudes of the convective events were discussed with the observed amounts of heat loss and the estimated heat transfer through lake surface. Furthermore, the influences of such events on anoxic hypolimnetic waters were evaluated and considered from the view of climate change.

TI  - Remote Sensing Data Detection Based on Multiscale Fusion and Attention Mechanism
T2  - MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing images are often of low quality due to the limitations of the equipment, resulting in poor image accuracy, and it is extremely difficult to identify the target object when it is blurred or small. The main challenge is that objects in sensing images have very few pixels. Traditional convolutional networks are complicated to extract enough information through local convolution and are easily disturbed by noise points, so they are usually not ideal for classifying and diagnosing small targets. The current solution is to process the feature map information at multiple scales, but this method does not consider the supplementary effect of the context information of the feature map on the semantics. In this work, in order to enable CNNs to make full use of context information and improve its representation ability, we propose a residual attention function fusion method, which improves the representation ability of feature maps by fusing contextual feature map information of different scales, and then propose a spatial attention mechanism for global pixel point convolution response. This method compresses global pixels through convolution, weights the original feature map pixels, reduces noise interference, and improves the network's ability to grasp global critical pixel information. In experiments, the remote sensing ship image recognition experiments on remote sensing image data sets show that the network structure can improve the performance of small-target detection. The results on cifar10 and cifar100 prove that the attention mechanism is universal and practical.

TI  - Global daily 1 km land surface precipitation based on cloud cover-informed downscaling
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - High-resolution climatic data are essential to many questions and applications in environmental research and ecology. Here we develop and implement a new semi-mechanistic downscaling approach for daily precipitation estimate that incorporates high resolution (30 arcsec, approximate to 1 km) satellite-derived cloud frequency. The downscaling algorithm incorporates orographic predictors such as wind fields, valley exposition, and boundary layer height, with a subsequent bias correction. We apply the method to the ERA5 precipitation archive and MODIS monthly cloud cover frequency to develop a daily gridded precipitation time series in 1 km resolution for the years 2003 onward. Comparison of the predictions with existing gridded products and station data from the Global Historical Climate Network indicates an improvement in the spatio-temporal performance of the downscaled data in predicting precipitation. Regional scrutiny of the cloud cover correction from the continental United States further indicates that CHELSA-EarthEnv performs well in comparison to other precipitation products. The CHELSA-EarthEnv daily precipitation product improves the temporal accuracy compared with a large improvement in the spatial accuracy especially in complex terrain.

TI  - Spatiotemporal distribution of seasonal snow water equivalent in High Mountain Asia from an 18-year Landsat-MODIS era snow reanalysis dataset
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal snowpack is an essential component in the hydrological cycle and plays a significant role in supplying water resources to downstream users. Yet the snow water equivalent (SWE) in seasonal snowpacks, and its space-time variation, remains highly uncertain, especially over mountainous areas with complex terrain and sparse observations, such as in High Mountain Asia (HMA). In this work, we assessed the spatio-temporal distribution of seasonal SWE, obtained from a new 18-year HMA Snow Reanalysis (HMASR) dataset, as part of the recent NASA High Mountain Asia Team (HiMAT) effort. A Bayesian snow reanalysis scheme previously developed to assimilate satellite-derived fractional snow-covered area (fSCA) products from Landsat and MODIS platforms has been applied to develop the HMASR dataset (at a spatial resolution of 16 arcsec (similar to 500 m) and daily temporal resolution) over the joint Landsat-MODIS period covering water years (WYs) 2000-2017.Based on the results, the HMA-wide total SWE volume is found to be around 163 km(3) on average and ranges from 114 km(3) (WY2001) to 227 km(3) (WY2005) when assessed over 18 WYs. The most abundant snowpacks are found in the northwestern basins (e.g., Indus, Syr Darya and Amu Darya) that are mainly affected by the westerlies, accounting for around 66 % of total seasonal SWE volume. Seasonal snowpack in HMA is depicted by snow accumulating through October to March and April, typically peaking around April and depleting in July-October, with variations across basins and WYs. When examining the elevational distribution over the HMA domain, seasonal SWE volume peaks at mid-elevations (around 3500 m), with over 50 % of the volume stored above 3500 m. Above-average amounts of precipitation causes significant overall increase in SWE volumes across all elevations, while an increase in air temperature (similar to 1.5 K) from cooler to normal conditions leads to an redistribution in snow storage from lower elevations to mid-elevations.This work brings new insight into understanding the climatology and variability of seasonal snowpack over HMA, with the regional snow reanalysis constrained by remotesensing data, providing a new reference dataset for future studies of seasonal snow and how it contributes to the water cycle and climate over the HMA region.

TI  - Vegetation dynamics in response to human and climatic factors in the Tanzanian Coast
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study of vegetation dynamics in the coastal region of Tanzania provides a fundamental basis to better understand the nature of the factors that underlie observed changes. The Tanzanian coast, rich in biodiversity, is economically and environmentally important although the understanding of the nature and causes of vegetation change is very limited. This paper presents an investigation of the relationship between vegetation dynamics in response to climate variations and human activities using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), meteorological, and Globeland30 Landsat data sets. Spatio-temporal trends and the relationship of NDVI to selected meteorological variables were statistically analyzed for the period 2000-2018 using the Mann-Kendall test and Pearson correlation respectively. The results reveal a significant positive trend in temperature (beta > 0, Z = 2.87) and a non-significant trend in precipitation (|Z| < 1.96). A positive relationship between NDVI and precipitation is observed. Coastal Tanzania has therefore experienced increased temperatures and variable moisture conditions which threaten natural vegetation and ecosystems at large. Classified land cover maps obtained from GlobeLand30 were analyzed to identify the nature and scale of human impact on the land. The analysis of land use and land cover in the region reveals an increase in cultivated land, shrubland, grassland, built-up land and bare land, while forests, wetland and water all decreased between 2000 and 2020. The decrease in forest vegetation is attributable to the fact that most livelihoods in the region are dependent on agriculture and harvesting of forest products (firewood, timber, charcoal). The findings of this study highlight the need for appropriate land-use planning and sustainable utilization of forest resources.

TI  - Spatiotemporal analysis of COVID-19, air pollution, climate, and meteorological conditions in a metropolitan region of Iran
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has a close relationship with local environmental conditions. This study explores the effects of climate characteristics and air pollution on COVID-19 in Isfahan province, Iran. A number of COVID-19 positive cases, main air pollutants, air quality index (AQI), and climatic variables were received from March 1, 2020, to January 19, 2021. Moreover, CO, NO2, and O-3 tropospheric levels were collected using Sentinel-5P satellite data. The spatial distribution of variables was estimated by the ordinary Kriging and inverse weighted distance (IDW) models. A generalized linear model (GLM) was used to analyze the relationship between environmental variables and COVID-19. The seasonal trend of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), wind speed, solar energy, and rainfall like COVID-19 was upward in spring and summer. The high and low temperatures increased from April to August. All variables had a spatial autocorrelation and clustered pattern except AQI. Furthermore, COVID-19 showed a significant association with month, climate, solar energy, and NO2. Suitable policy implications are recommended to be performed for improving people's healthcare and control of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study could survey the local spread of COVID-19, with consideration of the effect of environmental variables, and provides helpful information to health ministry decisions for mitigating harmful effects of environmental change. By means of the proposed approach, probably the COVID-19 spread can be recognized by knowing the regional climate in major cities. The present study also finds that COVID-19 may have an effect on climatic condition and air pollutants.

TI  - Forecasting and Evaluation of Impacts and Risk Due to Tidal Anomalies on a Coastal Island
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessment and forecasting of exposures, vulnerability and risks due to natural forces are important for the survival and adaptation of local communities. This research intends to understand the risk and impact associated with sea level rise and tidal amplitude on a coastal island located in the cyclogenesis area of the Bay of Bengal. Three scenarios were developed based on tidal amplitudes of 2 m, 4 m and 6 m, respectively, relative to the observed tide heights during extreme events. Land use analysis indicated a severe loss of natural vegetation in the last century, i.e. from 103 to 9 km(2) with an increase in cultivated spaces by 69 km(2), and in the last 8 years, post-cyclone Aila built-up spaces have increased by 4.7 km(2) (2012-2020). Local topography derived from stereo satellite data and the N8 connectivity bathtub model was used to determine flood inundations for various surge amplitudes. Analysis indicates the rising sea levels would inundate additional 275 ha of coastal lands, and built-up spaces would increase by 17.8 km(2) by 2050. Exposure assessment illustrates that during severe cyclonic events and super cyclonic events, tides engulf 27-187.7 km(2) landmass in the current era (2020), while by 2050, the cumulative effect of the surge and sea level rise would lead to exposure of 35.7-203.8 km(2) of the landscape. Risk assessment shows that during a less intense severe cyclonic event, 19.5 ha (2020) and 36.8 ha (2050) of built-up areas towards the east coast would be under high risk, whereas in extremely severe events, the built-up spaces under high risk would increase to 127 ha (2020) and 166 ha (2050) across the island. The analysis shows the importance of forecasting exposures and risks due to the variations in climate and landscapes. The frequency and intensity of low pressures cyclones in the cyclogenesis area are increasing with time.

TI  - TanDEM-X PolarDEM 90 m of Antarctica: generation and error characterization
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - We present the generation and validation of an updated version of the TanDEM-X digital elevation model (DEM) of Antarctica: the TanDEM-X PolarDEM 90 m of Antarctica. Improvements compared to the global TanDEM-X DEM version comprise filling gaps with newer bistatic synthetic aperture radar (SAR) acquisitions of the TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X satellites, interpolation of smaller voids, smoothing of noisy areas, and replacement of frozen or open sea areas with geoid undulations. For the latter, a new semi-automatic editing approach allowed for the delineation of the coastline from DEM and amplitude data. Finally, the DEM was transformed into the cartographic Antarctic Polar Stereographic projection with a homogeneous metric spacing in northing and easting of 90 m. As X-band SAR penetrates the snow and ice pack by several meters, a new concept for absolute height adjustment was set up that relies on areas with stable penetration conditions and on ICESat (Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite) elevations. After DEM generation and editing, a sophisticated height error characterization of the whole Antarctic continent with ICESat data was carried out, and a validation over blue ice achieved a mean vertical height error of just -0.3 m +/-( )2.5 m standard deviation. The filled and edited Antarctic TanDEM-X PolarDEM 90 m is outstanding due to its accuracy, homogeneity, and coverage completeness. It is freely available for scientific purposes and provides a high-resolution data set as basis for polar research, such as ice velocity, mass balance estimation, or orthorectification.

TI  - Urbanization favors the proliferation of Aedesaegypti and Culexquinquefasciatus in urban areas of Miami-Dade County, Florida.
T2  - Scientific Reports
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization processes are increasing globally. Anthropogenic alterations in the environment have profound effects on biodiversity. Decreased biodiversity due to biotic homogenization processes as a consequence of urbanization often result in increased levels of mosquito vector species and vector-borne pathogen transmission. Understanding how anthropogenic alterations in the environment will affect the abundance, richness, and composition of vector mosquito species is crucial for the implementation of effective and targeted mosquito control strategies. We hypothesized that anthropogenic alterations in the environment are responsible for increasing the abundance of mosquito species that are adapted to urban environments such as Aedesaegypti and Culexquinquefasciatus. Therefore, our objective was to survey mosquito relative abundance, richness, and community composition in Miami-Dade County, Florida, in areas with different levels of urbanization. We selected 24 areas, 16 remote areas comprised of natural and rural areas, and 8 urban areas comprised of residential and touristic areas in Miami-Dade County, Florida. Mosquitoes were collected weekly in each area for 24 h for 5 consecutive weeks from August to October 2020 using BG-Sentinel traps baited with dry ice. A total of 36,645 mosquitoes were collected, from which 34,048 were collected in the remote areas and 2,597 in the urban areas. Our results show a clear and well-defined pattern of abundance, richness, and community composition according to anthropogenic modifications in land use and land cover. The more urbanized a given area the fewer species were found and those were primary vectors of arboviruses, Ae.aegypti and Cx.quinquefasciatus.

TI  - Capture of decline in spring phytoplankton biomass derived from COVID-19 lockdown effect in the Yellow Sea offshore waters
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The Yellow Sea, characterized as a high-productivity ecosystem, is considered to be significantly attributable to high nutrient supply via atmospheric deposition. We observed a significant decline in phytoplankton biomass (similar to 30%) over the Yellow Sea during February-May 2020 (period of COVID-19 lockdown effect) compared to the same period in 2015-2019 (period of no effect of COVID-19 lockdown). Several possible factors, such as vari-ations in irradiance, vertical mixing, and river discharges, were not major contributors. Through the analysis of transportation and the constituents of atmospheric pollutants from Northern China (main source regions) to the Yellow Sea, we suggest that the decline in phytoplankton biomass over the Yellow Sea is mainly attributed to decreased atmospheric nutrient deposition due to the COVID-19 lockdown effect, because of decreased anthropogenic emissions in Northern China. Thus, attention should be focused on the Yellow Sea ecosystem response to increasing anthropogenic activities by lifting the COVID-19 lockdown restrictions.

TI  - Axillary Recurrence in Sentinel Lymph Node-Negative Breast Cancer Patients in a Tertiary Referral Cancer Centre
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy is the standard of care for axillary staging in clinically node-negative breast cancer. SLNB is predictive of axillary node status. Major concern is the occurrence of a false negative SLN. The objective of this study is to determine the rate of axillary recurrence in our series of patients in Indian cohort. The present study was conducted at Manipal Comprehensive Cancer Centre, Manipal Hospital, Bengaluru, a tertiary referral cancer centre in India, from Jan 2008 through December 2018. A total of 496 patients diagnosed with early breast cancer with clinically negative axilla underwent the SLNB procedure using both ICG and dual dye. Four hundred ninety-six patients with negative SLNB did not receive ALND. After a median follow-up of 48.8 months, 18 patients had distant metastases, one had axillary relapse, and 13 had an in-breast recurrence. The patients with axillary recurrence received axillary dissection and systemic adjuvant therapy. Data from this series, thus, showed that isolated axillary node recurrence after negative SLNB is rare (< 1%) and comparable with referral cancer institutions.

TI  - Determination of urban pollution islands by using remote sensing technology in Moscow, Russia
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Pollution of the atmosphere with harmful substances is currently the most dangerous form of degradation of the natural environment in Russia. The peculiarities of the environmental situation and the emerging environmental problems in some areas of the Russian Federation are caused by local natural conditions and the nature of the impacts from industries, transport, utilities, and agriculture (the specifics of enterprises, their capacity, location, technologies used). As a rule, the magnitude of air pollution depends on the degree of urbanization and anthropogenic transformation of the territory and climatic conditions that determine the potential for atmospheric pollution. During high-temperature technological processes, the smallest aerosol particles (0.5..0.10 mu m) formed, poorly captured by gas purification plants, and can migrate in the atmosphere for considerable distances. Larger particles (2.5 mu m and above) are formed due to the mechanical decomposition of solid particles and enter the atmosphere due to wind erosion, the dusting of dirt roads, the erasure of vehicle tires. The particles suspended with a diameter of not more than 2.5 mu m (PMX) are the most destructive to health since they penetrate and get deposited deep into human lungs. These microns, present in a suspended state in the air, consist of a complex mixture of large and small, solid and liquid particles, of both inorganic and organic substances. The boundary between the two fractions is usually particles with a diameter of 2.5 mu m (PM2.5). This study sought to build a model for determining fine dust PM2.5 in the Moscow air environment using Landsat 8 OLI satellite image channels and data on the concentrations of fine dust PM2.5 obtained by weather stations in the city. In addition, a correlation analysis was carried out to determine a regression model for studying the dispersion of fine dust in the city. The results obtained are presented on a map of the concentration of fine dust PM2.5 in Moscow, supporting management decisions and decision-making on environmental policy in urban planning.

AB  - This study evaluated historical land-cover states in order to identify potential land-use transition regimes leading to land degradation. Landsat satellite datasets were used to characterize land-cover states for 1986-2017 period. The multinomial probability distribution was used to establish sample size for training and accuracy assessment. Using a hybrid image classification approach, individual satellite images were initially clustered using the ISODATA technique, and spectral classes later transformed posteriori into respective thematic classes. Maximum Likelihood Function was subsequently used to assign pixels into classes with highest probability. Approximately 12% of mixed forest declined, while cropland increased by 30% between 1995-2008.

TI  - A deep learning hybrid predictive modeling (HPM) approach for estimating evapotranspiration and ecosystem respiration
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is reshaping vulnerable ecosystems, leading to uncertain effects on ecosystem dynamics, including evapotranspiration (ET) and ecosystem respiration (R-eco). However, accurate estimation of ET and R-eco still remains challenging at sparsely monitored watersheds, where data and field instrumentation are limited. In this study, we developed a hybrid predictive modeling approach (HPM) that integrates eddy covariance measurements, physically based model simulation results, meteorological forcings, and remote-sensing datasets to estimate ET and R-eco in high space-time resolution. HPM relies on a deep learning algorithm and long short-term memory (LSTM) and requires only air temperature, precipitation, radiation, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and soil temperature (when available) as input variables. We tested and validated HPM estimation results in different climate regions and developed four use cases to demonstrate the applicability and variability of HPM at various FLUXNET sites and Rocky Mountain SNOTEL sites in Western North America. To test the limitations and performance of the HPM approach in mountainous watersheds, an expanded use case focused on the East River Watershed, Colorado, USA. The results indicate HPM is capable of identifying complicated interactions among meteorological forcings, ET, and R-eco variables, as well as providing reliable estimation of ET and R-eco across relevant spatiotemporal scales, even in challenging mountainous systems. The study documents that HPM increases our capability to estimate ET and R-eco and enhances process understanding at sparsely monitored watersheds.

TI  - Monitoring soil salinization and its spatiotemporal variation at different depths across the Yellow River Delta based on remote sensing data with multi-parameter optimization
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization is recognized as a key issue negatively affecting agricultural productivity and wetland ecology. It is necessary to develop effective methods for monitoring the spatiotemporal distribution of soil salinity at a regional scale. In this study, we proposed an optimized remote sensing-based model for detecting soil salinity in different depths across the Yellow River Delta (YRD), China. A multi-dimensional model was built for mapping soil salinity, in which five types of predictive factors derived from Landsat satellite images were exacted and tested, 94 in-situ measured soil salinity samples with depths of 30-40 cm and 90-100 cm were collected to establish and validate the predicting model result. By comparing multiple linear regression (MLR) and partial least squares regression (PLSR) models with considering the correlation between predictive factors and soil salinity, we established the optimized prediction model which integrated the multi-parameter (including SWIR1, SI9, MSAVI, Albedo, and SDI) optimization approach to detect soil salinization in the YRD from 2003 to 2018. The results indicated that the estimates of soil salinity by the optimized prediction model were in good agreement with the measured soil salinity. The accuracy of the PLSR model performed better than that of the MLR model, with the R-2 of 0.642, RMSE of 0.283, and MAE of 0.213 at 30-40 cm depth, and with the R-2 of 0.450, RMSE of 0.276, and MAE of 0.220 at 90-100 cm depth. From 2003 to 2018, the soil salinity showed a distinct spatial heterogeneity. The soil salinization level of the coastal shoreline was higher; in contrast, lower soil salinization level occurred in the central YRD. In the last 15 years, the soil salinity at depth of 30-40 cm experienced a decreased trend of fluctuating, while the soil salinity at depth of 90-100 cm showed fluctuating increasing trend.

T2  - DISASTER MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH PREPAREDNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The number of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases and deaths registered in Mexico during 2020 could be underestimated, due to the sentinel surveillance adopted in this country. Some consequences of following this type of epidemiological surveillance were the high case fatality rate and the high positivity rate for COVID-19 shown in Mexico in 2020. During this year, the Mexican Ministry of Health only considered cases from the public health system, which followed this sentinel surveillance, but did not consider those cases from the private health system. To better understand this pandemic, it is important to include all the results obtained by all the institutions capable of testing for COVID-19; thus, the Mexican Government could then make good decisions to protect the population from this disease.

TI  - Distinct influenza surveillance networks and their agreement in recording regional influenza circulation: Experience from Southeast Michigan
T2  - INFLUENZA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY VIRUSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction In Southeast Michigan, active surveillance studies monitor influenza activity in hospitals, ambulatory clinics, and community households. Across five respiratory seasons, we assessed the contribution of data from each of the three networks towards improving our overall understanding of regional influenza circulation. Methods All three networks used case definitions for acute respiratory illness (ARI) and molecularly tested for influenza from research-collected respiratory specimens. Age- and network-stratified epidemic curves were created for influenza A and B. We compared stratified epidemic curves visually and by centering at seasonal midpoints. Results Across all seasons (from 2014/2015 through 2018/2019), epidemic curves from each of the three networks were comparable in terms of both timing and magnitude. Small discrepancies in epidemics recorded by each network support previous conclusions about broader characteristics of particular influenza seasons. Conclusion Influenza surveillance systems based in hospital, ambulatory clinic, and community household settings appear to provide largely similar information regarding regional epidemic activity. Together, multiple levels of influenza surveillance provide a detailed view of regional influenza epidemics, but a single surveillance system-regardless of population subgroup monitored-appears to be sufficient in providing vital information regarding community influenza epidemics.

TI  - Seasonal evolution of Antarctic supraglacial lakes in 2015-2021 and links to environmental controls
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Supraglacial meltwater accumulation on ice shelves may have important implications for future sea level rise. Despite recent progress in the understanding of Antarctic surface hydrology, potential influences on ice shelf stability as well as links to environmental drivers remain poorly constrained. In this study, we employ state-of-the-art machine learning on Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical Sentinel-2 satellite imagery to provide new insight into the inter-annual and intra-annual evolution of surface hydrological features across six major Antarctic Peninsula and East Antarctic ice shelves. For the first time, we produce a high-resolution record of supraglacial lake extent dynamics for the period 2015-2021 at unprecedented 10m spatial resolution and bi-weekly temporal scale. Through synergetic use of optical and SAR data, we obtain a more complete mapping record also enabling the delineation of buried lakes. Our results for Antarctic Peninsula ice shelves reveal below-average meltwater ponding during most of melting seasons 2015-2018 and above-average meltwater ponding throughout summer 2019-2020 and early 2020-2021 considering years 2015-2021 as a reference period. Meltwater ponding on investigated East Antarctic ice shelves was far more variable, with above-average lake extents during most 2016-2019 melting seasons and below-average lake extents during 2020-2021, considering the reference interval 2016-2021. This study is the first to investigate relationships with climate drivers both spatially and temporally including time lag analysis. The results indicate that supraglacial lake formation in 2015-2021 is coupled to the complex interplay of local, regional and large-scale environmental drivers with similar driving factors over both ice sheet regions. In particular, varying air temperature, solar radiation and wind conditions influenced supraglacial lake formation over all six ice shelves despite strong local to regional discrepancies, as revealed through pixel-based correlation analysis. Furthermore, regional climatic conditions were shown to be influenced by Southern Hemisphere atmospheric modes showing large-scale impacts on the spatio-temporal evolution of supraglacial lakes as well as on above- or below-average meltwater ponding with respect to the period 2015-2021. Finally, the local glaciological setting, including melt-albedo feedbacks and the firn air content, was revealed to strongly influence supraglacial lake distribution. Recent increases in Antarctic Peninsula surface ponding point towards a further reduction in the firn air content, implying an increased risk for ponding and hydrofracture. In addition, lateral meltwater transport was observed over both Antarctic regions with similar implications for future ice shelf stability.

TI  - Internal Solitary Waves Observed on the Continental Shelf in the Northern South China Sea From Acoustic Backscatter Data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Internal solitary waves (ISWs) are investigated offshore of Guangdong in the northern South China Sea (SCS) using high-frequency acoustic backscatter data of 100 kHz acquired in July 2020. Simultaneous XBT profiles and satellite images are incorporated to understand their propagation, evolution, and dissipation processes in shallow water at depths less than 50 m. The water column structures revealed by acoustic backscatter data and XBT profiles are consistent with a small difference of less than 3 m. A soliton train with apparent vertical and horizontal scales of similar to 7 and 100 m, respectively, is captured three times in 20 h in the repeated acoustic sections, which provides spatiotemporal constraints to the solitons. The characteristics of ISW phase speeds are estimated from acoustic backscatter data and satellite data and using theoretical two-layer Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) and extended KdV (eKdV) models. The acoustically observed phase speed of ISWs is approximately 0.4-0.5 m/s, in agreement with the estimates from both satellite data and model results. The shallow solar-heated water in summer (similar to 10-20 m) lying on the bottom cold water is responsible for the extensive occurrence of ISWs in the study region. ISWs are dissipated at the transition zone between the heated surface water and the upwelled water, forming a wide ISW dissipation zone in the coastal area, as observed from satellites. The acoustic backscatter method could be an effective way to observe ISWs with high resolution in shallow water and thus a potential compensatory technique for imaging the shallow blind zone of so-called seismic oceanography.

TI  - Evaluation of apical clips placed during axillary dissection demonstrates potential under-coverage of axillary radiation therapy target volumes during breast cancer regional nodal irradiation
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL IMAGING AND RADIATION ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Evidence-based AustralianAQ5 guidelines (eviQ) recommend adjuvant supraclavicular fossa irradiation after axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in node-positive breast cancer patients. Disparity between surgically determined versus computed tomography (CT) determined nodal volumes may result in discontiguous nodal volumes and untreated nodal tissue. We examine the extent of untreated nodal tissue in women with breast cancer post-level II or III ALND and adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) using ESTRO contouring guidelines. Methods Female breast cancer patients who underwent level II and III ALND with apical clip placement from 2016 to 2020 and CT simulated in supine position were included. CT-defined axillary level II-IV volumes were contoured using ESTRO guidelines. The distance between the apical clip and RT nodal volumes was measured to indicate extent of untreated tissue. Results Of 34 eligible patients treated by 7 surgeons, 76% had level II ALND and 24% level III ALND. Only 5.9% of clips entirely encompassed the corresponding RT nodal volumes. 55.9% of clips fell within and 44.1% fell inferolaterally outside the corresponding RT nodal volumes. A median 3.6 cm (range 0-7.5 cm) of undissected nodal tissue would not be included within standard RT target volumes following eviQ recommendations. Conclusion There is a disparity between surgically determined versus CT determined axillary nodal volumes, leading to discontiguous nodal volumes and untreated axillary nodal tissue, despite following standard radiation contouring guidelines. Intraoperatively placed apical axillary clips may assist radiation oncologists to accurately delineate undissected nodal tissues at risk.

TI  - Artificial resting sites: An alternative sampling method for adult mosquitoes
T2  - MEDICAL AND VETERINARY ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mosquito collections are commonly conducted with baited traps predominantly attracting host-seeking females. In contrast, resting sites are generally colonized by a broader range of the mosquito population, including a higher proportion of males and blood-engorged females. This study evaluates the sampling success of different artificial resting sites, attached to a deciduous or coniferous tree at different heights. As standard sampling method, carbon dioxide-baited Biogents Sentinel traps (BG traps) were operated in parallel. BG traps caught a higher number of specimens compared to the resting sites. However, the proportion of blood-engorged females and males was higher in resting sites. More Culiseta spp. specimens were collected in resting sites compared to BG traps, but less Aedes spp. specimens. In general, fewer specimens and species were recorded in small resting sites and at top height level compared to medium or large resting sites at medium or ground level. The proportion of males was highest at the ground, while the proportion of engorged females was highest at medium and top level. Due to the higher proportion of blood-engorged females, artificial resting sites are especially useful for studies of host-feeding patterns or xenosurveillance. Low costs and efforts allow a cost-effective increase of the number of resting sites per sampling site to collect more mosquitoes.

TI  - Carbon response of tundra ecosystems to advancing greenup and snowmelt in Alaska
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The ongoing disproportionate increases in temperature and precipitation over the Arctic region may greatly alter the latitudinal gradients in greenup and snowmelt timings as well as associated carbon dynamics of tundra ecosystems. Here we use remotely-sensed and ground-based datasets and model results embedding snowmelt timing in phenology at seven tundra flux tower sites in Alaska during 2001-2018, showing that the carbon response to early greenup or delayed snowmelt varies greatly depending upon local climatic limits. Increases in net ecosystem productivity (NEP) due to early greenup were amplified at the higher latitudes where temperature and water strongly colimit vegetation growth, while NEP decreases due to delayed snowmelt were alleviated by a relief of water stress. Given the high likelihood of more frequent delayed snowmelt at higher latitudes, this study highlights the importance of understanding the role of snowmelt timing in vegetation growth and terrestrial carbon cycles across warming Arctic ecosystems.The ongoing disproportionate increases in temperature and precipitation in the Alaska may alter the latitudinal gradients in greenup and snowmelt timings as well as carbon dynamics. With a broad range of datasets and model results, the authors show that the carbon response to early greenup or delayed snowmelt varies greatly depending upon local climatic limits.

TI  - Strong thermal stratification reduces detection efficiency and range of acoustic telemetry in a large freshwater lake
T2  - ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The successful use of acoustic telemetry to detect fish hinges on understanding the factors that control the acoustic range. The speed-of-sound in water is primarily a function of density, and in freshwater lakes density is primarily driven by temperature. The strong seasonal thermal stratification in the Great Lakes represent some of the steepest sound speed gradients in any aquatic system. Such speed-of-sound gradients can refract sound waves leading to greater divergence of acoustic signal, and hence more rapid attenuation. The changes in sound attenuation change the detection range of a telemetry array and hence influence the ability to monitor fish. We use 3 months of data from a sentinel array of V9 and V16 Vemco acoustic fish tags, and a record of temperature profiles to determine how changes in stratification influence acoustic range in eastern Lake Ontario. Result We interpret data from an acoustic telemetry array in Lake Ontario to show that changes in acoustic detection efficiency and range correlate strongly with changes in sound speed gradients due to thermal stratification. The steepest sound speed gradients of 10.38 m s(-1)/m crossing the thermocline occurred in late summer, which caused the sound speed difference between the top and bottom of the water column to be greater than 60 m/s. V9 tags transmitting across the thermocline could have their acoustic range reduced from > 650 m to 350 m, while the more powerful V16 tags had their range reduced from > 650 m to 450 m. In contrast we found that when the acoustic source and receiver were both transmitting below thermocline there was no change in range, even as the strength of sound speed gradient varied. Conclusion Changes in thermal stratification occur routinely in the Great Lakes, on timescales between months and days. The acoustic range can be reduced by as much as 50% compared to unstratified conditions when fish move across the thermocline. We recommend that researchers consider the influences of thermal stratification to acoustic telemetry when configuring receiver position.

AB  - With social and economic development and population growth, a series of human activities have intensified the destruction and degradation of muddy coastal wetlands, thus it is necessary to strengthen their protection and restoration. Hydrological connectivity is a basic condition for the existence and restoration of wetland ecosystems. This study selected the northern buffer zone of Yancheng National Nature Reserve (YNNR) as the research area. Combining field survey data with GF-2 remote sensing data, hydrological structure and process connectivity were integrated to evaluate the hydrological connectivity through internal and land-sea aspects. On this basis, the restoration priority area and the easy restoration area were determined by hot spot analysis and minimum unit of restoration. Our results showed that: 1) the hydrological connectivity within the region was great, with most of the total area. Land use types had a greater impact on the hydrological connectivity, and the hydrological connectivity of the farming pond area were generally higher than for farmland; 2) the sea-land hydrological connectivity decreased from the sea to the land, which was vertical with the coastal seawall, but the rate of change varied.; 3) the hydrological connectivity hotspot analysis showed that the site of the level 1 priority restoration was almost the same as the salt water dominant restoration area; the priority level 2 was in the freshwater dominant restoration area, accounting for 8.87% of the area; 4) the easy-to-restore areas were mainly distributed in the priority restoration areas of level 1-3, with an area of 11.7 km2, accounting for 6% of the study area. These research results can provide a better scientific basis for regional muddy wetland restoration planning activities.

TI  - A Pilot Study Evaluating Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Using Dual Dye Technique with ICG and Methylene Blue for Early Breast Carcinoma (EBC)
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node can be identified in almost 97% patients by using dual dye technique. Radiocolloid with blue dye is the gold standard technique. However, indocyanine green (ICG) with blue dye has reported good results in recent studies. Therefore, we aimed to estimate the sentinel lymph node (SLN) identification rates with dual dye technique using ICG and methylene blue among node-negative early breast cancer (EBC) patients undergoing surgery. In EBC patients undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), the combination of ICG with methylene blue was used. The SLN outcome data using dual dye technique was studied. Sixty-four patients underwent SLNB in between April 2019 and July 2020. The sentinel lymph node identification rate using dual dye was 95.3%. This was higher than blue dye alone (87.5%) and ICG alone (92.2%) techniques. In post neoadjuvant therapy (NACT) subset, SLN identification rate using dual dye was 91%. Median SLN harvest using ICG was three. The SLN identification rates with ICG and blue dye are comparable to the gold standard radiocolloid and blue dye technique. In comparison to radiocolloid, ICG can be considered superior in terms of its safety, easy availability, and low cost.

TI  - Sentinel mutations: the roses in the vineyard Comment
T2  - BLOOD
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - A central challenge in the care of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) is identifying those individuals at high risk for transformation into acute leukemia, an exacerbation that carries a very poor prognosis.(1) In this issue of Blood, Marcault and colleagues(2) describe a novel type of mutation, for which I propose the term "sentinel mutation" (see figure). The acquisition of a "sentinel mutation" drastically increases the likelihood of leukemic transformation, even though in some patients the mutation does not occur in the cells that form the leukemic clone. "Sentinel mutations" function like roses planted in vineyards. Ailing flowers forecast the vines' impending infection with black rot or downy mildew as the roses are affected first, even if the species that blight the flowers differ slightly from those that spoil the grapes. Similarly, Marcault and colleagues have shown that patients with MPN that acquire mutations in the transcription factor "nuclear factor erythroid 2" (NFE2) carry an increased risk of leukemic transformation, even though in some patients the mutations are not found in the leukemic cells.

TI  - RODEO: An algorithm and Google Earth Engine application for river discharge retrieval from Landsat
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing of river discharge (RSQ) algorithms provide a useful source of observations to supplement river gauge records. RSQ algorithms have existed for over a decade yet their widespread use has been impeded by a lack of operational usability and quantitative characterization of uncertainty. Here we present RODEO, an algorithm for estimating river discharge using Landsat observations in near-real time. RODEO is validated with 456 gauges (median Kling-Gupta efficiency = 0.3) and uses a novel quantile rating curve technique that pairs Landsat river widths with discharge estimates from a global hydrologic model. RODEO also characterizes the uncertainty of RSQ estimates (estimated root-mean-square error = +7%), enabling RSQ retrievals to be used for data assimilation into hydrologic models. With the goal of expanding the RSQ user base, the RODEO algorithm is implemented as a freely available, off-the-shelf cloud-based Google Earth Engine application that provides RSQ estimates across North America from 1984-present.

TI  - Glacial Lake Area Change and Potential Outburst Flood Hazard Assessment in the Bhutan Himalaya
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Against the background of climate change-induced glacier melting, numerous glacial lakes are formed across high mountain areas worldwide. Existing glacial lake inventories, chiefly created using Landsat satellite imagery, mainly relate to 1990 onwards and relatively long (decadal) temporal scales. Moreover, there is a lack of robust information on the expansion and the GLOF hazard status of glacial lakes in the Bhutan Himalaya. We mapped Bhutanese glacial lakes from the 1960s to 2020, and used these data to determine their distribution patterns, expansion behavior, and GLOF hazard status. 2,187 glacial lakes (corresponding to 130.19 +/- 2.09 km(2)) were mapped from high spatial resolution (1.82-7.62 m), Corona KH-4 images from the 1960s. Using the Sentinel-2 (10 m) and Sentinel-1 (20 m x 22 m), we mapped 2,553 (151.81 +/- 7.76 km(2)), 2,566 (152.64 +/- 7.83 km(2)), 2,572 (153.94 +/- 7.83 km(2)), 2,569 (153.97 +/- 7.79 km(2)) and 2,574 (156.63 +/- 7.95 km(2)) glacial lakes in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. The glacier-fed lakes were mainly present in the Phochu (22.63%) and the Kurichu (20.66%) basins. A total of 157 glacier-fed lakes have changed into non-glacier-fed lakes over the 60 years of lake evolution. Glacier-connected lakes (which constitutes 42.25% of the total glacier-fed lake) area growth accounted for 75.4% of the total expansion, reaffirming the dominant role of glacier-melt water in expanding glacial lakes. Between 2016 and 2020, 19 (4.82 km(2)) new glacial lakes were formed with an average annual expansion rate of 0.96 km(2) per year. We identified 31 lakes with a very-high and 34 with high GLOF hazard levels. These very-high to high GLOF hazard lakes were primarily located in the Phochu, Kurichu, Drangmechu, and Mochu basins. We concluded that the increasing glacier melt is the main driver of glacial lake expansion. Our results imply that extending glacial lakes studies back to the 1960s provides new insights on glacial lake evolution from glacier-fed lakes to non-glacier-fed lakes. Additionally, we reaffirmed the capacity of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data to determine annual glacial lake changes. The results from this study can be a valuable basis for future glacial lake monitoring and prioritizing limited resources for GLOF mitigation programs.

TI  - Regional Morpho-Kinematic Inventory of Slope Movements in Northern Norway
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mountain slopes in periglacial environments are affected by frost- and gravity-driven processes that shape the landscape. Both rock glaciers and rockslides have been intensively inventoried worldwide. Although most inventories are traditionally based on morphologic criteria, kinematic approaches based on satellite remote sensing have more recently been used to identify moving landforms at the regional scale. In this study, we developed simplified Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) products to inventory ground velocity in a region in Northern Norway covering approximately 7,500 km(2). We used a multiple temporal baseline InSAR stacking procedure based on 2015-2019 ascending and descending Sentinel-1 images to take advantage of a large set of interferograms and exploit different detection capabilities. First, moving areas are classified according to six velocity brackets, and morphologically associated to six landform types (rock glaciers, rockslides, glaciers/moraines, talus/scree deposits, solifluction/cryoturbation and composite landforms). The kinematic inventory shows that the velocity ranges and spatial distribution of the different types of slope processes vary greatly within the study area. Second, we exploit InSAR to update pre-existing inventories of rock glaciers and rockslides in the region. Landform delineations and divisions are refined, and newly detected landforms (54 rock glaciers and 20 rockslides) are incorporated into the databases. The updated inventories consist of 414 rock glacier units within 340 single- or multi-unit(s) systems and 117 rockslides. A kinematic attribute assigned to each inventoried landform documents the order of magnitude of the creep rate. Finally, we show that topo-climatic variables influence the spatial distribution of the rock glaciers. Their mean elevation increases toward the continental interior with a dominance of relict landforms close to the land-sea margin and an increased occurrence of active landforms further inland. Both rock glaciers and rockslides are mostly located on west-facing slopes and in areas characterised by strongly foliated rocks, which suggests the influence of geological preconditioning factors. The study demonstrates the value of semi-quantitative InSAR products to characterise kinematic information at large scale and exploit the results for periglacial research. It highlights the complementarity of both kinematic and morphologic approaches for inventorying slope processes.

TI  - Responses of Xilingol Fractional Vegetation Cover to Climate Change and Human Activities
T2  - SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the MODIS NDVI product data source of Xilingol from 2010 to 2019, we use the pixel dichotomous model to retrieve the vegetation coverage in our study. The spatiotemporal changes of the vegetation cover were analyzed in the model by using the meteorological data from researched sites or the vicinal meteorological stations for evaluating the meteorological influence on the vegetation cover changes. Based on this, an evaluation method was established to estimate the relative influences of the climate changes and anthropogenic activities. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) Fractional vegetation cover in Xilingol was decreased from the northeast to the southwest. (2) The overall trend in Xilingol fractional vegetation cover in the 10-year period shows a fluctuating increasing trend. (3) An opposite distribution pattern was detected between mean precipitation and mean temperature in the study site. (4) Compared with temperature, annual precipitation has a higher correlation with fractional vegetation cover in the study site and is the main climatic factor that affects vegetation growth in the study site. (5) During the 10-year period in the study site, anthropogenic human activities have slightly greater inhibitory effects on vegetation growth than promoting effects. (6) Climate change is a major factor to accelerate grassland degradation from 2010 to 2019 in vegetation degradation regions. The promotion effect of precipitation on vegetation coverage is obviously higher than the limitation of human activities, which leads to the increase of vegetation coverage in 2010-2019.

TI  - Interannual measures of nutritional stress during a marine heatwave (the Blob) differ between two North Pacific seabird species.
T2  - Conservation Physiology
M3  - Article
AB  - 'The Blob', a mass of anomalously warm water in the Northeast Pacific Ocean peaking from 2014 to 2016, caused a decrease in primary productivity with cascading effects on the marine ecosystem. Among the more obvious manifestations of the event were seabird breeding failures and mass mortality events. Here, we used corticosterone in breast feathers (fCort), grown in the winter period during migration, as an indicator of nutritional stress to investigate the impact of the Blob on two sentinel Pacific auk species (family Alcidae). Feathers were collected from breeding females over 8 years from 2010 to 2017, encompassing the Blob period. Since Pacific auks replace body feathers at sea during the migratory period, measures of fCort provide an accumulated measure of nutritional stress or allostatic load during this time. Changes in diet were also measured using [delta]<sup>15</sup>N and [delta]<sup>13</sup>C values from feathers. Relative to years prior to the Blob, the primarily zooplanktivorous Cassin's auklets (Ptychoramphus aleuticus) had elevated fCort in 2014-2017, which correlated with the occurrence of the Blob and a recovery period afterwards, with relatively stable feather isotope values. In contrast, generalist rhinoceros auklets (Cerorhinca monocerata) displayed stable fCort values across years and increased [delta]<sup>15</sup>N values during the Blob. As marine heatwaves increase in intensity and frequency due to climate change, this study provides insight into the variable response of Pacific auks to such phenomena and suggests a means for monitoring population-level responses to climatological variation.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Positive Rate Predicts Non-Sentinel Lymph Node Metastasis in Breast Cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: To investigate retrospectively an association between the number of metastatic sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) per total number of SLNs per patient (i.e., the SLN positive rate, or SLN-PR) and non-SLN metastasis in breast cancer.Methods: A large population (n = 2250) underwent SLN dissection from January 1, 2014 to January 1, 2020; 627 (27.87%) had at least one positive SLN (SLN+). Among these, 283 underwent axillary lymph node (ALN) dissection, and formed the test group. Four external validation groups comprised 43 patients treated in 2019. SLN mappings were examined using methylene blue and indocyanine green. Lymph node ultrasound, SLN-PR, and pathological characteristics were compared between patients with and without non-SLN metastasis. An SLN-PR cutoff value was calculated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. As- sociations between clinicopathological variables and SLN-PR with non-SLN metastasis were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression model.Results: The median age was 47 years (IQR: 42-56 y). The median number of resected SLNs was 4. Patients with positive non-SLNs (126/283, 44.52%) had a median of 2 positive node. SLN-PR > 0.333 was a risk factor for non-SLN positivity (area under the ROC curve, 0.726); and carried significantly higher risk of non-SLN metastasis (P < 0.001). This was validated in the external group.Conclusions: SLN-PR > 0.333 was associated with greater risk of non-SLN metastasis. This provides a reference to non-SLN metastasis in patients with SLN metastasis, an indication for ALN dissection and choice of adjuvant treatment. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Self-controlled assessment of thromboembolic event (TEE) risk following intravenous immune globulin (IGIV) in the US (2006-2012)
T2  - JOURNAL OF THROMBOSIS AND THROMBOLYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Since 2013, the U.S. Food and Drug administration (FDA) has required that intravenous immune globulin (IGIV) products carry a boxed warning concerning the risk of thromboembolic events (TEEs). This study assessed the incidence of TEEs attributable to IGIV in a large population-based cohort. A self-controlled risk interval design was used to quantify the transient increase in TEE risk during the risk interval (days 0-2 and 0-13 following IGIV for arterial and venous TEEs, respectively) relative to a later control interval (days 14-27 following IGIV). Potential IGIV-exposed TEE cases from 2006 to 2012 were identified from the FDA-sponsored Sentinel Distributed Database and confirmed through medical record review. Inpatient IGIV exposures were not included in the venous TEE analysis due to concerns about time-varying confounding. 19,069 new users of IGIV who received 93,555 treatment episodes were included. Charts were retrieved for 62% and 70% of potential venous and arterial cases, respectively. There was a transient increase in the risk of arterial TEEs during days 0-2 following IGIV treatment (RR = 4.69; 95% CI 1.87, 11.90; absolute increase in risk = 8.86 events per 10,000 patients, 95% CI 3.25, 14.6), but no significant increase in venous TEE risk during days 0-13 following outpatient IGIV treatments (RR = 1.07, 95% CI 0.34, 3.48). Our results suggest there is a small increase in the absolute risk of arterial TEEs following IGIV. However, lower-than-expected chart retrieval rates and the possibility of time-varying confounding mean that our results should be interpreted cautiously. Continued pharmacovigilance efforts are warranted.

TI  - In-home cannabis smoking more prevalent than in-home tobacco smoking among 2019 Global Drug Survey respondents
T2  - ADDICTIVE BEHAVIORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose of the Research: Early evidence from studies of home smoking policies suggests that in-home cannabis smoking is more often allowed than in-home tobacco smoking, but there are not yet data on whether cannabis is more often smoked in the home compared to tobacco, or whether in-home cannabis and tobacco smoking differs by usage status. Using cross-sectional data from over 100,000 sentinel drug users from 17 countries, we compared cannabis and tobacco smoking in the homes of Global Drug Survey 2019 respondents who currently used cannabis only, tobacco only, both tobacco and cannabis, or neither.Principal Results: Complete data on cannabis and tobacco use and in-home smoking were available for 107,272 adults (average age = 30 +/- 12, 34% women, countries with the three highest response rates; Germany = 32%, USA = 10%, New Zealand = 9%). In total, 53.6% and 50.6% of respondents reported past-year cannabis and tobacco smoking in their home respectively. Stratifying respondents into current cannabis-only users, tobacco only users, dual users, and non-users, past-year in-home cannabis smoking was more prevalent (78.8%) among cannabis-only users than was in-home tobacco smoking (67.9%) among tobacco-only users. Among dual users, past-year in-home cannabis smoking (82.8%; 95%CI = 80%-86%) was higher than in-home tobacco smoking (75.9%; 95%CI = 69%-81%; p < 0.001). In-home cannabis and tobacco smoking was similar among non-users (20.2% and 20.5%, respectively).Major Conclusions: Past-year in-home cannabis smoking was more prevalent than tobacco smoking in the homes of participants who used cannabis and/or tobacco, supporting our speculation that in-home cannabis smoking might be more socially acceptable than in-home tobacco smoking.

TI  - Self-reported arm and shoulder problems in breast cancer survivors in Sub-Saharan Africa: the African Breast Cancer-Disparities in Outcomes cohort study
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Arm and shoulder problems (ASP), including lymphedema, were common among women with breast cancer in high-income countries before sentinel lymph node biopsy became the standard of care. Although ASP impair quality of life, as they affect daily life activities, their frequency and determinants in Sub-Saharan Africa remain unclear. Methods All women newly diagnosed with breast cancer at the Namibian, Ugandan, Nigerian, and Zambian sites of the African Breast Cancer-Disparities in Outcomes (ABC-DO) cohort study were included. At each 3-month follow-up interview, women answered the EORTC-QLQ-Br23 questionnaire, including three ASP items: shoulder/arm pain, arm stiffness, and arm/hand swelling. We estimated the cumulative incidence of first self-reported ASP, overall and stratified by study and treatment status, with deaths treated as competing events. To identify determinants of ASP, we estimated cause-specific hazard ratios using Cox models stratified by study site. Results Among 1476 women, up to 4 years after diagnosis, 43% (95% CI 40-46), 36% (33-38) and 23% (20-25), respectively, self-reported having experienced arm/shoulder pain, stiffness and arm/hand swelling at least once. Although risks of self-reported ASP differed between sites, a more advanced breast cancer stage at diagnosis, having a lower socioeconomic position and receiving treatment increased the risk of reporting an ASP. Conclusion ASP are very common in breast cancer survivors in Sub-Saharan Africa. They are influenced by different factors than those observed in high-income countries. There is a need to raise awareness and improve management of ASP within the African setting.

TI  - Age- and Sex-Specific Bioaccumulation of Selected Metals in Freshwater Mussel (<i>Unio elangatulus eucirrus</i> Bourguignat, 1860) Populating from Keban Dam Lake (Elazig, Turkey)
T2  - BULLETIN OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In aquatic life, environmental chemicals are accumulated by mussels due to their sentinel nature and filter-feeding characteristics. Herein, the present study focused on assessing the concentrations of Cu, Zn, Mg, Mn, Fe, Cd, Pb, Ca, K, and Na levels in freshwater mussels (Unio elangatulus eucirrus) depending on sex and age. For all trace metals, some important differences of bioaccumulations were determined depending on ages and sex. In details, the results indicated that an important age-related accumulation of Mg, Cd, Ca, and K was in females and all trace elements, except Cu, Mg, and K levels in males (p < 0.05). No statistical differences were determined in mean concentrations of Cu, Zn, Mg, and Na. There are statistical differences in Mg, Mn, Fe, and Ca levels between females and males in four aged mussels (p < 0.05). Lead levels were under detectable limits. Overall, metal levels and their toxicity in freshwater mussels should be closely monitored for health of the environment, animals, and humans, since mussels and fish species fed on them are consumed highly in the research region and around.

TI  - A hybrid approach for water body identification from satellite images using NDWI mapping and histogram of gradients
T2  - INNOVATIONS IN SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Application of different water identification indices and their modified form with a threshold is a common practice in surface water identification from multispectral images. Implementation of the statistical features of water present in such images to improve the accuracy of existing approaches is a novel application. A dynamic threshold selection is more suitable for the detection of sediment-water. In consideration of the facts, the present study proposed a hybrid approach for automatic surface water detection. Fuzzy c-means, NDWI, and a statistical feature: gradient are used to classify and therefore identify surface water. The study area, the river basin of Sundarban, is chosen due to its nature of water bodies such as wide rivers, narrow water streams, and sediment-water. The algorithm works with minimum human interaction. The method is validated by applying on Sentinal-2 and WorldView-2 images having a spatial resolution of 10 m and 0.46 m, respectively, and is found the accuracy is 97%.

TI  - Batch-produced, GIS-informed range maps for birds based on provenanced, crowd-sourced data inform conservation assessments
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate maps of species ranges are essential to inform conservation, but time-consuming to produce and update. Given the pace of change of knowledge about species distributions and shifts in ranges under climate change and land use, a need exists for timely mapping approaches that enable batch processing employing widely available data. We develop a systematic approach of batch-processing range maps and derived Area of Habitat maps for terrestrial bird species with published ranges below 125,000 km(2) in Central and South America. (Area of Habitat is the habitat available to a species within its range.) We combine existing range maps with the rapidly expanding crowd-sourced eBird data of presences and absences from frequently surveyed locations, plus readily accessible, high resolution satellite data on forest cover and elevation to map the Area of Habitat available to each species. Users can interrogate the maps produced to see details of the observations that contributed to the ranges. Previous estimates of Areas of Habitat were constrained within the published ranges and thus were, by definition, smaller-typically about 30%. This reflects how little habitat within suitable elevation ranges exists within the published ranges. Our results show that on average, Areas of Habitat are 12% larger than published ranges, reflecting the often-considerable extent that eBird records expand the known distributions of species. Interestingly, there are substantial differences between threatened and non-threatened species. Some 40% of Critically Endangered, 43% of Endangered, and 55% of Vulnerable species have Areas of Habitat larger than their published ranges, compared with 31% for Near Threatened and Least Concern species. The important finding for conservation is that threatened species are generally more widespread than previously estimated.

TI  - Enhanced index for water body delineation and area calculation using Google Earth Engine: a case study of the Manchar Lake
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The sustainability of the hydrological and ecological ecosystems of any region requires continuous monitoring of the water bodies. Recent advancements in satellite-based remote optical sensors, big data analysis and cloud computing have given new dimensions to the field of water body studies including their detection as well as analysis. The present study extends the existing methods to assess the contemporary surface water detection and monitoring techniques via remote sensing. The proposed technique implies an improved hybrid approach for the purpose along with the calculation of the boundary areas. The study has been carried out on the Manchar Lake, the largest natural freshwater lake in Pakistan as well as in South Asia. The proposed hybrid water index along with the different existing water body detection indices and spectral bands have been worked out on the satellite images retrieved from the Google Earth Engine to detect and analyze the area/flow changes in the water body. Based on the 7 years of data, the proposed algorithm calculates the water body area more precisely. With limited availability of metadata about the study area, the results have been validated both qualitatively through national-met data and statistically. These results aid to better preserve and improve the quality of the water resource.

TI  - Changes in arthropod communities mediate the effects of landscape composition and farm management on pest control ecosystem services in organically managed strawberry crops
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Landscape composition and local diversification practices such as polyculture, cover cropping and hedgerows may promote natural pest control by benefiting natural enemy communities on farms. Our study employs piecewise structural equation modelling (PSEM) to test causal hypotheses regarding the effects of landscape composition and local diversification practices on arthropod communities and pest control ecosystem services. We sampled 27 organic strawberry fields in California's Central Coast region in 2015 and 2016 (17 repeated between years) for a total of 37 distinct sites across years. The sites were selected along orthogonal gradients of landscape composition and local diversification practices. We also investigated the effects of two common pest management practices. At each site, we sampled arthropod communities using a handheld vacuum and performed sentinel prey experiments using the pest species Lygus hesperus to estimate pest control levels. At the landscape scale, proportion of woody habitat increased natural enemy abundance; at the local scale, on-farm diversification practices increased natural enemy diversity. Insecticides and tractor vacuuming, aimed at controlling pests, were indirectly detrimental to pest control services. Both practices decreased natural enemy abundance, and while insecticides also decreased pest abundance, vacuuming did not. Natural enemy abundance and diversity increased pest control levels, while pest abundance had the opposite effect. The PSEM results confirmed our hypotheses that landscape and local effects on pest control are mediated through changes in arthropod communities. Synthesis and applications. At the landscape scale, higher proportions of woody habitat are associated with greater natural enemy abundance, which increases pest control levels in organic strawberry crops. When promoting pest control ecosystem services is a policy goal, regional planners should prioritize the conservation and restoration of woodlands in agricultural landscapes. At the local scale, actions by individual growers can impact pest control services. For many growers, adopting practices that promote on-farm plant diversity may be a feasible solution for increasing pest control levels while avoiding the environmental and economic costs imposed by insecticide application and tractor vacuuming.

TI  - Research on an ionospheric delay correction method for the interferometric imaging radar altimeter based on improved GIM data
T2  - JOURNAL OF SPATIAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Interferometric Imaging Radar Altimeter (InIRA) is alow-orbit single-frequency altimeter whose signals are subject to an ionospheric delay, which introduces measurement errors. Additionally, some difficulties, such as selecting the interpolation algorithm and intercepting the height scale, arise when applying the ionospheric correction model. Based on Sentinel-3A dual-frequency measurements, this paper suggests that linear variogram-based kriging is suitable for spatial interpolation, and the total electron content height scale coefficient calculated by the hierarchical IRI forecast model can be applied to the interpolated GIM intercept. When the improved GIM value is applied to four scenes of InIRA data, the obtained Ku-band ionospheric correction varies from 1.49cm to 1.57cm.

TI  - Investigating false start of the main growing season: A case of Uganda in East Africa
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - False start of the growing season (Fsos) is a component of the onset variability related to agronomic drought that adversely impact on agricultural production and productivity. In the sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) where agriculture heavily depends on rainfall, the Fsos tends to create confusion among farmers on when to start planting crops thereby affecting seed germination and normal growth after emergence. In this paper, we focus on the Fsos and the occurrence of dry spell especially before the Start of growing Season (SoS). We take advantage of the existing rainfall estimates (CHIRPS) and remotely sensed data for vegetation performance (NDVI) over the period 1999-2017 in combination with local knowledge derived from farmers to map out areas at risk of (i) dry spell at the SoS, and (ii) false timing of SoS or high probability of occurrence of the Fsos. We found that the North Eastern part of Uganda (8.8% of arable area) were at risk of dry spell throughout each year. However, the greater North (58.1% of arable area) was prone to dry spell during the onset of the March-May season. Areas in the South Western (3.7%) region were at risk during the onset of the September-November season. The probability that a location in Uganda experiences an Fsos falls between 0-53%. The findings in this study are vital for planning of predictive adaptation to the impacts of climate variability on agriculture amid struggle aimed at tackling food insecurity challenge in the SSA.

TI  - Contact-based interfaith programmes in schools and the changing religious education landscape: negotiating a worldviews curriculum
T2  - JOURNAL OF BELIEFS & VALUES-STUDIES IN RELIGION & EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This article explores the implications of a proposed move towards a religion and worldviews curriculum in England for contact-based interfaith programmes in schools, through a case study of the Faith and Belief Forum's School Linking programme. Quantitative and qualitative data collected through 1,488 teacher and student surveys, teacher focus groups and participant observation in schools reveal that despite students reporting an increase in religious knowledge after taking part in School Linking, the type of knowledge gained does not accurately capture the religious and worldview plurality of the programme's participants. In positioning School Linking's theoretical underpinnings of intergroup contact theory as driving this issue, the article proposes an alternative theoretical grounding for interfaith programmes in schools, the 'decategorization' model of contact. Interfaith programmes as communicated through decategorization ensures that such extra-curricular activities explore religious and non-religious worldviews in their complexity and complement students' learning developed through a religion and worldviews curriculum.

TI  - Introducing a flat ontology into landscape research: a case study of water governance experiments in South Africa
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Context Contemporary resource management paradigms within the developed world build on an understanding of human agency as ontologically distinct from the mode of existence of plants and animals. Because of this perspective, which gives priority to human agency, policies typically take their point of departure with human societies and associated ecosystems deemed of particular value. Objectives As an alternative to this worldview, social theorists have introduced what is known as "flat ontology", where all beings are bestowed equal rights to negotiate their existence. To explore the implications of introducing such an understanding into landscape management, a participatory planning process for water allocation was developed and tested in a case study in the Eerste River Catchment in South Africa. Methods The planning process was mediated using the approach "politics of nature" (PoN), which aims to operationalize flat ontology to renegotiate water allocation based on the needs of all beings instead of the desire of a subset of humans. PoN allowed participants to playfully co-develop a common ontology and value-set. Data documenting these processes were collected digitally and analysed. Results Results indicate that the approach engendered a rethinking of key relationships between human agency and ecosystem functionality, illustrating a potential for PoN-approaches to be deployed for governance of complex landscapes. Conclusions On the basis of experiments using PoN-methodology in the context of watershed management, it is discussed how the introduction of a flat ontology in landscape research, could inspire new ways of designing and intervening with collaborative resource management processes.

T2  - JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Extreme precipitation and flooding often lead to human and economic losses. However, the high-resolution nationwide flooding exposure data are scarce. Availability of all-weather space-borne SAR satellite data can potentially improve the ability to generate high-resolution flood map extent and exposure globally. In Iran, flooding is a major concern, given the socioeconomic vulnerabilities and increased likelihood of climate extremes. Iran experienced extreme flooding during January to March 2019, attributed to significant precipitation during October 2018 to March 2019, which is well above the long-term averages for 1999-2019. Using Pettitt and Mann Kendall tests, nationwide precipitation records were identified by significant decreasing and increasing trends in north and south, respectively. Utilizing 673 Sentinel-1 SAR intensity images, we applied a fast-marching algorithm for image segmentation in combination with a Bayesian framework to obtain high-resolution probabilistic flood maps. We found, 22, 9, and 15 states in January, February, and March, respectively, experienced flooding that covered >15% of their area with high flooded area percent in the northwestern and southeastern region. We estimated that >15, >11.32, and >11.33 million people were exposed to floods in January, February, and March, respectively. Our datasets inform flooding models and management efforts under increasing climate extremes and changing land use and cover.

TI  - Changes in urbanization and urban heat island effect in Dhaka city
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The study aimed to assess the changes in urban areas and UHI effects in Dhaka city, Bangladesh, from 2001 to 2017, using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily day- and nighttime land surface temperature (LST) data from 2001 to 2017. The expansion of the city was calculated using the city clustering algorithm (CCA). The temperature of the identified urbanized area was analyzed and compared with the adjacent regions. The changes in urban temperature were estimated using non-parametric statistical methods. The results showed that Dhaka city's land surface area has grown by 25.33% and its inhabitants by 76.65% during 2001-2017. Urban expansion and dense settlements caused an increase in average temperature in some areas of Dhaka city nearly 3 degrees C compared to that at its boundary. The day and night temperature differences at Dhaka city's warmest location and the coolest point outside the city were nearly 7 degrees C and 5 degrees C, respectively. The city's annual average day- and nighttime temperatures was increasing at a rate of 0.03 degrees C and 0.023 degrees C/year over the period of the last 17 years. The rising temperature would increase the UHI effect in the future, which, combined with high humidity, may cause a significant increase in public health risk in the city if mitigation practices are not followed.

AB  - Energy availability at trophic and hydrologic level dominates species richness gradients by constraining food resources, and regulating population sizes and extinction rates. Remote sensing datasets have mapped vegetation productivities as a proxy for energy availability, for example, using Dynamic Habitat Indices (DHIs). Considering the sparse vegetation across drylands, we developed indices of Land surface temperature (ILST) based on daytime land surface temperature from Terra and Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), which has three components: (1) annual mean temperature (LSTmean), (2) annual maximum temperature (LSTmax), and (3) standard deviation of temperature (LSTstd). We hypothesized that the temperature variables, such as ILST, would predict species richness better than productivity proxies across drylands. Thus, our objective was to determine how well they would predict the richness of plants, mammals and birds across the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. We calculated the DHIs and ILST from the MODIS vegetation and temperature products from 2001 to 2015. We found that: (1) ILST could capture more additive information compared with DHIs in terms of the relatively high variance explanation of species richness and high variable importance, and the combination of ILST and DHIs gave better predictions than single metrics for species richness patterns. (2) Plants and birds were more sensitive to temperature than vegetation productivity, probably due to physiological tolerance and evolutionary processes. (3) LSTstd was the most important variable affecting species richness, except on mammals. High LSTstd was related to more food resources and habitats, and low LSTstd represented extreme environment and environmental stress. Combined vegetation properties and temperature variabilities are good determinants of species richness, and should be carefully considered in future research.

TI  - Long-term characteristics of water quality around the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area: Spatiotemporal variations and meteorological effects
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the coastal water quality (CWQ) and determining the effects of meteorological factors (MF) on the long-term CWQ adjacent to urban agglomerations are key topics in coastal monitoring and management. This study used satellite-derived data to study the long-term CWQ around the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area (GBA) with indicators of chlorophyll-a concentration (Chla) and diffuse attenuation coefficient for downwelling irradiance at 490 nm (Kd(490)). The sea surface temperature (SST) and total precipitation accumulation (TPA) of the waters around the GBA were also studied from 2003 to 2019. Furthermore, statistical analysis was conducted to identify the impact of the MF on CWQ by quantifying trends and relationships of CWQ & MF. The results showed that (1) An increasing trend of annual Chla, Kd(490), and TPA were observed, whereas a decreasing trend of SST has been recorded from 2003 to 2019. Both CWQ indicators and meteorological variables showed significant differences among seasons, and the values of Chla, Kd(490), and SST were found higher in the coastal area but lower in the open waters area. (2) SST was the crucial factor of the high values of CWQ indicators in summer: the highest values of Chla and Kd(490) in summer are likely to be attributed to the proper SST (r = 0.87; r = 0.83) and higher TPA in spring (r = 0.95; r = 0.93). The precipitation played an uncertain role in driving the CWQ (r 0.9 and r <-0.9 in spring and winter, respectively). A significant increase in TPA was associated with the decrease of SST in the coming year. (3) Due to the relatively stable change of natural environment and human activities, the trends of Chla, Kd(490), and TPA remained broadly consistent with those of the past 17 years. However, SST indicates a slight downward trend. In summary, the TPA and SST driven patterns were essential in the management of water quality indicators in the GBA area. This study can improve our comprehensive understanding of the water quality status in the coastal regions of the GBA and provide references to the coastal zone and marine management, as well as the sustainable development of the GBA.

TI  - Histiocytoid variant of invasive lobular breast carcinoma. A case report and literature review
T2  - ANNALS OF MEDICINE AND SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction: Histiocytoid breast carcinoma (HBC) is a variant of invasive lobular carcinoma. The occurrence of HBC is rare and the natural history and clinical course of HBC is still not well known due to limited numbers of reported cases. In reality, many tumors have been misdiagnosed and reported as benign lesions.Case presentation: A 66-year-old- postmenopausal women, who has previous personal history of right breast invasive ductal carcinoma, for which she underwent right breast wide local excision with negative sentinel lymph node biopsy and received adjuvant radiotherapy and hormonal therapy. Two years later, a new left breast suspicious lesion was detected by Imaging. Breast Ultrasound showed left breast hypo-echoic area at 12-1 o'clock with irregular spiculated lesion 3 cm away from the nipple with posterior acoustic shadowing measuring 1 x 0.7 x 0.7 cm and mild tissue distortion with thicken cortical left Axillary lymph node. Mammography of both breasts confirmed the left breast lesion at 12o'clock with necrosis and irregular margins measuring 1.1 x 1.0 cm. MRI breasts showed, left breast heterogeneously enhancing mass at 12 o'clock with no other suspicious mass in the left or right breast. Ultrasound guided left breast biopsy of the suspicious lesion seen at 12-1 o'clock which confirmed the diagnosis of invasive lobular carcinoma, histiocytoid variant She underwent wire guided left breast wide local excision with left sentinel lymph node and axillary clearance. Final histopathology showed invasive lobular carcinoma, histiocytoid variant.Clinical discussion: The recognition of histiocytoid breast carcinoma is often a challenge, particularly when histiocytoid tumor cells occur in a metastatic site before the primary diagnosis of breast cancer. An awareness of histological features are needed to make the accurate diagnosis.Conclusion: Findings that support the correct diagnosis include identifying tumor cells with more cytological atypia, the presence of cytoplasmic vacuoles and secretions. Moreover, coexistence with invasive lobular carcinoma and/or lobular neoplasia and the use of immunohistochemistry to confirm their epithelial nature. clinicoradiological correlation is essential, as any discordance should trigger further diagnostic determination.

TI  - The use of regression tree method for Sentinel-2 satellite data to mapping percent tree cover in different forest types
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying forest systems is of importance for ecological services and economic benefits in ecosystem models. This study aims to map the percent tree cover (PTC) of various forest stands in the Buyuk Menderes Basin, located in the western part of Turkey with different characteristics in the Mediterranean and Terrestrial transition regions Sentinel-2 data with 10-m spatial resolution. In recent years, some researches have been carried out in different fields to show the capabilities and potential of Sentinel-2 satellite sensors. However, the limited number of PTC researches conducted with Sentinel-2 images reveals the importance of this study. This study aimed to demonstrate reliable PTC data in landscape planning or ecosystem modeling by introducing an advanced approach with high spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution and more cost-effective. In this study, a regression tree algorithm, one of the popular machine learning techniques for ecological modeling, was used to estimate the tree cover's dependent variable based on high-resolution monthly metrics' spectral signatures. Six frames of TripleSat images were used as training data in the regression tree. Monthly Sentinel-2 bands and produced metrics including NDVI, LAI, fCOVER, MSAVI2, and MCARI were almost the first time used as predictor variables. Stepwise linear regression (SLR) was applied to select these predictor bands in the regression tree and a correlation coefficient of 0.83 was obtained. Result PTC maps were produced and the results were evaluated based on coniferous and broadleaf. The results were tested using high spatial resolution TripleSat images and higher model accuracy was determined in both forest types. The high correlation is due to the Sentinel 2 satellite's band characteristics and the metrics are directly related to the tree cover. As a result, the high-accuracy availability of the Sentinel2 satellite is seen to map the PTC on a regional scale, including complex forest types between the Mediterranean and terrestrial transition climates.

TI  - Fast local adaptive multiscale image matching algorithm for remote sensing image correlation
T2  - COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Various studies have shown that image correlation calculated in the space domain outperforms frequency-based methods. However, such an approach usually requires great computational efforts, making it challenging to adopt for surveying fast moving processes like glaciers, particularly over wide areas. We present a local adaptive multiscale image matching algorithm (LAMMA), which repeatedly applies image correlation on grids of increasing spatial resolution and adapts the size of the interrogation area according to the local range of displacements. LAMMA allows reducing the number of calculi of several orders of magnitude and limits the occurrence of displacement outliers. We show an example of LAMMA application on Sentinel-2 images to measure glaciers flow of the Southern Patagonian Icefield, where LAMMA's runtime was comparable to that of frequency-based correlation. LAMMA's Matlab code is freely available on GitHub.

TI  - Updated Glacial Lake Inventory of Indus River Basin based on High-Resolution Indian Remote Sensing Satellite Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A comprehensive updated inventory of glacial lakes in the Indus River basin (up to the Indian administrative boundary) has been carried out using 157 high-resolution Indian Remote Sensing satellite images, mostly covering mountainous region of the Western Himalayas and Karakoram Ranges. Glacial lakes are classified in ten different types depending upon dam type, process of lake formation, topographic feature, and geographical position. Distribution of glacial lakes has been studied in terms of area, type, area versus type, elevation, elevation versus type, and area versus elevation at basin and subbasin levels, along with Indian administrative and transboundary region level. A total of 5335 glacial lakes >= 0.25 +/- 0.06 ha has been inventoried in the Indus River basin covering a total water spread area of 17395.03 +/- 1013.28 ha. About 4633 (86.84%) glacial lakes are with < 5 ha in size, whereas remaining lakes, i.e. 702 (13.16%), are with >= 5 ha in size, contributing to 34.04 +/- 1.63% and 65.96 +/- 1.63% of total lake area, respectively. Other glacial erosion types of lake are found to be the maximum with 2516 in number (47.16%) occupying a total lake extent of 8247.44 +/- 499.21 ha at 47.42% in the basin. More than half (i.e. 52.43%) of the lakes are situated in the high altitude range of 4001-5000 m amsl and dominated by other glacial erosion type of lakes, i.e. 58.17%. Glacial lakes are majorly distributed in the Gilgit subbasin (18.95%) followed by Indus Upper subbasin (18.78%) with a total lake extent of 19.43 +/- 0.03% and 19.93 +/- 0.01%, respectively. A total of 4280 (80.22%) glacial lakes lies within Indian region covering 79.26 +/- 0.02%, whereas remaining 19.78% of lakes are located in transboundary region with a 20.74 +/- 0.02% total lake area. Within India, majority of lakes are situated in Ladakh (UT) with 75.21% of lake count covering a total water spread area of 72.28 +/- 0.15%.

TI  - Unmanned Aerial System-Based Multispectral Water Quality Monitoring in the Iberian Pyrite Belt (SW Spain)
T2  - MINE WATER AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Few studies have assessed mining-associated water pollution using spectral characteristics. We used high-resolution multispectral data acquired by unmanned aerial drones combined with in situ chemical data to assess water quality parameters in 12 relatively small water bodies located in the Tharsis complex, an abandoned mining area in the Iberian pyrite belt (SW Spain). The spectral bands of Micasense RedEdge-MX Dual and spectral band combinations were used jointly with physicochemical data to estimate water quality parameters and develop reliable empirical models using regression analysis. Physicochemical parameters including pH, ORP, EC, Al, Cu, Fe, Mn, S, Si, and Zn were estimated with high accuracy levels (0.81 < R-2 < 0.99, 4 < RMSE% < 75, 0.01 < MAPE < 0.97). In contrast, the observed and modelled values for Ba, Ca, and Mg did not agree well (0.42 < R-2 < 0.70). The best-fitted models were used to generate spatial distribution maps, providing information on water quality patterns. This study demonstrated that using empirical models to generate spatial distribution maps can be an effective and easy way to monitor acid mine drainage.

TI  - A Multidisciplinary Approach to Managing Uncertainty
T2  - CURRENT BREAST CANCER REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose of Review Image-guided percutaneous breast biopsy of both palpable and non-palpable findings has become standard of care. These minimally invasive breast procedures can avoid a surgical procedure for patients who have benign findings and can also guide pre-surgical management for malignant pathology. Establishing radiology-pathologic concordance is critical to guide appropriate management and is often performed between the radiologist and pathologist. However, the role of a multidisciplinary team and understanding the overall clinical context can better guide clinical care, particularly when imaging and pathologic findings may be uncertain. Recent Findings This article presents a series of difficult cases where multidisciplinary input is needed to help guide subspecialty decision-making. A multidisciplinary team that has an understanding of what information is needed to guide subspecialty decision making and recommendations can improve patient management, particularly in uncertain radiology-pathology situations.

TI  - Parents, Pupils, Pedagogues, and Policies: A Rectangle of School Education for Immigrant's Children
T2  - SYSTEMIC PRACTICE AND ACTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The research explores issues surrounding entry into a public school for children of Bengali-speaking supposedly "Bangladeshi immigrant" community in a part of Hindi-speaking India. Using the Grounded Theory approach, we conducted in-depth interviews with multiple stakeholders. We reviewed relevant policies and extant literature to understand the field's emerging narrative. Drawing upon the social constructivist framework to analyse the patterns in the data, we found four categories: (1) Parent's decision and child's education, (2) Procedural burden, (3) Child's fear and emotions, and (4) Teachers' perceptions and obligations. The findings reveal that accessing public education by immigrant children is more complicated than the structural limitations, parental involvement, teacher's quality, and infrastructural issues as found in the past research. Importantly, different interpretations of circumstances and convenient adoption of a rationale by various stakeholders led to multiple realities, which eventually impacted children's participation in public school. The study complements the access theory by showing how a socially constructed worldview could enable or disable access to a specific community. The study suggests critical policy implications at the policy executives' level if an 'idealistic' macro-level policy to be fully translated into ground reality.

TI  - Evapotranspiration and Runoff Patterns Across California's Sierra Nevada
T2  - FRONTIERS IN WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatially resolved annual evapotranspiration was calculated across the 14 main river basins draining into California's Central Valley, USA, using a statistical model that combined satellite greenness, gridded precipitation, and flux-tower measurements. Annual evapotranspiration across the study area averaged 529 mm. Average basin-scale annual precipitation minus evapotranspiration was in good agreement with annual runoff, with deviations in wet and dry years suggesting withdrawal or recharge of subsurface water storage. Evapotranspiration peaked at lower elevations in the colder, northern basins, and at higher elevations in the southern high-Sierra basins, closely tracking the 12.3 degrees C mean temperature isocline. Precipitation and evapotranspiration are closely balanced across much of the study region, and small shifts in either will cause disproportionate changes in water storage and runoff. The majority of runoff was generated below the rain-snow transition in northern basins, and originated in snow-dominated elevations in the southern basins. Climate warming that increases growing season length will increase evapotranspiration and reduce runoff across all elevations in the north, but only at higher elevations in the south. Feedback mechanisms in these steep mountain basins, plus over-year subsurface storage, with their steep precipitation and temperature gradients, provide important buffering of the water balance to change. Leave-one-out cross validation revealed that the statistical model for annual evapotranspiration is sensitive to the number and distribution of measurement sites, implying that additional strategically located flux towers would improve evapotranspiration predictions. Leave-one-out with individual years was less sensitive, implying that longer records are less important. This statistical top-down modeling of evapotranspiration provides an important complement to constraining water-balance measurements with gridded precipitation and unimpaired runoff, with applications such as quantifying water balance following forest die-off, management or wildfire.

TI  - Clinical Decision Making in the Management of Breast Cancer Diagnosed During Pregnancy: A Review and Case Series Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENT AND YOUNG ADULT ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose: To highlight the various options available for the management of breast cancer diagnosed during pregnancy by describing the investigations, treatment, and outcomes in relation to these women.Methods: This is a narrative review of the literature to describe the issues related to pregnancy and obstetric management in patients with breast cancer. It incorporates a description of six cases of women (aged 29-39 years) with a first-time diagnosis of breast cancer during pregnancy to illustrate a number of issues that need to be considered during different trimesters.Results: Of the six cases, two were diagnosed in each pregnancy trimester. A painless breast mass was the presenting symptom in five cases (83%). In all cases, breast ultrasound was the primary diagnostic imaging procedure. Chest X-ray was performed in 3 (50%) and computed tomography in 2 (33%). A core needle biopsy was performed in all cases, and sentinel lymph node biopsy in 3 (50%) cases. Four women had grade 3 tumor; five had estrogen receptor-positive tumors. Four women had breast surgery during pregnancy. Five women gave birth after the induction of labor and/or cesarean section. In all six cases, a multidisciplinary team was involved in the delivery of health care.Conclusion: Regular breast examinations are needed for all pregnant woman during prenatal visits. Breast ultrasonography should be offered if a breast lump or other symptoms are detected. Breast surgery can be safely performed during all pregnancy trimesters, and some systemic therapeutic agents can be administered safely in the second and third trimesters.

TI  - EQUINOCTIAL SUN AND ASTRONOMICAL ALIGNMENTS IN MESOAMERICAN ARCHITECTURE: FICTION AND FACT
T2  - ANCIENT MESOAMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Archaeoastronomical studies carried out during the last decades in Mesoamerica have demonstrated that civic and ceremonial buildings were largely oriented on astronomical grounds, mostly to sunrises and sunsets on certain dates, allowing the use of observational calendars that facilitated the scheduling of agricultural and related ritual activities. One of the deeply rooted but unfounded ideas is that many alignments recorded the Sun's positions at the equinoxes. By examining such proposals and analyzing their methodological flaws, I argue that they are not based on reliable and objectively selected alignment data, but rather derive from the preconceived significance attributed to the equinoxes. The most likely targets of the near-equinoctial orientations were the so-called quarter days, which occur two days after/before the spring/fall equinox and mark mid-points in time between the solstices. Considering that the astronomical alignments dominate extensive parts of the built environment, they must have played an important role in religion, worldview, and political ideology. Therefore, only a correct identification of their celestial referents, a prerequisite for any convincing interpretation of their meaning, underlying intents, and observational practices employed, can contribute to a proper understanding of some prominent aspects of architectural and urban planning in Mesoamerica.

TI  - Performance evaluation of CFSR, MERRA-2 and TRMM3B42 data sets in simulating river discharge of data-scarce tropical catchments: a case study of Manafwa, Uganda
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Data scarcity has been a huge problem in modelling various catchments especially in the tropical region. Satellite data and different statistical methods are being used to improve the quality of conventional meteorological data. However, the potential of using these data needs to be further investigated. This paper evaluates the performance of three reanalysis datasets in hydrological modelling of the Manafwa Catchment, Uganda. Two reanalysis datasets were selected for studying both rainfall and temperature in Manafwa, whereas a satellite algorithm was selected for studying rainfall alone. The Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2), which has a horizontal resolution of 50 km and is suitable for investigating rainfall in small precipitation systems, and the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis and Reforecast (CFSR), which has a horizontal resolution of 38 km, were chosen as the reanalysis datasets. The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM3B42) data were used as the satellite product in this study. The SWAT was set up to compare the performance of reanalysis datasets with that of the observed data. The model performance indicators indicated that, at daily time steps, all the three datasets produced the values of Nash-Sutcliff Efficiency (NSE >= 0.4), coefficient of determination (R-2 >= 0.4) and Percent Bias +/- 25%. Despite a general underperformance compared to MERRA-2, CFSR performed better than TRMM. On applying generated bias corrections for precipitation and temperature climate data, overall results showed that the bias-corrected data outperformed the original data. We conclude that, in the absence of gauged hydro-meteorological data, bias-corrected MERRA-2, CFSR and TRMM data could be used for simulating river discharge in data-scarce areas such as the tropical catchments in Uganda.

TI  - Quantifying latitudinal variation in land surface phenology of <i>Spartina alterniflora</i> saltmarshes across coastal wetlands in China by Landsat 7/8 and Sentinel-2 images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Spartina alterniflora is an aggressive invasive plant spreading along the coastal China, spanning a latitudinal range of 20 degrees N-39 degrees N, and its invasion resulted in dramatic decline in both native plant diversity and ecosystem functioning. Phenology of S. alterniflora saltmarshes is a critical feature to elucidate the invasion dynamics over geographical regions but has not been well understood yet. In this study, we examined the variation of S. alterniflora saltmarsh phenology across coastal China during 2018-2020 by using time series Landsat 7/8 and Sentinel-2 images. Combined Landsat 7/8 and Sentinel-2 images provided more good-quality observations in a year, which could facilitate phenological retrieval. We applied and assessed three widely used phenology retrieval methods (i.e., NDVI-based pixel-specific statistical threshold, NDVI-based double logistic mathematical equation, and LSWI-based biological threshold) for retrieving the start and end of season (SOS and EOS) as well as the length of season (LOS) of S. alterniflora saltmarshes. The SOS and EOS dates derived from three phenology retrieval methods showed similar patterns in latitudinal phenology variation: SOS became later and LOS became shorter as latitude increased, and the latitudinal trend of EOS was not as large as that of SOS. This study shows the potential of Landsat 7/8 and Sentinel-2 to quantify land surface phenology of S. alterniflora saltmarshes, which not only enhances our understanding of the spatial-temporal dynamics of coastal saltmarshes in China but also improves the management of this plant invader that threatens native saltmarshes in the world.

TI  - An overview on flooding induced uplift for abandoned coal mines
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROCK MECHANICS AND MINING SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Flooding induced uplift for abandoned coal mines is monitored mainly by satellite data and geodetic levelling. Predictions are based on empirical formulas, but nowadays numerical simulation procedures provide an interesting alternative, because it is physically based and allows to consider complex mining, geological and hydrological conditions. According to the key driving mechanisms, the uplift process can be classified as either confined/unconfined (in respect to the mine water), isolated/connected (in respect to ponds) and with/without faults (in respect to the tectonic situation). The paper summarizes the state-of-the-art of monitoring and prediction of flooding induced uplift of abandoned coal mines. A workflow for using numerical simulations as tools for prediction of flooding induced uplift is proposed.

TI  - Assessment of the response of tropical dry forests to El Nin∼o southern oscillation
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical Dry Forests (TDFs) in the Americas are significantly affected by drought related to El Nin similar to o Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The analysis builds upon two drought indices: the MODIS-derived Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) and Temperature Condition Index (TCI) and the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) anomaly in the Nin similar to o 3.4 region. Temporal correlation analysis and Moving Window Correlation Analysis (MWCA) were used to explore the long-term and short-term responses at multiple sites. Results illustrate Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) at SRNP-EMSS (Santa Rosa National Park Environmental Monitoring Super Site) and PEMS (Parque Estadual da Mata Seca) in the dry season were negatively impacted by the long-term SST anomaly across multiple ENSO phases (warm, neutral, and cold phases), while there was no long-term impact at CCBR (Chamela-Cuixmala Biosphere Reserve) and TVMWR (Tucabaca Valley Municipal Wildlife Reserve). Findings from a short-term perspective, suggest that the GPP at SRNP-EMSS and CCBR were sensitive to the ENSO warm phase. TDFs GPP at PEMS and TVMWR were resistant to El Nin similar to o. Our results reveal that stronger El Nin similar to o events may lead to severe droughts in more regions across TDFs, but there is no direct relationship between the intensity of an individual El Nin similar to o event and the precipitation condition in each study site. Except for their teleconnections, the biophysical characteristics and seasonality can impact the response of ENSO on the GPP.

TI  - Two decades of dynamic change and progressive destabilization on the Thwaites Eastern Ice Shelf
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Thwaites Eastern Ice Shelf (TEIS) buttresses the eastern grounded portion of Thwaites Glacier through contact with a pinning point at its seaward limit. Loss of this ice shelf will promote further acceleration of Thwaites Glacier. Understanding the dynamic controls and structural integrity of the TEIS is therefore important to estimating Thwaites' future sea-level contribution. We present a similar to 20-year record of change on the TEIS that reveals the dynamic controls governing the ice shelf's past behaviour and ongoing evolution. We derived ice velocities from MODIS and Sentinel-1 image data using feature tracking and speckle tracking, respectively, and we combined these records with ITS_LIVE and GOLIVE velocity products from Landsat-7 and Landsat-8. In addition, we estimated surface lowering and basal melt rates using the Reference Elevation Model of Antarctica (REMA) DEM in comparison to ICESat and ICESat-2 altimetry. Early in the record, TEIS flow dynamics were strongly controlled by the neighbouring ThwaitesWestern Ice Tongue (TWIT). Flow patterns on the TEIS changed following the disintegration of the TWIT around 2008, with a new divergence in ice flow developing around the pinning point at its seaward limit. Simultaneously, the TEIS developed new rifting that extends from the shear zone upstream of the ice rise and increased strain concentration within this shear zone. As these horizontal changes occurred, sustained thinning driven by basal melt reduced ice thickness, particularly near the grounding line and in the shear zone area upstream of the pinning point. This evidence of weakening at a rapid pace suggests that the TEIS is likely to fully destabilize in the next few decades, leading to further acceleration of Thwaites Glacier.

TI  - Assimilation of SMAP disaggregated soil moisture and Landsat land surface temperature to improve FAO-56 estimates of ET in semi-arid regions
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) is of crucial importance in water science and hydrological process understanding especially in semi-arid/arid areas since ET represents more than 85% of the total water budget. FAO-56 is one of the widely used formulations to estimate the actual crop evapotranspiration (ETc (act)) due to its operational nature and since it represents a reasonable compromise between simplicity and accuracy. In this vein, the objective of this paper was to examine the possibility of improving ETc act estimates through remote sensing data assimilation. For this purpose, remotely sensed soil moisture (SM) and Land surface temperature (LST) data were simultaneously assimilated into FAO-dualK(c) . Surface SM observations were assimilated into the soil evaporation (E-s) component through the soil evaporation coefficient, and LST data were assimilated into the actual crop transpiration (T-c (act)) component through the crop stress coefficient. The LST data were used to estimate the water stress coefficient (K-s) as a proxy of LST (LST proxy ). The FAO-Ks was corrected by assimilating LST proxy derived from Landsat data based on the variances of predicted errors on K-s estimates from FAO-56 model and thermal-derived K-s. The proposed approach was tested over a semi-arid area in Morocco using first, in situ data collected during 2002-2003 and 2015-2016 wheat growth seasons over two different fields and then, remotely sensed data derived from disaggregated Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) SM and Landsat-LST sensors were used. Assimilating SM data leads to an improvement of the ETc act model prediction: the mot mean square error (RMSE) decreased from 0.98 to 0.65 mm/day compared to the classical FAO-dualK(c) using in situ SM. Moreover, assimilating both in situ SM and LST data provided more accurate results with a RMSE error of 0.55 mm/day. By using SMAP-based SM and Landsat-LST, results also improved in comparison with standard FAO and reached a RMSE of 0.73 mm/day against eddy-covariance ETc act measurements.

TI  - How long did crops survive from floods caused by Cyclone Idai in Mozambique detected with multi-satellite data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Floods are causing massive losses of crops and agricultural infrastructures in many regions across the globe. During the 2018/2019 agricultural year, heavy rains from Cyclone Idai caused flooding in Central Mozambique and had the greatest impact on Sofala Province. The main objectives of this study are to map the flooding durations, evaluate how long crops survived the floods, and analyse the dynamics of the affected crops and their recovery following various flooding durations using multi-source satellite data. Our results indicate that Otsu method-based flooding mapping provides reliable flood extents and durations with an overall accuracy higher than 90%, which facilitates the assessment of how long crops can survive floods and their recovery progress. Croplands in both Buzi and Tica administrative units were the most severely impacted among all the regions in Sofala Province, with the largest flooded cropland extent at 23,101.1 ha in Buzi on 20 March 2019 and the most prolonged flooding duration of more than 42 days in Tica and Mafambisse. Major summer crops, including maize and rice, could survive when the fields were inundated for up to 12 days, while all crops died when the flooding duration was longer than 24 days. The recovery of surviving crops to pre-flooding status took a much longer time, from approximately 20 days to as long as one month after flooding. The findings presented herein can assist decision making in developing countries or remote regions for flood monitoring, mitigation and damage assessment.

TI  - Assessing the effects of end-members determination on regional latent heat flux simulation in trapezoidal framework based model
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature-fractional vegetation coverage (LST-f(c)) trapezoid framework based models have been widely developed, applied, and verified to estimate regional latent heat flux (LE) and its partitioning process. The basis of operating these models lies in the determination of end-members within the LST-f(c) trapezoid. However, the knowledge of how the end-members affect the LE and ratio of vegetation latent heat flux (LEv) to latent heat flux (LEv/LE) estimation is lacking in the literature. In this study, three widely used end-members determination methods, viz., determination of actual end-members within the scatter plot of LST-f(c) (AEM), determination of theoretical end-members through the Zhang's method (Zhang et al., 2005, TEM-Z), and determination of theoretical end-members through Long's method (Long and Singh. 2012b, TEM-L) were inter-compared. The outcome of this study was verified at the 11 Eddy Correlation (EC) observation stations for the 183 test days during 2015 using the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products, revealing that different end-members combinations greatly alter the LE simulation. However, tuning of end-members do not shift the LEv/LE estimates, and spatial patterns of the LE and LEv/LE remained unchanged. Moreover, the performance of TEM-Z is better than the AEM, while the TEM-L provide relatively unstable performance during the 183 test days. Conclusively, this study endorses to adopt the TEM-Z method to determine the end-members. This study provides a clear understanding of the effect of different end-members to LE and LEv/LE simulation within the LST-f(c) trapezoid framework, and gives a clear insight for model selection, operation, and subsequent, guidelines for model improvement.

TI  - Comparing the concentrations of heavy metals on two bivalve species in Santos Bay, Brazil: Subsidies to understanding the assimilation dynamic of bivalve contaminants
T2  - WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Contaminant substances consist of chemical elements that present the potential to adversely impact the ecology of the environment, thus representing a threat to local fauna and flora. In this context, heavy metals are critical agents that, depending on the nature and level, are potentially toxic to living organisms. In order to evaluate the bioaccumulation of heavy metals in the Santos estuary and to determine the potential influence of salinity gradient on the heavy metal bioconcentration, the present study measured the concentrations of As, Cd, Pb, Cu, Cr, Fe, Ni, and Zn in two bivalve species (Crassostrea rhizophorae and Perna Perna) sampled at different sites of Santos Bay, in the southeastern region of Brazil. Throughout the study, the "sentinel species" used were effective in bioaccumulating contaminants. In oysters, based on the Brazilian legislation, critical limits were exceeded for As, Zn, Cu, and Cr. In the case of mussels, on the other hand, only for As, Zn, and Cr, the critical limits were overcome. In the present study, obtained data suggested salinity as a determinant parameter in As incorporation processes of bivalve mollusks. Practitioner Points The present study presents important results for the development of environmental management policies in estuarine environments. The present study points out differences between different organisms as biomonitors, providing subsidies for the decision of an effective biomonitoring program. The present study discusses values of contaminants as a danger to public health in Santos Bay, which can be extrapolated to other similar environments around the world.

TI  - A Novel Predictive Nomogram including Serum Lipoprotein a Level for Nonsentinel Lymph Node Metastases in Chinese Breast Cancer Patients with Positive Sentinel Lymph Node Metastases
T2  - DISEASE MARKERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. We developed a new nomogram combining serum biomarkers with clinicopathological features to improve the accuracy of prediction of nonsentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases in Chinese breast cancer patients. Methods. We enrolled 209 patients with breast cancer who underwent SLN biopsy and axillary lymph node dissection. We evaluated the relationships between non-SLN metastases and clinicopathologic features, as well as preoperative routine tests of blood indexes, tumor markers, and serum lipids, including lipoprotein a (Lp(a)). Risk factors for non-SLN metastases were identified by logistic regression analysis. The nomogram was created using the R program to predict the risk of non-SLN metastases in the training set. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was applied to assess the predictive value of the nomogram model in the validation set. Results. Lp(a) was significantly associated with non-SLN metastasis status. Compared with the MSKCC model, the predictive ability of our new nomogram that combined Lp(a) level and clinical variables (pathologic tumor size, lymphovascular invasion, multifocality, and positive/negative SLN numbers) was significantly greater (AUC: 0.732, 95% CI: 0.643-0.821) (C-index: 0.703, 95% CI: 0.656-0.791) in the training cohorts and also performed well in the validation cohorts (C-index: 0.773, 95% CI: 0.681-0.865). Moreover, the new nomogram with Lp(a) improved the accuracy (12.10%) of identification of patients with non-SLN metastases (NRI: 0.121; 95% CI: 0.081-0.202; P = 0.011). Conclusions. This novel nomogram based on preoperative serum indexes combined with clinicopathologic features facilitates accurate prediction of risk of non-SLN metastases in Chinese patients with breast cancer.

TI  - Susceptibility of sheep to experimental co-infection with the ancestral lineage of SARS-CoV-2 and its alpha variant.
T2  - bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology
M3  - Preprint
AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for a global pandemic that has had significant impacts on human health and economies worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible and the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in humans. A wide range of animal species have also been shown to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection by experimental and/or natural infections. Domestic and large cats, mink, ferrets, hamsters, deer mice, white-tailed deer, and non-human primates have been shown to be highly susceptible, whereas other species such as mice, dogs, pigs, and cattle appear to be refractory to infection or have very limited susceptibility. Sheep (Ovis aries) are a commonly farmed domestic ruminant that have not previously been thoroughly investigated for their susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we performed in vitro and in vivo studies which consisted of infection of ruminant-derived cell cultures and experimental challenge of sheep to investigate their susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. Our results showed that sheep-derived cell cultures support SARS-CoV-2 replication. Furthermore, experimental challenge of sheep demonstrated limited infection with viral RNA shed in nasal and oral swabs primarily at 1-day post challenge (DPC), and also detected in the respiratory tract and lymphoid tissues at 4 and 8 DPC. Sero-reactivity was also observed in some of the principal infected sheep but not the contact sentinels, indicating that transmission to co-mingled naive sheep was not highly efficient; hovewer, viral RNA was detected in some of the respiratory tract tissues of sentinel animals at 21 DPC. Furthermore, we used challenge inoculum consisting of a mixture of two SARS-CoV-2 isolates, representatives of the ancestral lineage A and the B.1.1.7-like alpha variant of concern (VOC), to study competition of the two virus strains. Our results indicate that sheep show low susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and that the alpha VOC outcompeted the ancestral lineage A strain.

TI  - Features of atmospheric deep convection in northwestern South America obtained from infrared satellite data
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric deep convection in equatorial continental regions is not homogeneously distributed in space or time, primarily due to surface inhomogeneities such as elevated topography and coastlines. This is the case in northwestern South America, which has particularly complex topography which, together with its geographical location, is responsible for some of the most prominent precipitation features around the globe. Although some of these features have been previously investigated in detail, others have not yet been studied, and some not even documented in the literature. The diverse atmospheric convective activity that takes place in this region constitutes a natural laboratory that can provide important insights into fundamental questions relevant for global climate. We use seven years of infrared brightness temperature data in 30 min intervals from the GOES-13 geostationary satellite to estimate the spatial, seasonal and diurnal distributions of deep convective events in this region. By doing so, we bring forward several relevant features, providing a starting point for future investigations. For example, we find that deep convective events have a bimodal seasonal distribution throughout most of the Colombian Orinoco and Amazon basins, where precipitation is known to have a unimodal distribution. Furthermore, deep convective events in this region tend to be comparable in size to those offshore the Colombian Pacific coast or over the Magdalena river valley, but with significantly shorter lifetimes. On the other hand, nocturnal convection dominates at several continental locations; one of these, the middle-lower Magdalena river valley, has been previously identified as one of the most active lightning hotspots on Earth, but its convective mechanisms have not yet been fully investigated. Another such location worth investigating is the middle Magdalena river valley, which may have strong similarities with the Maracaibo Lake area.

TI  - Mindfulness in Psychotherapy: The Experience of Psychotherapists Who Incorporate Mindfulness Into Their Practice
T2  - PSYCHOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Clinical Impact Statement Question: How can mindfulness be incorporated within Psychodynamic theories and Cognitive-Behavioral Psychotherapy. Findings: Using mindfulness enhances therapeutic relationship, improves case conceptualization, and enriches technique. Meaning: Mindfulness can be viewed as a tool that strengthens the core aspects of both types of therapies. Next Steps: Validating these findings within a quantitative research design.Mindfulness is most commonly defined as the ability to bring one's attention to experiences occurring in the present moment, with complete acceptance and without judgment. The diverse benefits of mindfulness as a therapeutic tool have been widely explored. Nevertheless, when mindfulness is incorporated into psychotherapy it may influence the relationship between the therapist and the patient in diverse manners. This influence appears in the literature as relational mindfulness pertaining to mindfulness practiced in relationship to other people. The present article attempts to delineate the diverse influences of relational mindfulness within the psychotherapeutic setting through Qualitative analysis of in-depth interviews conducted with eight psychotherapists recruited from an institution for the teaching of mindfulness for psychotherapists. Analysis revealed influences on the therapist's worldview, on technique, on the presence of the therapist and, on the therapeutic alliance. These aspects are discussed from a psychoanalytic and a cognitive-behavioral framework.

TI  - Forest disturbances and the attribution derived from yearly Landsat time series over 1990-2020 in the Hengduan Mountains Region of Southwest China
T2  - FOREST ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Natural forests in the Hengduan Mountains Region (HDMR) have pivotal ecological functions and provide diverse ecosystem services. Capturing long-term forest disturbance and drivers at a regional scale is crucial for sustainable forest management and biodiversity conservation. Methods We used 30-m resolution Landsat time series images and the LandTrendr algorithm on the Google Earth Engine cloud platform to map forest disturbances at an annual time scale between 1990 and 2020 and attributed causal agents of forest disturbance, including fire, logging, road construction and insects, using disturbance properties and spectral and topographic variables in the random forest model. Results The conventional and area-adjusted overall accuracies (OAs) of the forest disturbance map were 92.3% and 97.70% +/- 0.06%, respectively, and the OA of mapping disturbance agents was 85.80%. The estimated disturbed forest area totalled 3313.13 km(2) (approximately 2.31% of the total forest area in 1990) from 1990 to 2020, with considerable interannual fluctuations and significant regional differences. The predominant disturbance agent was fire, which comprised approximately 83.33% of the forest area disturbance, followed by logging (12.2%), insects (2.4%) and road construction (2.0%). Massive forest disturbances occurred mainly before 2000, and the post-2000 annual disturbance area significantly dropped by 55% compared with the pre-2000 value. Conclusions This study provided spatially explicit and retrospective information on annual forest disturbance and associated agents in the HDMR. The findings suggest that China's logging bans in natural forests combined with other forest sustainability programmes have effectively curbed forest disturbances in the HDMR, which has implications for enhancing future forest management and biodiversity conservation.

TI  - Implementation and evaluation of sepsis surveillance and decision support in medical ICU and emergency department
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To improve the timely diagnosis and treatment of sepsis many institutions implemented automated sepsis alerts. Poor specificity, time delays, and a lack of actionable information lead to limited adoption by bedside clinicians and no change in practice or clinical outcomes. We aimed to compare sepsis care compliance before and after a multi-year implementation of a sepsis surveillance coupled with decision support in a tertiary care center. Design: Single center before and after study. Setting: Large academic Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) and Emergency Department (ED). Population: Patients 18 years of age or older admitted to *** Hospital MICU and ED from 09/4/2011 to 05/01/2018 with severe sepsis or septic shock. Interventions: Electronic medical record-based sepsis surveillance system augmented by clinical decision support and completion feedback. Measurements and main results: There were 1950 patients admitted to the MICU with the diagnosis of severe sepsis or septic shock during the study period. The baseline characteristics were similar before (N = 854) and after (N = 1096) implementation of sepsis surveillance. The performance of the alert was modest with a sensitivity of 79.9%, specificity of 76.9%, positive predictive value (PPV) 27.9%, and negative predictive value (NPV) 97.2%. There were 3424 unique alerts and 1131 confirmed sepsis patients after the sniffer implementation. During the study period average care bundle compliance was higher; however after taking into account improvements in compliance leading up to the intervention, there was no association between intervention and improved care bundle compliance (Odds ratio: 1.16; 95% CI: 0.71 to 1.89; p-value 0.554). Similarly, the intervention was not associated with improvement in hospital mortality (Odds ratio: 1.55; 95% CI: 0.95 to 2.52; p-value: 0.078). Conclusions: A sepsis surveillance system incorporating decision support or completion feedback was not associated with improved sepsis care and patient outcomes. (c) 2021 Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - An improved TROPOMI tropospheric NO2 research product over Europe
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Launched in October 2017, the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) aboard Sentinel-5 Precursor provides the potential to monitor air quality over point sources across the globe with a spatial resolution as high as 5.5 km x 3.5 km (7 km x 3.5 km before 6 August 2019). The DLR nitrogen dioxide (NO2) retrieval algorithm for the TROPOMI instrument consists of three steps: the spectral fitting of the slant column, the separation of stratospheric and tropospheric contributions, and the conversion of the slant column to a vertical column using an air mass factor (AMF) calculation. In this work, an improved DLR tropospheric NO2 retrieval algorithm from TROPOMI measurements over Europe is presented.The stratospheric estimation is implemented using the STRatospheric Estimation Algorithm from Mainz (STREAM), which was developed as a verification algorithm for TROPOMI and does not require chemistry transport model data as input. A directionally dependent STREAM (DSTREAM) is developed to correct for the dependency of the stratospheric NO2 on the viewing geometry by up to 2x10(14) molec./cm(2). Applied to synthetic TROPOMI data, the uncertainty in the stratospheric column is 3.5x10(14) molec./cm(2) in the case of significant tropospheric sources. Applied to actual measurements, the smooth variation of stratospheric NO2 at low latitudes is conserved, and stronger stratospheric variation at higher latitudes is captured.For AMF calculation, the climatological surface albedo data are replaced by geometry-dependent effective Lambertian equivalent reflectivity (GE_LER) obtained directly from TROPOMI measurements with a high spatial resolution. Mesoscale-resolution a priori NO2 profiles are obtained from the regional POLYPHEMUS/DLR chemistry transport model with the TNO-MACC emission inventory. Based on the latest TROPOMI operational cloud parameters, a more realistic cloud treatment is provided by a Clouds-As-Layers (CAL) model, which treats the clouds as uniform layers of water droplets, instead of the Clouds-As-Reflecting-Boundaries (CRB) model, in which clouds are simplified as Lambertian reflectors.For the error analysis, the tropospheric AMF uncertainty, which is the largest source of NO2 uncertainty for polluted scenarios, ranges between 20 % and 50 %, leading to a total uncertainty in the tropospheric NO2 column in the 30 %-60 % range. From a validation performed with ground-based multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) measurements, the new DLR tropospheric NO2 data show good correlations for nine European urban/suburban stations, with an average correlation coefficient of 0.78. The implementation of the algorithm improvements leads to a decrease of the relative difference from -55.3 % to -34.7 % on average in comparison with the DLR reference retrieval. When the satellite averaging kernels are used to remove the contribution of a priori profile shape, the relative difference decreases further to similar to -20 %.

TI  - Synthesis of New Betaine-Based Ionic Liquids by Using a "One-Pot" Amidation Process and Evaluation of Their Ecotoxicity through a New Method Involving a Hemocyte-Based Bioassay
T2  - ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - A new class of betaine-based ionic liquids (ILs) have been synthesized. Betaine is transformed into betaine amides with various anions. These amides were prepared at first through a classical four-step method; the synthesis was then improved by reducing the number of steps using a one-pot strategy for amidation. The final yields were good to high, and the various structures were fully characterized to valorize them in many domains such as catalysis, extraction, or dissolution of biopolymers. Next, to determine their ecotoxicity, a hemocyte-based bioassay was used. This new method to evaluate the ecotoxicity of ILs was also applied to other ILs [tetrabutyl-ammonium (TBA), tetrabutyl-phosphonium (TBP), and betaine- and cholinium-based ILs] to prove its efficiency and its complementarity toward other ecotoxicological assessment methods. TBA- and TBP-based ILs induced limited effects on zebra mussel hemocytes, with TBP-ILs proving to be generally less toxic than TBA-based ones. On the contrary, betaine- and cholinium-based IL exposure led to more acute toxicity with a noticeable effect associated with the cation carbon chain length. Overall results also showed differential toxicity of ILs according to the nature of the anion in the assemblage, with lactate being the less biologically reactive anion. The results of this study thus reveal the importance of the nature of both cations and anions which constitute the IL structures and can strongly, sometimes synergistically, influence the IL toxicity. The possible interactions between the cationic and anionic parts reveal the complexity of IL toxicity prediction, thereby arousing interest in developing innovative strategies for the risk assessment of these molecular assemblages. In this context, the proposed hemocyte-based bioassay proved its efficiency and sensitivity in scoring and ranking IL toxicity according to their effects in the immunocompetent cells of an environmentally sentinel bivalve. This alternative bioassay could represent a complementary tool to more traditional and standard bioassays to complete the toxicity screening of substances such as ILs or new chemicals synthesized under green chemistry principles and notably the limitation of environmental toxicity by investigating the acute and functional effects on a wild and relevant freshwater invertebrate species.

TI  - Mapping burn severity in the western Italian Alps through phenologically coherent reflectance composites derived from Sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Deriving burn severity from multispectral satellite data is a widely adopted approach to infer the degree of environmental change caused by fire. Burn severity maps obtained by thresholding bi-temporal indices based on pre- and post-fire Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) can vary substantially depending on temporal constraints such as matched acquisition and optimal seasonal timing. Satisfying temporal requirements is crucial to effectively disentangle fire and non-fire induced spectral changes and can be particularly challenging when only a few cloud-free images are available. Our study focuses on 10 wildfires that occurred in mountainous areas of the Piedmont Region (Italy) during autumn 2017 following a severe and prolonged drought period. Our objectives were to: (i) generate reflectance composites using Sentinel-2 imagery that were optimised for seasonal timing by embedding spatial patterns of long-term land surface phenology (LSP); (ii) produce and validate burn severity maps based on the modelled relationship between bi-temporal indices and field data; (iii) compare burn severity maps obtained using either a pair of cloud-free Sentinel-2 images, i.e. paired images, or reflectance composites. We proposed a pixel-based compositing algorithm coupling the weighted geometric median and thematic spatial information, e.g. long-term LSP metrics derived from the MODIS Collection 6 Land Cover Dynamics Product, to rank all the clear observations available in the growing season. Composite Burn Index data and bi-temporal indices exhibited a strong nonlinear relationship (R-2 > 0.85) using paired images or reflectance composites. Burn severity maps attained overall classification accuracy ranging from 76.9% to 83.7% (Kappa between 0.61 and 0.72) and the Relative differenced NBR (RdNBR) achieved the best results compared to other bi-temporal indices (differenced NBR and Relativized Burn Ratio). Improvements in overall classification accuracy offered by the calibration of bi-temporal indices with the dNBR offset were limited to burn severity maps derived from paired images. Reflectance composites provided the highest overall classification accuracy and differences with paired images were significant using uncalibrated bi-temporal indices (4.4% to 5.2%) while they decreased (2.8% to 3.2%) when we calibrated bi-temporal indices derived from paired images. The extent of the high severity category increased by similar to 19% in burn severity maps derived from reflectance composites (uncalibrated RdNBR) compared to those from paired images (calibrated RdNBR). The reduced contrast between healthy and burnt conditions associated with suboptimal seasonal timing caused an underestimation of burnt areas. By embedding spatial patterns of long-term LSP metrics, our approach provided consistent reflectance composites targeted at a specific phenological stage and minimising non-fire induced inter-annual changes. Being independent from the multispectral dataset employed, the proposed pixel-based compositing approach offers new opportunities for operational change detection applications in geographic areas characterised by persistent cloud cover.

TI  - Science, the endless frontier of regulatory capture
T2  - FUTURES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper we explore five recent cases of regulatory capture in Europe and zoom in on a form of corporate penetration which is based on a strategic use of the image and legitimacy of science. We examine cases in which lobbyists present themselves as upholders of science and of evidencebased policy, intervene directly in the methodological and ethical aspects of science for policymaking, thus imprinting their own agenda on the societal functions of science. We propose the existence of a process whereby private interest ascend an ideal 'epistemic ladder'. In this vision, lobbying intervention moves from questioning the evidence to questioning its legitimacy, all the way to acting as to create a worldview where not only the evidence, but the very idea of regulation, become irrelevant or undesirable, other than as a vehicle for the pursuit of private interest. Caught in this project, science and its future appear vulnerable.

TI  - Sub-continental-scale mapping of tidal wetland composition for East Asia: A novel algorithm integrating satellite tide-level and phenological features
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal wetlands, the global hotspots of biodiversity and carbon stocks, are currently experiencing widespread modifications in their composition due to human disturbances and changing climate. Accurate mapping of tidal wetland composition is crucial and urgently required for the conservation and management of coastal ecosystem, as well as for maximizing their associated services. However, remote sensing of tidal wetlands is still challenge due to periodic tidal fluctuations, frequent cloud cover, and similar spectral characteristics with terrestrial land cover types. Previous approaches to mapping the tidal wetlands have been restricted to small study regions or have focused on an individual tidal wetland type, thus limiting their ability to consistently monitor the composition of tidal wetlands over large geographic extents. To address the above issues, we proposed a novel algorithm on Google Earth Engine, called Multi-class Tidal Wetland Mapping by integrating Tide-level and Phenological features (MTWM-TP), to simultaneously map mangroves, salt marshes and tidal flats for specifying large-scale tidal wetland composition. The MTWM-TP algorithm firstly generates several noise-free composite images with different tide levels and phenological stages and then concatenates them into a random forest classifier for further classification. The usage of tide-level and phenological features eliminates inland landscapes and help to distinguish deciduous salt marshes and evergreen mangroves, leading to a statistically significant improvement in accuracy. We applied the algorithm to 10,274 Sentinel-2 images of East Asia and derived a 10-m resolution multi-class tidal wetland map with an overall accuracy of 97.02% at a sub-continental scale. We found that tidal wetlands occupied 1,308,241 ha of areas in East Asia in 2020, of which 89.12% were tidal flats, 9.39% were salt marshes, and only 1.49% were mangroves. This spatially explicit map of tidal wetland composition will provide valuable guidance for coastal biodiversity protection and blue carbon restoration. In addition, the proposed MTWM-TP algorithm can serve as a reliable means for monitoring sub -continental-or larger-scale tidal wetland composition more broadly.

TI  - Modelling seasonal variation of gully erosion at the catchment scale
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Geo-hydrological phenomena, including gullies, contribute significantly to soil erosion and land degradation. To address this, proper management of basins and hillslopes should consider the mechanism, timing, and location of gully development and how gullies interact with other hillslope processes. Yet, conventional modelling techniques for such processes are rare, frequently being limited to applications of only single processes and typically requiring high-resolution input data. Further, existing tools for characterizing basins and hillslopes tend to be based on static descriptions of geo-environmental conditions, and thus are not effective for modelling changes such as the seasonal triggering conditions of gully phenomena over time. This study proposes a method to integrate open remote sensing data (Sentinel-2) and an existing modelling tool (LANDPLANER) using simplified input data to better predict and forecast gullies' spatial and temporal occurrence. The study investigates the seasonal conditions responsible for the triggering of gullies at the catchment scale using different erosion modelling schema in the Toscana region of Central Italy. Geomorphological gully inventory data were collected and used as benchmarks to test the proposed approach. The results show that the occurrence of gully erosion in the studied region changes seasonally, and the proposed method was able to effectively discriminate spatial and temporal differences of the gully phenomena. The proposed method can be applied to similar regions worldwide, allowing for the investigation of gully erosion over time, even in places with limited data availability.

TI  - Cultural Orientation and Risk Perception: Development of a Scale Operating in a French Context
T2  - RISK ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cultural theory has often been invoked to explain risk preferences, yet empirical evidence for that influence has regularly been challenged. This research addresses this issue by reassessing the role of cultural orientation in understanding risk perception through the development of an alternative assessment tool of worldviews operating in a French context. Using data from two samples of French citizens (N = 192 and N = 631), study 1 conducted exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses which provided support for a three-factor scale of worldviews: hierarchy-individualism, egalitarianism, and fatalism. Based on data from two other independent samples (N = 111 and N = 422), study 2 affirmed, for each worldview, its convergent validity (with its counterpart in another worldview measure), discriminant validity (from all other subscales), and predictive validity (for specific patterns of risk perception). Of particular interest is that culturally diverse individuals hold divergent positions on risk (skepticism, sensibility, neutrality) depending on, and in proportion to, the (in)compatibility of the hazardous activity to their preferred worldview. Implications for risk management and communication are discussed.

TI  - A CONVERGENT FINITE DIFFERENCE METHOD FOR COMPUTING MINIMAL LAGRANGIAN GRAPHS
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS ON PURE AND APPLIED ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - We consider the numerical construction of minimal Lagrangian graphs, which is related to recent applications in materials science, molecular engineering, and theoretical physics. It is known that this problem can be for-mulated as an additive eigenvalue problem for a fully nonlinear elliptic partial differential equation. We introduce and implement a two-step generalized finite difference method, which we prove converges to the solution of the eigenvalue problem. Numerical experiments validate this approach in a range of chal-lenging settings. We further discuss the generalization of this new framework to Monge-Ampere type equations arising in optimal transport. This approach holds great promise for applications where the data does not naturally satis-fy the mass balance condition, and for the design of numerical methods with improved stability properties.

TI  - Exploring actionable visualizations for environmental data: Air quality assessment of two Belgian locations
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Organizations collect an ever-increasing amount of data concerning environmental parameters. Non-experts may be confronted with an information overload, making the data meaningless. A way to circumvent this problem is visualizing the trends in the pollution concentrations measured over time. However, non-experts do not have a mental model to derive air quality information from displayed concentration profiles. Therefore, a large fraction of the stakeholders remains unable to read/interpret such data effectively. To improve communication with stakeholders, we superposed health risk information from 9 different Air Quality Indices (AQIs) on different kinds of graphs. The visualization methods are applied on data collected by the Belgian Environment Agency from two monitoring stations located in contrasting regions, Ghent and Vielsalm. Supplementary, spatially distributed pollution is shown using data collected from Sentinel-5p satellite. Despite some limitations of the AQIs, the applied visualizations methods successfully translate the data obtained into actionable information.

TI  - Solid waste dumping site analysis using GIS and remote sensing: Bonga Town, Southwestern Ethiopia
T2  - WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The main objective of this study was to select potential solid waste landfill areas suitable for Bonga Town that are environmentally sound. The key data were LANDSAT 8 and SPOT-6 satellite images with a spatial resolution of 15 and 1.5 m, respectively; a digital elevation model with a spatial resolution of 30 m; and a ground control point, which was collected through a ground point survey and a topographic map of the study area. Each parameter was subjected to a peer review according to the analytical hierarchy process. Once the weights were established, the weighted overlap analysis was determined, which combined these criteria and classified them into high, medium, less suitable and inappropriate regions of the study area. The results show that 75.65% of the study area is not suitable for the solid waste landfill, 18.86% less suitable, 5.17% moderately adequate and 0.3% very adequate. Therefore, the ability to use inaccessible geological information framework and detection innovations for mandatory discrimination evidence for a reasonably robust waste dump will minimise opportunities and natural human well-being problems.

TI  - Fragmented landscapes affect honey bee colony strength at diverse spatial scales in agroecological landscapes in Kenya
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Landscape fragmentation and habitat loss at multiple scales directly affect species abundance, diversity, and productivity. There is a paucity of information about the effect of the landscape structure and diversity on honey bee colony strength in Africa. Here, we present new insights into the relationship between landscape metrics such as patch size, shape, connectivity, composition, and configuration and honey bee (Apis mellifera) colony strength characteristics. Remote-sensing-based landscape variables were linked to honey bee colony strength variables in a typical highly fragmented smallholder agroecological region in Kenya. We examined colonies in six sites with varying degrees of land degradation during the period from 2017 to 2018. Landscape structure was first mapped using medium resolution bitemporal Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery with an optimized random forest model. The influence of the surrounding landscape matrix was then constrained to two buffer distances, i.e., 1 km representing the local foraging scale and 2.5 km representing the wider foraging scale around each investigated apiary and for each of the six sites. The results of zero-inflated negative binomial regression with mixed effects showed that lower complexity of patch geometries represented by fractal dimension and reduced proportions of croplands were most influential at local foraging scales (1 km) from the apiary. In addition, higher proportions of woody vegetation and hedges resulted in higher colony strength at longer distances from the apiary (2.5 km). Honey bees in moderately degraded landscapes demonstrated the most consistently strong colonies throughout the study period. Efforts towards improving beekeeper livelihoods, through higher hive productivity, should target moderately degraded and heterogeneous landscapes, which provide forage from diverse land covers.

TI  - Do rusty crayfish (<i>Faxonius rusticus</i>) invasions affect water clarity in north temperate lakes?
T2  - LIMNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive crayfish can cause shifts in lakes from clear, macrophyte-dominated states to eutrophic, phytoplankton-dominated states because of their burrowing and foraging behavior. While invasive crayfish populations have been linked to declines in water clarity of shallow lakes and wetlands in Asia and Europe, little research has been done on the potential for similar effects of invasive rusty crayfish (Faxonius rusticus) in large temperate lakes of the Midwestern USA. We related F. rusticus abundance in 17 lakes of northern Wisconsin, USA over time (1984-2018) to measures of lake clarity (chlorophyll a concentration and Secchi disc depth) estimated from remote sensing (Landsat imagery). Contrary to the effects of invasive crayfish in other study systems, we found a weak, positive association between F. rusticus abundance and water clarity. We propose that lake clarity may increase if declines in small fishes caused by F. rusticus lead to population growth of zooplankton and consequent decreases in phytoplankton through a trophic cascade. Alternatively, F. rusticus could be passengers to, rather than drivers of, lake clarity trends, responding positively to increased littoral benthic productivity when lakes are clearer. Future research should aim to determine if F. rusticus causes or responds to changes in water clarity, but should also investigate the impacts of crayfish invasions on water clarity across a greater variety of lentic ecosystems.

TI  - Temporal and spatial heterogeneity of recent lake surface water temperature trends in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake surface water temperature (LSWT) monitoring is significant as it provides valuable information on climate changes and resultant changes in lakes. Here, monthly moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer LSWT data of 364 lakes during 2001-2015 were analysed to determine spatiotemporal patterns of daytime (LSWTd), nighttime (LSWTn), daily LSWT (LSWTm) and their drivers in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau at monthly, seasonal and annual timescales. We focused on spatiotemporal heterogeneity of LSWT trends. Results showed climatological LSWT presented a saddle-shaped distribution along the northeast-southwest direction except for LSWTd in March, while highly heterogeneous LSWT trends without spatial dependence were observed at all timescales. Diurnal asymmetry of LSWT trends was evident with 56.04-88.19% lakes showing smaller LSWTd trends than LSWTn trends except for August and September. Further, we found lake surface albedo trend could effectively explain spatial patterns of LSWT trends at different timescales, and its interactions with other variable trends generally were the largest or second-largest.

TI  - Characterization of atmospheric mechanisms that cause the transport of Arabian dust particles to the southeastern region of Turkey
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Southeastern Anatolia Region (SEAR), the third-lowest mean annual precipitation region in Turkey, has semi-arid climate and plateau characteristics. The proximity of the region to North Africa and the Middle East dust source areas enables long-range transport of desert dust particles toward the SEAR by strong winds. Among the other dust source regions, the Arabian Peninsula has a crucial role in terms of affecting the SEAR with a high-annual frequency and high dust concentration values. We investigated the atmospheric patterns of three extreme Arabian dust episodes that affect the SEAR in this study. Dust episodes were determined using present weather (SYNOP) codes of ten stations in the SEAR during the 2014-2019 period. The source regions were found using HYSPLIT backward trajectory analysis. In this study, we benefited from synoptic maps, in situ PM10 observations, numerical simulations of the WRF-Chem model, and MODIS satellite images to analyze the extreme dust episodes. The results showed that the surface low pressure over the Persian Gulf and strong southerly winds at the 700-hPa level enabled the transport of dust particles from the surface to the mid-atmospheric levels. If the center of the upper-level ridge extended from Saudi Arabia to southern Turkey, the atmospheric blocking mechanism prevented the dispersion of dense dust particles from the SEAR to its surrounding, which caused the observation of high dust concentrations in the SEAR. In general, the WRF-Chem model outputs are in good agreement with ground-based PM10 concentrations and MODIS true-color images in terms of temporal and spatial distributions of dust concentrations.

TI  - Syphilis and the COVID-19 pandemic: Did the lockdown stop risky sexual behavior?
T2  - CLINICS IN DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Restrictive measures to contain the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic might produce different effects on other infective diseases, especially those affecting the most intimate sphere of sexuality. The epidemiology of syphilis could reflect the consequences of whether people are avoiding or not risky behaviors. To understand the course of syphilis during the COVID-19 outbreak, we performed a retrospective observational study of all new diagnoses observed at the STDs Service of the Dermatology Clinic at Cagliari, part of the Italian sentinel surveillance system. All incident cases diagnosed during the first 6 months of each year, from 2016 to 2020, thus including the recent lockdown period, were retrieved from the database. Of the 87 cases studied, 18 occurred during the first 6 months of 2020, almost all patients (88%) presenting with early phases of the disease and reporting unprotected sexual intercourses in spite of community containment and social distancing. Comparison with the previous 4 years found no significant statistical differences that hospital access and management limitations had not impaired the management of patients with syphilis. We alert the medical community of the possible increase of sexually transmitted diseases, as society returns to normal. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Single institute experience of intraoperative radiation therapy in early-stage breast cancer
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) is an alternative to whole breast irradiation in selected early-stage breast cancer patients. In this single institute analysis, we report the preliminary results of IORT given by Axxent Electronic Brachytherapy (eBT) system. Patients treated with lumpectomy and eBT within a minimum follow-up period of 12 months were analyzed. Eligible criteria include being over the age of 45, having unifocal invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) or ductal carcinoma in situ <3 cm in diameter, not exhibiting lymph node involvement on preoperative images, and negative sentinel lymph node biopsy. The eBT was given by preloaded radiation plans to deliver a single fraction of 20 Gray (Gy) right after lumpectomy. From January 2016 to April 2019, a total of 103 patients were collected. There were 78 patients with IDC and 25 with ductal carcinoma in situ. At a mean follow-up time of 31.1 months (range, 14.5-54.0 months), the local control rate was 98.1%. Two IDC patients had tumor recurrences (1 local and 1 regional failure). Post-IORT radiotherapy was given to 4 patients. There were no cancer related deaths, no distant metastases, and treatment side effects greater than grade 3 documented. We report the largest single institute analysis using the eBT system in Taiwan. The low recurrence and complication rates at a 31.1 month follow-up time support the use of the eBT system in selected early-stage breast cancer patients.

TI  - Using Tailored Messages to Target Overuse of Low-Value Breast Cancer Care in Older Women
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: National recommendations allow for the omission of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and post-lumpectomy radiotherapy in women >= 70 y/o with early-stage, hormone-receptor positive invasive breast cancer, but these therapies remain common. Previous work demonstrates an individual's maximizing-minimizing trait-an inherent preference for more or less medical care-may influence the preference for low-value care.Materials and methods: We recruited an equal number of women >= 70 yrs who were maximizers, minimizers, or neutral based on a validated measure between September 2020 and November 2020. Participants were presented a hypothetical breast cancer diagnosis before randomization to one of three follow-up messages: maximizer-tailored, minimizer-tailored, or neutral. Tailored messaging aimed to redirect maximizers and minimizers toward declining SLNB and radiotherapy. The main outcome measure was predicted probability of choosing SLNB or radiotherapy.Results: The final analytical sample (n = 1600) was 515 maximizers (32%), 535 neutral (33%) and 550 (34%) minimizers. Higher maximizing tendency positively correlated with electing both SLNB and radiotherapy on logistic regression (P < 0.01). Any tailoring (maximizer- or minimizer-tailored) reduced preference for SLNB in maximizing and neutral women but had no effect in minimizing women. Tailoring had no impact on radiotherapy decision, except for an increased probability of minimizers electing radiotherapy when presented with maximizer-tailored messaging.Conclusions: Maximizing-minimizing tendencies are associated with treatment preferences among women facing a hypothetical breast cancer diagnosis. Targeted messaging may facilitate avoidance of low-value breast cancer care, particularly for SLNB. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Verification of the differenced Normalised Burn Ratio (dNBR) as an index of fire severity in Afrotemperate Forest
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Temperate evergreen broad-leaved forest seldom experiences fire, and little is known about the severity at which they burn. During October-November 2018, 70 000 ha of fynbos, thicket, Afrotemperate forest and other lesser vegetation types burnt in the southern Cape of South Africa. This study set out to verify through field observations the accuracy of the differenced Normalised Burn Ratio (dNBR) as an index of fire severity, derived from Sentinel 2 images, in Afrotemperate forest. Stem fire severity and char height were observed for 1 648 trees in 87 plots and linear regression used to test whether these observed measures were related to dNBR. Stem fire severity and char height were collinear, and the latter dropped from further analysis. The strong linear relationship between dNBR and stem fire severity (r(2) = 0.69, p < 0.001) confirmed the accuracy of dNBR as a measure of fire severity in Afrotemperate forest. The verification of dNBR enables the mapping and characterization of fire severity in Afrotemperate forest. In the fire investigated, a total of 4 628 ha of Afrotemperate forest burnt of which 67 % burnt at low severity, 21 % at medium severity and 12 % at high severity. Such information on the distribution of fire severity facilitates investigation of further questions regarding past and future fire regimes and the fire ecology of Afrotemperate forest.

TI  - The TROPOSIF global sun-induced fluorescence dataset from the Sentinel-5P TROPOMI mission
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - The first satellite-based global retrievals of terrestrial sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) were achieved in 2011. Since then, a number of global SIF datasets with different spectral, spatial, and temporal sampling characteristics have become available to the scientific community. These datasets have been useful to monitor the dynamics and productivity of a range of vegetated areas worldwide, but the coarse spatiotemporal sampling and low signal-to-noise ratio of the data hamper their application over small or fragmented ecosystems. The recent advent of the Copernicus Sentinel-5P TROPOMI mission and the high quality of its data products promise to alleviate this situation, as TROPOMI provides daily global measurements at a much denser spatial and temporal sampling than earlier satellite instruments. In this work, we present a global SIF dataset produced from TROPOMI measurements within the TROPOSIF project funded by the European Space Agency. The current version of the TROPOSIF dataset covers the time period between May 2018 and April 2021. Baseline SIF retrievals are derived from the 743-758 nm window. A secondary SIF dataset derived from an extended fitting window (735-758 nm window) is included. This provides an enhanced signal-to-noise ratio at the expense of a higher sensitivity to atmospheric effects. Spectral reflectance spectra at seven 3 nm windows devoid of atmospheric absorption within the 665-785 nm range are also included in the TROPOSIF dataset as an important ancillary variable to be used in combination with SIF. The methodology to derive SIF and ancillary data as well as results from an initial data quality assessment are presented in this work. The TROPOSIF dataset is available through the following digital object identifier (DOI): https://doi.org/10.5270/esa- s5p_innovation- sif-20180501_20210320- v2.1-202104 (Guanter et al., 2021).

TI  - Exploring the agricultural landscape diversity-food security nexus: an analysis in two contrasted parklands of Central Senegal
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - CONTEXT: Fostering diversity within agricultural systems can substantially contribute to improved food security among smallholder farmers. Agroforestry parklands are diverse agricultural landscapes where trees can provide an array of ecosystem services. Previous studies analyzing the agricultural landscape diversity-food security nexus in agroforestry parklands have only considered tree cover. OBJECTIVE: We propose an original empirical approach that combines the analysis of spatial data on agricultural landscape diversity with agricultural field monitoring and household surveys. These three sources of data were used to scrutinize the direct and indirect contributions of agricultural landscape diversity to food availability and food access. METHODS: Millet yield was used as a proxy for food availability, and household food access was approximated using the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) indicator. Two contrasted agroforestry parklands of Central Senegal were chosen as case studies. Firstly, we used a Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) algorithm to disentangle the relative contribution of landscape diversity, biophysical and crop management variables in explaining millet yield variability. Secondly, we investigated the pathways linking agricultural landscape di-versity to HFIAS using a Correlation Network Analysis (CNA). RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The GBM model explained 77% and 84% of millet yield variability for the two parklands, respectively, with landscape diversity variables accounting for 53% and 47% of relative influence. Among the landscape diversity variables, tree species richness and tree density were the most important ones. Millet yield was positively associated with tree density in the Nioro site until a threshold of 5 trees/ha, and with tree species richness in the two sites. The CNA showed that greater tree cover and larger tree patches were moderately correlated with HFIAS. This suggests that tree species with large crown, as it the case for most fruit bearing tree species in the region, are the main species contributing directly to food access. Agricultural land-scape diversity contributed mainly indirectly to household food access through an "agroecological pathway", i.e. by the provision of ecosystem services regulating and supporting crop production. SIGNIFICANCE: Using an integrated landscape approach relying on up-to-date remote sensing data and recent advances in data analysis methods, our study shows that tree species diversity matters as much as the amount of tree cover for the production of food, and it can contribute to improve food security. We bring a more nuanced picture of the contribution of agricultural landscape diversity to food security suggesting that land management policies supporting food security should consider both tree density and tree species diversity to optimize the co -benefits of trees for the different food security dimensions.

TI  - Seasonal and interannual drought responses of vegetation in a California urbanized area measured using complementary remote sensing indices
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The effects of drought can manifest in vegetation across an array of physiological responses and time scales. In metropolitan areas, vegetation provides shading and cooling during hot and dry conditions, but these benefits can be reduced with drought. While many studies have evaluated interannual vegetation drought responses, these responses to drought can be expressed diversely across seasons, especially in cities that regularly experience seasonal drought (e.g., in Mediterranean climates). Here, we evaluated seasonal and interannual drought responses across the dominant types of urban trees and grasses in the Santa Barbara, California, USA metropolitan area, primarily using Landsat imagery acquired from 2010 to 2019 as well as repeat Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer - Classic (AVIRIS-C) imagery acquired 2013-2015. To track vegetation types, we produced a random forest classification from 4 m AVIRIS-Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) imagery acquired in June 2014 (overall accuracy = 86%; kappa = 0.85), thresholding to 90% pure pixels for most vegetation types in the coarser time series imagery. We monitored drought response from Landsat imagery using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the difference in land surface temperature (ALST) between vegetation and developed/impervious surfaces. We used AVIRIS-C to measure equivalent water thickness (EWT), comparing it with NDVI. During drought years, NDVI was lower and ALST was closer to zero. Changes in EWT revealed seasonal adjustments by vegetation that were not readily apparent in the NDVI. To show how drought response expression in vegetation can vary by season, drought duration, and urban vegetation type, we examined the correlations of both NDVI and ALST to the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) calculated over a range of time spans. For most vegetation types, the strongest correlations of NDVI to SPEI and ALST to SPEI were during the summer, except for annual grass and turfgrass NDVI, which had the strongest correlations in the winter. In general, NDVI and ALST for annual grass were most often correlated with SPEI at spans <12 months, particularly for NDVI. By contrast, NDVI and ALST for trees and turfgrass were commonly also correlated with SPEI at spans >= 12 months, in addition to seasonal time spans of <12 months. This study demonstrates the benefits of using functionally and seasonally distinctive remote sensing variables (NDVI, ALST, and EWT) together to quantify changes in vegetation canopy condition during droughts.

TI  - Surface pCO<sub>2</sub> variability in two contrasting basins of North Indian Ocean using satellite data
T2  - DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial and temporal variability of the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) over the northern tropical Indian Ocean was estimated based on satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface salinity (SSS), and chlorophyll concentration (Chl-a). The distribution of sea surface pCO(2) is controlled by various physical processes, such as mixing, entrainment, upwelling, and advection, and by associated biological processes, such as phytoplankton blooms. The results showed lower surface water pCO(2) over the Bay of Bengal (BoB) (< 300 mu atm) as compared to the Arabian Sea (AS), which could be attributed to low salinity during the northeast monsoon season (December-January) in the BoB. High pCO(2) values (> 500 mu atm) were found near the Somali coast during the southwest monsoon season (June-August) caused by intense coastal upwelling. The pCO(2) over BoB (400-450 mu atm) was more than that of the AS in the fall inter-monsoon season (September-November) as a response to the relatively warmer SST over the BoB. The highest spatiotemporal variability of surface pCO(2) was observed in the western AS near to the coast and over the northern BoB as a response to the higher variability in biological productivity and salinity, respectively, over these regions. The effect of tropical cyclones on pCO(2) variability over the BoB was also assessed in this study. The sea surface pCO(2) values were found to be much smaller along the cyclone track after the passage of cyclones because of the strong SST drop and the sudden phytoplankton blooms caused by the entrainment and vertical mixing of subsurface cold and nutrient-rich water with surface water. The cyclone-induced surface cooling and the associated decrease in surface water pCO(2) were found to be higher after the passage of the Madi cyclone compared to the Hudhud cyclone.

TI  - Psychiatric hospitalization during the two SARS-CoV-2 pandemic waves: New warnings for acute psychotic episodes and suicidal behaviors
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUNDThe subsequent waves of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic have represented a dramatic health emergency characterized by significant consequences on mental health. Diachronic variations in the incidence rates of acute relapse of psychiatric disorders may represent significant "sentinel events " for assessing the mental health response to an unprecedented stressful event.AIMTo investigate the variation in psychiatric hospitalization rates and differences in sociodemographic and clinical-psychopathological peculiarities at Bologna "Maggiore " General Hospital Psychiatric Ward (GHPW) between the first two waves SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the same periods of the previous 3 years. The secondary purpose of the study was to suggest a diachronic response pathway to stress by reporting additional literature data on coping strategies.METHODSThis observational and retrospective study collected information on admission to the GHPW at the "Maggiore " Hospital in Bologna in the index periods defined as follows: the first period between February 24, 2020 and April 30, 2020 (first epidemic wave) and the second period between October 8, 2020, and January 7, 2021 (second pandemic wave). Absolute numbers and proportion of admitted patients, their sociodemographic and clinical-psychopathological characteristics were compared with the same parameters recorded in the two same periods of the previous 3 years. No strict inclusion or exclusion criteria were provided in the data collection to collect information on all patients requiring acute psychiatric hospitalization.RESULTSDuring the first wave, there was a significant reduction in hospitalization rates, although there was a simultaneous increase in compulsory hospitalizations and the acute relapse of schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders. During the second wave, hospitalization rates reached those recorded during the same period of the previous 3 years, mainly due to the rise of bipolar and related disorders, depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, trauma- and stressor-related disorders and suicidal behaviors.CONCLUSIONThe coping strategies adopted during the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic protected the vulnerable population from the general risk of clinical-psychopathological acute relapse, even if they increased the susceptibility to run into schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder relapses. In the medium-long term (as in the second pandemic wave), the same strategies do not play protective roles against the stress associated with the pandemic and social restriction measures. Indeed, during the second wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, an increase in total hospitalization rate, suicidal behaviors and the incidence rate of bipolar and related disorders, depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, trauma- and stressor-related disorders was observed.

TI  - Spread and phenology of Spathius galinae and Tetrastichus planipennisi, recently introduced for biocontrol of emerald ash borer (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) in the northeastern United States
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - Emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire (Coleoptera: Buprestidae), is an invasive wood-boring pest of ash trees (Fraxinus spp.) in the United States. It is responsible for catastrophic decline of ash in urban and forested ecosystems, resulting in millions of dollars in economic losses. Biological control is one of the most promising management options available to reduce A. planipennis spread and impact. From 2015 to 2017, two larval parasitoids from the native range of A. planipennis, Spathius galinae Belokobylskij & Strazenac (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) and Tetrastichus planipennisi Yang (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae), were released in forested areas in New York and Connecticut. The purpose of this study was to measure the spread and seasonal phenology of these introduced parasitoids. From May to September 2020, sentinel ash logs containing EAB larvae were deployed in naturally occurring A. planipennis infested trees at each release site and at 2 km intervals up to 14 km away from the release site. Logs were replaced every two weeks and the parasitization rate was recorded. Each month, three trees from each release area were also cut and debarked to record A. planipennis infestation levels, natural parasitization rates, and A. planipennis and parasitoid phenology. We observed that both S. galinae and T. planipennisi emerged from the logs first deployed from the end of May to early June. Parasitization peaked in late July and mid-August, with sentinel logs deployed at each distance producing both species throughout the summer until mid-September. Both S. galinae and T. planipennisi were detected 14 km away from the release sites, the greatest distance away from the release sites sampled. Debarked trees produced similar seasonal patterns of parasitism. Our results indicate that the classical biological control program initiated several years ago has successfully produced a self-sustaining population of both S. galinae and T. planipennisi, which have been spreading widely and attacking the borer throughout the growing season. These findings strongly suggest that future release efforts may allow for wider temporal release windows and larger strategic spacing of release points across geographic regions.

TI  - Multi-year monitoring land surface phenology in relation to climatic variables using MODIS-NDVI time-series in Mediterranean forest, Northeast Tunisia
T2  - ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mediterranean region is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change. The majority of climate models forecast a rise in temperatures and less rainfall, which have been observed in recent decades. These changes will affect several vegetation properties, especially phenological dynamics and traits, by increasing drought intensity and recurrence. In this climate change context, the present study aims to assess the evolution of vegetation state and its relation with the climate dynamics in the Mediterranean forest region of northeast Tunisia using Land Surface Phenology (LSP) metrics and the vegetation index (NDVI) analysis from 2000 to 2017. To conduct this work, we used precipitation and temperature data from the two closest weather stations and 16-day NDVI composite images from the MODIS satellite source, with 250-m spatial resolution. Three phenological metrics- start of season (SOS), end of season (EOS), and length of season (LOS) - were obtained and compared for different vegetation types. The LSP variation in response to climatic metrics was also analyzed. The results showed that the LSP in our study area changed significantly during the 2000-2017 period, which includes an average 7.8 days delay in the SOS, an average advance in the EOS by 5 days, and LOS shortened by an average 12.8 days. Autumn (Pr_9) and spring (Pr_3 and P3_4) precipitations, as well as maximum temperature (Tx9+10), represent the best climate parameters to explain the changes in LSP. Both the NDVI and SPEI showed a significant high correlation (p < 0.001) on longer time scales. LSP and NDVI proved useful tools for monitoring the vegetation state according to climate for better planning territory purposes.

TI  - Bathymetry derivation in shallow water of the South China Sea with ICESat-2 and Sentinel-2 data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water depth estimation models based on optical satellite images often require ground-truth data for supervised training procedures. However, in the South China Sea (SCS), the ground truth data are limited or outdated. Therefore, it is challenging to derive reasonable water depths around islands or coral reefs without prior knowledge. ICES at-2 is a space-borne LiDAR satellite launched in September 2018 that provides geolocated height at the laser footprint on a global scale and opens an opportunity for bathymetric mapping in regions normally inaccessible. The combination of ICES at-2 data with Sentinel-2 optical images is developed to extend the application of satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB). Three SDB algorithms, including ratio transform (RT), multiple linear regression, and classification-based (CB) algorithms, are applied to investigate the water-depth retrieval capabilities. Five islands located in different parts of the SCS are selected, analyzed, and evaluated with the support of Google Earth Engine. Comparing the ICES at-2 water depth profiles against airborne LiDAR data, the statistical indexes of R-2 and RMSE reached 0.99 and 0.31 m, respectively. This demonstrates the suitability of using ICES at-2 data as a reliable data source in shallow water. On the other hand, the CB model is used to address the issue of heterogeneity by dividing the target islands into groups based on spectral characteristics. The results show that an integration of ICESat-2 and Sentinel-2 imageries can achieve R-2 at 0.75 to 0.95 and RMSE at 0.66 to 1.87 m with the deepest pixels at 19 to 32 m across these five islands. We conclude that the ICESat-2/Sentinel-2 synergy scheme is capable of overcoming current limitations in various regions and thus can fill the gaps in bathymetry charts.

TI  - Response of glacier area variation to climate change in the Kaidu-Kongque river basin, Southern Tianshan Mountains during the last 20 years
T2  - CHINA GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers are crucial water resources for arid inland rivers in Northwest China. In recent decades, glaciers are largely experiencing shrinkage under the climate-warming scenario, thereby exerting tremendous influences on regional water resources. The primary role of understudying watershed scale glacier changes under changing climatic conditions is to ensure sustainable utilization of regional water resources, to prevent and mitigate glacier-related disasters. This study maps the current (2020) distribution of glacier boundaries across the Kaidu-Kongque river basin, south slope of Tianshan Mountains, and monitors the spatial evolution of glaciers over five time periods from 2000-2020 through thresholded band ratios approach, using 25 Landsat images at 30 m resolution. In addition, this study attempts to understand the role of climate characteristics for variable response of glacier area. The results show that the total area of glaciers was 398.21 km(2) in 2020. The glaciers retreated by about 1.17 km(2)/a (0.26%/a) from 2000 to 2020.The glaciers were reducing at a significantly rapid rate between 2000 and 2005, a slow rate from 2005 to 2015, and an accelerated rate during 2015-2020. The meteorological data shows slight increasing trends of mean annual temperature (0.02 degrees C/a) and annual precipitation (2.07 mm/a). The correlation analysis demonstrates that the role of temperature presents more significant correlation with glacier recession than precipitation. There is a temporal hysteresis in the response of glacier change to climate change. Increasing trend of temperature in summer proves to be the driving force behind the Kaidu-Kongque basin glacier recession during the recent 20 years. (C) 2021 China Geology Editorial Office.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeTo explore the value of machine learning model based on CE-MRI radiomic features in preoperative prediction of sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis of breast cancer. MethodsThe clinical, pathological and MRI data of 177 patients with pathologically confirmed breast cancer (81 with SLN positive and 96 with SLN negative) and underwent conventional DCE-MRI before surgery in the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University from January 2015 to May 2021 were analyzed retrospectively. The samples were randomly divided into the training set (n=123) and validation set (n= 54) according to the ratio of 7:3. The radiomic features were derived from DCE-MRI phase 2 images, and 1,316 original eigenvectors are normalized by maximum and minimum normalization. The optimal feature filter and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm were used to obtain the optimal features. Five machine learning models of Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting Decision Tree, and Decision Tree were constructed based on the selected features. Radiomics signature and independent risk factors were incorporated to build a combined model. The receiver operating characteristic curve and area under the curve were used to evaluate the performance of the above models, and the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated. ResultsThere is no significant difference between all clinical and histopathological variables in breast cancer patients with and without SLN metastasis (P >0.05), except tumor size and BI-RADS classification (P< 0.01). Thirteen features were obtained as optimal features for machine learning model construction. In the validation set, the AUC (0.86) of SVM was the highest among the five machine learning models. Meanwhile, the combined model showed better performance in sentinel lymph node metastasis (SLNM) prediction and achieved a higher AUC (0.88) in the validation set. ConclusionsWe revealed the clinical value of machine learning models established based on CE-MRI radiomic features, providing a highly accurate, non-invasive, and convenient method for preoperative prediction of SLNM in breast cancer patients.

TI  - Calibration of METRIC Modeling for Evapotranspiration Estimation Using Landsat 8 Imagery Data
T2  - WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Water resources management needs efficient tools to estimate the rate of water loss through evapotranspiration (ET). High resolution spatial imagery has provided a valuable source of data which their implementation in well-tuned models has the potential of evapotranspiration rate estimations with satisfactory accuracy. Mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration (METRIC) is basically an energy balance model which has shown a good performance in different applications. The model needs to be calibrated for various source of spatial data and with the introduction of new empirical correlations for numerous variables which are used in the model, the model is recalibrated for Landsat 8 multispectral image and applied to intensively cultivated agriculture lands in Alpu (Eskisehir, Turkey). In previous studies, the correlations from previous studies were referenced where the procedure was confusing for many users. In this work, a descriptive step by step procedure is also provided. The meteorological 24 h relative ET was then used to spread the instant ET (at image capture time) estimation into daily 24 h estimation. This approach reduces the errors from multiple correlations and to some extent the effect of short variations like partial cloud coverage.

TI  - Refined burned-area mapping protocol using Sentinel-2 data increases estimate of 2019 Indonesian burning
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Many nations are challenged by landscape fires. A confident knowledge of the area and distribution of burning is crucial to monitor these fires and to assess how they might best be reduced. Given the differences that arise using different detection approaches, and the uncertainties surrounding burned-area estimates, their relative merits require evaluation. Here we propose, illustrate, and examine one promising approach for Indonesia where recurring forest and peatland fires have become an international crisis.Drawing on Sentinel-2 satellite time-series analysis, we present and validate new 2019 burned-area estimates for Indonesia. The corresponding burned-area map is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4551243 (Gaveau et al., 2021a). We show that > 3.11 million hectares (Mha) burned in 2019. This burned-area extent is double the Landsat-derived official estimate of 1.64 Mha from the Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry and 50% more that the MODIS MCD64A1 burned-area estimate of 2.03 Mha. Though we observed proportionally less peatland burning (31% vs. 39% and 40% for the official and MCD64A1 products, respectively), in absolute terms we still observed a greater area of peatland affected (0.96 Mha) than the official estimate (0.64 Mha). This new burned-area dataset has greater reliability than these alternatives, attaining a user accuracy of 97.9% (CI: 97.1 %-98.8 %) compared to 95.1% (CI: 93.5 %-96.7 %) and 76% (CI: 73.3 %-78.7 %), respectively. It omits fewer burned areas, particularly smaller- (< 100 ha) to intermediate-sized (100-1000 ha) burns, attaining a producer accuracy of 75.6% (CI: 68.3 %-83.0 %) compared to 49.5% (CI: 42.5 %-56.6 %) and 53.1% (CI: 45.8 %-60.5 %), respectively. The frequency-area distribution of the Sentinel-2 burn scars follows the apparent fractal-like power law or Pareto pattern often reported in other fire studies, suggesting good detection over several magnitudes of scale. Our relatively accurate estimates have important implications for carbon-emission calculations from forest and peatland fires in Indonesia.

AB  - Using Sentinel-1A/B SAR data, Harvey (2021) produced an InSAR timeseries over White Island, New Zealand. The paper documents the apparent deformation through 2019, with particular focus on the mechanisms surrounding the fatal eruption on December 9 of that year. Based on the analysis, the author suggests that a sudden increase in the Line of Sight (LOS) range occurred two weeks prior to the eruption, with potential implications for hazard monitoring at White Island and globally equivalent volcanoes. More generally, a suggestion is made that dome contraction may presage eruptions. However, re-analysis of the datasets provided by the author indicates that the sudden change in LOS displacement, interpreted as a collapse of the dome, is simply an atmospheric artefact introduced by the choice of reference point on the island. Given the fatal nature of the eruption, and implications for forecasting phreatic eruptions more broadly, it is vitally important that the community carefully validate results that have forecasting implications, otherwise, spurious warnings may be communicated to the public. Based on the data presented in Harvey (2021), there is clearly no precursory deflation event in the build up to the eruption, in agreement with other datasets around this tragic event.

TI  - Satellite-based monitoring of lake Urmia basin health with focus on its ecosystem regulating services by applying total ecosystem health (TEH) model
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, most of the natural and semi-natural ecosystems around the world have experienced excessive environmental loads due to human unsustainable activities that threaten their health and sustainability. Accordingly, the idea of ecosystem health has been proposed to monitor simultaneously the structure, function as well as the services that an ecosystem provides. In this research, moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 8-day land surface temperature product was used to measure temperature and land cover changes of Lake Urmia Basin for three months of June, July and August in a time period of 2000-2018. Time series data analysis was carried out using linear regression, Fourier series and Mann-Kendall test. Moreover, Moran index was used to analyze changes of the spatial pattern of indicators. To show the influence of Lake Urmia ecosystem services on its overall health, Total Ecosystem Health model was established by introducing normalized difference vegetation index, lake temperature, Moran index and temperature of the basin as indicators of Vigor, Structure, Resilience and Ecosystem Services, respectively. Based on output of the model, 54, 41 and 4% of the regions have obtained weak, moderate and strong ecosystem health, respectively. The results showed that despite the moderating role of Lake Urmia as a temperature regulator for its surrounding areas especially within 10 km, the decline of ecosystem health status in 95% of regions has occurred during the years 2000-2018. Therefore, to benefit from the ecosystem regulating services, the sustainability of other components involved in the total ecosystem health should be also ensured.

TI  - Ultrasound for the Objective Measurement of Breast Lymphedema
T2  - JOURNAL OF ULTRASOUND IN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives Breast lymphedema has supplanted upper extremity lymphedema as a common and debilitating sequela of breast cancer treatment, but has no objective measurement. We assessed the utility of ultrasound-measured difference in dermal thickness between affected and unaffected breasts as a measure of breast lymphedema. We associated this measure with patient characteristics, treatment parameters, and patient-reported impact on quality of life. Methods We enrolled 30 invasive breast carcinoma patients treated with breast-conserving surgery, sentinel lymph node biopsy, and radiotherapy, and 10 control patients evaluated for benign breast conditions without prior breast surgery or radiotherapy. Patient and treatment variables were ascertained from medical records and radiotherapy instruments. Impacts on quality of life were measured with a modified Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire. We characterized breast lymphedema by calculating the difference in ultrasound-measured dermal thickness between affected and unaffected breasts. Associations with patient characteristics, treatment, and quality of life were quantified with log-binomial regression models. Results Breast lymphedema was defined as a dermal thickness difference of >0.3 mm. Nineteen patients in the invasive group (63%) had breast lymphedema by this definition. We observed positive associations between ultrasound-defined breast lymphedema and surgical factors (size of primary tumor, number of lymph nodes removed), radiotherapy factors (breast volume irradiated, receipt of radiation boost), and patient-reported outcomes (sleep quality and overall confidence). Conclusions Difference in dermal thickness is an easy and inexpensive measurement for quantifying breast lymphedema, and correlates with treatment parameters and patient-reported impacts on quality of life.

TI  - Epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection and SARS-CoV-2 positive hospital admissions among children in South Africa
T2  - INFLUENZA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY VIRUSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction We describe epidemiology and outcomes of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and positive admissions among children <18 years in South Africa, an upper-middle income setting with high inequality. Methods Laboratory and hospital COVID-19 surveillance data, 28 January - 19 September 2020 was used. Testing rates were calculated as number of tested for SARS-CoV-2 divided by population at risk; test positivity rates were calculated as positive tests divided by total number of tests. In-hospital case fatality ratio (CFR) was calculated based on hospitalized positive admissions with outcome data who died in-hospital and whose death was judged SARS-CoV-2 related by attending physician. Findings 315 570 children aged <18 years were tested for SARS-CoV-2; representing 8.9% of all 3 548 738 tests and 1.6% of all children in the country. Of children tested, 46 137 (14.6%) were positive. Children made up 2.9% (n = 2007) of all SARS-CoV-2 positive admissions to sentinel hospitals. Among children, 47 died (2.6% case-fatality). In-hospital deaths were associated with male sex [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.18 (95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.08-4.40)] vs female; age <1 year [aOR 4.11 (95% CI 1.08-15.54)], age 10-14 years [aOR 4.20 (95% CI1.07-16.44)], age 15-17 years [aOR 4.86 (95% 1.28-18.51)] vs age 1-4 years; admission to a public hospital [aOR 5.07(95% 2.01-12.76)] vs private hospital and >= 1 underlying conditions [aOR 12.09 (95% CI 4.19-34.89)] vs none. Conclusions Children with underlying conditions were at greater risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 outcomes. Children > 10 years, those in certain provinces and those with underlying conditions should be considered for increased testing and vaccination.

TI  - Urbanization delays plant leaf senescence and extends growing season length in cold but not in warm areas of the Northern Hemisphere
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim Urbanization is becoming one of the most important drivers of global environmental change as human population and economic development rapidly increase. However, the effects of urbanization on plant phenology are still poorly understood, especially for leaf senescence and growing season length across large spatial scales. We aimed to fill this knowledge gap by combining in situ observations and remote sensing phenological data. Location The United States and Europe. Time period 2009-2018. Major taxa studied Vascular plants. Methods We divided the United States and Europe into 10 km by 10 km grid cells. We estimated leaf senescence dates for 93 species, and growing season length for a subset of 54 of these species, for grid cells with enough data using a database with >22 million in situ phenology observations. We also estimated growing season lengths at the community level for the Eastern Temperate Forest ecoregion in the US using remote sensing data. We then investigated effects of urbanization (using human population density as a proxy), temperature, and their interactions on leaf senescence and growing season lengths using linear mixed models. Results Urbanization and warmer regional temperature both delayed plant leaf senescence. In addition, the effects of urbanization on leaf senescence and growing season lengths depended on climate context: urbanization delayed leaf senescence and extended growing season length in cold regions; however, urbanization advanced leaf senescence and shortened growing season length in warm regions, implying the positive effects of urbanization on growing season length in cold regions may be weaker in a warmer future. Main conclusions Our study provides strong empirical evidence that the influence of urbanization on plant phenology and growing season length varies with regional temperature. Our results have important implications for predicting plant phenology and growing season length in a warmer and more urbanized future.

TI  - Neural-network-based estimation of regional-scale anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions using an Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) dataset over East and West Asia
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most significant greenhouse gas, and its concentration is continuously increasing, mainly as a consequence of anthropogenic activities. Accurate quantification of CO2 is critical for addressing the global challenge of climate change and for designing mitigation strategies aimed at stabilizing CO2 emissions. Satellites provide the most effective way to monitor the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. In this study, we utilized the concentration of the column-averaged dry-air mole fraction of CO2, i.e., XCO2 retrieved from a CO2 monitoring satellite, the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2), and the net primary productivity (NPP) provided by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to estimate the anthropogenic CO2 emissions using the Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN) over East and West Asia. OCO-2 XCO2, MODIS NPP, and the Open-Data Inventory for Anthropogenic Carbon dioxide (ODIAC) CO2 emission datasets for a period of 5 years (2015-2019) were used in this study. The annual XCO2 anomalies were calculated from the OCO-2 retrievals for each year to remove the larger background CO2 concentrations and seasonal variabil- ity. The XCO2 anomaly, NPP, and ODIAC emission datasets from 2015 to 2018 were then used to train the GRNN model, and, finally, the anthropogenic CO2 emissions were estimated for 2019 based on the NPP and XCO2 anomalies derived for the same year. The estimated and the ODIAC CO2 emissions were compared, and the results showed good agreement in terms of spatial distribution. The CO2 emissions were estimated separately over East and West Asia. In addition, correlations between the ODIAC emissions and XCO2 anomalies were also determined separately for East and West Asia, and East Asia exhibited relatively better results. The results showed that satellite-based XCO2 retrievals can be used to estimate the regional-scale anthropogenic CO2 emissions, and the accuracy of the results can be enhanced by further improvement of the GRNN model with the addition of more CO2 emission and concentration datasets.

TI  - Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma staging may influence management in users: A survey study
T2  - CANCER MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose This study aims to determine whether there is consensus regarding staging and management of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) across the various specialties that manage this disease. Materials and Methods A survey regarding CSCC high-risk features, staging, and management was created and emailed to cutaneous oncology experts including dermatology, head and neck surgery/surgical oncology, radiation oncology, and medical oncology. Results One hundred fifty-six (46%) of 357 invited physicians completed the survey. Depth of invasion (92%), perineural invasion (99%), histologic differentiation (85%), and patient immunosuppression (90%) achieved consensus (>80%) as high-risk features of CSCC. Dermatologists were more likely to also choose clinical tumor diameter (79% vs. 54%) and histology (99% vs. 66%) as a high-risk feature. Dermatologists were also more likely to utilize the Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) staging system alone or in conjunction with American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) (71%), whereas other cancer specialists (OCS) tend to use only AJCC (71%). Respondents considered AJCC T3 and higher (90%) and BWH T2b and higher (100%) to be high risk and when they consider radiologic imaging, sentinel lymph node biopsy, post-operative radiation therapy, and increased follow-up. Notably, a large number of respondents do not use staging systems or tumor stage to determine treatment options beyond surgery in high-risk CSCC. Conclusion This survey study highlights areas of consensus and differences regarding the definition of high-risk features of CSCC, staging approaches, and management patterns between dermatologists and OCS. High-risk CSCC is defined as, but not limited to, BWH T2b and higher and AJCC T3 and higher, and these thresholds can be used to identify cases for which treatment beyond surgery may be considered. Dermatologists are more likely to utilize BWH staging, likely because BWH validation studies showing advantages over AJCC were published in dermatology journals and discussed at dermatology meetings. Additional data are necessary to develop a comprehensive risk-based management approach for CSCC.

TI  - Remote sensing study of ozone, NO2, and CO: some contrary effects of SARS-CoV-2 lockdown over India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Escalating emissions of several air pollutants over South Asia could play a detrimental role in the regional and global atmosphere. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate these emissions within the boundary layer and at higher heights utilizing satellite data that are more inclusionary, where limited in situ observations are available. Here, we utilize the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI), Ozone Monitoring Instruments (OMI), TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), and Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME-2) hyperspectral satellite data to assess the changes in emission sources during Indian lockdown with a primary focus on the tropospheric profiles of ozone and carbon monoxide (CO). A significant reduction (> 20%) in the tropospheric ozone was seen over northern and northeast regions compared to 2018, while a dramatic increase (> 20%) compared to 2019 was seen. The subtropical dynamics mainly contributed to the increased ozone over the northern region. An analysis of the ozone production regime showed mostly NO2 limited regime over the major part of India and VOC limited regime over thermal power plants regions. Unlike in the boundary layer, where CO showed reduction (15-20%), CO profiles showed a consistent increase (as high as 31%) in the free troposphere over the majority of cities and thermal power plants. The CO total column also showed an increase (similar to 20%) over central and western India and a slight decrease (5%) over northern India. Similar to CO, an increase (similar to 15%) of NO2 column over the western region was observed particularly compared to 2019. However, unlike ozone and CO, reduction of tropospheric NO2 columns was seen over the major part of India, with the highest reduction over northern regions (20-52%). Furthermore, homogeneous yearly differences (> 30%) between OMI and TROPOMI NO2 observations were also seen distinctly over the remote areas. Contrary to surface-based studies, the present study shows an increase in CO, ozone (decrease), and NO2 at several locations and in the free troposphere during the lockdown.

TI  - Evaluation of NPP using three models compared with MODIS-NPP data over China
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating net primary productivity (NPP) is significant in global climate change research and carbon cycle. However, there are many uncertainties in different NPP modeling results and the process of NPP is challenging to model on the absence of data. In this study, we used meteorological data as input to simulate vegetation NPP through climate-based model, synthetic model and CASA model. Then, the results from three models were compared with MODIS NPP and observed data over China from 2000 to 2015. The statistics evaluation metrics (Relative Bias (RB), Pearson linear Correlation Coefficient (CC), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE)) between simulated NPP and MODIS NPP were calculated. The results implied that the CASA-model performed better than the other two models in terms of RB, RMSE, NSE and CC whether on the national or the regional scale. It has a higher CC with 0.51 and a smaller RMSE with 111.96 g C.m(-2).yr(-1) in the whole country. The synthetic model and CASA-model has the same advantages at some regions, and there are lower RMSE in Southern China (86.35 g C.m(-2).yr(-1)), Xinjiang (85.53 g C.m(-2).yr(-1)) and Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (93.22 g C.m(-2).yr(-1)). The climate-based model has widespread overestimation and large systematic errors, along with worse performances (NSEmax = 0.45) and other metric indexes unsatisfactory, especially Qinghai-Tibet Plateau with relatively lower accuracy because of the unavailable observation data. Overall, the CASA-model is much more ideal for estimating NPP all over China in the absence of data. This study provides a comprehensive intercomparison of different NPP-simulated models and can provide powerful help for researchers to select the appropriate NPP evaluation model.

TI  - Spatial calibration of an unstructured SWAN model forced with CFSR and ERA5 winds for the Black and Azov Seas
T2  - APPLIED OCEAN RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents the first spatial calibration of SWAN model physical parameters based on satellite observations for the Black and Azov Seas. Currently, the wind-wave model performance is unknown in several coastal and offshore areas due to the gap in wave buoy measurements. The development and increase of altimetry satellites allow collecting a large number of observations in a reasonable time, and thus to calibrate spatially wave models. Therefore, the present study aims to determine the best physical parameterization of the unstructured SWAN model based on satellite data for coarse domain over Black and Azov Seas and for local domain implementations. For this purpose, the significant wave height (SWH) was simulated using 44 physical settings for both ERA5 and CFSR winds. The spatial calibration is based on observations from seven altimetry satellites (Jason-3, Sentinel-3A, Sentinel-3B, Cryosat-2, SARAL/AltiKa, CFOSAT, and Hai Yang-2B). The spatial calibration and evaluation of the wind-wave model performance show an informative variation in the wave model performance, which can depend on several factors such as coastal morphology and the wind source accuracy and the physical setting of the wind-wave model. It raises several findings concerning the spatial sensitivity of the SWAN model to the used wind field, the wind and whitecapping source terms, whitecapping coefficient (Cds), and the windscaling tunable parameter, and the wind growth formulates using the ST6 package. Thus, this study allows observing the spatial response of the SWAN model as a function of physical parameterizations. The SWAN model calibration improved the simulation accuracy considerably overall Black and Azov Sea areas, using both CFSR and ERA5. The SWAN model using the ERA5 winds has provided a higher correlation and better accuracy in large part of the seas. It is highly recommended for the whole Black and Azov Seas to define the wind input term and whitecapping term based on (Komen et al., 1984), with a Cds coefficient of 0.8E-5. Considering the spatial error statistics, the same finding was obtained when the model results were compared with Utrish wave buoy measurements in the northeastern part of the Black Sea. Therefore, for local nested model implementation, it is also recommended to define the optimal configuration based on the error statistics mapped in the present paper.

TI  - Meteorological drought and remote sensing data: an approach to assess fire risks in the Algerian forest
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The risk of forest fires is one of the main environmental, social, and economic problems facing the countries of the Mediterranean basin, in particular Algeria, Morocco, Portugal, Spain, and France. For several decades, thousands of hectares in northern Algeria have been highly vulnerable and vulnerable to this scourge. In northwestern Algeria, the decline in rainfall is particularly pronounced in the mid-1970s. This rainfall decreases by around 50%. This long and regular dryness has destroyed more than 37,000 ha/year of the vulnerable forest. The aim of this study is to assess the fire risk of forest by a combination of a classical climatic analysis approach of drought using SPI (Standardized Precipitation Index) and remote sensing data (NDVI: normalized difference vegetation index). The NDVI is evaluated through Google Earth Engine Web GIS based software that mainly uses Modis images that cover the time span from 2006 to 2019. Both of these data confirm, the spatial variation of drought along the period of study, and a substantial drought effect in the region; this coincides with the outbreak of forest fires.

TI  - Variations in Guidelines for Diagnosis of Child Physical Abuse in High-Income Countries A Systematic Review
T2  - JAMA NETWORK OPEN
M3  - Review
AB  - IMPORTANCE The highly variable practices observed regarding the early detection and diagnostic workup of suspected child physical abuse contribute to suboptimal care and could be partially related to discrepancies in clinical guidelines.OBJECTIVE To systematically evaluate the completeness, clarity, and consistency of guidelines for child physical abuse in high-income countries.EVIDENCE REVIEW For this systematic review, national or regional guidelines that were disseminated from 2010 to 2020 related to the early detection and diagnostic workup of child physical abuse in infants aged 2 years or younger by academic societies or health agencies in high-income countries were retrieved. The definitions of sentinel injuries and the recommended diagnostic workup (imaging and laboratory tests) for child physical abuse were compared. Data were analyzed from July 2020 to February 2021.FINDINGS Within the 20 included guidelines issued in 15 countries, 168 of 408 expected statements (41%) were missing and 10 statements (4%) were unclear. Among 16 guidelines characterizing sentinel injuries, all of them included skin injuries, such as bruises, hematoma, or burns, but only 8 guidelines (50%) included intraoral injuries and fractures. All 20 guidelines agreed on the indication for radiological skeletal survey, head computed tomography, and head magnetic resonance imaging but differed for those of bone scintigraphy, follow-up skeletal survey, spinal magnetic resonance imaging, cranial ultrasonography, chest computed tomography, and abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography. Additionally, 16 guidelines agreed on exploring primary hemostasis and coagulation but not on the tests to perform, and 8 guidelines (50%) mentioned the need to investigate bone metabolism.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These findings suggest that guidelines for the diagnosis of child physical abuse in infants were often clear but lacked completeness and were discrepant on major issues. These results may help identify priorities for well-designed original diagnostic accuracy studies, systematic reviews, or an international consensus process to produce clear and standardized guidelines to optimize practices and infant outcomes.

TI  - Southwestern ponderosa pine forest patterns following wildland fires managed for resource benefit differ from reference landscapes
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context Managers aiming to utilize wildland fire to restore southwestern ponderosa pine landscapes require better understanding of forest cover patterns produced at multiple scales. Restoration effectiveness of wildland fires managed for resource benefit can be evaluated against natural ranges of variation. Objectives We describe landscape patterns within reference landscapes, including restored and functioning ponderosa pine forests of northern Arizona, and compare them to wildland fires managed for resource benefit. We make comparisons along a gradient of extents and assess the effects of scale on landscape differences. Methods Using Sentinel-2 imagery, we classified ponderosa pine forest cover and calculated landscape metrics across a gradient of landscape extent within reference and managed landscapes. We used non-parametric tests to assess differences. We used random forest models to assess and explore which landscape metrics were most importance in differentiating landscape patterns. Results Restored forests exhibited landscapes patterns consistent with those of ecologically intact forest landscapes. Managed wildfire landscape patterns differed significantly when compared to reference landscape patterns among nearly all landscape metrics considered and became increasingly different with increasing landscape extent (15-840 ha), tending towards both denser and larger patch areas. Conclusions Landscape patterns from wildland fires managed for resource benefit we examined differ from those of reference landscapes. Differences become more pronounced with increasing landscape size. Landscape patterns among large managed forest landscapes suggest that the predominately single-entry, low-severity disturbance regime from these managed fires is failing to reduce tree densities and break up large contiguous areas of canopy cover.

TI  - How much time is enough? Sentinel lymph node mapping time depends on the radiotracer agent
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background In 2014, technetium-99m tilmanocept (TcTM) replaced technetium-99m sulfur colloid (TcSC) as the standard lymphoscintigraphy (LS) mapping agent in melanoma patients undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). The aim of this study was to examine differences in mapping time, intra-operative identification of sentinel lymph node (SLN), and false negative rate (FNR) between patients who underwent SLNB with TcTM compared to TcSC. Methods Patients who underwent SLNB between 2010 and 2018 were retrospectively identified. Patient demographic, tumor, and imaging data was stratified by receipt of TcSC (n = 258) or TcTM (n = 133). Student's t test and chi(2) test were used to compare characteristics and outcomes. Results Both cohorts were similar in demographic, primary tumor characteristics, and total number of SLN identified (TcTM 3.56 vs. TcSC 3.28, p = 0.244). TcTM was associated with significantly shorter LS mapping times (51.8 vs. 195.1 min, p < 0.01). There was no significant difference in the number of patients with positive SLN (TcTM 11.3 vs. TcSC 17.4%, p = 0.109) and the FNR was similar between both groups (TcTM 25% vs. TcSC 22%). Conclusion TcTM was associated with significantly shorter LS mapping time while identifying similar numbers of SLN. Our results support further study to ensure similar FNR and oncologic outcomes between agents.

TI  - Surface subsidence monitoring with an improved distributed scatterer interferometric SAR time series method in a filling mining area
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Statistically homogeneous pixel (SHP) selection and DS phase optimization are two critical steps in the distributed scatterer interferometric SAR (DS-InSAR) time series method. In this paper, a new algorithm named dynamic hypothesis test of confidence interval (D-HTCI) is proposed, which reduces the wrong selection rate of SHP and increases the number of SHP selections. Using adaptive spatial nonlocal filtering method for DS phase optimization, the phase standard deviation (PSD) and the sum of phase differences (SPD) show that compared with the traditional covariance matrix decomposition method, the optimization quality is improved by 2.1 and 1.8 times, respectively. Combining 24 scenes Sentinel-1A data from September 17, 2017 to July 14, 2018, the method is applied to monitor surface subsidence of the Daizhuang filling mining area (Jining, Shandong, China). The results show that the proposed method has mm-level accuracy for monitoring of surface subsidence in a filling mining area.

TI  - Estimation of forest aboveground biomass by using mixed-effects model
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Using remote sensing data to estimate forest aboveground biomass (FAB) is of great significance for understanding the terrestrial C dynamics and making regional policies of forest management. The vegetation type-specified approach can improve the accuracy of estimating FAB, and it is difficult to obtain enough field plots for each vegetation type to fit a statistic model in practice. In this study, we tried to solve this problem by fitting a linear mixed-effects model based on the Landsat TM image and vegetation types. For developing the most parsimonious mixed-effect models, we used stepwise regressions to fit a linear regression model at the beginning and then we extended it into a linear mixed-effects model with the backward elimination method by adding and testing random effects to the explanatory variables in the linear regression model. The results showed that the linear mixed-effects model, compared with the linear regression model, has higher estimation accuracy with fewer parameters and smaller RMSE (R-2 = 0.63, RMSE reduced by 14.81%). The linear mixed-effects model is a feasible way to fit a species-level FAB estimation model when the field plots data are limited and uneven for different vegetation types.

TI  - Multi-stage guided-filter for SAR and optical satellites images fusion using Curvelet and Gram Schmidt transforms for maritime surveillance
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMAGE AND DATA FUSION
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images depend on the dielectric properties of objects with certain incident angles. Thus, vessels and other metallic objects appear clear in SAR images however, they are difficult to be distinguished in optical images. Synergy of these two types of images leads to not only high spatial and spectral resolutions but also good explanation of the image scene. In this paper, a hybrid pixel-level image fusion method is proposed for integrating panchromatic (PAN), multispectral (MS) and SAR images. The fusion method is performed using Multi-stage guided filter (MGF) for optical images pansharpening, to get high preserving spatial details and nested Gram-Schmidt (GS) and Curvelet-Transform (CVT) methods for SAR and optical images,to increase the quality of the final fused image and benefit from the SAR image properties. The accuracy and performance of the proposed method are appraised using Landsat-8 Operational-Land-Imager (OLI) and Sentinel-1 images subjectively as well as objectively using different quality metrics. Moreover, the proposed method is compared to a number of state-of-the-art fusion techniques. The results show significant improvements in both visual quality and the spatial and spectral evaluation metrics. Consequently, the proposed method is capable of highlighting maritime activity for further processing.

TI  - Detection and Characterization of Sentinel Lymph Node by Ultrasound Molecular Imaging with B7-H3-Targeted Microbubbles in Orthotopic Breast Cancer Model in Mice
T2  - MOLECULAR IMAGING AND BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Accurate identification and assessment of sentinel lymph node (SLN) using noninvasive imaging methods can play a vital role in tumor staging, surgical planning, and prognostic evaluation. In this study, we assessed the efficacy of B7-H3-targeted molecular-ultrasound imaging for the early SLN detection, and characterization in a mouse model of orthotopic breast cancer. Procedures We established a mouse breast cancer model with lymph node metastasis by injecting MAD-MB 231 cells which were engineered to express firefly luciferase reporter gene into the fat pad of the right 4th mammary gland in female BALB/c nude mice. The sole lymph node (LN) close to the tumor was regarded as the SLN for imaging investigation, which included metastatic and non-metastatic SLNs. The LN in the right 4th mammary gland from normal mice was used as normal control (normal mice LN). The commercially available preclinical streptavidin-coated, perfluorocarbon-containing lipid-shelled microbubbles (VisualSonics, Toronto, Canada) were used to generate B7-H3-targeted microbubbles (MBB7-H3) and control microbubbles (MBControl). Then, ultrasound molecular imaging (USMI) was performed using a high-resolution transducer (MS250; center frequency, 21 MHz; Vevo 2100; VisualSonics, Toronto, Canada) after intravenous injection of microbubbles. Results The SLN was clearly detected and located under conventional (B-mode) and contrast-enhanced ultrasonography with microbubble injection. The metastatic SLNs showed a markedly higher signal from B7-H3-targeted microbubbles (MBB7-H3) compared to the non-metastatic SLNs and normal LNs. The metastatic SLN was further confirmed by ex vivo bioluminescence imaging and eventually verified by histological analysis. Conclusions Our findings suggest the potential value of USMI using B7-H3 targeted microbubbles in breast cancer and establish an effective imaging method for the non-invasive detection and characterization of SLN.

TI  - MultiTempGAN: Multitemporal multispectral image compression framework using generative adversarial networks
T2  - JOURNAL OF VISUAL COMMUNICATION AND IMAGE REPRESENTATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Multispectral satellites that measure the reflected energy from the different regions on the Earth generate the multispectral (MS) images continuously. The following MS image for the same region can be acquired with respect to the satellite revisit period. The images captured at different times over the same region are called multitemporal images. Traditional compression methods generally benefit from spectral and spatial correlation within the MS image. However, there is also a temporal correlation between multitemporal images. To this end, we propose a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) based prediction method called MultiTempGAN for compression of multitemporal MS images. The proposed method defines a lightweight GAN-based model that learns to transform the reference image to the target image. Here, the generator parameters of MultiTempGAN are saved for the reconstruction purpose in the receiver system. Due to MultiTempGAN has a low number of parameters, it provides efficiency in multitemporal MS image compression. Experiments were carried out on three Sentinel-2 MS image pairs belonging to different geographical regions. We compared the proposed method with JPEG2000-based conventional compression methods and three deep learning methods in terms of signal-tonoise ratio, mean spectral angle, mean spectral correlation, and laplacian mean square error metrics. Additionally, we have also evaluated the change detection performances and visual maps of the methods. Experimental results demonstrate that MultiTempGAN not only achieves the best metric values among the other methods at high compression ratios but also presents convincing performances in change detection applications.

TI  - nPTD classification: an updated classification of gastric cancer location for function preserving gastrectomy based on physiological lymphatic flow
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The correlation between tumor location and lymphatic flow distribution in gastric cancer has been previously reported, and PTD (Proximal - Transitional - Distal) classification was proposed. Our group updated and developed the nPTD classification. Method We retrospectively studied gastric cancer patients who underwent the dye method sentinel node biopsy from 1993 to 2020. The inclusion criteria were a single lesion type 0 cancer of <= 5 cm in the long axis, clinically node-negative, and invasion within the proper muscle layer pathologically. In this study, the distribution of dyed lymphatic flow was evaluated for each occupied area of the tumor. Results We included 416 patients in this study. The tumors located in the watershed of the right and left gastroepiploic arteries near greater curvature had extensive lymphatic flow; therefore, a newly circular region with a diameter of 5 cm is set on the watershed of the greater curvature between P and T zone as the 'n' zone. In addition, for cancers located in the lesser P curvature, lymphatic flow to the greater curvature was not observed. Therefore, the P zone was divided into two: the lesser curvature side (PL) and the greater curvature side (PG). Conclusions The advantage of the nPTD classification is that it provides not only proper nodal dissection but also adequate function-preserving gastrectomy. If the tumor is localized within the PL, the proximal gastrectomy resection area can be further reduced. In contrast, for cancers located in the 'n' zone, near-total gastrectomy is required because of the extensive lymphatic flow.

TI  - Accurate tracking of forest activity key to multi-jurisdictional management goals: A case study in California
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - An essential component of sustainable forest management is accurate monitoring of forest activities. Although monitoring efforts have generally increased for many forests throughout the world, in practice, effective monitoring is complex. Determining the magnitude and location of progress towards sustainability targets can be challenging due to diverse forest operations across multiple jurisdictions, the lack of data standardization, and discrepancies between field inspections and remotely-sensed records. In this work, we used California as a multijurisdictional case study to explore these problems and develop an approach that broadly informs forest monitoring strategies. The State of California recently entered into a shared stewardship agreement with the US Forest Service (USFS) and set a goal to jointly treat one million acres of forest and rangeland annually by 2025. Currently, however, federal and state forest management datasets are disjoint. This work addresses three barriers stymying the use of federal and state archival records to assess management goals. These barriers are: 1) current databases from different jurisdictions have not been combined due to their distinct data collection processes and internal structures; 2) datasets have not been comprehensively analyzed, despite the need to understand the extent of previous treatments as well as the rate of current activity; and 3) the spatial accuracy of archival datasets has not been evaluated against remotely-sensed data. To reduce these barriers, we first aggregated existing archival forest management records between 1984 and 2019 from the USFS ' Forest Activity Tracking System (FACTS) and the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) using a qualitative scalar of treatment intensity. Combined FACTS and CAL FIRE completed footprint acres - defined as unique areas of land where a treatment was completed at any time since 1984 - have decreased since a peak in 2008. At most, 300,000 footprint acres are completed each year, 30% of the million-acre goal. Prescribed fires - defined as direct burning operations - have risen over time, according to the FACTS hazardous fuels dataset but prescribed fire records in CAL FIRE's dataset have rapidly increased since 2016. We also refined the spatial and temporal detail of the aggregated management record using the Continuous Change Detection and Classification algorithm on satellite remote sensing data to produce a state-wide time series map of harvest disturbances. A comparison of the algorithm's refined data to the archival record potentially suggests over-reporting in both FACTS and CAL FIRE's archival datasets. Our integrated dataset provides a better assessment of current treatments and the path towards the 1-million-acre a year goal. The refined dataset leverages the strengths of complementary, albeit imperfect, monitoring strategies from archives and remotely-sensed detection.

TI  - Haze correction of hyperspectral imagery over inland waters
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Haze, an atmospheric condition that degrades many remote sensing images, is part of the atmospheric correction. In this study, a new method is proposed to reduce the effect of haze on hyperspectral imagery over inland water bodies using the spectral unmixing approach. If haze is present in the image, spectral unmixing can result an end member corresponding to haze, and a corresponding haze abundance map (HAM) can be generated. The spectrally and spatially varying haze contribution to reflectance spectra, referred to as hyperspectral haze reflectance cube, is estimated using the HAM and the reflectance spectra extracted from haze affected areas of the hyperspectral image. Actual reflectance from water bodies can thus be obtained by subtracting this cube from the observed hyperspectral reflectance cube. Two hyperspectral images acquired with Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer-Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) sensor over the Ujani reservoir of Maharashtra, India, are used to develop and validate the proposed hyperspectral haze correction method. We demonstrate the successful removal of haze effects by validating with field measured reflectance spectra, visual, spectral and statistical interpretation of the haze corrected AVIRIS-NG imagery. The proposed methodology can be readily implemented for existing and future hyperspectral imagery from NASA's Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud and ocean Ecosystem (PACE) mission.

TI  - Measurement of suspended sediment concentration in open channel flows based on hyperspectral imagery from UAVs
T2  - ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Since conventional in situ measurements of suspended sediments in the river system are labor-intensive and timeconsuming, remote sensing approaches using multi- or hyper-spectral cameras have widely been applied to obtain high-resolution suspended sediment concentration (SSC) distributions in rivers and streams. However, in nature, the properties of heterogeneous sediment, such as the mineral content and particle size distribution, induce a strong variability in the optical images of the suspended sediments. For this reason, the robust estimation of the suspended sediment using the remote sensing technique is challenging due to the optical variability of the suspended sediment. Thus, it is necessary to deal with this variability of the optical images to improve the accuracy of remote sensing-based SSC measurements and extend them to the global estimator. In this study, a robust Machine Learning (ML) model for SSC estimation based on hyperspectral images was developed by considering the optical variability of the suspended sediment in water bodies. A series of field-scale tracer experiments were conducted in open channels with three different sediment types in order to obtain both the SSC using laser diffraction sensors and hyperspectral images using a UAV camera. The experimental results showed that the optical characteristics of SSC were critically heterogeneous due to the properties of the sediment. Using these experimental dataset, four explicit regression models and two implicit ML regression models were developed and compared to select an optimal estimator. Consequently, a Support Vector Regression (SVR) model using relevant spectral bands in a wide wavelength range yielded the most accurate results, with an R2 of 0.90 for the whole dataset. However, linear regression models, which could not consider various spectral bands and the nonlinear effect of the optical variability of SSC, were limited in their ability to retrieve SSC from hyperspectral images. Furthermore, the SVR model accurately reproduced the spatio-temporal SSC distributions in all study cases, including low-visibility suspended sediments, thus successfully resolved the optical variability of SSC with widely selected spectral bands from recursive feature elimination (RFE). The SVR model also successfully retrieved the SSC distribution in uncalibrated rivers. The results of this study demonstrated that the proposed ML regression models based on the hyperspectral imagery achieved a significant improvement in SSC estimation in terms of accuracy and global applicability.

AB  - Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technology has the potential to reveal ground surface deformation at high temporal and spatial resolutions, and the InSAR image processing field is progressing toward big data analytics. In this era of big data, as InSAR is usually employed for natural hazard research, processing large InSAR images under time constraints is a fundamental challenge. Graphics processing units (GPUs) have been widely adopted for high-performance computing (HPC) due to their parallel computing capability and low power consumption. Accordingly, we explore the interconnection between InSAR time series processing and GPU hardware for parallel Sentinel-1 InSAR processing. We build a rapid GPU-assisted InSAR processing chain and apply this chain to accelerate the time-consuming optimization steps in Sentinel-1 InSAR processing. This processing chain plays a pivotal role in rapidly calculating InSAR deformation maps using large quantities of Sentinel-1 SAR data and thus can be used in practical applications. We also perform some experiments to demonstrate that the processing chain is appropriate for the deformation monitoring of various natural disasters and is suitable for emergency monitoring and wide-area investigations of potential hazards involving geological disasters.

TI  - Combined impacts of the abnormal and urban heat island effect in Guiyang, a typical Karst Mountain City in China
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The abnormal heat island (AHI) effect has recently been reported in several karst cities. However, the combined effect of the abnormal and urban heat island (UHI) effect is still a gap. This study analyzed the combined effect the AHI and UHI in Guiyang, a typical rapidly urbanizing karst mountain city, to provide insights into the variation and formation of AHIs and UHIs using Landsat imagery. Although the AHI effect remained the major component of the thermal environment, the impact of UHI intensified with rapid urbanization. Moreover, in addition to suitable topographic conditions such as shallow slopes and high elevations in sunny aspects, the low and low-medium vegetation coverage lands were highly related to the formation of the AHI, and the AHI intensity increased in almost all directions with urban expansion. In addition, the formation conditions and mechanism of the AHI can be attributed to the unique thermal properties of karst carbonate. The above results suggest that karst rock desertification is the key point for the improvement of the regional thermal environment, so comprehensive prevention of rock desertification and rational planning of construction projects should be involved in environmental protection in karst mountain cities.

TI  - Retrieval of olive tree biophysical properties from Sentinel-2 time series based on physical modelling and machine learning technique
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this work is to build a model that enables to estimate and monitor the biophysical properties of olive trees planted in super-intensive groves, using innovative forward/backward radiative transfer modelling. In the forward step, the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model simulates a large dataset of satellite image (here, Sentinel-2, S2) reflectance values of realistic olive tree mock-ups with high accuracy. The backward model is composed by two successive regression neural networks trained with the DART simulated dataset. These networks are optimized respectively to estimate biophysical properties of the understory and of the olive trees from the reflectance images. To ensure accurate property retrieval, the dataset covers all possible biophysical and structural properties of the olive trees and understory in addition to the soil optical properties. Therefore, it is composed of trees with various sizes, leaf area index (LAI), tree covers, and leaf biophysical properties associated with ranges of chlorophyll content (Cab), carotenoid content (Ccar), leaf mesophyll structure (N), and leaf equivalent water thickness (EWT) that are compatible to standard properties of olive tree leaves. Particular attention is paid to soil signature estimation, as it is very bright and so greatly influences the canopy signature. Soil reflectance is estimated from the satellite images. Different soil classes with different moisture contents are considered. Inversion results from time series of S2 images are consistent with the olive tree phenological stages. For instance, Cab increases during winter and decreases during summer. The sharp decrease coincides to tree stress caused by lack of water and long-time exposure to the sun. Likewise, an increase in water content in winter is noted, especially in images taken after rainy events. Besides, olive tree sizes estimation in the areas crossed by water alleys shows the highest values. Furthermore, validation is done by comparing our inverted properties to in-situ measurements. For example, LAI, Cab, and EWT RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) are 0.58 m(2)m(-2), 2.5 mu g cm(-2) and 0.003 cm, respectively.

TI  - Long-term changes in aerosol loading over the 'BIHAR' State of India using nineteen years (2001-2019) of high-resolution satellite data (1 x 1 km<SUP>2</SUP>)
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) in the Indian sub-continent faces massive aerosol loading, for which it is regarded as a global air pollution hotspot. This study examined the spatial variation in columnar aerosol loading (2001-2019) over the eastern state of Bihar and its 38 administrative districts affected by transboundary transport and local emissions. In the current study, aerosol optical depth (AOD(0.55 mu m)) retrieved at 1 x 1 Km(2) resolution by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor using the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction algorithm (MCD19A2, Collection 6) was analyzed. A significant increase in AOD from 0.49 to 0.68, with an inter-annual variability of 12.0%, was observed. The highest seasonal aerosol loading of the range 0.51-0.75 was observed during the post-monsoon (OND) and winter (JF) seasons due to long-range transport of pollutants from upper and central IGP regions and aerosols emitted locally, which further was aggravated by poor metrological conditions. AOD was not found to vary significantly with the land use pattern (e.g., urban, rural, and background), implying the substantial influence of regional transport. A significant increase in the annual AOD trend (0.0106 year(-1)) and seasonal trends (0.0072-0.0182 year(-1)) was observed for the analysis period. Districts located along the Ganga river stretch exhibited the highest annual AOD rate with an overall percentage increase of 40-50%. Low to moderate model performance (R2:0.25-0.65; MAPE: 15.2-26.7%) was exhibited by Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) time series model over the study area for the successive two years (2020 and 2021), emphasizing the districts with a potential for high aerosol loading that requires immediate addressing under Business as usual (BAU) scenarios. The overall study augments policy makers with decision-making support to instigate air quality measures at the state epicenters. The study also recommends inter-state coordination to develop an integrated airshed management approach for holistic improvement in state air quality.

TI  - Counting Carbon: Quantifying Biomass in the McMurdo Dry Valleys through Orbital & Field Observations
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We use correlative field studies and high-resolution multispectral remote sensing data from the WorldView-2 instrument to estimate the abundance of photosynthetically active biomass (photoautotrophs consisting primarily of microbial mats and mosses) in Canada Stream in Taylor Valley, McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV), Antarctica. In situ field investigations were performed to (1) acquire ground validation targets for atmospherically correcting satellite imagery, (2) derive spectra of "pure" geologic and biological endmembers, (3) estimate photoautotroph cover from remote sensing data, and (4) convert these coverage estimates to biomass using data collected in the field. Our results suggest that, on the morning of 12 December 2018, the Canada Stream system contained more than 3,800 kg of photosynthetically active carbon. Extrapolating our unmixing results to the entirety of the Fryxell basin of Taylor Valley, Antarctica, we model the presence of more than 750,000 kg of photosynthetically active carbon across the landscape and carbon fixation rates roughly equivalent to five hectares of tropical rainforest. The ability to spatially and temporally quantify the amount of photosynthetically active biomass using remote sensing data in the MDV of Antarctica is a revolutionary development that will help elucidate the ecological drivers and environmental responses in this cold desert landscape.

TI  - Aerosol physico-optical-radiative characterization and classification during summer over Ny-Ålesund, Arctic
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With an aim to study the year-to-year changes in physical, optical, and radiative properties of polar aerosols, special observation campaigns were conducted during three consecutive summers of 2010, 2011 and 2012 over Ny-angstrom lesund (78.9 degrees N, 11.9 degrees E, 42 m AMSL), Arctic, employing a ground-based Multi-channel Solar-radiometer (MICROTOPS II Sun- photometer). In the present study, the columnar Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) at lambda = 500 nm and the Angstrom exponent (alpha) data sets are used to analyse the daily mean AOD and alpha by using a liner regression (best-fit) method. The results highlight that the columnar aerosol optical depth (mean AOD@500 nm for the study period) is 0.144 +/- 0.05. Signature of secondary aerosol formation through marine sources based on variation in two wavelength AODs is also studied. These columnar AOD measurements over the study region are found to be in good agreement within experimental limitations with the synchronous MODIS satellite derived values. The 3 years' alpha mean value is found to be 0.797 +/- 0.328 within the range of 0.01-1.4. The frequency of occurrence and relative frequency histograms of alpha exhibited two modes centred at around 1.2 and 0.8. The primary and secondary modes reveal that the marine aerosols in the study region are mixed type, and they contribute about 44%, with the accumulation particles alone contributing about 31%. We found a close correspondence between aerosol optical properties and local meteorological conditions over the experimental location. The aerosol radiative forcing estimations revealed higher negative aerosol radiative forcing (indicating cooling) at Bottom-of-the-Atmosphere (BOA) and positive radiative forcing (indicating warming) in the Atmosphere (ATM) and Top-of-the-Atmosphere (TOA) during 2012 as compared to those obtained during 2010 and 2011, which is consistent with the observed AOD and alpha. The airmass back-trajectory model analysis also showed intrusion of anthropogenic aerosols from neighbouring regions into the study region, particularly during the year 2012.

TI  - A sulfur dioxide Covariance-Based Retrieval Algorithm (COBRA): application to TROPOMI reveals new emission sources
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sensitive and accurate detection of sulfur dioxide (SO2) from space is important for monitoring and estimating global sulfur emissions. Inspired by detection methods applied in the thermal infrared, we present here a new scheme to retrieve SO2 columns from satellite observations of ultraviolet back-scattered radiances. The retrieval is based on a measurement error covariance matrix to fully represent the SO2-free radiance variability, so that the SO2 slant column density is the only retrieved parameter of the algorithm. We demonstrate this approach, named COBRA, on measurements from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) aboard the Sentinel-5 Precursor (S-5P) satellite. We show that the method reduces significantly both the noise and biases present in the current TROPOMI operational DOAS SO2 retrievals. The performance of this technique is also benchmarked against that of the principal component algorithm (PCA) approach. We find that the quality of the data is similar and even slightly better with the proposed COBRA approach. The ability of the algorithm to retrieve SO2 accurately is further supported by comparison with ground-based observations. We illustrate the great sensitivity of the method with a high-resolution global SO2 map, considering 2.5 years of TROPOMI data. In addition to the known sources, we detect many new SO2 emission hotspots worldwide. For the largest sources, we use the COBRA data to estimate SO2 emission rates. Results are comparable to other recently published TROPOMI-based SO2 emissions estimates, but the associated uncertainties are significantly lower than with the operational data. Next, for a limited number of weak sources, we demonstrate the potential of our data for quantifying SO2 emissions with a detection limit of about 8 kt yr(-1), a factor of 4 better than the emissions derived from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). We anticipate that the systematic use of our TROPOMI COBRA SO2 column data set at a global scale will allow missing sources to be identified and quantified and help improve SO2 emission inventories.

TI  - Investigation of satellite rainfall-driven rainfall-runoff model using deep learning approaches in two different catchments in India
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rainfall-runoff models are valuable tools for flood forecasting, management of water resources, and drought warning. With the advancement in space technology, a plethora of satellite precipitation products (SPPs) are available publicly. However, the application of the satellite data for the data-driven rainfall-runoff model is emerging and requires careful investigation. In this work, two satellite rainfall data sets, namely Global Precipitation Measurement-Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrieval Product V6 (GPM-IMERG) and Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS), are evaluated for the development of rainfall-runoff models and the prediction of 1-day ahead streamflow. The accuracy of the data from the SPPs is compared to the India Meteorological Department (IMD)-gridded precipitation data set. Detection metrics showed that for light rainfall (1-10 mm), the probability of detection (POD) value ranges between 0.67 and 0.75 and with an increasing rainfall range, i.e., medium and heavy rainfall (10-50 mm and >50 mm), the POD values ranged from 0.24 to 0.45. These results indicate that the satellite precipitation performs satisfactorily with reference to the IMD-gridded data set. Using the daily precipitation data of nearly two decades (2000-2018) over two river basins in India's Eastern part, artificial neural network, extreme learning machine (ELM), and long short-time memory (LSTM) models are developed for rainfall-runoff modelling. One-day ahead runoff prediction using the developed rainfall-runoff modelling confirmed that both the SPPs are sufficient to drive the rainfall-runoff models with a reasonable accuracy estimated using the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency coefficient, correlation coefficient, and the root-mean-squared error. In particular, the 1-day streamflow forecasts for the Vamsadhara river basin (VRB) using LSTM with GPM-IMERG inputs resulted in NSC values of 0.68 and 0.67, while ELM models for Mahanadhi river basin (MRB) with the same input resulted in NSC values of 0.86 and 0.87, respectively, during training and validation stages. At the same time, the LSTM model with CHIRPS inputs for the VRB resulted in NSC values of 0.68 and 0.65, and the ELM model with CHIRPS inputs for the MRB resulted in NSC values of 0.89 and 0.88, respectively, in training and validation stages. These results indicated that both the SPPs could reliably be used with LSTM and ELM models for rainfall-runoff modelling and streamflow prediction. This paper highlights that deep learning models, such as ELM and LSTM, with the GPM-IMERG products can lead to a new horizon to provide flood forecasting in flood-prone catchments.

TI  - Does SLNB substitute END in the future with the sole advantage of preventing shoulder morbidity?
T2  - ORAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Letter
AB  - SLNB has emerged as a rational proposition in the management of early-stage oral cancer and has mixed responses within the oncological community. It is high time for the clinicians to look into the fact that, when a patient post-surgery has a regional recurrence within 6 months, it could be reasonable to believe that a tumor seed which was earlier an isolated tumor cell (ITC) or in the form of a micro-metastasis (MM) would have led to this. SLNB has the potential to become a standard of care in the future owing to the development and utility of better evaluation tools to pick nodal metastasis. It is not an overemphasizing statement to say that SLNB could become a standard recommendation in the near future, however, it still looks like a distant dream considering its logistical and technological limitations.

TI  - Tourist Street View Navigation and Tourist Positioning Based on Multimodal Wireless Virtual Reality
T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the multimodal wireless virtual reality technology, this article researches and implements two different spatial positioning estimation systems based on intelligent networks and mixed reality devices, which can estimate their position and attitude in space with higher accuracy. Based on the multimodal protocol, an extensible information exchange protocol is designed to meet the requirements of the terminal and the background service in the scenic spot, which realizes the information interaction between the terminal and the background service and supports the realization of system functions. Second, a real-time data management module is designed for the two types of terminal historical location query and real-time location query. Through the research and summary of GPS positioning technology and existing matching algorithms, as well as the analysis of positioning errors, a scenic map matching algorithm based on an improved virtual reality model is proposed. Later, in the electronic map design, the traditional linear street view model was improved, the width element of the street view was increased, and the rectangular street view model was introduced. When the candidate road section was selected, the candidate road section was determined by the area intersection method of the error rectangle and the rectangular street view, and the search path was improved, while reducing omissions in the selection of candidate road sections. In the process of adaptive moving target feature learning, it can effectively remove the inaccurate foreground extraction caused by the misjudgement and misdetection of the multimodal background modeling method. This plays an important role in the later trajectory tracking and reduces the uninterruptedness. The simulation results show that the real-time data is cached in the memory, and the real-time data is divided and organized on the basis of region, which realizes efficient designated terminal location query, range query, neighbour query, and many other typical real-time location-based queries. Finally, using the characteristics of the database management system adopted, through a reasonable design of the database table structure, efficient access to historical data is realized. System test results show that the system has realized multimedia applications, electronic maps, travel notes, and other functions and has a friendly interface, easy operation, and good maintainability and scalability.

TI  - Mitigating climate change impacts on irrigation water shortage using brackish groundwater and solar energy
T2  - ENERGY REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Increase temperature globally would increase irrigation water requirements. Therefore, brackish groundwater can be used as non-conventional water resources in potential solar areas to supplement irrigation water shortage. Consequently, humidification dehumidification greenhouse agriculture used solar energy to desalinating groundwater. The objective of this research is to mitigate the impacts of climate change on water shortage in Qena, Upper Egypt to supplement water shortage. MODIS data were downloaded to get NDVI and Kc and estimate study area irrigation water requirements. Besides, the groundwater model was constructed using MODFLOW software to study the potentiality of groundwater aquifer for development considered the expected impacts of climate change due to temperature increase in the management scenarios. Also, estimate the required agricultural area to be switched to irrigation by solar desalinating from brackish groundwater in a greenhouse to compensate for water shortage. The results showed an increase in irrigation rate of about 6.78%. Based on the model results, the best management scenario is digging wells with 1.0(km) spacing lifting about 400(m(3)/day/well) to supply requited irrigation water. For this scenario, the maximum drawdown is about 49(m) after 50(years), which is safe. Results indicated approximately 17.68% of agricultural land could be irrigated using brackish groundwater by humidification dehumidification greenhouse. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

TI  - First wave of COVID-19 in Venezuela: Epidemiological, clinical, and paraclinical characteristics of first cases
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has particularly affected countries with weakened health services in Latin America, where proper patient management could be a critical step to address the epidemic. In this study, we aimed to characterize and identify which epidemiological, clinical, and paraclinical risk factors defined COVID-19 infection from the first confirmed cases through the first epidemic wave in Venezuela. A retrospective analysis of consecutive suspected cases of COVID-19 admitted to a sentinel hospital was carried out, including 576 patient cases subsequently confirmed for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. Of these, 162 (28.1%) patients met the definition criteria for severe/critical disease, and 414 (71.2%) were classified as mild/moderate disease. The mean age was 47 (SD 16) years, the majority of which were men (59.5%), and the most frequent comorbidity was arterial hypertension (23.3%). The most common symptoms included fever (88.7%), headache (65.6%), and dry cough (63.9%). Severe/critical disease affected mostly older males with low schooling (p < 0.001). Similarly, higher levels of glycemia, urea, aminotransferases, total bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were observed in severe/critical disease patients compared to those with mild/moderate disease. Overall mortality was 7.6% (44/576), with 41.7% (28/68) dying in hospital. We identified risk factors related to COVID-19 infection, which could help healthcare providers take appropriate measures and prevent severe clinical outcomes. Our results suggest that the mortality registered by this disease in Venezuela during the first epidemic wave was underestimated. An increase in fatalities is expected to occur in the coming months unless measures that are more effective are implemented to mitigate the epidemic while the vaccination process is ongoing.

TI  - Deep Learning Estimation of Daily Ground-Level NO<sub>2</sub> Concentrations From Remote Sensing Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The limited number of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) surface measurements calls for the development of highly accurate approaches to estimating surface NO2 concentrations. In this study, we leverage a new satellite instrument, the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), along with other predictor variables, to estimate daily surface NO2 concentrations over Texas in 2019. We use the deep convolutional neural network (Deep-CNN), an advanced deep learning algorithm, to obtain estimates and achieve a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.91, an index of agreement (IOA) of 0.95, and a mean absolute bias (MAB) of 1.75 ppb in surface NO2 estimation. Additionally, we leverage a novel approach, shapley additive explanations (SHAP), to describe how Deep-CNN understands each predictor variable. The SHAP results show that the Deep-CNN model has an advanced understanding of the data set, revealing that TROPOMI closely captures levels of NO2. In addition, we show the superiority of our Deep-CNN model at estimating surface NO2 over other well-known machine learning and regression models in the field, including the support vector machines (SVM), random forest (RF), and multiple linear regression (MLR). Although SVM and RF show strong capabilities at estimating surface NO2 concentrations, their accuracy is inferior to that of the Deep-CNN model, ranking second and third in model accuracy in this study. The MLR, however, shows a poor ability at NO2 estimation and ranks last among all models. Testing the impact of sample size on model performance, we also show that, compared to other models, Deep-CNN needs more samples to trigger its strength at surface NO2 estimation.

TI  - Phytoplankton dynamics based on satellite inherent optical properties and oceanographic conditions in a patagonian gulf frontal system in relation to the adjacent continental shelf waters
T2  - MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamics of phytoplankton across a seasonal frontal system formed in San Jose ' Gulf (SJG, Patagonia Argentina) and in neighbouring shelf waters was assessed based on bio-optical satellite data (2003-2018) and spring and summer in situ samplings. Bio-optical properties of the water masses on the eastern (ED) and western (WD) domains of the seasonal frontal system of SJG showed clear differences: the year-round-vertically-mixed waters from the WD, strongly connected with the adjacent shelf waters, evidenced a brief and strong single phytoplankton bloom, while those from the ED, showing lower exchange with shelf waters and a strong vertical stratification during the warm season, displayed an earlier and long-lasting spring phytoplankton bloom, followed by a late-summer and autumn bloom, both associated with the development and erosion of the seasonal thermocline. Waters from the entire system are optically influenced by the absorption of coloured dissolved organic matter and detritus (cdom + detritus), suggesting a strong sediment load contribution from the continent and the seabed. To remark, a strong correlation between satellite chlorophyll-a (Chla-sat) and absorption by phytoplankton (aphy443) in the outer shelf waters differs from the weak correlation of those variables in the gulf's water masses, whose optical parameters are more complex. In situ Chla records may indicate wind-driven upwelling and downwelling areas in the northern and southern coasts of the ED. Dissolved nitrogen was identified as the limiting macronutrient for phytoplankton growth in the ED during summer. This work contributes relevant ecological information that may support management actions on the SJG shellfish artisanal fishery.

TI  - Changes in biomass burning, wetland extent, or agriculture drive atmospheric NH<sub>3</sub> trends in select African regions
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric ammonia (NH3) is a precursor to fine particulate matter and a source of nitrogen (N) deposition that can adversely affect ecosystem health. The main sources of NH3 - agriculture and biomass burning - are undergoing are or expected to undergo substantial changes in Africa. Although evidence of increasing NH3 over parts of Africa has been observed, the mechanisms behind these trends are not well understood. Here we use observations of atmospheric NH3 vertical column densities (VCDs) from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) along with other satellite observations of the land surface and atmosphere to evaluate how NH3 concentrations have changed over Africa from 2008 through 2018, and what has caused those changes. In West Africa NH3 VCDs are observed to increase during the late dry season, with increases of over 6% yr(-1) in Nigeria during February and March ( p<0 :01). These positive trends are associated with increasing burned area and CO trends during these months, likely related to agricultural preparation. Increases are also observed in the Lake Victoria basin region, where they are associated with expanding agricultural area. In contrast, NH3 VCDs declined over the Sudd wetlands in South Sudan by over 1.5% yr(-1), though not significantly (p D 0:28). Annual maxima in NH3 VCDs in South Sudan occur during February through May and are associated with the drying of temporarily flooded wetland soils, which favor emissions of NH3. The change in mean NH3 VCDs over the Sudd is strongly correlated with variation in wetland extent in the Sudd: in years when more area remained flooded during the dry season, NH3 VCDs were lower (r D 0:64, p<0:05). Relationships between biomass burning and NH3 may be observed when evaluating nationalscale statistics: countries with the highest rates of increasing NH3 VCDs also had high rates of growth in CO VCDs; burned area displayed a similar pattern, though not significantly. Livestock numbers were also higher in countries with intermediate or high rates of NH3 VCD growth. Fertilizer use in Africa is currently low but growing; implementing practices that can limit NH3 losses from fertilizer as agriculture is intensified may help mitigate impacts on health and ecosystems.

TI  - Coseismic and Early Postseismic Deformation Due to the 2021 M7.4 Maduo (China) Earthquake
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2021 Maduo earthquake ruptured a 150 km-long left-lateral fault in the northeast Tibet. We used Synthetic Aperture Radar data collected by the Sentinel-1A/B satellites within days of the earthquake to derive a finite fault model and investigate the details of slip distribution with depth. We generated coseismic interferograms and pixel offsets from different look directions corresponding to the ascending and descending satellite orbits. At the eastern end the rupture bifurcated into two sub-parallel strands, with larger slip on the northern strand. Inversions of coseismic displacements show maximum slip to the east of the epicenter. The averaged coseismic slip has a peak at depth of 3-4 km, similar to slip distributions of a number of shallow strike-slip earthquakes. Postseismic observations over several weeks following the Maduo earthquake reveal surface slip with amplitude up to 0.1 m that at least partially eliminated the coseismic slip deficit in the uppermost crust.

TI  - Seasonal parasitism of native egg parasitoids of brown marmorated stink bug (Halyomorpha halys) in Japan
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The invasive, Halyomorpha halys (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), is a severe economic insect pest native to East Asia. A strong effort has been made to identify natural egg parasitoids of H. halys in invaded regions, but parasitism rates reported from these studies have been inconsequentially low. To determine the species composition, phenology, and efficiency of egg parasitoids in the native region of H. halys, we deployed fresh and frozen sentinel H. halys egg masses from March through December in Kyoto, Japan. Our findings provide valuable insights on the abundance and parasitism rates of native H. halys parasitoids in Japan. A total of seven parasitoid species emerged from the sentinel egg masses, but Trissolcus japonicus had the highest parasitism rate of all parasitoids recovered (84% on fresh egg masses) and maintained the largest portion of the total parasitoid species composition (60% on fresh egg masses). The early season parasitoid community in Kyoto, Japan, is dominated by T. japonicus, with the first parasitism activity occurring in March. Throughout the course of the field study, T. japonicus also sustained a significantly higher parasitism rate on fresh H. halys eggs than frozen. The results from this research help expand the understanding of parasitoids in the native region of H. halys and hold importance for the future development of biological control programs against this invasive pest.

TI  - Impact of the Arctic observing systems on the ECCC global weather forecasts
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the impact of the conventional (in situ) and satellite observing systems in the Arctic on forecasts in the Northern Hemisphere polar and midlatitude regions using the Canadian global forecast system. It is part of an international cooperation to understand the role and the relative importance of the polar observing systems in numerical prediction systems in order to make recommendations for future optimal observing network design in this area. Both Observing System Experiment and Forecast Sensitivity to Observation Impact methods are used to assess the relative importance of the observing systems north of 60 degrees N. The experiments are conducted during winter 2017-2018 and summer 2018, which include the first two Special Observing Periods of the Year of Polar Prediction. The impact of supplementary radiosondes launched during these periods is also assessed. It is found that the joint impact of all Arctic satellite data on forecasts is two to four times larger than the impact of all conventional data in this area. The microwave sounders and the radiosonde network have the largest impact among the satellite and convention observing systems, respectively. The impact of the conventional data is larger than that of microwave sounders in both winter and summer seasons. The impact of the supplementary radiosondes on short-range forecast in the Arctic is positive, but becomes negligible beyond 24 hr forecast lead-time. The impact of observations in the Arctic on medium-range forecasts in the midlatitudes is larger over eastern North America and northern Asia for both seasons examined.

TI  - Stratospheric Adiabatic Mixing Rates Derived From the Vertical Gradient of Age of Air
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The circulation of the stratosphere transports important trace gases, including ozone, and can be thought of as having a fast horizontal mixing component and a slow meridional overturning component. Measuring the strength of the circulation directly is not possible, and so it must be inferred from tracer measurements. Long-lived trace gases can be related to the idealized tracer age of air, which describes how long an air parcel has been in the stratosphere. In this paper, we derive a quantitative relationship between the vertical gradient of age and the horizontal mixing between the tropics and the extratropics using a "leaky pipe" framework in isentropic coordinates. Mixing rates of air into and out of the tropics are related to the vertical gradient of age in the tropics and in the extratropics, respectively. The derivation is repeated with the hemispheres separated so that the vertical structure of the mixing in the two hemispheres can be compared directly. These theories are applied to output from an idealized model of the stratosphere and from a realistic chemistry-climate model to test our assumptions and calculate the mixing rates in the models. We then perform a quantitative comparison of the mixing rates in the Northern and Southern hemispheres along with an examination of where such a separation is valid. Finally, we perform a very preliminary calculation of mixing efficiency with satellite data to demonstrate the use of the mixing metric to compare mixing in models and data.

TI  - Influenza hospitalizations in Australian children 2010-2019: The impact of medical comorbidities on outcomes, vaccine coverage, and effectiveness
T2  - INFLUENZA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY VIRUSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Children with comorbidities are at greater risk of severe influenza outcomes compared with healthy children. In Australia, influenza vaccination was funded for those with comorbidities from 2010 and all children aged <5 years from 2018. Influenza vaccine coverage remains inadequate in children with and without comorbidities. Methods Children <= 16 years admitted with acute respiratory illness and tested for influenza at sentinel hospitals were evaluated (2010-2019). Multivariable regression was used to identify predictors of severe outcomes. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated using the modified incidence density test-negative design. Results Overall, 6057 influenza-confirmed hospitalized cases and 3974 test-negative controls were included. Influenza A was the predominant type (68.7%). Comorbidities were present in 40.8% of cases. Children with comorbidities were at increased odds of ICU admission, respiratory support, longer hospitalizations, and mortality. Specific comorbidities including neurological and cardiac conditions increasingly predisposed children to severe outcomes. Influenza vaccine coverage in influenza negative children with and without comorbidities was low (33.5% and 17.9%, respectively). Coverage improved following introduction of universal influenza vaccine programs for children <5 years. Similar vaccine effectiveness was demonstrated in children with (55% [95% confidence interval (CI): 45; 63%]) and without comorbidities (57% [(95%CI: 44; 67%]). Conclusions Comorbidities were present in 40.8% of influenza-confirmed admissions and were associated with more severe outcomes. Children with comorbidities were more likely experience severe influenza with ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital morality. Despite demonstrated vaccine effectiveness in those with and without comorbidities, vaccine coverage was suboptimal. Interventions to increase vaccination are expected to reduce severe influenza outcomes.

TI  - Flood hazard response to scenarios of rainfall dynamics and land use and land cover change in an urbanized river basin in Accra, Ghana
T2  - CITY AND ENVIRONMENT INTERACTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding of flood hazard response to multiple scenarios of relevant determinants in urban centers is a precondition for proactive disaster risk management. Yet, studies on flood response to the effects of multiple agents in Sub-Saharan Africa countries is rare. This study simulates peak runoff and water flow rate to land use and land cover (LULC), and scenarios of rainfall intensity of different durations and return periods. An urban flood-prone Odaw River catchment of Accra, Ghana was studied for the possible hazard responses to variations in LULC and rainfall intensities and amounts. Landsat data for 2000, 2011 and 2020 were classified and analyzed for changes in LULC. Rainfall intensity was estimated for different durations; and 2, 10 and 25 years of return periods, using Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) model. The rational and the successive flow routing hydrological models were used to simulate peak runoff and flow rate, respectively. Built-up area increased in coverage from 40% in 2000 to 65% in 2020, whereas woodland reduced from 10.5% to 4.0% for the same period. The peak runoff was highest in the built-up areas, and directly proportional to rainfall intensities and return periods. Replacing a given amount of woodland by equal amount of built-up area increased peak discharge by 3.5 times. Runoff peaked 30 mins after onset of rainfall for the 10-yr and 25-yr return periods, but peaked 1 hr for the 2-yr return period. We recommend that flood risk reduction strategies maintain substantial amount of woody vegetation and grassland, and provide quick early warning when extremely high rainfall intensity is anticipated. Land use planning organization should consider a range of flood hazard intensities, including rare and extreme events in their decisions.

TI  - Impact of temporal and spatial variability of solar resource on technical sizing of isolated solar installations in Senegal using satellite data
T2  - ENERGY REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of visible images from geostationary satellites such as Meteosat makes it possible to observe practically the entire surface of the earth almost instantaneously. This study aims to analyze for the first time the spatial and temporal variability of solar resource at different scales (daily, interannual and seasonal) in Senegal. Senegal is a climatologically interesting area because of its heterogeneity in terms of climate, from desert type (Sahelian) in the north to tropical type in the south, its sea-land interface and also its north-south gradient in precipitation. It is therefore interesting to map the solar resource to identify the different zone (zoning) in terms of solar potential. We will then suggest a model to size a 100% solar microgrid for electricity production. A case study has been applied with this model for a village that has a requirement of 134 kWh/d. In this paper, GHI (Global Horizontal Irradiance) estimates obtained from satellite imagery allowed us to evaluate the solar resource and its daily, interannual and seasonal variability. The Helioclim-3 V5 (HC-3) database is used over a 14-year period (2006-2019). This database allows to estimate the solar resource components at any point of the globe and for longer time periods. HC-3 has a very good spatial resolution (about 3 km) and a high temporal resolution (15 min). This method takes into account the relief and integrates clouds, water vapors and aerosols. The results to fully cover the needs of this 100% solar village mini-grid, there is a variation of the peak power of 20.20% between the maximum and minimum values over the year and 46.56% over the seasons. Coefficient of variation (COV) maps expressed as a percentage also show a low dispersion of the solar resource over the study period. The COV shows a narrow distribution with a minimum value of 6% and a maximum value of 9% varying from area to area and season to season. To see how a data compares to others, we will see the concept of percentiles. The P5, P10, P50 and P90 percentiles are calculated and compared to the GHI average from 2006 to 2019. The results show that P10 and P90 are closer to the GHI average than P5 and P50. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Good Things Need Time: Progress With the First Hyperspectral Sounder in Geostationary Orbit
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - My comments address the Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GIIRS) on the Chinese FY-4A satellite. It is the first hyperspectral sounder in geostationary orbit. An impact study by Yin et al. (2021, ) of GIIRS data on forecasting of typhoon (Maria in 2018) shows beneficial results. GIIRS provides temperature and humidity observations in cloud-free areas with high vertical and, as a novelty, with high temporal resolution (as short as 15 min) over a limited area. The development of GIIRS was long preceded by international plans and it will be followed by other hyperspectral sounders covering the geostationary ring. GIIRS is a major step toward an improved global space-based observing system enabling better forecasts of the temporal evolution of severe convective weather.

TI  - Transport equations for the normalized <i>n</i>th-order moments of velocity derivatives in grid turbulence
T2  - JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Transport equations for the normalized moments of the longitudinal velocity derivative Fn+1 (here, n is 1, 2, 3...) are derived from the Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations for shearless grid turbulence. The effect of the (large-scale) streamwise advection of Fn+1 by the mean velocity on the normalized moments of the velocity derivatives can be expressed as C1Fn+1/Re-lambda, where C-1 is a constant and Re-lambda is the Taylor microscale Reynolds number. Transport equations for the normalized odd moments of the transverse velocity derivatives F-y,F- n+1 (here, n is 2, 4, 6), which should be zero if local isotropy is satisfied, are also derived and discussed in sheared and shearless grid turbulence. The effect of the (large-scale) streamwise advection term on the normalized moments of the velocity derivatives can also be expressed in the form C2Fy, n+1/Re-lambda, where C-2 is a constant. Finally, the contribution of the mean shear in the transport equation for Fn+1 can be modelled as 15B/Re-lambda, where B (= S *S-s,S- n+1) is the product of the non-dimensional shear parameter S* and the normalized mixed longitudinal-transverse velocity derivatives S-s,S- n+1; if local isotropy is satisfied, S-s,S- n+1 should be zero. These results indicate that if Fn+1, F-y,F- n+1 and B do not increase as rapidly as Re-lambda, then the effect of the large-scale structures on small-scale turbulence will disappear when Re. becomes sufficiently large.

TI  - A Spherical Harmonic Model of Earth's Lithospheric Magnetic Field up to Degree 1050
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed mapping of the Earth's magnetic field brings key constraints on the composition, dynamics, and history of the crust. Satellite and near-surface measurements detect different length scales and are complementary. Here, we build a model, selecting and processing magnetic field measurements from the German CHAMP and ESA Swarm satellites, which we merge with near-surface scalar anomaly data. We follow a regional approach for modeling the magnetic field measurements and next transform the series of regional models into a unique set of spherical harmonic (SH) Gauss coefficients. This produces the first global model to SH degree 1050 derived by inversion of all available measurements. The new model agrees with previous satellite-based models at large wavelengths and fits the CHAMP and Swarm satellite data down to expected noise levels. Further assessment in the geographical and spectral domains shows the model to be stable when downward continued to the Earth's surface.

TI  - A Novel Phase Unwrapping Method Used for Monitoring the Land Subsidence in Coal Mining Area Based on U-Net Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale and high-intensity mining underground coal has resulted in serious land subsidence. It has caused a lot of ecological environment problems and has a serious impact on the sustainable development of economy. Land subsidence cannot be accurately monitored by InSAR (interferometric synthetic aperture radar) due to the low coherence in the mining area, excessive deformation gradient, and the atmospheric effect. In order to solve this problem, a novel phase unwrapping method based on U-Net convolutional neural network was constructed. Firstly, the U-Net convolutional neural network is used to extract edge to automatically obtain the boundary information of the interferometric fringes in the region of subsidence basin. Secondly, an edge-linking algorithm is constructed based on edge growth and predictive search. The interrupted interferometric fringes are connected automatically. The whole and continuous edges of interferometric fringes are obtained. Finally, the correct phase unwrapping results are obtained according to the principle of phase unwrapping and the wrap-count (integer jump of 2 pi) at each pixel by edge detection. The Huaibei Coalfield in China was taken as the study area. The real interferograms from D-InSAR (differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar) processing used Sentinel-1A data which were used to verify the performance of the new method. Subsidence basins with clear interferometric fringes, interrupted interferometric fringes, and confused interferometric fringes are selected for experiments. The results were compared with the other methods, such as MCF (minimum cost flow) method. The tests showed that the new method based on U-Net convolutional neural network can resolve the problem that is difficult to obtain the correct unwrapping phase due to interrupted or partially confused interferometric fringes caused by low coherence or other reasons in the coal mining area. Hence, the new method can help to accurately monitor the subsidence in mining areas under different conditions using InSAR technology.

TI  - Terrestrial and Atmospheric Controls on Surface Energy Partitioning and Evaporative Fraction Regimes Over the Tibetan Plateau in the Growing Season
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-atmosphere interactions are an essential component of the climate system. However, no detailed description of the underlying effects of the surface forcing of the atmosphere has been established. In this study, GLEAM, MODIS, and ERA5 were the input set of multiple analysis algorithms, "segmentation" was the core idea of the analysis method. The study area is segmented into six surface response functional groups, and the multidimensional evaporation regime function was segmented into piecewise functions controlled by segment authoritative variables. Inspired by the surface heat balance equation and moisture-limited, energy-limited evaporation regimes, we chose soil moisture content and the net radiation flux to represent the moisture and energy status, respectively, and chose the leaf area index (LAI) to characterize the vegetation cover to investigate the primary effects of surface parameters on the energy partitioning of the land surface and evaporative regime. The results show that though a coupling strength 1.8 times greater was obtained when the LAI was used as the response variable instead of soil moisture, soil moisture was still the highest response variable in the regression tree analysis. This is consistent with the essence of the evaporative fraction and indicates that water should be the most fundamental response variable. The evaporative regime was subdivided from two phases into five phases according to the effects such as water extraction by vegetation, photosynthesis, soil shading, and roughness changes, each with an authoritative response variable.

TI  - Representation of Stony Surface-Atmosphere Interactions in WRF Reduces Cold and Wet Biases for the Southern Tibetan Plateau
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Current regional and global climate models often have significant cold and wet biases in the simulation of climate for the Southern Tibetan Plateau (STP). This region has complex terrain and steep slopes, and the underlying surface in many areas is stony with little soil and vegetation, which causes negligible infiltration and rapid runoff. The default soil type (loam) in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) is thus replaced with bedrock to improve the representation of the mountainous hydrological processes in this region. The domain of bedrock is identified by using satellite-based Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and terrain elevation standard deviation. The model results demonstrate that the WRF-simulated precipitation and temperature are sensitive to soil type setting in this region. After the soil type is corrected, the mean precipitation bias at weather stations in the STP is reduced from 35 mm to -6 mm and the cold bias of 2 m air temperature is reduced from 1.5 degrees C to 0.8 degrees C when evaluated against weather station data. The relevant land and atmospheric processes are explored. The revision of the soil type from loam to bedrock results in increased sensible heat flux and decreased evaporation. A higher sensible heat flux results in higher air temperature, and the suppressed evaporation attenuates precipitation-evaporation feedback. The altered energy budget enhances the valley wind, resulting in a sinking motion anomaly and reduced precipitation over lower elevations. The study highlights the critical role of soil type in the realistic representation of land-atmosphere interactions by numerical models for the unique region.

TI  - Identifying the spatio-temporal variations of <i>Ulva prolifera</i> disasters in all life cycle
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Since 2007, Ulva prolifera disasters have occurred every year in the South Yellow Sea of China, the largest green tide disaster in the world. The inter-annual differences make such disasters monitoring and early warning difficult. This study used remote sensing data (2015-2019) to determine its spatio-temporal variations in all life cycle. The results showed a lay effect between the NDVI-mean and the coverage area of U. prolifera. The spatio-temporal distribution of U. prolifera showed stages and regional differences. From late April to early May, U. prolifera first emerged near the Subei Shoal. After development in the middle of the Yellow Sea, U. prolifera outbroke in the eastern sea area of Shandong and Jiangsu, declined in the Shandong sea area, and disappeared near Qingdao. The cycle lasted for approximately 90 days. The sea surface temperature was the necessary condition for the disaster, and the sea wind field was the main driving force for its horizontal drift. This study overcomes the poor timing and continuity of remote sensing data in the monitoring of U. prolifera. It provides a theoretical reference for forecasting the outbreak period of U. prolifera and can aid policy-makers to avert such disasters in advance.

TI  - Quantitative Evaluation of Urban Expansion using NPP-VIIRS Nighttime Light and Landsat Spectral Data
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying the evolution of urban expansion is of vital importance for optimizing land use patterns and promoting sustainable urban development. This research constructed the Enhanced Nighttime Light Urban Index (ENUI), which combines NPP-VIIRS nighttime light with Landsat spectral data, and used this index for quantitative evaluation of urban expansion in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) urban agglomeration. The results showed that, between 2012 and 2018, (1) the extraction using the ENUI achieved overall accuracy of 0.93-0.94, producer's accuracy in urban areas of 0.82-0.84, user's accuracy in urban areas 0.73-0.75, and Kappa values of 0.75-0.78, showing a relatively high extraction accuracy; (2) the GBA urban expansion followed a circular and radial expansion pattern; (3) the growth trend of expansion intensity and development potential for sub-central cities was stronger than central cities; and (4) the agglomeration auto correlation of the spatial expansion in the GBA presents a continuous "dispersion" trend. Compared with previous methods, our study improved the extraction accuracy of urban expansion and effectively reduced the deficiency of overflow effect for NPP-VIIRS nighttime light. The research can thus provide valuable datasets and reference for decision-making to adjust and optimize urban development pattern and design urban sustainable development.

TI  - A remote sensing and modeling integrated approach for constructing continuous time series of daily actual evapotranspiration
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing-based surface energy balance (SEB) techniques have emerged as useful tools for quantifying spatialized actual evapotranspiration at various temporal and spatial scales. However, discontinuous data acquisitions and/or gaps in image acquisition due to cloud cover can limit the applicability of satellite remote sensing (RS) in agriculture water management where continuous time series of daily crop actual evapotranspiration (ETc act) are more valued. The aim of the research is to construct continuous time series of daily ETc act starting from temporal estimates of actual evapotranspiration obtained by SEB modelling (ETa eb) on Landsat-TM images. SEBAL model was integrated with the FAO 56 evaporation model, RS-retrieved vegetative biomass dynamics (by NDVI) and on-field measurements of soil moisture and potential evapotranspiration. The procedure was validated by an eddy covariance tower on a vineyard with partial soil coverage in the south of Sardinia Island, Italy. The integrated modeling approach showed a good reproduction of the time series dynamics of observed ETc act (R-2 =0.71, MAE=0.54 mm d(-1), RMSE=0.73 mm d(-1)). A daily and a cumulative monthly temporal analysis showed the importance of integrating parameters that capture changes in the soil-plant-atmosphere (SPA) continuum between Landsat acquisitions. The comparison with daily ETc act obtained by the referenced ET fraction (ETrF) method that considers only weather variability (by ETo) confirmed the lead of the proposed procedure in the spring/early summer periods when vegetation biomass changes and soil water evaporation have a significant weight in the ET process. The applied modelling approach was also robust in constructing the missing ETc act data under scenarios of limited cloud-free Landsat acquisitions. The presented integrated approach has a great potential for the near real time monitoring and scheduling of irrigation practices. Further testing of this approach with diverse dataset and the integration with the soil water modeling is to be analyzed in future work.

TI  - The Lived Experience of Interdependence: Support Worker Relationships and Implications for Wider Rehabilitation
T2  - BRAIN IMPAIRMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Engaging in a meaningful life where one can exercise autonomy has been proposed as a key aim of rehabilitation. Influenced by a neoliberal worldview, this has traditionally been characterised by a pursuit towards individual functional independence in which one completes tasks and activities unassisted. However for many persons, individual functional independence may not be a realistic, prioritised or beneficial goal. Many individuals must learn to work with support workers to exercise choice and control. Such relationships extend beyond a transactional nature and involve many subtle characteristics. In this article, I draw on my lived experience of partnering with support workers to illustrate the complexity of such relationships and how they can enable interdependence to serve as a vehicle to self-determination. I finish with some ideas about what rehabilitation can do to recognise the important role human connections play in facilitating interdependence. Understanding the nature of these relationships is necessary to provide services which value interdependence, supporting people to pursue a meaningful life following impairment.

TI  - Derivation and Evaluation of Satellite-Based Surface Current
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Observations of real-time ocean surface currents allow one to search and rescue at ocean disaster sites and investigate the surface transport and fate of ocean contaminants. Although real-time surface currents have been mapped by high-frequency (HF) radar, shipboard instruments, satellite altimetry, and surface drifters, geostationary satellites have proved their capability in satisfying both basin-scale coverage and high spatiotemporal resolutions not offered by other observational platforms. In this paper, we suggest a strategy for the production of operational surface currents using geostationary satellite data, the particle image velocimetry (PIV) method, and deep learning-based evaluation. We used the model scalar field and its gradient to calculate the corresponding surface current via PIV, and we estimated the error between the true velocity field and calculated velocity field by the combined magnitude and relevance index (CMRI) error. We used the model datasets to train a convolutional neural network, which can be used to filter out bad vectors in the surface current produced by arbitrary model scalar fields. We also applied the pretrained network to the surface current generated from real-time Himawari-8 skin sea surface temperature (SST) data. The results showed that the deep learning network successfully filtered out bad vectors in a surface current when it was applied to model SST and created stronger dynamic features when the network was applied to Himawari SST. This strategy can help to provide a quality flag in satellite data to inform data users about the reliability of PIV-derived surface currents.

TI  - Spatio-temporal pattern of land use and land cover and its effects on land surface temperature using remote sensing and GIS techniques: a case study of Bhubaneswar city, Eastern India (1991-2021)
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization produces substantial land use changes by causing the construction of different urban infrastructures in the city region for habitation, transportation, industry, and other reasons. As a result, it has a significant impact on Land Surface Temperature (LST) by disrupting the surface energy balance. The objective of this paper is to assess the impact of land-use/land-cover (LU/LC) dynamics on urban land surface temperature (LST) of Bhubaneswar City in Eastern India during 30 years (1991-2021) using Landsat data (TM, ETM + , and OLI/TIRS) and machine learning algorithms (MLA). The finding reveals that the mean LST over the entire study domain grows significantly between 1991 and, 2021due to urbanization (beta coefficient 0.400, 0.195, 0.07, and 0.06 in 1991, 2001, 2011, and 2021 respectively) and loss of green space (beta coefficient - 0.295, - 0.025, - 0.125 and - 0.065 in 1991, 2001, 2011 and 2021 respectively). The highest class recorded for agricultural land (49.60 km(2), accounting for 33.94% of the total land area) was in 1991 followed by vegetation (41.27 km(2), 28.19% of the total land area), and built-up land (27.59 km(2), 18.84% of the total land area). The sharp decline of vegetation cover will continue until 2021 due to increasing built-up areas (r = - 0.531, - 0.329, - 0.538, and - 0.063 in the 1991, 2001, 2011 and 2021 respectively). Built-up land (62.60 km(2), accounting for 42.76% of the total land area, an increase of 35.01 km(2) from 1991) as the highest class followed by water bodies (21.57%, 32.60 km(2) of the land area), and agricultural land (31.57 km(2), 21.57% of the land area) in 2021. Remote sensing techniques proved to be an important tool to urban planners and policymakers to take adequate steps to promote sustainable development and minimize urbanization influence on LST. Urban green space (UGS) can help improve the overall liveability and environmental sustainability of Bhubaneswar city.

TI  - Deep learning-based hydrothermal alteration mapping using GaoFen-5 hyperspectral data in the Duolong Ore District, Western Tibet, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrothermal alteration mapping is of great significance for porphyry copper deposit (PCD) exploration. Due to different metallogenetic environments, hydrothermal processes are heterogeneous especially in large-scale ore districts, leading to diverse physicochemical properties and spectral variations of wall-rock alteration. Conventional mapping methods mainly rely on shallow spectral features to identify hydrothermal alteration and cannot fully characterize the properties of the materials. By contrast, deep learning (DL) frameworks with multiple nonlinear layers can extract deep spectral and spatial features from hyperspectral imagery which is more robust and discriminative. Deep models were employed to the GaoFen-5 (GF-5) hyperspectral dataset in the Duolong district, to investigate the role of deep features in hydrothermal alteration mapping. For this purpose, we assess stacked autoencoder and several convolution neural networks which are computationally affordable for achieving large-area mineral exploration. More importantly, the mixed convolutions and covariance pooling algorithm achieved the best mapping results with the overall accuracy of 96.77%. The feature fusion method is also recommended, because of its lightweight structures. These two spectral-spatial classifiers produced appealing classification performance while reducing the misclassification among spectrally similar minerals and alleviating noise, demonstrating their powerful learning capabilities. Finally, spatial patterns of the hydrothermal alteration in the Duolong district can be taken as an important indicator of erosion degree of the porphyry-epithermal system. It is proved that the combination of the DL methods and the GF-5 hyperspectral data is effective in large-area mineral exploration and can be applied to other PCDs in the neighboring Bangong Co-Nujiang metallogenic belt.

TI  - Seeing like a Socialist: On Socialist Worldviews from Polanyi to Taylor to Now
T2  - NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article we argue that reinvigorating socialist politics requires championing a socialist worldview that goes beyond the critique of capitalism. Neglecting such an outlook leaves socialism tethered to the fortunes of capitalism and inhibits a broader account of its own virtues. We begin by explaining why worldview thinking is appropriate today. Then we examine two underappreciated works by Karl Polanyi (his 1927 lecture "On Freedom") and Charles Taylor (his 1974 essay "Socialism and Weltanschauung"). Each treats worldview thinking as indispensable and we use them as catalysts for developing a socialist vision. Finally, we bring our insights to bear on the worldview potential of socialist republicanism. We contend that a promising worldview emerges by elaborating the following components: a political anthropology of human possibilities; anti-capitalism, social freedom, and non-domination; socialist civic virtues; and the promise and limits of pluralism.

TI  - Potential of Landsat 8 OLI for mapping and monitoring of soil salinity in an arid region: A case study in Dushak, Turkmenistan (Retracted article. See vol. 17, 2022)
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
M3  - Retracted Publication
AB  - Soil salinity is the most common land degradation agent that impairs soil functions, ecosystem services and negatively affects agricultural production in arid and semi-arid regions of the world. Therefore, reliable methods are needed to estimate spatial distribution of soil salinity for the management, remediation, monitoring and utilization of saline soils. This study investigated the potential of Landsat 8 OLI satellite data and vegetation, soil salinity and moisture indices in estimating surface salinity of 1014.6 ha agricultural land located in Dushak, Turkmenistan. Linear regression model was developed between land measurements and remotely sensed indicators. A systematic regular grid-sampling method was used to collect 50 soil samples from 0-20 cm depth. Sixteen indices were extracted from Landsat-8 OLI satellite images. Simple and multivariate regression models were developed between the measured electrical conductivity values and the remotely sensed indicators. The highest correlation between remote sensing indicators and soil EC values in determining soil salinity was calculated in SAVI index (r = 0.54). The reliability indicated by R2 value (0.29) of regression model developed with the SAVI index was low. Therefore, new model was developed by selecting the indicators that can be included in the multiple regression model from the remote sensing indicators. A significant (r = 0.74) correlation was obtained between the multivariate regression model and soil EC values, and salinity was successfully mapped at a moderate level (R2: 0.55). The classification of the salinity map showed that 21.71% of the field was non-saline, 29.78% slightly saline, 31.40% moderately saline, 15.25% strongly saline and 1.44% very strongly. The results revealed that multivariate regression models with the help of Landsat 8 OLI satellite images and indices obtained from the images can be used for modeling and mapping soil salinity of small-scale lands.

TI  - Murals as Memory Carriers. Analysis of the Meanings Given to Them and the Attitudes of Their Creators
T2  - ON THE WATERFRONT
M3  - Article
AB  - The phenomenon of wall paintings has been developing in public space since the Mexican Revolution. Murals are used, among other purposes, to capture memories. Moreover, they are one of the most popular forms of representation of the past in public space, commonly called memory carriers. In the discussion of the research being carried out, the opportunities associated with the formation of historical awareness and attitudes towards society's past through commemorative murals will be highlighted.The research was conducted from July to November 2020. It was based on the analysis of the existing materials- photographs of commemorative murals (significant and marked elements) and interviews with semi-structured memory agents. The first stage of the described research focused on the authors of commemorative murals.The aim of the research was to determine the meaning and values that the creators of murals have given in general and in particular to the commemorative murals made by themselves. The research allowed, among other things, to answer questions concerning the artistic path of the creators (graffiti environment), what factors influenced the process of making mural (family history, one's own past, finances, social involvement), worldview and values of the declared creators (patriotism) and attitude to the politics of memory.

TI  - Spatial Variation Characteristics and Remote Sensing Retrieval of Total Suspended Matter in Surface Water of the Yangtze River
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - Total suspended matter (TSM) is an important parameter that describes optical characteristics and water pollution level. Remote sensing was used to obtain suspended matter concentrations in the planar water body, which can monitor and analyze the reliability of turbidity and pollution levels. In this study, a semi-empirical model of suspended matter along the Yangtze River mainstream(from Chongqing to Shanghai) was constructed based on the field measured hyperspectral data and suspended matter concentration and its components, with reference to MODIS (1-4 band), Landsat 8 (1-5 band), Sentinel 2 (2-6 band), HJ-B1 (1-4 band), and other commonly used band ranges. The results show that: (1) Turbidity and TSM of the Yangtze River mainstream increased from Chongqing to Shanghai during the dry season, whereas the proportion of OSM to TSM(OSM/TSM) decreased from Chongqing to Shanghai. (2) The spectral properties of chlorophyll-a were not obvious; however, it showed a bimodal spectral characteristic of suspended matter concentration. Due to the low concentration of suspended matter in the water(<114.68 mg.L-1), the first peak value was significantly higher than the second peak. However, peak reflection and position had an obvious "red shift" phenomenon in the direction of the wavelength. (3) The reflectance values of the Yangtze River mainstream were most sensitive to the concentration of suspended matter in the 600-710 nm and 475-550 nm bands. Most of these fall in the green and red band of MODI, Landsat 8, Sentinel 2, and HJ-1B satellites. Therefore, the commonly used satellites have a band setting to detect the inversion of turbidity degree index of the Yangtze River main stream water body. The Sentinel 2 satellite band is most suitable for the inversion of suspended matter concentration in the Yangtze River mainstream. The mean absolute percentage error(MAPE) and root mean square error(RMSE) of the optimal exponential model were 10.23 mg.L-1 and 23%, respectively.

TI  - Convergence of emerging technologies: Development of a risk-based paradigm for marine mammal monitoring for offshore wind energy operations
T2  - INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The ability to gather real-time and near real-time data on marine mammal distribution, movement, and habitat use has advanced significantly over the past two decades. These advances have outpaced their adoption into a meaningful, risk-based assessment framework so critically needed to support society's growing demands for a transition to increased reliance on renewable energy. Marine acoustics have the capacity to detect, identify, and locate vocalizations over broad areas. Photogrammetric and image processing increases the ability to visually detect animals from surface or aerial platforms. Ecological models based on long-term observational data coupled with static and remotely sensed oceanographic data are able to predict daily and seasonal habitat suitability. Extensive monitoring around anthropogenic activities, combined with controlled experiments of exposure parameters (i.e., sound), supports better informed decisions on reducing effects. Population models and potential consequence modeling provide the ability to estimate the significance of individual and population exposure. The collective capacities of these emerging technical approaches support a risk ranking and risk management approach to monitoring and mitigating effects on marine mammals related to development activities. The monitoring paradigm related to many offshore energy-related activities, however, has long been spatially limited, situationally myopic, and operationally uncertain. A case evaluation process is used to define and demonstrate the changing paradigm of effective monitoring aimed at protecting living resources and concurrently providing increased certainty that essential activities can proceed efficiently. Recent advances in both technologies and operational approaches are examined to delineate a risk-based paradigm, driven by a diversity of regional data inputs, that is capable of meeting the imperative for timely development of offshore wind energy.

TI  - Assimilation of Ground and Satellite Snow Observations in a Distributed Hydrologic Model for Water Supply Forecasting
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Runoff from the Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB) is an important water resource in the western United States. The majority of annual runoff is derived from spring snowmelt, and therefore April-July water supply volume (WSV) forecasts produced by the Colorado Basin River Forecast Center are critical to basin water management. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of snow data assimilation (DA) in a distributed hydrologic model on WSV forecasting error and skill in headwater catchments of the UCRB. To do this, a framework was built to use the Localized Ensemble transform Kalman filter to update modeled snow water equivalent (SWE) states in the Hydrology Laboratory-Research Distributed Hydrologic Model with SNOTEL SWE observations and spatially and temporally complete MODIS Snow Covered-Area and Grain size data. The DA approach was assessed by evaluating ensemble streamflow prediction forecasts over a 20-year period for 23 catchments in the UCRB. Overall, the DA approach improved water supply forecast skill in 80% of pilot basins with an average improvement in the median continuous rank probability skill score of 4%. A research-to-operations transition was facilitated by automating the implementation of the DA approach. This work demonstrates the capacity for gridded and point snow products to be used to objectively update model states in an operational forecasting setting.

TI  - A General Framework for Spatio-Temporal Modeling of Epidemics With Multiple Epicenters: Application to an Aerially Dispersed Plant Pathogen
T2  - FRONTIERS IN APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND STATISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The spread dynamics of long-distance-dispersed pathogens are influenced by the dispersal characteristics of a pathogen, anisotropy due to multiple factors, and the presence of multiple sources of inoculum. In this research, we developed a flexible class of phenomenological spatio-temporal models that extend a modeling framework used in plant pathology applications to account for the presence of multiple sources and anisotropy of biological species that can govern disease gradients and spatial spread in time. We use the cucurbit downy mildew pathosystem (caused by Pseudoperonospora cubensis) to formulate a data-driven procedure based on the 2008 to 2010 historical occurrence of the disease in the U.S. available from standardized sentinel plots deployed as part of the Cucurbit Downy Mildew ipmPIPE program. This pathosystem is characterized by annual recolonization and extinction cycles, generating annual disease invasions at the continental scale. This data-driven procedure is amenable to fitting models of disease spread from one or multiple sources of primary inoculum and can be specified to provide estimates of the parameters by regression methods conditional on a function that can accommodate anisotropy in disease occurrence data. Applying this modeling framework to the cucurbit downy mildew data sets, we found a small but consistent reduction in temporal prediction errors by incorporating anisotropy in disease spread. Further, we did not find evidence of an annually occurring, alternative source of P. cubensis in northern latitudes. However, we found a signal indicating an alternative inoculum source on the western edge of the Gulf of Mexico. This modeling framework is tractable for estimating the generalized location and velocity of a disease front from sparsely sampled data with minimal data acquisition costs. These attributes make this framework applicable and useful for a broad range of ecological data sets where multiple sources of disease may exist and whose subsequent spread is directional.

TI  - Reversible bilateral optic tract edema following pipeline-assisted coiling of a large ophthalmic aneurysm: A case report
T2  - CLINICAL NEUROLOGY AND NEUROSURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Edema coursing the optic apparatus has traditionally been associated with sellar and para-sellar tumors. However, postoperative aneurysmal volume expansion following endovascular treatment has been reported to induce cranial neuropathies, such as vision loss in rare instances. Here, we present a case report of worsening optic tract edema associated with bilateral visual acuity deficit following treatment of a large left paraophthalmic aneurysm with pipeline-assisted coiling. Rapid resolution of visual deficit was observed following administration of corticosteroids. A 42-year-old female with a 6-month history of worsening left eye vision and sentinel headache presented with left visual field cut and decreased left visual acuity. She was found to have a large paraophthalmic aneurysm which was treated with pipeline-assisted coiling. Within one week post-treatment, the patient presented to the emergency department with worsening right visual complaints. On magnetic resonance imaging, T2 hyperintensities coursing the right posterior optic nerve, optic chiasm, and bilateral optic tracts were noted. Angiography demonstrated an expanding neck remnant. The patient was treated with oral corticosteroids and repeat pipeline stenting. At four week follow up, she demonstrated significant improvement of symptoms and reduced T2 hyperintensities. With the advancement in endovascular technique for the treatment of large aneurysms, more patients are electing endovascular treatment over microsurgical clipping. Given the possibility of continued growth following endovascular treatment, patient counseling regarding risks and side effects is paramount.

TI  - Synthesis of SERS-active core-satellite nanoparticles using heterobifunctional PEG linkers
T2  - NANOSCALE ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is a sensitive analytical technique capable of magnifying the vibrational intensity of molecules adsorbed onto the surface of metallic nanostructures. Various solution-based SERS-active metallic nanostructures have been designed to generate substantial SERS signal enhancements. However, most of these SERS substrates rely on the chemical aggregation of metallic nanostructures to create strong signals. While this can induce high SERS intensities through plasmonic coupling, most chemically aggregated assemblies suffer from poor signal reproducibility and reduced Long-term stability. To overcome these issues, here we report for the first time the synthesis of gold core-satellite nanoparticles (CSNPs) for robust SERS signal generation. The novel CSNP assemblies consist of a 30 nm spherical gold core Linked to 18 nm satellite particles via Linear heterobifunctional thiol-amine terminated PEG chains. We explore the effects that the varying chain Lengths have on SERS hot-spot generation, signal reproducibility and Long-term activity. The chain Length was varied by using PEGs with different molecular weights (1000 Da, 2000 Da, and 3500 Da). The CSNPs were characterized via UV-Vis spectrophotometry, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), zeta-potential measurements, and lastly SERS measurements. The versatility of the synthesized SERS-active CSNPs was revealed through characterization of optical stability and SERS enhancement at 0, 1, 3, 5, 7 and 14 days.

T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital elevation models (DEMs) are the primary form of satellite data used to design and analyze the hydrology and hydraulic behavior of watersheds for water resource development. The primary objective of this study is to conduct morphometric parameter analysis using SRTM30m, ASTER30m, and ALOS30m data to determine the impact of identical DEM resolution and DEM sources on the Tena watershed by computing the basic and derived parameters. In this study I used data from two sources for morphometric parameter analysis with ArcGIS software. The results indicate that the DEM sources did not provide similar results for all parameters: ASTER30m was the maximum output for almost all parameters, followed by SRTM30m and ALOS30m. The findings of this study suggest that ASTER30m is the most suitable data source for flood risk assessment, soil erosion, sediment, streamflow, and other watershed modelling, while ALOS30m is best suited for peak discharge analysis. All of the used DEM sources were suitable for computing watershed shape parameters. In general, the resolution of DEMs impacts the hydrological and hydraulic study of any watershed, with resulting effects on decision-making for watershed management and development.

TI  - Latent Class Analysis of Sexual Behaviours and Attitudes to Sexually Transmitted Infections Among Gay and Bisexual Men Using PrEP
T2  - AIDS AND BEHAVIOR
M3  - Article
AB  - Gay and bisexual men (GBM) who use pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) are at increased risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) compared to those who don't use PrEP. Since the implementation of PrEP in Australia, it is possible that attitudes towards STIs have shifted in line with changes in risk and transmission dynamics in the context of increased screening. As the extent to which GBM utilise STI prevention strategies likely depends on their attitudes towards STIs and STI prevention, the aims of this study were to use latent class analysis (LCA) to classify GBM using PrEP on the basis of their attitudes towards STIs and reported risk behaviours, and examine how these categorisations relate to risk of STI acquisition. 1225 GBM who were previously enrolled in a PrEP implementation study (The PrEPX Study) completed a survey focused on sexual behaviours and attitudes towards STIs 1 year post-study follow-up. Data on chlamydia, gonorrhoea and syphilis testing and positivity were available through a sentinel network of participating study clinics. Using LCA, participants were allocated into four classes; Class 1, "Some concern and lowest risk"; Class 2, "Low concern and lower risk"; Class 3, " High concern and higher risk"; and Class 4, "Low concern and highest risk". The majority (78%) of participants were classified into Class 3 or Class 4, two groups which were distinguished by highly disparate attitudes towards STIs but with a similar proportion of participants diagnosed with a bacterial STI in the last 12 months (48% and 57%, respectively). Findings suggest that attitudes towards STIs among GBM using PrEP in Australia vary considerably, and this will likely influence their receptivity to different STI prevention strategies.

TI  - Near-Infrared Imaging With Indocyanine Green for the Treatment of Endometriosis: Results From the Gre-Endo Trial
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionA current challenge for endometriosis surgery is to correctly identify the localizations of disease, especially when small or hidden (occult endometriosis), and to exactly define their real extension. The use of near-infrared radiation imaging (NIR) after injection of indocyanine green (ICG) represents one of the most encouraging method. The aim of this study is to assess the diagnostic value of NIR-ICG imaging in the surgical treatment of endometriosis compared with the standard of treatment. Material and MethodsThe Gre-Endo trial is a prospective, single-arm study (NCT03332004). After exploring the operatory field using the white light (WL) mode, patients were injected with ICG and then observed in NIR mode. All suspected areas were classified and chronicled according to lesions visualized only in WL, NIR-ICG, or in the combination of both. Lesion not visualized in WL was considered as suspect occult lesion (s-OcL). In addition, a random control biopsy from an apparent negative peritoneum visualized in WL and NIR-ICG imaging was taken for all patients (control cases). All lesions removed were considered "suspect endometriosis" until pathology. ResultsFifty-one patients were enrolled between January 2016 and October 2019. A total of 240 suspected lesions have been identified with both methods (WL + NIR-ICG). Two hundred and seven (86.2%) lesions out of the overall 240 were visualized with WL imaging, and 200 were confirmed to be pathologic (true positive for WL). The remaining 33/240 (13.75%) (false negative for WL) lesions were identified only with NIR-ICG imaging and collected as s-OcL. All 33 s-OcLs removed were confirmed to be pathologic (c-OcL = 100%). NIR-ICG vision showed PPV of 98.5%, NPV of 87.1%, Se of 87%, and Sp of 98.5%, confirming that this kind of imaging is an excellent diagnostic and screening test (p = 0.001 and p = 0.835, according to McNemar's and Cohen's kappa tests, respectively). ConclusionsThe use of NIR-ICG vision alone and combined with WL showed good results in intraoperative detection rate and fluorescence-guided surgery of endometriosis. Furthermore, NIR-ICG allowed surgeons to remove occult lesions that otherwise would remain, leading to possible greater postoperative pain and a higher risk of persistence and relapse.

TI  - Challenging dominant sustainability worldviews on the energy transition: Lessons from Indigenous communities in Mexico and a plea for pluriversal technologies
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Little research exists on how alternative understandings of sustainability and societal well-being, such as those developed by marginalized Indigenous populations, can enrich and possibly challenge dominant visions of sustainability anchored in Western discourses on sustainable development and ecological modernization. This paper addresses this research gap in the context of the transition towards low-carbon energy sources by addressing the following question: how do Indigenous worldviews contrast with modernist visions of sustainability in the context of the energy transition? To do so, it first builds a conceptual framework contrasting modernist and Indigenous sustainability worldviews. Second, it applies this framework to the case of wind energy developments within the territory of three Zapotec communities located in southern Mexico, with the discussion relying on 103 interviews with key stakeholders, six focus groups and participant observation. Results show that the Zapotec sustainability worldview contrasts strikingly with wind developers' modernist propositions, which tend to reproduce the region's past colonial arrangements in terms of cultural domination, non-recognition of Indigenous identities and disrespect for local customs. This contrast has led to many conflicts and misunderstandings around wind energy projects. The paper concludes that different conceptualizations of sustainability must be recognized to ensure an inclusive and just energy transition, and advances the concept of "pluriversal technologies" to emphasize the need for technologies that embrace ontological and epistemological diversity by being co-designed, co-produced and co-owned by the inhabitants of the socio-cultural territory in which they are embedded.

TI  - Innovative use of spatial regression models to predict the effects of green infrastructure on land surface temperatures
T2  - ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the complex and dynamic interplay and cumulative effects of green infrastructure (GI) and urban form on land surface temperatures (LST) is important to design and implement heat mitigation strategies. Past research has mostly employed two-dimensional (2D) indicators, simple correlations and conventional regression models using coarse-level analytical approaches that obviate spatial autocorre-lation effects. For the first time, this study applies a holistic approach to evaluate GI and urban settings as complex dynamic systems. The objectives of this paper are to: (1) develop novel 'spatially-based' predic-tive models that account for spatial dependencies; (2) implement a fine-scale analytical unit (<50 m) for a more precise and accurate analysis; (3) incorporate the 'multi-temporal' diurnal and seasonal variations into predictions; and (4) propose the novel combination of 2D and 3D morphological, compositional and configurational parameters of GI and urban form derived from very high resolution (VHR) remotely-sensed data (<2m), using Sydney metropolitan region as case study. Results show a strong spatial asso-ciation of LST at fine scale (<50 m) and spatial autocorrelation among residuals in traditional models. Spatial error model (SEM) exhibits a superior performance over conventional multivariate regression, however, results presented significant heteroscedasticity caused by the large temperature variability in certain areas, although this problem was partially solved. Future studies should incorporate unmeasured factors related to material-specific properties (i.e. albedo, emissivity), and capture the thermal variation within urban areas by segmenting datasets into zones with relatively homogenous thermal and physical properties. Overall, ground imperviousness mostly defines the LST profile of a place, with a relative warming effect of 0.23 degrees C and 0.61 degrees C during day; and 0.18 degrees C and 0.41 degrees C at night per 10% of area incre-ment in winter and summer, respectively. The same increment in the proportion of water and trees con-tributes to a maximum LST reduction of 0.42-0.85 degrees C in summer, and 0.25-1.17 degrees C in winter; however, this causes an increase of nocturnal LST between 0.12 degrees C and 0.30 degrees C throughout the year. In general, the cooling effects from GI do not outweigh the warming effects from man-made surfaces. Compared to abundance, the spatial configuration of trees is less influential on LST. Ground sky view factor (GSVF), alti-tude and distance to coast are of relative importance in defining LST profiles. These results used to numerically simulate different greening scenarios at neighbourhood scale for Sydney; illustrating the potential of spatial models to define heat mitigation scenarios to inform urban design and planning policies.

TI  - A bibliometric analysis of tropical mangrove forest land use change from 2010 to 2020
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Review
AB  - Mangrove land use changes of varied intensities have long been a problem in tropical mangrove forests. This has resulted in various degrees of mangrove land use modification, which catch many interests in the region for research. The research provided here is a bibliometric analysis of scholarly articles published around the world in various publication document types on changes in land use of tropical mangrove forests based on remote sensing and Geographical Information System (GIS). Scientific data analysis was undertaken by using bibliometric approaches on 6,574 papers extracted from the Scopus databases between 2010 and 2020. The findings revealed that the number of publications continuously climbed from under 400 to an average of 50-60 per year till 2019. The data showed that the mangrove forest modifications study gained traction when the highest number of citations, 9,236 in 2015, were observed. We can also notice that the overall number of citations fluctuated a lot during the first five years (2010-2015) but increased from 2013 to 2015. The findings demonstrate how remote sensing satellites have aided vegetation and land study in recent years. The findings also revealed that the analysis tools of Land Use Change, Vegetation Index, Mangrove, Tropical Country, Remote Sensing, and Tropical contributed to scientific knowledge of current issues of mangrove land use change in the tropical region. The authors' keywords, Remote Sensing in particular, supplied roughly 43%, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (13%), Vegetation Index (9%), and other keywords contributed less than 7%. The growth pattern of the keywords "MODIS" and "Landsat" implies that both will stay important over the next five years, according to an analysis of the type of satellite used in land use assessment. Meanwhile, papers pertaining to policy on land use change, food security, and forest resources were evaluated in order to highlight policy and academic research findings on the topics. The application of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, which is a very relevant tool that can be used in monitoring land use changes and assessing vegetation status because it is a desirable technique in measuring plant health and vigour, can help fill the research gaps presented in this study. This review can help with the development of better mangrove land use change approaches in tropical mangroves and around the world using satellite remote sensing and GIS.

TI  - Water demand of central pivot-irrigated areas in Bahia, Brazil: management of water resources applied to sustainable production
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - When performed without technical criteria, the rapid expansion of irrigated agricultural frontiers can result in overexploitation of water, causing worrying impacts on the balance of agroecosystems. This study proposes a model applied to the state of Bahia, to estimate the water demand of areas irrigated by a central pivot, in order to contribute to information that will subsidize the inspection and planning of water resources in the promotion of sustainable agriculture. The irrigated areas were identified and measured by photointerpretation using orbital images from the Landsat-8 satellite. With a historical series of data, the reference evapotranspiration was calculated and monthly water balance was elaborated. The data obtained were spatialized by kriging, and with punctual values of water deficit (mm), the water demand of the irrigated perimeter of the equipment was estimated. The results were described considering strategic planning units, proposed from municipalities, hydrographic basins and biomes. A total of 4075 pivots were quantified, covering an irrigated area of 265,896.30 ha and with an average annual consumption of 1,333,473,208.02 m(3) of water. Areas of high demand were identified, especially in the western region of Bahia, which includes the hydrographic basin of the Sao Francisco River and the Cerrado biome, concentrating 80.85% and 75.47% of the state water demand for pivots, respectively. Considering possible points of water vulnerability and continuity of this expansion, the results provide the primary information needed to encourage the adoption of public policies aimed at the management of water resources. The study method proposes guidelines that condition the application in any region of interest in the world.

TI  - Optimization of environmental variable functions of GPP quantitative model based on SCE-UA and minimum loss screening method
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental variable functions are of key importance for gross primary productivity (GPP) modeling. This study proposes a method about the optimization of environmental variable function to obtain a more robust and accurate GPP quantitative model. The key idea is to explore the impact of environmental factors on the accuracy of the GPP quantitative model from the following three aspects: the first is using tensor as the alternative environmental factor equation to construct the basis-function set of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), atmospheric temperature and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration for the given environmental conditions, and soil moisture functions of new environmental conditions. The second is building 144 candidate model based on a tensor product. The third is finding the best model from the candidates according to the Shuffled Complex Evolution (SCE-UA) algorithm and the Minimum Loss Screening Method. Through the above experiments, we have the following conclusions: First, this paper obtains two new best models from 144 candidate models, and their accuracy is higher than that of the initial model, indicating that this paper proposes a more robust and accurate GPP quantitative model. Then, the model proposed in this paper has common characteristics, that is, PAR and atmospheric temperature can be replaced by more appropriate quantitative functions, named Sigmoid-like function and Q10 equation, and the carbon dioxide equation can use half-saturated equation or Sigmoid function. Finally, the method in this paper can provide new ideas for simulating the fluxes of other ecosystems, including soil carbon decomposition and plant respiration.

TI  - Southeast Asia island coastline changes and driving forces from 1990 to 2015
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Global climate change and high-intensity human interventions have caused significant changes in island coastline. Due to the increase in sea level rise (SLR), inundation risk of islands has attracted attention in the recent past. However, high-quality data and large-scale studies on island coastline change are very few. This study aimed at investigating island changes in South East Asia (SEA) between 1990 and 2015 using an integrated workflow, including coastline extraction, analysis of changes, and discussion of driving forces based on remote sensing technology and GIS spatial analysis. More than 9000 islands were extracted. Approximately 12% of the total islands had undergone changes in coastlines, resulting in about 251 km(2) decrease in area (421 islands showed increase in area while 678 islands showed a decrease in area). Coastline length increased by 821 km from 1990 to 2015. Natural coastlines decreased by 4238 km, whereas artificial coastlines increased by 5059 km. Approximately 1/3 of total coastlines changed in location (14.9% underwent deposition and 16.1% underwent retreat). The overall land-sea pattern of SEA islands presented a "west (slightly north) to east (slightly south)" distribution, with the evolutionary process of expansion patches spanning from west to east and from south to north. Human activities, material composition and landforms of the island coast played key roles in coastline changes, whereas SLR was not associated with extensive erosion of SEA islands. Our findings form a basis for integrated management of coastal zones of SEA island countries.

TI  - Hourly mapping of surface air temperature by blending geostationary datasets from the two-satellite system of GOES-R series
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatio-temporally continuous surface air temperature (SAT) is a valuable input for many research fields such as environmental studies and hydrological models. Substantial efforts have been focused on mapping daily SAT using land surface temperature (LST) derived from polar-orbiting satellites such as NASA's Terra and Aqua. However, reconstruction of SAT at very high temporal scales such as sub-daily or hourly was carried out in very few studies, most of which are based on the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellites for small-scale areas with limited stations. In this study, we developed estimation schemes based on random forest for mapping hourly SAT over a large-scale region (CONUS) by blending LST datasets from the two-satellite system of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R (GOES-R) Series with the aim of reconstructing the hourly SAT maps with spatially uniform resolutions of about 2 km over CONUS. Estimation schemes with different variables were compared to evaluate the contributions of reanalysis variables and the hour of day (HOD) variable to model predicative performance, and the impacts of station density on model performance were also explored. We found that the model scheme with reanalysis variables and the scheme with HOD achieved higher predicative performance with the mean RMSE of 2.0 K and 2.5 K, respectively. Systematic predictive errors across the synoptic hours of a diurnal cycle are significantly reduced when considering HOD in the modeling of hourly SAT. The model scheme considering both reanalysis variables and HOD achieved the highest performance with a mean RMSE of 1.9 K. We observed that the influence of station density on model performance is related to types of cross-validation and model schemes, and that the uncertainty levels associated with the evaluation of predicative performance for the model schemes decrease with station density, which increases our confidence in the evaluation results for the schemes. Therefore, the mapping accuracy of hourly SAT over the large-scale area CONUS could be conservatively estimated to be 1.9-2.5 K using site-based cross-validation. We expect that this study will facilitate the further mapping of SAT at high-temporal scales over large-scale areas based on abundant and sustained observations from global systems of meteorological geostationary satellites.

TI  - A new AG-AGB estimation model based on MODIS and SRTM data in Qinghai Province, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The ability to rapidly and effectively monitor the alpine grassland aboveground biomass (AG-AGB) is very important to grassland resource management and sustainable use. The present satellite-driven models for estimating AG-AGB still need be improved due to incomplete monitoring indicators and a lack of sufficient in situ measurements. Thus, this study proposes a new AG-AGB estimation model based on MODIS and SRTM data for improving the estimation accuracy of AG-AGB. In this new model, first six estimation indicators were obtained from 33 spectral and environmental indicators using Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and correlation analysis. Second, multiple linear regression (MLR), a back propagation neural network (BPNN), a support vector machine (SVM), and the random forest (RF) algorithm were used to build the new model based on the long-term AG-AGB field measurements and the corresponding to six estimating indicators for 6128 samples. Third, the new model was used to map the spatial distribution of the AG-AGB in Qinghai Province, China. And, the trends of the AG-AGB changes from 2005 to 2018 were analyzed using Sen and Mann-Kendall trend analysis and Hurst exponent analysis. The results show that 1) the six estimation indicators (EVI, radiation, altitude, B5/B7, latitude, and precipitation) were confirmed to be important for estimating the AG-AGB. 2) Among the MLR, BPNN, SVM, and RF, the model based on MODIS and SRTM data constructed using the RF algorithm was determined to be the best new model, with an R-2 of 0.938 and a relative root mean square error (RRMSE) of 19.88%, for accurately estimating the AG-AGB based on 6128 samples. 3) Moreover, a set of 1200 samples was determined to be the lowest sample size for constructing the new model, with an R-2 of nearly 0.923 and an RRMSE of 25%. 4) The AG-AGB can be more accurately mapped using the new model (R-2 of 0.800 and RRMSE of 23.91%), indicating that the new model based on MODIS and SRTM data has the potential to map the AG-AGB over a large area. And over the last 14 years, the AG-AGB overall trends were that the areas with increasing AG-AGB (67.65%) were much larger than those with decreasing AG-AGB (32.35%), and the area of the sustainable AG-AGB increase accounts for 39.75% of the total alpine grassland area in northeastern and southwestern parts of Qinghai Province. The proposed estimation model based on MODIS and SRTM data is more suitable, greatly improves the accuracy of AG-AGB modeling, and provides a scientific basis for the reasonable use and management of alpine grassland resources.

TI  - Environmental variability and larval supply to wild and cultured shellfish populations
T2  - AQUACULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal upwelling ecosystems support some of the most productive fisheries of the planet together with a large shellfish aquaculture sector that depends on oceanographic processes to deliver planktonic larvae to replenish and feed the farmed stock. Coastal shellfish aquaculture operations in Chile and Peru have experienced large interannual fluctuations in larval supply over the past decade, yet the drivers of such variability remain unidentified. We focused on the effects of environmental variability on larval supply of the farmed Peruvian bay scallop Argopecten purpuratus in a bay in northern Chile (Tongoy Bay, 30 circle S) that accounts for over 90% of countrywide landings. We examined the hypothesis that the environmental processes governing larval supply were shared with wild benthic invertebrates with planktonic larval development and compared time series of larval abundance for the scallop with larval supply rates to benthic populations of two well-studied wild intertidal species: the Chthamalid barnacle Jehlius cirratus and the purple mussel Perumytilus purpuratus. To this end, we examined the cross-correlation of larval supply to environmental variability using MODIS satellite fields of sea surface temperature (SST) chlorophyll-a concentration (chl-a) and fluorescence line height (nFLH), together with three climate indices relevant for the south east Pacific sector: the Southern Oscillation index (SOI), the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the Antarctic Oscillation Index (AAO). Our results showed that over the five-year study period (2009-2013), patterns of larval supply to the scallop population were related to interannual variability in the environmental processes as captured by their Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs), likely to adult condition before spawning. Surprisingly, larval supply for none of the wild species showed a clear association to the EOFs. In contrast, scallops and wild species showed significant association to lower frequency climate variability as captured by the SOI and the PDO, but not the AAO. Results suggest that larval supply patterns to Tongoy Bay may be modulated by regional patterns of climatic variability, particularly of tropical origin. Thus, changes in coastal oceanography associated with ongoing changes in global climate could have strong and lasting effects on the supply of seedstock for wild and cultivated species across this eastern boundary coastal system and argue for the establishment of long-term ocean observing and early warning systems along the region.

TI  - Wildfire, smoke, and outdoor recreation in the western United States
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfire activity is increasing in the western United States at a time when outdoor recreation is growing in popularity. Because peak outdoor recreation and wildfire seasons overlap, fires can disrupt recreation and expose people to poor air quality. We link daily data on campground use at 1069 public campgrounds across the western United States over a ten-year period to daily satellite data on wildfire and smoke. We use this data set to (1) tabulate the number of campers affected by wildfire and smoke at campgrounds across the western US, and (2) provide estimates of how campground use responds to wildfire and smoke impacts, including the first causal estimates of the impacts of wildfire smoke on recreation behavior. We find that, on average, more than 120,000 campground visitor-days per year are close to an actively burning fire and nearly 400,000 are impacted by adverse smoke conditions. In some regions more than 10% of camper-days occur when air quality is poor due to wildfire smoke. Combining the results with monthly national park visitation data at the 30 parks in our sample, we estimate that fire and smoke affect 400,000 and 1 million visitor-days per year, respectively. Using fixed effects panel regressions at the campground level, we estimate declines in campground use in response to fire and smoke. The magnitude of the smoke effect is small, however, suggesting that smoke fails to deter most visitors to public lands. Back-of-the envelope calculations based on our findings and estimates from the literature suggest that most of the total welfare losses accruing to campers due to smoke occurs via health impacts from trips taken in spite of smoky conditions, rather than due to cancelled trips.

TI  - The effect of adjacent vegetation on fire severity in Afrotemperate forest along the southern Cape coast of South Africa
T2  - SOUTHERN FORESTS-A JOURNAL OF FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently two large wildfires (around the towns of Knysna in 2017 and George in 2018) jointly burnt over 80 000 ha in the southern Cape, South Africa. Here, patches of closed-canopy Afrotemperate forest occur within a matrix of fire-prone (native) fynbos shrublands or adjacent to commercial plantations of invasive alien Pinus trees (a transformed state). We compared the distances that fire penetrated into forest margins adjacent to fynbos to those adjacent to plantations. Furthermore, we used a satellite-derived index of fire severity, the differenced Normalised Burn Ratio (dNBR), to compare fire severity in forest margins adjacent to fynbos to those adjacent to plantations. Results were inconsistent between the two fires. In the Knysna fire, no significant difference was noted in fire penetration into forest, while forest margins adjacent to plantations burnt at significantly lower severity than those adjacent to fynbos. In the George fire, penetration into and fire severity in forest margins adjacent to plantations were significantly greater than in those adjacent to fynbos. Not only were fire severity and penetration in forest margins with plantations adjacent dissimilar between the George and Knysna fires, but variability in fire severity was greater in forest margins with plantation adjacent than in those with fynbos adjacent. Our study provides evidence that fire severity in forest margins is associated with the adjacent vegetation type and that plantations potentially expose forests to greater variability in fire severity and extent than the forest may experience under natural conditions. Other important factors that may affect the severity and extent of burn in forest margins are forest patch size and topographical position, the nature of the ecotone between forest and the adjacent vegetation, and the fuel load and structure of the adjacent vegetation which varies considerably in relation to stand age and management practices in plantations.

TI  - Quantifying how urban landscape heterogeneity affects land surface temperature at multiple scales
T2  - Journal of Ecology and Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Landscape metrics have been widely applied to quantifying the relationship between land surface temperature and urban spatial patterns and have received acceptable verification from landscape ecologists but some studies have shown their inaccurate results. The objective of the study is to compare landscape metrics and texture-based measures as alternative indices in measuring urban heterogeneity effects on LST at multiple scales. Results The statistical results showed that the correlation between urban landscape heterogeneity and LST increased as the spatial extent (scale) of under-study landscapes increased. Overall, landscape metrics showed that the less fragmented, the more complex, larger, and the higher number of patches, the lower LST. The most significant relationship was seen between edge density (ED) and LST (r = - 0.47) at the sub-region scale. Texture measures showed a stronger relationship (R-2 = 34.84% on average) with LST than landscape metrics (R-2 = 15.33% on average) at all spatial scales, meaning that these measures had a greater ability to describe landscape heterogeneity than the landscape metrics. Conclusion This study suggests alternative measures for overcoming landscape metrics shortcomings in estimating the effects of landscape heterogeneity on LST variations and gives land managers and urban planners new insights into urban design.

TI  - Paget's disease of the breast in male with underlying invasive ductal carcinoma: A case report with review of literature
T2  - ANNALS OF MEDICINE AND SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction: Paget's disease of the breast is a rare cutaneous eczema-like condition that occurs in the nippleareolar complex of the breast. The current study aims to report a rare case of Paget's disease of the breast associated with invasive ductal carcinoma in a male breast.Case report: A 54-year-old male presented with ulceration of the left nipple-areolar complex that has been progressing over the last 6 months. On examination; there was a palpable axillary lymph node. On ultrasound, a small hypoechoic heterogenous mass was seen beneath the areola (8*4 mm) with surrounding vascularity, and a few axillary lymph nodes with normal morphology and cortical thickness. The mammography revealed some points of calcification arranged in clusters. The patient underwent left side mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy. The result of histopathological examination showed left side unifocal invasive ductal carcinoma.Discussion: There are two main theories that explain the histogenesis of Paget's disease of the breast with and without underlying malignancy: epidermotropic theory, which suggests an epidermal infiltration of the nipple with Paget cells, and transformative theory, which proposes a malignant transformation of normal glandular cells of the epidermis.Conclusion: The clinical presentation of Paget's disease of the breast is characteristic and should always warn the surgeon of the possibility of underlying malignancy.

TI  - Using Satellite Data to Guide Urban Poverty Reduction
T2  - REVIEW OF INCOME AND WEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Poverty reduction in low- and middle-income countries is increasingly an urban challenge, and a challenge that continues to be constrained by lack of data, including data on the spatial distribution of poverty within cities. Utilizing existing household survey data in combination with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) applied to high-resolution satellite images of cities, this study shows that existing data can generate detailed neighborhood-level maps providing key targeting information for an anti-poverty program. The approach is highly automatic, applicable at scale, and cost-effective. The method also provides direct support for policy development, as illustrated by the case study, where the Government of Mozambique is implementing an urban social safety net program, targeting poor urban neighborhoods, utilizing the estimated poverty maps.

TI  - Seven Decades of Dimensional and Mass Balance Changes on Dokriani Bamak and Chhota Shigri Glaciers, Indian Himalaya, Using Satellite Data and Modelling
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study, dimensional (glacier area and snout position) and mass balance changes of Dokriani Bamak (central Himalaya) and Chhota Shigri (western Himalaya) glaciers have been investigated over the last seven decades using satellite data and modelling. Dimensional changes were investigated using satellite data from Corona (1968-1971), Landsat TM/ETM+ (1993-2010) and Sentinel-MSI (2020) along with limited field checks, while annual and seasonal mass balances on both the glaciers were reconstructed using a simple temperature-index model since 1950. Dokriani Bamak and Chhota Shigri glaciers showed deglaciation and retreat over 1968-2020 with limited areal and snout changes up to 1990s, and then accelerated rates in the twenty-first century, especially after similar to 2010. The mean annual glacier-wide mass balances were computed as - 0.09 +/- 0.35 m w.e./y and - 0.12 +/- 0.28 m w.e./y with equivalent cumulative mass wastage of - 6.33 m w.e. and - 8.61 m w.e. on Dokriani Bamak and Chhota Shigri glaciers over 1950-2020, respectively. Both the glaciers showed decadal positive mass balances over 1950-1980s followed by a limited wastage over 1980-2000, and an accelerated decadal mass wastage post-2000, in agreement with decreasing glacier velocities. As a result of an accelerated post-2000 wastage, a western tributary glacier detached from the Chhota Shigri Glacier, providing much higher deglaciation rate on Chhota Shigri Glacier compared to Dokriani Bamak Glacier. The present study revealed that mass balance exerts significant control on deglaciation and retreat of both the glaciers. Though the mass wastage patterns were roughly similar on both the glaciers, Chhota Shigri Glacier showed consistently lower terminus retreat than that of the Dokriani Bamak Glacier because of the presence of thick debris cover and local steep topographic settings around glacier snout.

TI  - A HIV diagnosis and treatment cascade for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples of Australia
T2  - AIDS CARE-PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SOCIO-MEDICAL ASPECTS OF AIDS/HIV
M3  - Article
AB  - Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (hereafter Aboriginal) people are a priority population for HIV care in Australia; however, no HIV cascade exists for this population. We developed annual HIV cascades for 2010-2017 specific to Aboriginal peoples. By 2017, an estimated 595 Aboriginal people were living with HIV (PLWH); however, 14% remained undiagnosed. Cascade steps below global targets were: PLWH aware of their diagnosis (86%), and retention in care (81% of those who had received any care in previous two years in a sentinel network of clinics). For people retained in care, treatment outcomes surpassed global targets (92% receiving treatment, 93% viral suppression). Increases occurred across all HIV cascade steps over time; however, the least improvement was for retention in care, while the greatest improvement was achieving viral suppression. The HIV cascade for Aboriginal peoples highlights both gaps and strengths in the Australian HIV care system, and importantly highlights where potential interventions may be required to achieve the global UNAIDS targets.

TI  - Seasonal and long-term variations in leaf area of Congolese rainforest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - It is important to understand temporal and spatial variations in the structure and photosynthetic capacity of tropical rainforests in a world of changing climate, increased disturbances and human appropriation. The equatorial rainforests of Central Africa are the second largest and least disturbed of the biodiversly-rich and highly productive rainforests on Earth. Currently, there is a dearth of knowledge about the phenological behavior and long-term changes that these forests are experiencing. Thus, this study reports on leaf area seasonality and its time trend over the past two decades as assessed from multiple remotely sensed datasets. Seasonal variations of leaf area in Congolese forests derived from MODIS data co-vary with the bimodal precipitation pattern in this region, with higher values during the wet season. Independent observational evidence derived from MISR and EPIC sensors in the form of angular reflectance signatures further corroborate this seasonal behavior of leaf area. The bimodal patterns vary latitudinally within this large region. Two sub-seasonal cycles, each consisting of a dry and wet season, could be discerned clearly. These exhibit different sensitivities to changes in precipitation. Contrary to a previous published report, no widespread decline in leaf area was detected across the entire extent of the Congolese rainforests over the past two decades with the latest MODIS Collection 6 dataset. Long-term precipitation decline did occur in some localized areas, but these had minimal impacts on leaf area, as inferred from MODIS and MISR multi-angle observations.

TI  - Remote estimates of total suspended matter in China's main estuaries using Landsat images and a weight random forest model
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Total suspended matter (TSM) is a key parameter for coastal waters, and its transport in estuaries can regulate erosion-accretion and biogeochemical processes. However, most existing models were built to estimate TSM concentration in specific rivers or regions, such as the Yangtze River or Yellow River estuaries in China. Here, we propose a stable hybrid model to estimate TSM concentrations of different estuaries in China using local regression and a TSM mapping method based on the weight random forest (WRF) model. Two hundred thirty-eight in situ TSM samples were collected in six river stations from northern to southern China by the United Nations Environment Programme Global Environment Monitoring System. The surface reflectance for each sample was extracted from Landsat images considering the date and location of each TSM value in Google Earth Engine. One-variable, multiple stepwise linear regression (MSLR), and RF models were built to predict TSM concentration in global regressions (single model) across all calibration samples and local regressions (hybrid model) with a TSM threshold of 100 mg/L. A WRF model was used to map TSM concentrations based on the classification probability of a decision tree model. Our study showed that: (1) the Red band, band ratio, and band difference indices using the Red band as input were sensitive to the estuaries with low TSM concentrations, while the NIR band, band ratio, and band difference indices using NIR band were sensitive to highly turbid estuaries with high TSM concentrations; (2) the band difference index predicted TSM concentrations better in less turbid estuaries than the band ratio index; (3) the predictions of the RF model were better than those of the one-variable and MSLR models both for global regressions and local regressions - the local RF model had the best result, i.e., a validation R-2 of 0.90 and an RMSE of 0.56 mg/L; and (4) the WRF model was more reasonable than the original RF model. TSM concentrations were overestimated using the original RF model. Our results suggested that the local regression was suitable for different estuaries with large differences in TSM concentration. The WRF model provided an effective approach for water quality parameter mapping.

M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, a part of Wadi Al-Sahba, Saudi Arabia, is tested for revealing and modelling potential area of groundwater using integrated data derived from remote-sensing, geology and hydrology through GIS-based analytical hierarchy process method. Nine thematic maps e.g. geology, stream-networks, topography, slope, lineaments, depressions, radar intensity, rainfall and land use/cover that control the occurrence of groundwater were weighted and combined to quantify the potential area of groundwater resources. The output prospection map revealed five predicting zones of groundwater (GPZs) are very low (11.55%), low (28.18%), moderate (29.14%), high (22.41%) and very high (8.73%). The most predicted areas are covering wide part of Al Kharj and downstream of Wadi Al-Sahba. Information derived from well data (# 59), thermal sensor and interferometric SAR coherence change detection data are validated the prospective map. Overall, integration of remote sensing data has the capability for revealing and predicting potential areas of groundwater resources.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - As an air pollutant closely related to urban traffic and heavy industrial capacity, the variation of NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) concentration can directly reflect the strength of socioeconomic activities. Using the weekly average results of daily product synthesis of tropospheric NO2 column concentrations from OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) satellite inversion, a weekly-scale variation series of standardized socioeconomic activity index during the Spring Festival period of 2019-2021 is constructed. The results show that the OMI-NO2 satellite data are in good consistency with ground-based monitoring data; the Spring Festival holiday also suppresses socioeconomic activity in normal years, but the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic leads to an extended period of 2-3 weeks of weakened socioeconomic activity in China after the holiday, while the minimum value of socioeconomic activity intensity decreases by 0.12. Although socioeconomic activity is significantly suppressed in the short term, the intensity of socioeconomic activity rises steadily with the gradual resumption of work and production everywhere from the third week after the Chinese Spring Festival and has reached 60.91% of the highest level before the holiday in the seventh week after the holiday. OMI-NO2 satellite data can be used for a rapid assessment of the intensity of air pollution emissions and the level of socioeconomic activity in different regions.

TI  - Hydrological sentinels and the relative emergence of climate change signals in New Zealand river flows
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrological impacts of climate change are prompting water resource and flood hazard management to adapt to non-stationary conditions. Among the factors influencing these policy decisions is the question of timing: when are we likely to see climate change effects? Using a national climate-hydrology model cascade over the 21(st) century, times and extents of emergence of six hydrological metrics are evaluated across New Zealand rivers. While the stringency of the emergence criteria has a significant effect on timing and extent, emergence for all metrics generally occurs after mid-century, if at all, and in the country's South Island. Looking at the first emerging metrics, in contrast, allows us to sidestep the high uncertainties of the time of emergence, revealing mean winter flows to be the most extensive sentinel of climate change in New Zealand rivers among the metrics considered. This has implications for hydrological monitoring to inform timely climate change adaptation.

TI  - Supraglacial lake bathymetry automatically derived from ICESat-2 constraining lake depth estimates from multi-source satellite imagery
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - We introduce an algorithm (Watta) which automatically calculates supraglacial lake bathymetry and detects potential ice layers along tracks of the ICESat-2 (Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite) laser altimeter. Watta uses photon heights estimated by the ICESat-2 ATL03 product and extracts supraglacial lake surface, bottom, and depth corrected for refraction and (sub-)surface ice cover in addition to producing surface heights at the native resolution of the ATL03 photon cloud. These measurements are used to constrain empirical estimates of lake depth from satellite imagery, which were thus far dependent on sparse sets of in situ measurements for calibration. Imagery sources include Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), Sentinel-2, and high-resolution Planet Labs PlanetScope and SkySat data, used here for the first time to calculate supraglacial lake depths. The Watta algorithm was developed and tested using a set of 46 lakes near Sermeq Kujalleq (Jakobshavn) glacier in western Greenland, and we use multiple imagery sources (available for 45 of these lakes) to assess the use of the red vs. green band to extrapolate depths along a profile to full lake volumes. We use Watta-derived estimates in conjunction with high-resolution imagery from both satellite-based sources (tasked over the season) and nearly simultaneous Operation IceBridge CAMBOT (Continuous Airborne Mapping By Optical Translator) imagery (on a single airborne flight) for a focused study of the drainage of a single lake over the 2019 melt season. Our results suggest that the use of multiple imagery sources (both publicly available and commercial), in combination with altimetry-based depths, can move towards capturing the evolution of supraglacial hydrology at improved spatial and temporal scales.

TI  - Concurrent habitat fluctuations of two economically important marine species in the Southeast Pacific Ocean off Chile in relation to ENSO perturbations
T2  - FISHERIES OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - ENSO-driven concurrent habitat fluctuations of two economically important marine species jumbo squid Dosidicus gigas and jack mackerel Trachurus murphyi in the Southeast Pacific Ocean off Chile during 1950-2017 were examined using a habitat suitability index (HSI) modeling approach. The optimal HSI models sourced from 10 weighing-based scenarios were developed, selected and validated using the crucial factors water temperature at 400 m depth (Temp_400m), sea surface height anomaly (SSHA) and sea surface salinity (SSS) for D. gigas and sea surface temperature (SST), Temp_400m, and mixed layer depth (MLD) for T. murphyi. Results suggested that the optimal HSI model could accurately predict the habitat hotspots for D. gigas and T. murphyi. The ENSO event (indicated by Nino 3.4 index, NI) was significantly related to environmental conditions off Chile. Cross-correlation revealed positive relationships between NI and SST, SSHA, SSS, and Temp_400m and negative correlation between NI and MLD. Synchronous opposite habitat fluctuations were shown between D. gigas and T. murphyi under different ENSO events. The NI was significantly negatively related to the HSI of D. gigas and positively correlated with the HSI of T. murphyi. Comparing with the El Nino years, suitable habitats of D. gigas and T. murphyi dramatically enlarged and contracted, respectively, during the La Nina years. Both suitable habitats moved southwestward under this climate conditions. Our finding suggested that ENSO-driven environmental changes played important roles in the concurrent habitat fluctuations of D. gigas and T. murphyi. Such studies are conducive to the effective utilization and management of multiple related species.

TI  - An explicitly spatial approach to identify heat vulnerable urban areas and landscape patterns
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change induced by global warming will produce more frequent heatwaves and intensify urban heat islands, thereby increasing heating related risks. Given this scenario, it is important to mitigate heat on urban ecosystems to promote their resilience. This study aims to develop a method to identify heat vulnerable urban areas by considering the land surface temperature (LST) distribution and landscape patterns. Methods included the creation of a cellular space to represent a given urban environment and integrate multidisciplinary databases; the use of Landsat-8 satellite images to estimate fraction vegetation cover, normalized difference moisture indices emissivity, and albedo; and exploratory spatial analyses using Moran's global and local indices to identify landscape patterns associated with Local Climate Zones (LCZ). Analyses revealed that the estimated variables are suitable for explaining LST, which is autocorrelated in space, despite seasonal variations. The methods made it possible to identify heat vulnerable areas, which should be considered when developing adaptation policies, and that heating is associated with areas composed of both compact low rise (LCZ3) and large low rise buildings (LCZ8), whereas cooling is associated with dense trees (LCZA), and when vegetation is associated with both open high rise (LCZ4) and open low rise buildings (LCZ6).

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PEST MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Herbivorous insects are predicted to have higher densities in larger patches, while their natural enemies will be more affected by the edge of these patches. In this paper, we investigate the effect of the relationship between brassica horticultural plot shape and the adjacent land use on the abundance of P. xylostella and its chances to be parasitised. Samples were collected from brassica plots during spring. Landscape metrics of the study area were estimated using Landsat images. We found a negative relationship between the pest abundance and the perimeter-to-area ratio of the brassica plot, and a positive relationship with land cover estimated from Landsat images. The proportion of parasitised immatures showed opposite relationship with the same variables. Implications of these findings are discussed.

TI  - The Integration of Multi-Source Remotely Sensed Data with Hierarchically Based Classification Approaches in Support of the Classification of Wetlands
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Methodologies were developed to classify wetlands (Open Bog, Treed Bog, Open Fen, Treed Fen, and Swamps) from remotely sensed data using advanced classification algorithms through two hierarchical approaches. The data utilized included multispectral optical and thermal data (Landsat-5, and Landsat-8), radar imagery (Sentinel-1), and a digital elevation model. Goals were to determine the best way to combine imagery to classify wetlands through hierarchically based classification approaches to produce more accurate and efficient maps compared to standard classification. Algorithms used were Random Forest (RF), and Naive Bayes. A hierarchically based RF classification methodology produced the most accurate classification result (91.94%). The hierarchically based approaches also improved classification accuracies for low-quality data, as defined through feature analysis, when compared to a nonhierarchical classifier. The hierarchical approaches also produced a significant increase in classification accuracy for the Naive Bayes classifier versus the standard approach (similar to 12% increase) while not significantly increasing computation time - comparable in accuracy to the RF tests for around 20% the computational effort. Preselection of spectral bands, polarizations and other input parameters (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Normalized Difference Water Index, albedo, slope, etc.) using log-normal or RF variable importance analysis was very effective at identifying low-quality features and features which were of higher quality.

T2  - IFAC PAPERSONLINE
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 20th IFAC Conference on Technology, Culture, and International Stability (TECIS)
CL  - Moscow, RUSSIA
AB  - The article examines the psychological antecedents and opportunities for correcting attitudes associated with the person's rejection of COVID-19 prevention measures. The psychological factors that favor the appearance of such attitudes in a person are discussed. Three groups of these antecedents are distinguished, differing in terms of their place in the structure of the psyche and the degree of their stability during a person's life: stable, relatively stable, dynamic. The group of stable psychological antecedents includes personality traits, cognitive/thinking style, personal values; into the group of relatively stable worldview beliefs, science-related knowledge, peculiarities of the social self and group identity; into the group of dynamic ones the psychological state, attitudes, and beliefs regarding the situation of the pandemic.Two main strategies for counteracting negative attitudes and beliefs are highlighted: preventive (implemented even before the emergence of undesirable attitudes and the appearance of misinformation provoking their occurrence), reactive (carried out after the formation of negative attitudes and beliefs). Various options for implementing a preventive strategy are considered: limiting the spread of misinformation about COVID-19, preventing its refutation, and developing people's skills to detect misinformation.The factors of the effectiveness of the reactive counteraction strategy are analyzed: the type of tactics used to correct negative attitudes, the characteristics of the source of misinformation about COVID-19, the structure of the refuting message, the frequency of repetition of misinformation, the time elapsed between its appearance and rebutting it, the degree and direction of the recipient's cognitive activity, his/her views and beliefs.

TI  - Molecular mechanisms of cancer metastasis via the lymphatic versus the blood vessels
T2  - CLINICAL & EXPERIMENTAL METASTASIS
M3  - Review
AB  - Cancer metastasis is the process by which primary cancer cells invade through the lymphatic or blood vessels to distant sites. The molecular mechanisms by which cancer cells spread either through the lymphatic versus blood vessels or both are not well established. Two major developments have helped us to understand the process more clearly. First, the development of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) concept which is well established in melanoma and breast cancer. The SLN is the first lymph node in the draining nodal basin to receive cancer cells. Patients with a negative SLN biopsy show a significantly lower incidence of distant metastasis, suggesting that the SLN may be the major gateway for cancer metastasis in these cancer types. Second, the discovery and characterization of several biomarkers including VEGF-C, LYVE-1, Podoplanin and Prox-1 have opened new vistas in the understanding of the induction of lymphangiogenesis by cancer cells. Cancer cells must complete multiple steps to invade the lymphatic system, some of which may be enabled by the evolution of new traits during cancer progression. Thus, cancer cells may spread initially through the main gateway of the SLN, from which evolving cancer clones can invade the blood vessels to distant sites. Cancer cells may also enter the blood vessels directly, bypassing the SLN to establish distant metastases. Future studies need to pinpoint the molecules that are used by cancer cells at different stages of metastasis via different routes so that specific therapies can be targeted against these molecules, with the goal of stopping or preventing cancer metastasis.

TI  - Analyzing the distribution and variation of Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) in the Yellow River Estuary (YRE) using Landsat 8 OLI
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Yellow River Estuary (YRE) as well as its adjacent coastal areas are famous for its high concentration of Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM). The distribution of SPM and its variations in the estuary area promoted the carbon, oxygen and nutrient cycles in coastal areas and nearby sea areas. This study took advantage of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (Landsat 8 OLI) data to estimate SPM in the YRE from 2013 to 2019. Remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) from Landsat 8 OLI bands has been proved to be effective through cross-validate with R-rs from Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) bands. A simple empirical algorithm (NIR band ratio green band and add red band) was developed to map the SPM distribution and concentration, with the Average Percentage Difference (APD) 33.12% and R-2 0.93 based on in-situ data. Annual average distribution of SPM shows that highly turbid areas with SPM greater than 10(3) mg/L are mostly found surrounding the estuary of Yellow River, in the northwest part of the Laizhou Bay and south part of Bohai bay. High variations of SPM distributions are consistent with high SPM, and vice versa. The influences of river runoff is mainly concentrated in the estuary area, and outside 4.5 km the variability of SPM effected by river discharge is not obvious. Significant difference is observed in seasonal SPM distribution. Higher SPM in winter is observed both in range and intensity compared to summer. Significant seasonal variations are mainly controlled by sediment resuspension processes driven by wind-wave forces. The results of this study indicate that Landsat8 OLI is an effective mean to retrieve SPM in YRE and its adjacent areas. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Intraoperative pathologically-calibrated diagnosis of lymph nodes involved by breast cancer cells based on electrical impedance spectroscopy; a prospective diagnostic human model study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Nodal status evaluation is a crucial step in determining prognostic factors and managing treatment strategies for breast cancer patients. Preoperative (CNB), intraoperative (SLNB), and even postoperative techniques (Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded sectioning, FFPE) have definite limitations of precision or sometimes are time-consuming for the result declaration. The primary purpose of this prospective study is to provide a precise complementary system for distinguishing lymph nodes (LNs) involved by cancerous cells in breast cancer patients intraoperatively.Methods: The proposed system, Electrical Lymph Scoring(ELS), is designed based on the dielectric properties of the under-test LNs. The system has a needle-shaped 2-electrode probe entered into SLNs or ALNs dissected from patients through standard surgical guidelines. Impedance magnitude in f = 1 kH (Z(1kHz)) and Impedance Phase Slope in frequency ranges of 100 kHz-500 kHz (IPS) were then extracted from the impedance spectroscopy data in a cohort study of 77 breast cancer patients(totally 282 dissected LNs) who had been undergone surgery before (n = 55) or after (n = 22) chemical therapies (non-neoadjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy). A new admittance parameter(Y-n') also proposed for LN detection in neoadjuvant chemotherapy patients.Results: Considering the permanent pathology result as the gold standard checked by two independent expert pathologists, a significant correlation was observed between the presence of cancerous cells in LNs and individual ranges of the ELS electrical responses. Compared with normal LNs containing fatty ambient and immune cells, LNs involved by cancerous clusters would reduce the Z(1kHz) and increase the IPS. These changes correlate with fat metabolism by cancer cells due to their Fatty Acid Oxidation (FAO) in LN, which results in different dielectric properties between high and low-fat content of normal and cancerous LNs, respectively.Conclusions: By finding the best correlation between our defined impedimetric parameters and pathological states of tested LNs, a real-time intraoperative detection approach was developed for highly-sensitive (92%, P<0.001) diagnosis of involved sentinel or axillary LNs. The impact of real-time intraoperative scoring of SLNs would make a pre-estimation about the necessity of excising further LNs to help the surgeon for less invasive surgery, especially in the absence of frozen-section equipment.

M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, forest habitats are threatened by human-induced deforestation and degradation. This study was aimed to assessing changes in land-use patterns in Awi Zone, Ethiopia, during the last 34 years and its relationship with land surface temperature (LST) and rainfall using digital change detection approaches. Multi-temporal Landsat imagery (1985, 2000, 2009, and 2019), MODIS, and CHIRPS were used in combination with Google Earth and field data for this study. Support vector machine classification technique was used to produce LULC maps. Mann-Kendall test for LST (2000-2019) and rainfall (1981-2019) was used to compute non-parametric trend analysis. Results revealed that 47,255.5 ha of forest and 24,674.9 ha of other land-cover types had increased from 1985 to 2019. In contrast, agriculture and bare land had decreased by 16,819.9 ha and 55,110.5 ha, respectively. In Dega agro-climatic zone, mean and minimum LST trend analysis has revealed a significant decrease. Sen's slope shows mean, minimum, and maximum LST decreasing trend at 0.13 degrees C/yr., 0.12 degrees C/yr. and 0.10 degrees C/yr., respectively. In Woyna Dega and Kolla, LST trend analysis showed decreasing and increasing trends from 2000 to 2019. Coefficient of determination (r(2)) of forest cover and mean LST for Dega, WoynaDega, and Kolla zones revealed 0.98, 0.81, and 0.20, respectively. Kolla is highly influenced by anthropogenic factors and rapid urbanization that caused depletion of forest cover and conversion of farmlands into human settlements. In future, community-based land-use and land-cover planning and sustainable forest management system are recommended to protect, conserve and rehabilitate the remaining natural environment in the study area.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Worldwide mining activities are one of the major anthropogenic activities that have caused high forest cover loss (FCL). In this study, we have quantified FCL in Odisha State due to mining activities analyzing Hansen Global Forest Change (HGFC) time series data for the period of 2001-2019 in Google Earth Engine platform. Our analysis suggests that Nabarangpur, Puri, Kendrapara, and Kalahandi districts lost more than 20% of their forest cover during this period. Rayagada and Koraput were the top two districts that recorded the highest FCL with mean change rates of 13.81 km(2)/year and 7.17 km(2)/year, respectively. The results point out that mining operations have grown in recent years in Odisha State, and the increase in these activities has contributed to the increase in FCL. This study offers a cost-effective methodology to monitor FCL in mining areas which will eventually contribute to the protection of forest biodiversity and forest dwelling tribal population.

TI  - Use of remotely sensed derived metrics to assess wetland vegetation responses to climate variability-induced drought at the Soetendalsvlei wetland system in the Heuningnes Catchment, Western Cape province, South Africa
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland vegetation plays an important role in the environmental functioning of wetlands through the provision of ecosystem services, such as food and critical habitat for organisms that live in or near water resources. The ecosystem services provided by wetland vegetation are facing several pressures due to the impacts of drought. Drought can induce significant declines in overall plant productivity and even lead to high rates of plant mortality. Therefore, assessing vegetation response to a drought is important for wetland assessment. In this study, the subtle changes in vegetation distribution were used as a proxy to examine and quantify the extent of drought impacts on the Soetendalsvlei wetland within the Heuningnes Catchment, South Africa. First, the vegetation health information was extracted by calculating the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) during the wet and dry seasons for the period between 2014 and 2018. The derived NDVI results were further statistically linked to the corresponding rainfall and evapotranspiration observed during the study period. An analysis of NDVI results revealed that gradual vegetation health change occurred across the study area. The highest derived NDVI (0.5) for wetland vegetation was observed during 2014, but progressively declined over the years. Change in vegetation health indicated a significant (r = 0.8-0.92) and positive correlation to the amount of rainfall received over the same period, whereas with evapotranspiration the relationships showed an opposite trend (r = -0.7 to -0.5). The results of this study highlight the importance of integrating remotely sensed data and climate variability information in assessing wetland vegetation seasonal and long-term variations. Such information can help in decision-making on the conservation of wetlands and effective monitoring of wetland ecosystems.

TI  - Accuracy analysis of remote sensing index enhancement for SVM salt inversion model
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate and rapid acquisition of the soil salt content and spatial distribution is of great significance for effectively monitoring cropland soil salinization. Using OLI/Landsat-8 images as data sources, shortwave infrared bands (SWIR1, SWIR2) are introduced to the traditional vegetation and salinity indices, and the enhanced indices are put forward to obtain an improved inversion effect. After enhancement, the correlation coefficient between the indices and soil salt content increased by 0.01-0.44, and the multicollinearity between indices significantly decreased. The prediction ability of the support vector machine salt inversion model improved from general to fairly good, and the predicted and measured values were close to a linear distribution. The predicted and measured values ranged from 0.39-36.38 g center dot kg(-1) and 0.35-38.09 g center dot kg(-1), respectively, and 63.25% of the regional salt status could be accurately predicted. The results showed that the accuracy of soil salinity inversion can be effectively enhanced by introducing shortwave infrared bands.

T2  - CHILD ABUSE & NEGLECT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Research indicates that a healthy cultural identity is associated with positive outcomes including increased self-esteem, academic achievement, and higher reports of satisfying family interactions. Objective: This retrospective study explored the experiences of intergenerational trauma, cultural connections, and identity among Indigenous former youth in child welfare care of the Ontario government. Participants and setting: Participants self-identified as Indigenous (First Nations, Status and nonStatus; Metis; Inuit), had a history of being in child welfare care and had never been adopted. Each participant in this research study reflected on the influence of intergenerational trauma and being in child welfare care in the development of their cultural identities. Methods: This study utilized a blend of traditional grounded theory, constructivist grounded theory, relational worldview model and a two-eyed seeing approach. Results: Overall findings indicate the importance of cultural connections, having a purpose and meaning in life that links to cultural identity and spirituality as critical elements in the pathways from trauma to well-being. These findings reflect Indigenous reclamations of traditional belief systems, practices, languages, and cultures in order to overcome personal experiences and problems. Conclusions: Many Indigenous communities are taking active steps to find children lost in the child welfare system, to care for these children, and to rekindle cultural identity for them. With the goals of healing, reconciliation and cultural restoration, it is imperative that child welfare agencies support the development of positive cultural identity, spirituality, and connection to cultural communities for Indigenous children, youth, and their families.

TI  - Spatial resolution, spectral metrics and biomass are key aspects in estimating plant species richness from spectral diversity in species-rich grasslands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing evidence suggests that remotely sensed spectral diversity is linked to plant species richness. However, a conflicting spectral diversity-biodiversity relationship in grasslands has been found in previous studies. In particular, it remains unclear how well the spectral diversity-biodiversity relationship holds in naturally assembled species-rich grasslands. To address the linkage between spectral diversity and plant species richness in a species-rich alpine grassland ecosystem, we investigated (i) the trade-off between spectral and spatial resolution in remote sensing data; (ii) the suitability of three different spectral metrics to describe spectral diversity (coefficient of variation, convex hull volume and spectral species richness) and (iii) the importance of confounding effects of live plant biomass, dead plant biomass and plant life forms on the spectral diversity-biodiversity relationship. We addressed these questions using remote sensing data collected with consumer-grade cameras with four spectral bands and 10 cm spatial resolution on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), airborne imaging spectrometer data (AVIRIS-NG) with 372 bands and 2.5 m spatial resolution, and a fused data product of both datasets. Our findings suggest that a fused dataset can cope with the requirement of both high spatial- and spectral resolution to remotely measure biodiversity. However, in contrast to several previous studies, we found a negative correlation between plant species richness and spectral metrics based on the spectral information content (i.e. spectral complexity). The spectral diversity calculated based on the spectral complexity was sensitive to live and dead plant biomass. Overall, our results suggest that remote sensing of plant species diversity requires a high spatial resolution, the use of classification-based spectral metrics, such as spectral species richness, and awareness of confounding factors (e.g. plant biomass), which may be ecosystem specific.

TI  - Concurrent Breast Carcinoma and Follicular Lymphoma: A Case Series
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Rare coexistence of disease or pathology Background: The incidence of multiple primaries in cancer patients is 2-17%. However, the synchronous co-occurrence of adenocarcinoma of the breast and follicular lymphoma is rare.Case Reports: We describe a case series of 3 post-menopausal women who presented to our institute with a breast lump. On further investigations, 2 of them had invasive ductal carcinoma and 1 had invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast. All 3 cancers were estrogen/progesterone receptor (ER/PR)-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2)-negative. During the staging PET scans, all 3 patients had increased FDG uptake in axillary, mesenteric, and inguinal lymph nodes, respectively, raising concerns for metastatic disease. However, subsequent biopsies revealed them as follicular lymphomas occurring as a second concurrent primary malignancy. All patients underwent radical mastectomies with sentinel lymph node dissection followed by chemotherapy and hormonal therapy. Most of the lymphomas were low grade, which the oncologist closely followed.Conclusions: Very few cases of breast cancer and follicular lymphoma co-occur; this is not limited to the axillary lymph nodes and can occur in any part of the lymphatic chain. Regional lymph node enlargement detected on examination or imaging does not always indicate metastasis. A high index of suspicion is needed followed by lymph node biopsy to rule out any second primary malignancy.

TI  - Drone measurements of surface-based winter temperature inversions in the High Arctic at Eureka
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The absence of sunlight during the winter in the High Arctic results in a strong surface-based atmospheric temperature inversion, especially during clear skies and light surface wind conditions. The inversion suppresses turbulent heat transfer between the ground and the boundary layer. As a result, the difference between the surface air temperature, measured at a height of 2 m, and the ground skin temperature can exceed several degrees Celsius. Such inversions occur very frequently in polar regions, are of interest to understand the mechanisms responsible for surface-atmosphere heat, mass, and momentum exchanges, and are critical for satellite validation studies.In this paper we present the results of operations of two commercial remotely piloted aircraft systems, or drones, at the Polar Environment Atmospheric Research Laboratory, Eureka, Nunavut, Canada, at 80 degrees N latitude. The drones are the Matrice 100 and Matrice 210 RTK quadcopters manufactured by DJI and were flown over Eureka during the February-March field campaigns in 2017 and 2020. They were equipped with a temperature measurement system built on a Raspberry Pi single-board computer, three platinum-wire temperature sensors, a Global Navigation Satellite System receiver, and a barometric altimeter.We demonstrate that the drones can be effectively used in the extremely challenging High Arctic conditions to measure vertical temperature profiles up to 75 m above the ground and sea ice surface at ambient temperatures down to -46 degrees C. Our results indicate that the inversion lapse rates within the 0-10 m altitude range above the ground can reach values of similar to 10-30 degrees C(100m)(-1) (similar to 100-300 degrees C km(-1)). The results are in good agreement with the coincident surface air temperatures measured at 2, 6, and 10 m levels at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration flux tower at the Polar Environment Atmospheric Research Laboratory. Above 10 m more gradual inversion with order-of-magnitude smaller lapse rates is recorded by the drone. This inversion lapse rate agrees well with the results obtained from the radiosonde temperature measurements. Above the sea ice drone temperature profiles are found to have an isothermal layer above a surface-based layer of instability, which is attributed to the heat flux through the sea ice. With the drones we were able to evaluate the influence of local topography on the surface-based inversion structure above the ground and to measure extremely cold temperatures of air that can pool in topographic depressions. The unique technical challenges of conducting drone campaigns in the winter High Arctic are highlighted in the paper.

TI  - A climatology of trade-wind cumulus cold pools and their link to mesoscale cloud organization
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a climatology of trade cumulus cold pools and their associated changes in surface weather, vertical velocity and cloudiness based on more than 10 years of in situ and remote sensing data from the Barbados Cloud Observatory. Cold pools are identified by abrupt drops in surface temperature, and the mesoscale organization pattern is classified by a neural network algorithm based on Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite 16 (GOES-16) Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) infrared images. We find cold pools to be ubiquitous in the winter trades - they are present about 7.8 % of the time and occur on 73 % of days. Cold pools with stronger temperature drops (Delta T) are associated with deeper clouds, stronger precipitation, downdrafts and humidity drops, stronger wind gusts and updrafts at the onset of their front, and larger cloud cover compared to weaker cold pools, which agrees well with the conceptual picture of cold pools. The rain duration in the front is the best predictor of Delta T and explains 36 % of its variability.The mesoscale organization pattern has a strong influence on the occurrence frequency of cold pools. Fish has the largest cold-pool fraction (12.8 % of the time), followed by Flowers and Gravel (9.9 % and 7.2 %) and lastly Sugar (1.6 %). Fish cold pools are also significantly stronger and longer-lasting compared to the other patterns, while Gravel cold pools are associated with significantly stronger updrafts and deeper cloud-top height maxima. The diel cycle of the occurrence frequency of Gravel, Flowers, and Fish can explain a large fraction of the diel cycle in the cold-pool occurrence as well as the pronounced extension of the diel cycle of shallow convection into the early afternoon by cold pools. Overall, we find cold-pool periods to be similar to 90 % cloudier relative to the average winter trades. Also, the wake of cold pools is characterized by above-average cloudiness, suggesting that mesoscale arcs enclosing broad clear-sky areas are an exception. A better understanding of how cold pools interact with and shape their environment could therefore be valuable to understand cloud cover variability in the trades.

TI  - Integrated approach for ocean data remote sensing with extensive ecological and earth system science learning
T2  - ANNALS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing pictures are more diversified, and individuals are paying greater attention to marine remote sense studies due to the fast advancement of remote sensing technology. However, due to the complexity of remote ocean data and the varied ocean environments, there is a difference in outcomes even if the same object is recognized in a different scenario. This work provides a pixel-level-based remote-sensing imaging approach (PLORSIA) combining global and regional characteristics to acquire more semantic information and improved pixel predictive capacities. The first is to extract texture, color characteristics, and spatial relationships. Secondly, the algorithm builds a multiresolution local method for cross-attention to get the data about the weight, and regional aspects of ocean remotely sensed pictures in multiple directions. Multiresolution local methods span a comprehensive range of algorithms, models, methods, and concepts. Central to the multiresolution method is somehow to express short-range, mid-range, and long-range relationships explicitly. A multiresolution global cross-attention method is now being developed to achieve global features with an approach. Then each subsystem describes the fusing of global characteristics and local characteristics to get additional depth. Multiresolution global cross-attention network to learn multi-layered depictions of vertices via a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and then match the short text snippet with the graphical depiction of the images with the attention mechanisms employed over each layer of the CNN. Lastly, distant ocean-sample sensing is presented via the prediction of the image of pixel level. Three available ocean remotely sensed datasets had tested using the method presented in this article. The empirical findings demonstrate that the PLORSIA process can draw characteristics from tiny samples of remotely sensed pictures from the marine. Furthermore, PLORSIA displays higher prediction skills compared with the forecast outcomes of other remote sensing data systems. The experimental findings show that the suggested model enhances the precision ratio of 93%, recall ratio of 93%, F-score ratio of 93.33%, and accuracy ratio of 90% compared to other existing methods.

TI  - Environmental regulation, economic development and air pollution in the cities of China: Spatial econometric analysis based on policy scoring and satellite data
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution has become a key problem to be solved in the process of sustainable development in China. Most existing research on environmental regulation has focused on one dimension or several aspects of environmental regulation. This paper quantitatively scored environmental policies in China from multiple dimensions to construct the index of environmental regulation and used a spatial econometric model and satellite-monitored PM2.5 data for 280 cities in 2002-2016 to analyze the effects of environmental regulation on city air pollution treatment in the country. The empirical results showed that (a) there was a significant positive correlation for the spatial distribution of air pollution in China (0.87 in 2007) and the current air pollution situation was susceptible to the effects of its previous (the time lag effect of urban air pollution in eastern China is the strongest, which was 0.347); (b) environmental regulation could significantly improve the air pollution situation in the cities of northern and eastern regions; (c) the decomposition of the spatial spillover effect confirmed the role of environmental regulation in improving air quality in the region or surrounding areas. (d) we found the inverted U-shaped relationship between city economic development and air pollution in southern cities, the environmental Kuznets curve was verified; In the future, breaking the "barriers" in pollution treatment between regions and strengthening regional conversation and cooperation are effective approaches to treating air pollution.

TI  - Time series and neural network to forecast water quality parameters using satellite data
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Complex and highly variable parameters of water quality are difficult to predict over time and space. In most cases, predictions of surface chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and sea surface temperature (SST) are based on coupled ecological-hydrodynamic modeling, which is driven by oceanic and climatic conditions. Since these models are complex, simpler and efficient methods of predictions are required. The objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of stochastic time series models - Seasonal Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) and nonlinear neural network (NN) - to predict Chl-a and SST in coastal areas. Additionally, this study examines the sensitivity of the aforementioned models with respect to variation in depth and changes in turbidity. The data used in this study are satellite-derived Chl-a and SST collected for the Arabian Gulf region for a period of 10 years. This region has been selected for the study due to pronounced variability in depth and changes in turbidity in its waters. As a result of this study, it has been shown that SARIMA and NN are able to forecast Chl-a and SST. In the deep & less turbid water, SARIMA and NN models (SARIMA/NN) produced Chl-a R-2:RMSE values of (0.5:0.6)/(0.37:0.53) and SST R-2 :RMSE (0.9:1.36)/(0.8:1.43). However, the NN has performed better than SARIMA in predicting Chl-a in turbid & shallow waters, especially when Chl-a concentrations are high (>2 mgm(-3)). Based on our analysis, we conclude that SARIMA and NN are capable of forecasting the future values of Chl-a and SST in regions with pre-existing knowledge of the water depth and turbidity.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node BIOPSY after neoadjuvant therapy in breast cancer patients with lymph node involvement at diagnosis. Could wire localization of clipped node improve our results?
T2  - SURGEON-JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL COLLEGES OF SURGEONS OF EDINBURGH AND IRELAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) after neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) in node -positive (N+) breast cancer patients at diagnosis remains a controversial issue, with no consensus on implementation or safety. Objectives: We sought to assess the accuracy of SLNB after NAT in biopsy-proven N+ cases at diagnosis and the efficacy and accuracy of wire localization of the clipped node to improve results. Material and methods: A cross-sectional diagnostic technique validation study in N+ pa-tients following NAT was performed. The biopsy-proven affected lymph node was clipped at diagnosis. SLNB and axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) were performed in cases of clinical-radiological lymph node response after NAT. For the purposes of our study we added wire localization of the clipped node. Results: 103 patients were included (mean age, 54.4 years [+/- 12.7]). Wire marking was performed in 28 cases. The overall identification rate (IR) of SLN was 81.6%. The median number of nodes removed was 2 (range 2). The overall false negative rate (FNR) was 6.1%. Sensitivity and overall accuracy were 93.9% and 95.2%, respectively (area under curve 0.97). In the double-marked (clip and wire) group the FNR decreased to 0% and accuracy was 100%. Axillary pathologic complete response was observed in 24.3% of cases. Conclusions: SLNB is useful in node-positive patients at diagnosis who respond to NAT. Combining this with preoperative wire localization of the biopsied lymph node reduces the FNR without increasing the number of complications.

TI  - Evaluation of high-resolution DEMs from satellite imagery for geomorphic applications: A case study using the SETSM algorithm
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) have revolutionized research in geomorphology by allowing for detailed quantitative analysis of Earth's surface. Satellite stereo images offer the promise of expanding the availability of high-resolution DEMs over broad areas, but rigorous evaluation of the scientific application of these datasets remains limited. In this study, we consider DEMs built using stereo pairs of high-resolution (0.5 m) satellite imagery and the open-source DEM extraction algorithm, Surface Extraction from TIN Space-search Minimization (SETSM). We selected locations across a range of landscapes to evaluate the application of these DEMs to geomorphic problems, with particular attention to hillslope analyses where high spatial resolution has been shown to be important for revealing topographic signatures of tectonic and environmental processes. We compared the quality of SETSM 2 m DEMs to LiDAR-derived DEMs and the widely available SRTM-30 m and ALOS-30 m DEMs by comparing the elevation data and derivative products (e.g., slope, aspect, and curvature). We found that SETSM DEMs performed noticeably better than SRTM and ALOS DEMs, but with systematic biases relative to LiDAR DEMs in regions with vegetation. Moreover, noise in the initial SETSM elevation data is amplified with every subsequent derivative, significantly decreasing quality. Finally, we evaluated the potential use of SETSM products for change detection. Applying DEM differencing to a major landslide, we found volume and sediment thickness from SETSM DEMs were similar to volumes and thicknesses from other studies. This example illustrates the capabilities of SETSM and other satellite-based stereo-photogrammetry for contributing to rapid response after natural disasters. Overall, we conclude that DEMs derived from satellite image stereo-photogrammetry can markedly improve on lower resolution global elevation data for terrain analysis and can open possibilities for change detection, but that care needs to be taken in their application especially in regions with significant vegetation.

TI  - Geo-CropSim: A Geo-spatial crop simulation modeling framework for regional scale crop yield and water use assessment
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing derived datasets (e.g. Leaf Area Index (LAO) are increasingly being used in process based cropping system models to improve the prediction skill of the simulations when implementing operationally at regional scale. However, challenges such as inadequate quality of the available remote sensing data products and high reliance of models on climate variables and their uncertainties still exist. To address these challenges, we developed Geo-CropSim, a spatial modeling framework to use high quality remote sensing products in the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) agroecosystem model to regulate simulated processes and improve predictions of crop yield and evapotranspiration. Geo-CropSim comprises three main features 1) pixel level model initialization using crop emergence dates; 2) ability of the EPIC model to read in the PROSAIL (i.e. combined PROSPECT leaf optical properties model and SAIL canopy bidirectional reflectance model) inversion-based crop type LAI; and 3) a stress adjustment function to regulate simulated stress using LAI anomalies. To understand its performance, we implemented it over the State of Nebraska to estimate corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max [Merr.]) yields and evapotranspiration (ET) for 2012 (drought year) and 2015 (normal year) at 500-m resolution. Results showed that emergence dates and seasonal LAI captured spatial and temporal differences in crop progression (e.g. delayed planting in 2015) and growth (e.g. declined LAI in 2012) driven by regional differences in crop management and weather conditions very well. These differences were reflected in Geo-CropSim yield estimates, and showed improved spatial and temporal details compared over those from EPIC simulations obtained without using remote sensing derived emergence and LAI. Results revealed that Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of Geo-CropSim yield estimates, computed based on USDA-NASS reported yields, were 18.85% and 1.22 Mg ha(-1) for corn, and 17.90% and 0.46 Mg ha(-1) for soybeans, respectively, which are substantially lower than those of original EPIC estimates (MAPE = 33.74% and RMSE = 2.18 Mg ha(-1) for corn; and MAPE = 40.71% and RMSE = 0.98 Mg ha(-1) for soybeans). Further, Geo-CropSim was able to capture ET and transpiration dynamics reasonably well (e.g. 10-12 % lower values for soybeans compared to corn values), and showed good agreement with flux measurements (i.e. R-2 values of 0.63 and 0.72, RMSE values of 29.88 and 33.41 mm, and MAPE values of 5.0% and 6.8% for corn and soybean, respectively). Overall, this study demonstrated that Geo-CropSim has considerable potential to serve as a reliable operational tool to assess crop yields and water use under various cropping systems and to help in regional yield monitoring and water resource management.

TI  - Land-cover changes and drivers of palm swamp degradation in southeastern Brazil from 1984 to 2018
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of increasing human and climatic changes has caused the degradation of wetlands across the globe. Understanding the causes such process is important as wetlands provide a variety of ecosystem services. In the present study, we analyzed land cover patterns in palm swamps and their areas of influence in 1984, 1994 and 2018 in southeastern Brazil. We identified potential drivers of palm swamp degradation using data obtained by remote sensing. We also evaluated whether changes in the surrounding area were correlated with the degradation within the palm swamps. In addition, we correlated the variations on surface temperature with the different levels of degradation of the palm swamps. Our results indicate that the palm swamps in the study region underwent temporal changes in land cover patterns, with an increase in degraded area from 1984 to 2018. We observed that the size and average slope of the palm swamp and the density of surrounding roads affected the proportion of degraded area. We also demonstrated that the surface temperature is a good proxy for estimating the environmental quality of palm swamps. Our assessment indicates that palm swamp degradation is a complex process that result from intertwined environmental, social, economic and political factors.

TI  - Spatial and seasonal variability of chlorophyll <i>a</i> in different-sized lakes across eastern China
T2  - INLAND WATERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll a (Chl-a) in lakes is an indicator of phytoplankton biomass and widely employed in lake management. Here, we used Chl-a data from 586 lakes >= 1 km(2) in eastern China from 2013 to 2018 derived from the Operational Land Imager (OLI) onboard the Landsat-8 satellite to examine influences of climatic and anthropogenic factors on Chl-a variations among these lakes, partitioned into groups of different sizes. The results indicate that Chl-a values in small lakes (1-50 km(2)) were higher than those in large lakes (>50 km(2)), and the mean Chl-a in summer and autumn was higher than in spring and winter. Air temperature was positively correlated with the seasonal mean Chl-a in all sizes of lakes. Small lakes had a larger cropland proportion in their watersheds than large lakes, suggesting that the higher cropland proportion of the land cover contributed to the high Chl-a of these lakes. This research highlights the merit of high spatial resolution remote sensing for monitoring lakes in a regional context and indicates that the management of lakes could benefit from controlling agricultural activities in their watersheds.

TI  - Patterns of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 carriers manifest multiscale association between urban landscape morphology and human activity
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The outbreak of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the drastic measures taken to mitigate its spread through imposed social distancing, have brought forward the need to better understand the underlying factors controlling spatial distribution of human activities promoting disease transmission. Focusing on results from 17,250 epidemiological investigations performed during early stages of the pandemic outbreak in Israel, we show that the distribution of carriers of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19, is spatially correlated with two satellite-derived surface metrics: night light intensity and landscape patchiness, the latter being a measure to the urban landscape's scale-dependent spatial heterogeneity. We find that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 carriers was significantly more likely to occur in "patchy" parts of the city, where the urban landscape is characterized by high levels of spatial heterogeneity at relatively small, tens of meters scales. We suggest that this spatial association reflects a scale-dependent constraint imposed by the city's morphology on the cumulative behavior of the people inhabiting it. The presented results shed light on the complex interrelationships between humans and the urban landscape in which they live and interact, and open new avenues for implementation of multi-satellite data in large scale modeling of phenomena centered in urban environments.

TI  - Remote sensing based forest canopy opening and their spatial representation
T2  - FOREST SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of remote sensing in natural resource management is an easily accessible input for obtaining detailed information on the ground and landscape. There is a wide range of procedures to analyze the forest canopy through satellite images. The purpose of this work is to obtain a map of forest opening with remote sensing by relating several vegetation indices, Kauth-Thomas transformation and texture filters, to a Landsat 8OLI image. A factor analysis was made to evaluate the contribution of these variable to identify the opening of the forest cover, yielding a sigma 2 - 76%. The results show that the Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), and brightness factor have the best correlation (0.225-0.216 component coefficient). The resulting model was reclassified into five categories of forest opening and associated with land use data from the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI-Mexico). Thus, 95% of human settlements have a canopy opening between medium and very high, the crops areas 72%, and the low deciduous forest with secondary shrub vegetation 100% of the opening. Coniferous and mixed forests have a low to very low canopy opening 46% and 55%, respectively of their surface. The forests with secondary vegetation, both shrub and arboreal, present greater openness than the same forests in the primary state. Verification of the spatial representation data of canopy opening was made by comparing 94 hemispheric photographs with 94 sites located in open areas obtaining an r 0.57. This work offers a simple and straightforward methodology, easily replicable in different types of vegetation using free satellite imagery. Hence, it is a helpful tool for decision-makers when considering the general status of conservation of forest systems and their spatial distribution.

TI  - Increase in irrigated wheat yield in north-west Mexico from 1960 to 2019: Unravelling the negative relationship to minimum temperature
T2  - FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This in-depth analysis of the rise in farm yield (FY) of irrigated wheat in the Yaqui Valley of north-west Mexico, from around 2 to 7 t/ha between 1960 and 2019, begins by highlighting a weather component overlooked in modelling and other thinking about wheat and climate change, namely the dominant role of natural annual variation in minimum temperature (Tmin). Year to year fluctuations around the increasing yield trend were substantial (st.dev. 591 kg/ha) and were highly correlated negatively with annual fluctuations in the average Tmin January to March (Tmin J-M) which ranged from 5.0 to 11.5 degrees C in this period lasting from mid tillering to early-mid grain fill. Dividing the 60-year period into three consecutive 20-year periods and using multiple linear regression improved the accuracy of estimates of FY as a linear function of time in each period (responding inter alia to better technology including breeding and agronomy), with slopes of 4.5%, 0.6%, and 1.8% p.a. for 1960-79, 1980-99, and 2000-19, respectively. Tmin J-M coefficients were -218, -413, -406 kg/ha/degrees C, or -5.9, -8.1, -6.6%/degrees C, respectively, with R-2 always close to 0.9. Combining results, the FY response to Tmin J-M was close to -7%/degrees C, such that over the 60-year period the Tmin J-M increase of 1.0 degrees C contributed a 7% reduction in FY at constant CO2. The improved estimate of FY slopes with respect to time revealed novel variation across the 60 year period to be dissected in a following paper. Annual fluctuations in Tmax J-M were not correlated with variation in Tmin J-M nor with variation in FY. Crop simulation modelling of potential yield (PY) corroborated the negative effect of increased Tmin J-M on yield and suggested that increased Tmin J-M primarily decreased days to anthesis, biomass and number of grains (/m2). Measurements retrieved from long term well-managed experiments in the Valley under constant agronomy and cultivars confirmed all the above predicted responses to Tmin J-M. Our results align with the few published studies increasing crop night temperature in the critical period of around 30 days up to the end of anthesis when grains/m(2), and hence yield, was inversely related to rate of development. In the Yaqui Valley this was strongly associated with Tmin variation. This phenomenon, and the roles of Tmax and solar radiation (Rs) variation, are discussed in detail.

TI  - Tracking vegetation degradation and recovery in multiple mining areas in Beijing, China, based on time-series Landsat imagery
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring of the vegetation change trajectory in mining areas is crucial to understand ecosystem degradation induced by mining activities and to evaluate the effectiveness of ecological restoration. Beijing, the capital of China, is rich in mineral resources and has had many small-scale mine sites. In this study, we aimed to propose a new method to automatically characterize vegetation degradation and recovery trajectory for multiple mine sites. First, the method constructs temporal composites of the Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI) on a pixel-by-pixel basis using Landsat satellite observations on the Google Earth Engine platform; second, the Pettitt test and Sen+Mann-Kendall analysis are used to identify the year of change and pre- and post-change trends; then, the time-series NDVI is classified into five vegetation trajectory types [recovery (R), degradation (D), degradation-recovery (D-R), recovery-degradation (R-D), and no change (NC)] and 13 subtypes; and finally, the recovery status of the mine sites is analyzed. The method was applied to track vegetation change in 500 mine sites in the Beijing mountainous area and compared to widely used the LandTrendr algorithm. The results showed that our method achieved satisfactory accuracies in trajectory type classification with an overall accuracy of 91.10%. The year of change detected by the Pettitt test was generally consistent with historical Google Earth high resolution imagery. Compared to the LandTrendr algorithm, our method yielded much less omission and commission errors of R, D, R-D, and D-R types and had better capability in identifying gradual recovery or degradation. As the method required few parameters, it is suitable for automatic trajectory monitoring of multiple mine sites. In the study area, 1469.07 ha out of 3746.25 ha of the mine sites have been recovered from 2000 to 2019. The recovery mainly occurred during 2009-2013, around the same time when the Green Mine Construction Campaign was launched in Beijing. 622.62 ha of the mine sites have experienced degradation probably due to illegal mining activities. Our results are expected to support evaluation of mine restoration effects and detection of illegal mine sites.

TI  - Effects of Management, Dietary Intake, and Genotype on Rumen Morphology, Fermentation, and Microbiota, and on Meat Quality in Yaks and Cattle
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NUTRITION
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditionally, yaks graze only natural grassland, even in harsh winters. Meat from grazing yaks is considered very healthy; however, feedlot fattening, which includes concentrate, has been introduced. We questioned whether this change in management and diet would have an impact on the rumen and meat quality of yaks. This study examined the morphology, fermentation, and microbiota of the rumen and the quality of meat of three groups of bovines: (1) grazing yaks (GYs, 4-year olds), without dietary supplements; (2) yaks (FYs, 2.5-year olds) feedlot-fattened for 5 months after grazing natural pasture; and (3) feedlot-fattened cattle (FC, Simmental, 2-year olds). This design allowed us to determine the role of diet (with and without concentrate) and genotype (yaks vs. cattle) on variables measured. Ruminal papillae surface area was greater in the FYs than in the GYs (P = 0.02), and ruminal microbial diversity was greater but richness was lesser in the GYs than in the FC and FYs. Concentrations of ruminal volatile fatty acids were greater in the yaks than in the cattle. In addition, both yak groups had higher protein and lower fat contents in meat than the FC. Meat of GY had a lower n6:n3 ratio than FY and FC, and was the only group with a ratio below r, which is recommended for healthy food. Essential amino acids (EAA), as a proportion of total AA and of non-essential AA of yak meat, met WHO criteria for healthy food; whereas FC did not.

TI  - Spatio-temporal effects of inundation and climate on vegetation greenness dynamics in dryland floodplains
T2  - ECOHYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring floodplain vegetation response to water availability is essential for sustainable water resource management. However, the interpretation of these responses through space and time has been challenging due to the limitation of satellite-derived inundation extent, which is restricted by the return period of imagery and prevalence of clouds affected images during high flow events. We address this issue by utilising a predictive inundation model capable of reporting inundation at daily temporal resolution. Spatio-temporal patterns in vegetation greenness of four floodplain vegetation communities (Eucalyptus camaldulensis, Eucalyptus largiflorens, Eucalyptus coolabah and Duma florulenta) were quantified using Landsat-derived vegetation index and a combination of time series of floodplain inundation pattern, rainfall and soil moisture for the years 1989-2016. The results show that vegetation dynamics were highly variable between years and are closely associated with irregular rainfall patterns and overbank flooding. Linear mixed-effect models explained between 38% and 67% of the variability in vegetation productivity, with all involved variables being significant predictors (p < 0.05). The effects of rainfall, soil moisture and inundation were diverse and depended on vegetation type. Higher inundation frequency and low interflood period often corresponded to lower vegetation responses, which may relate to a mixed surface water and vegetation signal, or a short-term inhibitive effect of surface water on growth. These results highlight the importance of groundwater and lagged effects of rainfall and flow in explaining patterns of vegetation condition in semi-arid floodplains and should be considered in the design of environmental water monitoring programmes.

TI  - Comparison of Clinical Characteristics for Distinguishing COVID-19 From Influenza During the Early Stages in Guangdong, China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: To explore the differences in clinical manifestations and infection marker determination for early diagnosis of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) and influenza (A and B).Methods: A hospital-based retrospective cohort study was designed. Patients with COVID-19 and inpatients with influenza at a sentinel surveillance hospital were recruited. Demographic data, medical history, laboratory findings, and radiographic characteristics were summarized and compared between the two groups. The chi-square test or Fisher's exact test was used for categorical variables, and Kruskal-Wallis H-test was used for continuous variables in each group. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was used to differentiate the intergroup characteristics. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to analyze the predisposing factors.Results: About 23 patients with COVID-19 and 74 patients with influenza were included in this study. Patients with influenza exhibited more symptoms of cough and sputum production than COVID-19 (p < 0.05). CT showed that consolidation and pleural effusion were more common in influenza than COVID-19 (p < 0.05). Subgroup analysis showed that patients with influenza had high values of infection and coagulation function markers, but low values of blood routine and biochemical test markers than patients with COVID-19 (mild or moderate groups) (p < 0.05). In patients with COVID-19, the ROC analysis showed positive predictions of albumin and hematocrit, but negative predictions of C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (HBDH), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Multivariate analysis revealed that influenza might associate with risk of elevated CRP, PCT, and LDH, whereas COVID-19 might associated with high HBDH.Conclusion: Patients with influenza had more obvious clinical symptoms but less common consolidation lesions and pleural effusion than those with COVID-19. These findings suggested that influenza likely presents with stronger inflammatory reactions than COVID-19, which provides some insights into the pathogenesis of these two contagious respiratory illnesses.

TI  - 15-year variability of desert dust optical depth on global and regional scales
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to investigate global, regional and seasonal temporal dust changes as well as the effect of dust particles on total aerosol loading using the ModIs Dust AeroSol (MIDAS) fine-resolution dataset. MIDAS delivers dust optical depth (DOD) at fine spatial resolution (0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees) spanning from 2003 to 2017. Within this study period, the dust burden increased across the central Sahara (up to 0.023 yr(-1)) and Arabian Peninsula (up to 0.024 yr(-1)). Both regions observed their highest seasonal trends in summer (up to 0.031 yr(-1)). On the other hand, declining DOD trends are encountered in the western (down to -0.015 yr(-1)) and eastern (down to -0.023 yr(-1)) Sahara, the Bodele Depression (down to -0.021 yr(-1)), the Thar (down to -0.017 yr(-1)) and Gobi (down to -0.011 yr(-1)) deserts, and the Mediterranean Basin (down to -0.009 yr(-1)). In spring, the most negative seasonal trends are recorded in the Bodele Depression (down to -0.038 yr(-1)) and Gobi Desert (down to -0.023 yr(-1)), whereas they are in the western (down to -0.028 yr(-1)) and the eastern Sahara (down to -0.020 yr(-1)) and the Thar Desert (down to -0.047 yr(-1)) in summer. Over the western and eastern sector of the Mediterranean Basin, the most negative seasonal trends are computed at summer (down to -0.010 yr(-1)) and spring (down to -0.006 yr(-1)), respectively. The effect of DOD on the total aerosol optical depth (AOD) change is determined by calculating the DODto-AOD trend ratio. Over the Sahara the median ratio values range from 0.83 to 0.95, whereas in other dust-affected areas (Arabian Peninsula, southern Mediterranean, Thar and Gobi deserts) the ratio value is approximately 0.6. In addition, a comprehensive analysis of the factors affecting the sign, the magnitude and the statistical significance of the calculated trends is conducted. Firstly, the implications of the implementation of the geometric mean instead of the arithmetic mean for trend calculations are discussed, revealing that the arithmetic-based trends tend to overestimate compared to the geometric-based trends over both land and ocean. Secondly, an analysis interpreting the differences in trend calculations under different spatial resolutions (fine and coarse) and time intervals is conducted.

TI  - Mapping of Winter Wheat Using Sentinel-2 NDVI Data. A Case of Mashonaland Central Province in Zimbabwe
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - A robust early warning system can alert to the presence of food crises and related drivers, informing decision makers on food security. To date, decision-makers in Zimbabwe still rely on agriculture extension personnel to generate information on wheat production and monitor the crop. Such traditional methods are subjective, costly and their accuracy depends on the experience of the assessor. This study investigates Sentinel-2 NDVI and time series utility as a wheat-monitoring tool over the wheat-growing areas of Zimbabwe's Bindura, Shamva, and Guruve districts. NDVI was used to classify and map the wheat fields. The classification model's evaluation was done by creating 100 reference pixels across the classified map and constructing a confusion matrix with a resultant kappa coefficient of 0.89. A sensitivity test, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and area under the curve (AUC) were used to measure the model's efficiency. Fifty GPS points randomly collected from wheat fields in the selected districts were used to identify and compute the area of the fields. The correlation between the area declared by farmers and the calculated area was positive, with an R-2 value of 0.98 and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 2.23 hectares. The study concluded that NDVI is a good index for estimating the area under wheat. In this regard, NDVI can be used for early warning and early action, especially in monitoring programs like 'Command Agriculture' in Zimbabwe. In current and future studies, the use of high-resolution images from remote sensing is essential. Furthermore, ground truthing is always important to validate results from remote sensing at any spatial scale.

TI  - Rotavirus infection among children under five years of age hospitalized with acute gastroenteritis in Myanmar during 2018-2020-Multicentre surveillance before rotavirus vaccine introduction
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Rotavirus gastroenteritis (RVGE) is a leading cause of severe diarrhea in children under-five worldwide, with the majority of mortality in lower-income countries. This study aimed to provide baseline information on epidemiology of rotavirus and circulating strains before rotavirus vaccine introduction in Myanmar.Methods: Hospital-based, prospective surveillance was conducted from May 2018 to January 2020 at four sentinel sites; two hospitals in Lower Myanmar, one hospital each in Middle Myanmar and East Myanmar. Children under five years of age hospitalized for acute gastroenteritis were enrolled; demographic and clinical data were collected. Stool samples were screened by ELISA (ProSpecT (TM) Rotavirus, OXOID-UK) for rotavirus antigen and a subset of ELISA positive samples were genotyped by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.Results: Rotavirus was detected in 45.7% (799/1750) of cases enrolled at three sites in May 2018-April 2019 and 42.5% (521/1227) at four sites in May 2019-January 2020. RVGE cases were predominantly male (58.7%; 775/1320) and 92.6% (1223/1320) of RVGE cases occurred in <2 years old. Rotavirus detection was higher in the cold and dry season (November-April). RVGE compared to non-RVGE cases had more frequent vomiting (78.3% Vs 68.1%, p < 0.01), fever (65.8% Vs 61.3%, p = 0.01), severe dehydration (3.6% Vs 2.1%, p < 0.01) and requirement of treatment by IV fluid (58.3% Vs 53.1%, p < 0.01). The most prevalent genotypes identified were G1P[6] (113/359, 31.5%), G1P[8] (94/359, 26.2%) and G2P[4] (33/359, 9.2%).Conclusions: This study confirms the persistent high prevalence of RVGE among children under-five admitted to hospitals in different parts of Myanmar and the diversity of rotavirus strains over time prior to vaccine introduction. The rotavirus vaccine was introduced nationwide in February 2020 in Myanmar and these data will be important baseline data for post-vaccination monitoring of vaccine impact and circulating strains.

TI  - A Method to Identify <i>Dacrydium pierrei</i> Hickel Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Multi-source Remote Sensing Data in a Chinese Tropical Rainforest
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying special species in tropical forests is an important topic in forest resource management, and the use of a single type of remote sensing data for identification of species has limited accuracy. To analyze the ability of various unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing data for identifying target species, this study used three types of UAV remote sensing data (light detection and ranging (LiDAR), red, green, blue (RGB), and multispectral) to identify Dacrydium pierrei Hickel (D. pierrei) in Chinese tropical forests. The study compared the effects of using various combinations of UAV remote sensing data on the accuracy of D. pierrei identification and identified the optimal combination. (1) Random forest feature selection improved the accuracy of identification of D. pierrei by UAV multiple source remote sensing data: The producer accuracy (PA) was increased up to by 4.62%. (2) The following eight features were most useful for identifying D. pierrei: four features from multispectral images (DR_Standard, RE_Standard, DR_Mean, and B_Brightne), two features from RGB images (B_Standard and B_Mean), and two features from LiDAR images (INT_kurtosis and INT_aad). (3) Combining remote sensing data by integrating up to three types of data sources improved the accuracy of D. pierrei identification. When using a single type of remote sensing data, multispectral data gave the highest identification accuracy. When combining two types of remote sensing data, RGB and multispectral data achieved the best overall effect, and the highest overall identification accuracy, of more than 90%, was obtained by combining three types of remote sensing data.

TI  - Comparing vegetation indices from Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 under different vegetation gradients based on a controlled grazing experiment
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Grasslands contribute considerably to the global carbon cycle and livestock production. However, many of the world grasslands suffer from degradation caused mainly by overgrazing. Remote sensing methods are effective tools for monitoring and estimating grassland vegetation parameters. In this study, we compared the performance of vegetation indices (VIs) obtained from two different sensors to estimate grassland vegetation parameters under different vegetation and soil conditions based on typical grassland biomass gradients formed by longterm controlled grazing experiments. Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 were selected as data sources to estimate two vegetation parameters, fresh aboveground biomass (AGB) and leaf area index (LAI). Field-measured fresh AGB and LAI data were collected from experimental grasslands with different grazing intensities (GI) in Hulunber, Inner Mongolia, China in 2019. Univariate linear mixed models were established between VIs and field measurements, and grazing intensities were considered as random factors. The results confirmed that vegetation parameters (AGB and LAI) and VIs decreased with increasing GI; however, the decreasing trend was insignificant when the GI exceeded 0.69 Au/ha. VIs derived from Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 estimated fresh AGB and LAI at 80% accuracy. Sentinel-2 derived VIs yielded higher predictive accuracy than Landsat 8 for both fresh AGB and LAI. Comparing with the other VI inversion models, the normalised difference phenology index derived from Sentinel-2 images estimated the vegetation parameters the most effectively and accurately, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.625 and relative root mean square error (RMSE%) of 18.105% for fresh AGB estimation and R2 of 0.559 and RMSE% of 14.953% for LAI estimation.

TI  - Woody species diversity and land-use change legacy: Dataset across Uruguay
T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
M3  - Article
AB  - The presented datasets relate to the research article entitled "Beyond the boundaries: Do spatio-temporal trajectories of land-use change and cross boundary effects shape the diversity of woody species in Uruguayan native forests?"[Ramirez and Saumel 10.1016/j.agee.2021.107646]. The datasets include field survey data on woody species diversity from 32 permanent plots of native forests across the Oriental Republic of Uruguay (South America). Based on land-use maps created with Landsat images we analysed the changes of percentage of cover, the landscape shape index and aggregation index of the different land-use types (i.e., native forest, grassland, timber plantation and crops) in a buffer of 3 km from the central point of each plot. Datasets were produced using ArcGIS and different R and Fragstat packages. Data on woody species diversity, land-use change history inform landscape planning, land-use management, policy and governance and can be used for further meta-analysis with other local, regional or global data sets.

TI  - Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis identifies microplastics in stranded common dolphins <i>(Delphinus delphis)</i> from New Zealand waters
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Here we provide a first assessment of microplastics (MPs) in stomach contents of 15 common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) from both single and mass stranding events along the New Zealand coast between 2019 and 2020. MPs were observed in all examined individuals, with an average of 7.8 pieces per stomach. Most MPs were fragments (77%, n = 90) as opposed to fibres (23%, n = 27), with translucent/clear (46%) the most prevalent colour. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy revealed polyethylene terephthalate (65%) as the most predominant polymer in fibres, whereas polypropylene (31%) and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (20%) were more frequently recorded as fragments. Mean fragment and fibre size was 584 mu m and 1567 mu m, respectively. No correlation between total number of MPs and biological parameters (total body length, age, sexual maturity, axillary girth, or blubber thickness) was observed, with similar levels of MPs observed between each of the mass stranding events. Considering MPs are being increasingly linked to a wide range of deleterious effects across taxa, these findings in a typically pelagic marine sentinel species warrants further investigation.

TI  - Modeling salinized wasteland using remote sensing with the integration of decision tree and multiple validation approaches in Hetao irrigation district of China
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - The salinized wasteland (SW) is a buffer zone to accumulate salt introduced from irrigation water in salinized irrigation districts. It is crucial to identify the locations and sizes of SW to achieve effective land management and reclamation, as well as agricultural sustainable development. However, the SW is less explored due to the lack of low-cost and effective techniques. In this study, a decision tree-based remote sensing model was proposed to distinguished SW from other land types using the high-resolution Gaofen-1 (GF-1) images in the Hetao Irrigation District of China during 2017-2020. Meanwhile, multiple validation approaches including points (field and random points) and area (small and medium-sized SWs, i.e., SWA, SWB) matching validations were adopted. To establish the model of SW, four spectral indices including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), and Salinity Index (SI), as well as a series of multi-period and multi-year remote sensing images were used. The threshold values of the four spectral indices were determined based on the probability density curve. The SW remote sensing model was highly accurate and reliable. The average producer accuracy (PA) and average user accuracy (UA) were respectively 88.0% and 81.6% for field investigation (field points matching validation), and 85.9% and 80.1% for Google Earth image investigation (random points matching validation). Besides, the average overlapping rate and misclassification rate were respectively 95.6% and 2.3% for small-sized typical SWs (area validation), and 92.9% and 4.7% for medium-sized typical SWs during 2017-2020. The model indicated that the SW area in the region was respectively 9969, 9694, 9660, and 9608 ha from 2017 to 2020. The area of small and medium-sized SWs decreased with time, while that of large-sized SWs was the opposite.

TI  - Compiling a high-resolution country-level ecosystem map to support environmental policy: methodological challenges and solutions from Hungary
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution ecosystem maps increase the efficiency of policy implementation. However, due to challenges related to both data and methods, such maps of appropriate scale and quality are still rarely available for nationwide analyses. We present solutions to some typical challenges of national-scale ecosystem mapping through the new Ecosystem Map of Hungary. It is a comprehensive, spatially and thematically detailed map with a hierarchical typology. The mapping methodology combined several novel elements from the integration of various large-scale databases in a (theoretical) data cube to the use of image-based predictive mapping (with a Random Forest classifier, using Sentinel-1 and -2 and environmental data). A participatory method involving local experts was used for validation, addressing the lack of suitable reference data as well as improving map-maker and map-user interaction. Besides the original objective of supporting conservation-related decision-making, further uses emerged from a variety of fields including spatial planning, education and recreation.

TI  - Remote sensing-derived bioclimatic variables for modeling invasive <i>Prosopis juliflora</i> distribution in a region of limited meteorological stations
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate modeling of invasive species in areas of limited distribution of meteorological stations is challenging. In this regard, climate records from satellites are good alternatives. However, the accuracy of these datasets needs to be validated and their performance should be evaluated. Hence, this study aimed at evaluating the performance of four satellite-derived bioclimatic variables for modeling invasive Prosopis juliflora distribution in the dryland ecosystem of Ethiopia. Accordingly, WorldClim1.4 bioclimatic variables were used as a baseline to evaluate their performance, while, gauge-derived bioclimatic variables were used to validate all tested datasets. A total of 240 species occurrence and absence points were used to train and test the performance of all models using the Random Forest algorithm. Accordingly, satellite-derived bioclimatic variables provide better performance with an area under the curve of 0.64 and true skill statistics of 0.4 compared to a reanalysis and WorldClim1.4 derived bioclimatic variables. However, the lower performance of satellite datasets indicates the importance of its integration with other variables.

TI  - Estimation of land surface temperature in response to land use/land cover transformation in Kolkata city and its suburban area, India
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF URBAN SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The land transformation in Kolkata city and its suburban area is mainly due to intensive population pressure and rapid urban sprawling. Consequently, the land surface temperature (LST) is continuously increasing and gradually intensifying the effects of the urban heat island. The aim of this study is to assess the spatiotemporal variation of LST in response to land use land cover change (LULC) during 1995-2020. The maximum likelihood classifier was used for the supervised classification of LULC and the accuracy assessment was done using the confusion matrix. Quin's Mono-window algorithms for Landsat TM data of 1995 and 2010 and split-window algorithms for Landsat 8 OLI data of 2020 were applied to retrieve LST. Several spectral indices such as Normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and Modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) were calibrated and pixel-specific overlay analysis was done for correlation study between spectral indices and LST. This work revealed that the rapid urban sprawling causes massive land transformation in the study area. The land conversions from trees outside forests (TOF) and agricultural land to built-up were significantly contributing to an overall increase in the mean LST during 1995-2020. The mean LST was comparatively high over Kolkata city than its suburban area. During 1995-2020, the mean LST was increased by nearly 8.43 degrees C in the summer season and 4.32 degrees C in the winter season. The increasing rate of LST was found relatively high over the built-up (7.06 degrees C), agricultural land without crop (5.55 degrees C), and open land (5.54 degrees C). However, it was comparatively low over TOF (4.66 degrees C) and water bodies (3.68 degrees C). The LST was positively correlated to NDBI and negatively correlated to NDVI and MNDWI. In order to combat urban warming, this study will promote green city initiatives through sustainable land use planning.

TI  - Improving forest detection with machine learning in remote sensing data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest detection in remote sensing data is essential for important applications such as detection of area desertification, flooding simulation, forest health analysis, or conversion of digital elevation models. Existing techniques have open issues: they do not generalize well to different scenarios, they lack accuracy, and they require human intervention for input data characterization. To address these issues, in this work, we developed various classification models by using a variety of Machine Learning techniques, namely Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Random Forest ensembles (RF), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Different CNN architectures were created specifically for the forest detection problem, and alternative feature extraction mechanisms were developed to support RF and SVM for this task. All these models were trained with SRTM and Landsat-8 satellite data, and their hyperparameters were optimized. Their effectiveness was assessed by using the Forest/No-Forest masks provided by JAXA as ground truth. Additionally, these models were compared against the JAXA's mask itself using expert-labeled data as ground truth. The experiments show promising results in terms of accuracy and generalization while presenting a reduced dependency on human intervention for characterizing data in both training and classification phases.

TI  - The July Effect in Podiatric Medicine and Surgery Residency
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOOT & ANKLE SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - ABS T R A C T The period when medical students begin residency in teaching hospitals throughout the United States heralds a period known in the medical community as the "July Effect." Though several sentinel studies associated this time-frame with an increase in medical errors, residencies since demystified this phenomenon within their respective specialty. This study aims to evaluate the presence of the July Effect in a podiatric medicine and surgery residency program. A retrospective chart review was conducted, comparing patient demographics and surgical outcomes including length of stay, operative time and readmission rate between the first (July, August, September) and fourth (April, May June) quarters of the academic year from 2014-2019. A total of 206 patients met the inclusion criteria, where 99 received care in the first, resident-naive, quarter and 107 received care in the fourth, resident-experienced, quarter. No difference in patient demographics including sex, body mass index, or comorbidity index was appreciated between both quarters (p<0.05). Those patients who underwent soft tissue and bone debride-ments, digital, forefoot, midfoot and rearfoot amputations experienced no statistically significant difference in length of stay, operative time, or readmission rate between both quarters (p<0.05). The results of this study did not support the presence of the July Effect in our foot and ankle surgery residency. Future studies can further explore this phenomenon by examining patients admitted following traumatic injury or elective procedures. Moreover, this study shows the curriculum employed at our program provides sufficient support, guidance, and resources to limit errors attributed to the July Effect.

TI  - Using multimodal remote sensing data to estimate regional-scale soil moisture content: A case study of Beijing, China
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - An accurate regional estimate of soil moisture content (SMC) is important for water management and drought monitoring. Traditional ground measurement methods of SMC are limited by the disadvantages of high cost and small scale. The development of remote sensing (RS) technology provides a cost-effective tool for estimating SMC at regional scale. However, the estimation of SMC by using the combination of multiple sensors has yet to be thoroughly discussed. Furthermore, the way in which vegetation types, fraction of vegetation coverage (FVC) and soil layer depth affect the SMC-estimation performance remains unclear. Therefore, the objectives in this study are to (1) evaluate the SMC-estimation performance provided by Landsat-8 data and random forest regression (RFR) algorithm; (2) discuss the accuracy of RS-based method for SMC estimation at different soil layer depths, and (3) explore how vegetation types and FVC affect the performance of SMC-estimation. The results can be summarized as: (1) the SMC estimation performance of multispectral (MS)- and thermal infrared (TIR)-based indices single used were comparable, in which TIR-based indices performed better in shallow soil layer while MS-based indices performed better in deep soil layer. Generally, MS- and TIR-based indices jointly used outperformed the index single used. (2) the accuracy of the proposed method for estimating SMC decreased with soil depth. (3) the proposed method performed greatest in grassland with relatively low height among the three vegetation types. Moreover, the SMC estimation in moderate vegetation coverage (FVC ranged from 0.3 to 0.5) was best. These results indicate that RS-based multimodal data combined with RFR could provide relatively repeatable and accurate SMC estimation. This approach can thus be used for the regional SMC monitoring and water resources management.

TI  - Fragile areas of soil organic carbon mineralization in western Patagonia (Chile) according to global increasing temperature
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Patagonia region encompasses pristine ecosystems developed under cold climates. The effect of global warming in the region has not been fully assessed. The objective of this study was to identify susceptible areas to an increase in temperature affecting soil organic carbon mineralization and therefore carbon dioxide emissions. Soil carbon stocks were inferred from land use data obtained from the regional inventory, and regional temperatures were analyzed using Terra moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer images in PCI-Geomatica and Idrisi-Selva softwares. Temperature data (monthly, 2000-2012) were classified as: below 1 degrees C, 1-4 degrees C, > 4-10 degrees C, >10-20 degrees C and > 20 degrees C. Areas of fragility to soil C mineralization were classified according to the potential response of soil biological activity to the temperature (at 4 degrees C threshold). The classes analyzed were classified as Fragile-1, being colder and more responsive than Fragile-2 and Fragile-3 categories. Areas of first concern fragility to carbon decomposition occupied around 145,750 ha, representing about 1% of the natural ecosystems of the region. Over 60% of these areas are covered by peatlands. Projections indicate that these fragile ecosystems will be subjected to temperature increases of 1.0 to 1.5 degrees C in the medium term and to 1.5 to 2.0 degrees C in the long term, respectively, in the scenario RCP-4.5 of climate change. Under a more severe scenario (RCP-8.5), temperatures will rise + 0.5 degrees C over the RCP-4.5. The information provided here will address future research and support policy making decisions for the region.

TI  - Large wildfire driven increases in nighttime fire activity observed across CONUS from 2003-2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the ecological and socioeconomic impacts of wildfires, little attention has been paid to the spatiotemporal patterns of nighttime fire activity across the conterminous United States (CONUS). Daytime fire radiative power (FRP) detected by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) was nearly evenly split (54% vs. 46%) between inside and outside wildfires from 2003 to 2020. In contrast, 94% of nighttime FRP was detected within wildfires, of which 95% was detected within large wildfires (> 2023 ha). Nighttime proportions (i.e., the proportion of total summed FRP detected by MODIS at night) were lowest (3%) outside wildfires when coincident 1000-hr fuel moistures were highest and vegetation fires were smaller and less intense. As 1000-hr fuel moistures decreased, MODIS active fire pixels shifted out of agricultural and prescribed fires and into wildfires with higher nighttime per-pixel values of FRP such that nighttime proportions peaked at 29% for the largest wildfires. Increases in nighttime proportions within larger wildfires were attributed to increases in nighttime persistence whereby under the driest conditions, daytime fire activity detected by MODIS was more likely to continue burning with sufficient vigour to be detected again at night. From 2003-2020, MODIS detected significant (p < 0.01) increasing trends in nighttime wildfire fire activity, with a +54%, +42% and +21% increase in the annual nighttime sum of FRP, annual nighttime active fire pixel counts and annual mean nighttime per-pixel values of FRP, respectively, detected in the latter half of the study period. Nighttime trends were corroborated using observations from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) as well annual wildfire statistics reported by U.S. federal, state and local agencies. Moreover, MODIS detected a significant positive trend in the nighttime proportion of FRP emitted from wildfires, indicating that in the absence of diurnal differences in detection biases, increases in nighttime fire activity since 2003 have outpaced daytime increases. However an analysis of MODIS omission rates revealed that increasing nighttime proportions were at least partially attributed to a relatively greater improvement in nighttime detection performance compared to the daytime for larger wildfires burning during drier conditions. Nighttime fire activity already poses additional risks to firefighters and communities, and this work suggests that projected increases in the frequency of large wildfires will be accompanied by increases in the extent and intensity of nighttime fire activity.

TI  - International geological significance of the potential Al-Medina volcanic UNESCO Global Geopark Project in Saudi Arabia revealed from multi-satellite remote sensing data
T2  - HERITAGE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - UNESCO Global Geoparks should be of international geological significance in terms of their scientific quality, rarity, aesthetic appeal and tourism value. At least nine Cenozoic volcanic fields are developed in the western Saudi Arabia, with a total area of 180,000 km(2). In this paper, the geological and geomorphological features of these volcanic fields induced by the expansion of the Red Sea are interpreted and displayed using multi-source satellite images, such as Landsat-8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) and Gaofen-2 data. Our results show that the Al-Medina volcanic field (AMVF) has great prospects as the aspiring volcanic Geopark in Saudi Arabia. This study indicates that: (1) AMVF has international geoscientific significance and rare natural attribute because the volcanic fields are induced by the rising mantle plume and rare examples of white volcanoes comprised mainly from felsic rock; (2) AMVF has abundant volcanic landscapes, including completely preserved cones and craters and multi-phase lava flows from different eruption stages, which have great aesthetic appreciation and tourism values to attract the general public; (3) AMVF is close to the second holy city of Islam-Medina, which has convenient transportation and is suitable to develop tourism to promote the development of the local economy; (4) AMVF had erupted repeatedly (the latest eruption was in 1256 AD), establishment of the UNESCO Global Geopark Project can not only prevent potential geological hazard risks to the people living in Medina city from future volcanic eruption events, but also provide better protection and conservation to geoheritage sites being damaged by human activities, for example setting protected boundaries of AMVF to avoid the destruction of volcanic landscape integrity caused by urban expansion.

TI  - Artificial intelligence associated with Sentinel-2 data in predicting commercial volume in Brazilian Amazon Forest
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest inventory and monitoring is normally carried out based on field measurements of biophysical attributes such as diameter, height, and the number of trees, which is a labor, time, and money consuming activity. Satellite data associated with artificial intelligence tools are alternative approaches to estimate forest parameters at large scales. We assessed correlation of forest variables measured in the field with different vegetation indices (VIs) (normalized difference vegetation index, soil adjusted vegetation index, modified soil adjusted vegetation index, enhanced vegetation index, and enhanced vegetation index adjusted 2.2), retrieved from Sentinel-2 imagery to predict the volume of commercial trees (VCC) showing a minimum commercial diameter (MCD) >= 50 cm in a sustainable forest management plan in the Brazilian Amazon region. A total of 150 artificial neural networks (ANNs) of the multilayer perception type were trained and supervised. Subsequently, the five best-performing networks were retained based on the fit and accuracy statistics. The ANN-1 showed the best statistical results [root-mean-square error <10% and correlation coefficient (r) > 0.98] to predict the VCC using as input variables the number of trees per hectare showing MCD >= 50 cm and all tested VIs. Our study shows promising results that may contribute to improving forest management planning at large scales in remote areas in tropical regions.

TI  - Assessment of air pollution at Greater Cairo in relation to the spatial variability of surface urban heat island
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Greater Cairo, Egypt, which lies in the apex of the Nile Delta, is one of the most populated regions in the world. Air pollution is a profound environmental issue prevailing in the urban/rural landscapes of this crowded megacity. The objectives of the present study were to utilize remotely sensed data in order to address the seasonal variations of the nocturnal surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII) as extracted from the American Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite and the related seasonal distribution of selected air pollutants, including nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2), and carbon monoxide (CO) as extracted from the European TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) for the period from 2018 to 2021. It is observed that there is clear nocturnal urban heat island over Greater Cairo, particularly at the administrative districts dominated by urban land use with high density of population and at the industrial and power generation locations. The highest SUHII is observed during winter. On the other hand, the selected pollutants also represent an urban pollution island (UPI) capping the regions of high SUHII. At the seasonal level, the highest NO2 correlation with the SUHII occurs during spring (R-2 = 0.59), while the CO correlates maximum during winter (R-2 = 0.51). Nonetheless, the seasonal SO2 distribution is poorly related to the SUHII as this specific pollutant is significantly associated with the industrial land use. Climatic and topographic factors could intensify the distribution of air pollution in the study area. Results of this study demonstrate the significance of geospatial technology tools in the subtle analysis and addressing regional air pollution. The outputs are also of a paramount implication on the management of urban environment and the adaptation of urban air quality.

TI  - Application of textural analysis to map the sea ice concentration with sentinel 1A in the western region of the Antarctic Peninsula
T2  - POLAR SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This article proposes the mapping of the concentration of sea ice in the oceanic region of the western Antarctic Peninsula using backscatter coefficients and textural features from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) C-band, horizontal single polarization (HH) images obtained by the Sentinel 1 A satellite sensor. Pure samples of open water and sea ice were obtained from SAR images with the aid of PlanetScope optical images during the austral winter. The statistical technique of logistic regression was applied to identify the best textural features to discriminate the two sampled targets. These selected textural features were used with the backscatter coefficients of SAR images in a maximum likelihood supervised classifier to analyze the images. With sea ice classified in the time series between 2016 and 2019 during winter and austral spring, the concentration of sea ice in the study region was calculated and mapped. The textural features statistically indicated by the logistic regression were gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) Mean and GLCM Variance, resulting in the supervised classification having an accuracy of 86% and precision ranging from 86% to 98% in the validation stage.

TI  - [Recent HIV infection and associated factors among men who have sex with men in Jiangsu province].
T2  - Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: To understand the incidence of HIV infections and associated factors among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Jiangsu province. Methods: Based on national AIDS sentinel surveillance in 2019, MSM from 13 cities in Jiangsu were recruited for questionnaire interview and laboratory testing during April to July, 2019. Seropositive samples were tested with Limiting-antigen avidity enzyme immunoassay to detect recent HIV infections. The incidence of HIV infection in MSM were calculated according to the formula and parameters from China CDC. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with recent infection of HIV. Results: A total of 4 469 MSM were subjects and the incidence of HIV infection were 4.5% (95%CI: 3.4%-5.5%).Multivariate logistic regression analysis results showed that compared with these aged ≥40 years, recruitment ways from MSM venues, awareness of AIDS knowledge, non-unprotected anal sex in the past 6 months and non-syphilis infection, those who aged 18-24 years (aOR=2.083,95%CI:1.087-3.990), recruitment ways from VCT clinics (aOR=2.125,95%CI:1.175-3.843), unawareness of AIDS knowledge (aOR=2.456,95%CI:1.109-5.437), unprotected anal sex in the past 6 months (aOR=3.553,95%CI:2.143-5.889) and syphilis infection (aOR=2.414,95%CI:1.033-5.462) were higher risk of HIV infection. Conclusion: The new infection rates of HIV were high in MSM in Jiangsu province. Health education, condom use and HIV/syphilis screening promotions should therefore be top priority in the prevention and control of HIV infection in MSM.
AB  - 目的： 分析江苏省MSM的HIV新发感染及影响因素。 方法： 根据2019年全国艾滋病哨点监测方案，2019年4-7月在江苏省13个城市招募MSM，进行问卷调查及实验室检测，应用限制性抗原亲和力酶联免疫法（LAg-Avidity EIA）检测HIV新发感染者，根据中国CDC推荐的基于亲和力方法的计算公式及参数计算新发感染率；采用多因素logistic回归模型分析HIV新发感染的影响因素。 结果： 研究对象MSM 4 469人，HIV新发感染率为4.5%（95%CI：3.4%~5.5%）。多因素logistic分析结果显示，相比于≥40岁年龄组、招募途径来自MSM活动场所、艾滋病知识知晓、最近6个月未发生无保护肛交、无梅毒现症感染，18~24岁年龄组（aOR=2.083，95%CI：1.087~3.990）、招募途径来自VCT门诊（aOR=2.125，95%CI：1.175~3.843）、艾滋病知识不知晓（aOR=2.456，95%CI：1.109~5.437）、最近6个月发生无保护性肛交（aOR=3.553，95%CI：2.143~5.889）、梅毒现症感染（aOR=2.414，95%CI：1.033~5.462）的HIV新发感染风险较高。 结论： 江苏省MSM人群HIV新发感染率较高。MSM的艾滋病预防控制，需加强健康教育、推广使用安全套和促进HIV/梅毒筛查工作。.

TI  - Green spaces as an indicator of urban sustainability in the Arctic cities: Case of Nadym
T2  - POLAR SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Green spaces have recently received wide acknowledgement for urban sustainability benefits and are mentioned in the Sustainable Development Goals SDGs Target 11.7. The article aims to address the knowledge gap on indicators used for assessment of green spaces for urban sustainability in the Arctic using an example of Nadym, Russia which is illustrative of compact cities built during the Soviet time using a system of microrayons. Different indicators implemented by international organizations for assessment of green spaces are compared with indicators used in Russia. Utilizing very high-resolution WorldView-3 satellite image and open source data, the quantity and quality of green spaces are estimated with high accuracy. In addition to traditionally used indicators of share of green space per capita, share of public spaces for common use within walking distance to assess availability and accessibility of green spaces, the paper suggests importance of taking into account governance, distribution, and composition using analysis of historic legacies, municipal budget allocation for green space maintenance, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index values. Such detailed view can enrich discussions about green spaces as sources for resilience both at the local and global levels, in comparison with other cities and across countries.

TI  - Effect of Gryllotalpa gryllotalpa (Orthoptera: Gryllotalpidae) on plant and crop characteristics of sugar beet, Beta vulgaris L. and detection of associated damage using hyperspectral remote sensing
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TROPICAL INSECT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sugar beet is considered the most important source of sugar production in Egypt. However, the crop is infested by a wide range of insect pests, which damage the leaves and taproot, leading to substantial yield loss. The mole cricket Gryllotalpa gryllotalpa is one of the insect species causing huge damage to sugar beet and decreasing sugar production. Thus, this study aimed to determine the effect of G. gryllotalpa on the yield, vegetative characteristics, and sugar quality of sugar beet. To achieve this, the reflectance characteristics of sugar beet plants infested by G. gryllotalpa and not infested were analyzed using hyperspectral remote sensing data. These experiments were performed in Al-Qalyubia and El-Fayoum governorates regions, representing Upper and Lower Egypt, during the 2018/2019 season. Sugar beet seedlings of 80 days old were artificially infested by G. gryllotalpa at three intensity levels viz: 5, 10 and 15 adults per replicate. The infestation rate, weight loss, vegetative and sugar quality characteristics were assessed at all levels of G. gryllotalpa infestation. In addition, the damage due to different levels of G. gryllotalpa infestation during three different stages of sugar beet plant growth (the leaf development stage, rosette stage and harvestable stage) was compared using a hyperspectral remote sensing technique. The obtained results demonstrated that percentages of both infestation and weight loss in sugar beet root increased gradually with the increase of G. gryllotalpa infestation level. At the highest infestation level (15 adults/ replicate), the infestation rate reached 45.13% and 56.02% at the Upper and Lower Egypt sites, respectively. At the same locations, the % weight loss was 19.76% and 31.79%, respectively. In both regions, all vegetative characteristics of sugar beet plants such as plant height, number of leaves, and crown diameter were significantly decreased in the plants with different infestation levels comparing with those in the healthy plants. The sucrose and total soluble solids percentages gradually decreased with increasing infestation level. The percentages of sucrose were 17.56%-18.84% at high level of infestation, compared with 20.72% for healthy plants. The results indicated that hyperspectral remote sensing could be effective to distinguish between different infestation levels of G. gryllotalpa. Regarding the spectral bands, their effectiveness was in the following order: blue > green > red > near-infrared. Therefore, the remote sensing techniques could help for detection and prediction of G. gryllotalpa in sugar beet plants.

TI  - Residual malaria among migrant workers in Myanmar: why still persistent and how to eliminate it?
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Residual malaria is probably an important source for the re-emergence of malaria infection in the elimination era. Assessment to identify the factors influencing residual malaria in high-risk groups is needed to develop evidence-based decisions by stakeholders and policymakers. Methods This study was conducted to explore the factors influencing the residual malaria infection among migrant workers in two sentinel sites (endemic vs. pre-elimination areas) in Myanmar using the mixed-model method. Results A total of 102 migrant respondents (65 in Bamauk and 37 in Shwegyin) were included for the quantitative assessment using pretested questionnaires during household visits. Although 87.3% of them had insecticidal bed nets (ITNs/LLINs), only 68.3% of the migrants in Bamauk and 57.9% in Shwegyin used it regularly. The use of any bed net was high (79.9% in Bamauk vs. 91.0% in Shwegyin). The mean LLINs in their families were 1.64 (95%CI: 1.48-1.81) in Bamauk and 2.89 (95%CI: 2.67-3.11) in Shwegyin. Most of them received no health information for malaria prevention within the last year and their knowledge about malaria was low. Their working nature was a challenge for control measures against malaria in migrants. Conclusion The strategy for distributing LLINs and health promotion activities for mobile/migrant populations should be reviewed, and an appropriate action plan should be developed for the specific migrant group. Moreover, health promotion activities for behavior change communication should be strengthened in the migrant population in Myanmar.

TI  - Radiotherapy Versus Inguinofemoral Lymphadenectomy as Treatment for Vulvar Cancer Patients With Micrometastases in the Sentinel Node: Results of GROINSS-V II
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - PURPOSE The Groningen International Study on Sentinel nodes in Vulvar cancer (GROINSS-V)-II investigated whether inguinofemoral radiotherapy is a safe alternative to inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy (IFL) in vulvar cancer patients with a metastatic sentinel node (SN).METHODS GROINSS-V-II was a prospective multicenter phase-II single-arm treatment trial, including patients with early-stage vulvar cancer (diameter < 4 cm) without signs of lymph node involvement at imaging, who had primary surgical treatment (local excision with SN biopsy). Where the SN was involved (metastasis of any size), inguinofemoral radiotherapy was given (50 Gy). The primary end point was isolated groin recurrence rate at 24 months. Stopping rules were defined for the occurrence of groin recurrences.RESULTS From December 2005 until October 2016, 1,535 eligible patients were registered. The SN showed metastasis in 322 (21.0%) patients. In June 2010, with 91 SN-positive patients included, the stopping rule was activated because the isolated groin recurrence rate in this group went above our predefined threshold. Among 10 patients with an isolated groin recurrence, nine had SN metastases > 2 mm and/or extracapsular spread. The protocol was amended so that those with SN macrometastases (> 2 mm) underwent standard of care (IFL), whereas patients with SN micrometastases (<= 2 mm) continued to receive inguinofemoral radiotherapy. Among 160 patients with SN micrometastases, 126 received inguinofemoral radiotherapy, with an ipsilateral isolated groin recurrence rate at 2 years of 1.6%. Among 162 patients with SN macrometastases, the isolated groin recurrence rate at 2 years was 22% in those who underwent radiotherapy, and 6.9% in those who underwent IFL (P = .011). Treatment-related morbidity after radiotherapy was less frequent compared with IFL.CONCLUSION Inguinofemoral radiotherapy is a safe alternative for IFL in patients with SN micrometastases, with minimal morbidity. For patients with SN macrometastasis, radiotherapy with a total dose of 50 Gy resulted in more isolated groin recurrences compared with IFL. (C) 2021 by American Society of Clinical Oncology

TI  - Assessment of Uncertainties in Modelling Land Use Change with an Integrated Cellular Automata-Markov Chain Model
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELING & ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Uncertainty in future land use change modelling is crucial to study as it may result in varying spatial characteristics and features of the model. An integrated land use change model combines different modelling techniques and strengths. However, combined model uncertainties may significantly affect the accuracy of the model results. In this study, uncertainties resulting from spatial resolution and proportional errors of the input maps, as well as from iteration number of the cellular automata (CA) employing an integrated CA-Markov chain (CA-MC) model have been explored. The model uncertainty was quantified by comparing simulated maps to a classified land use map with the help of kappa statistics and confusion matrix. Further, correlation analysis was performed between kappa coefficients and land use simulations. The results show that the input data uncertainty (spatial resolution and proportional error) has a higher influence on land use simulation as compared to the CA-model parameter uncertainty (iteration number). The confusion matrix and the percent deviation from simulated land use map showed that variation in the major land use classes, namely agriculture (69.2 to 66.1%), dense forest (14.8 to 12%), degraded forest (12.6 to 14.5%), and barren land (1.31 to 5.96%), is required to be taken into account to reduce the model simulation error and hence the uncertainties. This study reveals that input datasets of fine spatial resolution and a low proportional error as well as to a lesser extent a high number of iterations can be recommended to minimize uncertainty in the CA-MC modelling.

TI  - Cultural worldviews consistently explain bundles of ecosystem service prioritisation across rural Germany
T2  - PEOPLE AND NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Differences in ecosystem service (ES) priorities often lead to conflicts between stakeholders. While differences in priorities have often been described, the sociocultural factors, including differences in cultural worldview, which drive them have not. We propose that the cultural theory of risk and its 'grid-group' typology, which classifies people as individualists, hierarchists, egalitarians and fatalists, can provide a conceptual framework for doing this.2. We examined the relationship between ES prioritisation by stakeholders and underlying cultural (cultural worldviews, and related environmental nature and risk perceptions), sociocultural (region, stakeholder group, political party preference) and socio-demographic factors. This was achieved by applying multivariate statistics to data from a survey with 321 respondents, conducted across 14 stakeholder groups in three German regions.3. Results show that most stakeholders prioritised many services but gave the highest priority to services linked to their stakeholder group. We identified four 'ES priority bundles': cultural services, open-land provisioning services, environmental protection services and forest provisioning services.4. Each ES priority bundle was consistently associated with particular cultural worldviews, perceptions of nature and sociocultural factors, meaning that we could identify 'cultural types'. Two of these associations were particularly strong: Prioritisation of open-land provisioning ES was high for the agriculture stakeholder group, associated with individualism, a perception of nature as durable but unpredictable, and support for economic liberal, conservative political parties. In contrast, those who prioritised environmental protection tended to hold egalitarian cultural worldviews and perceive nature as tolerant and sensitive. They also often belonged to the research and nature conservation stakeholder groups, with a mostly left-leaning political party preference.5. The identification of cultural types of stakeholder with consistent ES priorities and cultural worldviews may provide a useful construct in the future ES research. Furthermore, it may allow communications regarding ES to be tailored to improve their effectiveness, potentially aiding the promotion of sustainable management strategies.

TI  - Occupational radiation dose of personnel involved in sentinel node biopsy procedure
T2  - PHYSICA MEDICA-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Sentinel node biopsy is a procedure used for axillary nodal staging in breast cancer surgery. The process uses radioactive Tc-99m isotope for mapping the sentinel node(s) and all the staff involved in the procedure is potentially exposed to ionizing radiation. The colloid for radiolabelling (antimone-sulphide) with Tc-99m isotope (half-life 6 h) is injected into the patient breast. The injection has activity of 18.5 MBq. The surgeon removes the primary tumor and detects active lymph nodes with gamma detection unit. The tumor as well as the active nodal tissue is transferred to pathologist for the definitive findings. The aim of the study was to measure dose equivalents to extremities and whole body for all staff and suggest practice improvement in order to minimize exposure risk.Materials and methods: The measurements of the following operational quantities were performed: Hp(10) personal dose equivalent to whole body and Hp(0.07) to extremities for staff as well as ambiental dose for operating theatre and during injection.Hp(0.07) were measured at surgeon's finger by ring thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) type MTS-N, and reader RADOS RE2000. Surgeon and nurse were wearing TLD personal dosimeter at the chest level. Anesthesiologist and anesthetist were wearing electronic personal dosimeters, while pathologist was wearing ring TLD while manipulating tissue samples.Electronic dosimeters used were manufactured by Polimaster, type PM1610.All TLD and electronic dosimeters data were reported, including background radiation. Background radiation was also monitored separately. Personal TLDs are standard for this type of personal monitoring, provided by accredited laboratory.Measurements of ambiental dose in workplaces of other staff involved around the patient was performed before the surgery took place, by calibrated survey meters manufactured by Atomtex, type 1667.The study involved two surgeons and one pathologist, two anesthesiologists and three anesthetists during two months period.Results and discussion: The doses received by all staff are evaluated using passive and active personal dosimeters and ambiental dose monitors and practice was improved based on results collected. Average annual whole body dose for all staff involved in the procedure was less than 0.8 mSv. Extremity dose equivalents to surgeon and pathologist were far below the limits set for professionally exposed (surgeon) and for public (pathologist).Conclusions: Although has proven to be very safe for all staff, additional measures for radiation protection, in accordance to ALARA principle (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) should be conducted. The recommendations for practice improvement with respect to radiation protection were issued.

TI  - Application of Google earth engine python API and NAIP imagery for land use and land cover classification: A case study in Florida, USA
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The analysis of land use and land cover data provides invaluable support to a variety of land management and conservation activities. However, historically its application has been limited by high costs associated with data acquisition, analysis, and classification. In recent years, freely available satellite imagery and geospatial data sets and rapid advancement in data analysis capabilities provide immense opportunities to understand and solve the real-world environmental problems. Open-source platforms such as Google Earth Engine (GEE) provide a planetary-scale environmental science data and analyses capability at much greater efficiency and accuracy than the traditional workflows. We evaluated the GEE Python API utility for classifying the freely available NAIP aerial imagery of 2017 to derive the land use land cover (LULC) information of a Panhandle area of Florida, USA. We identified eight major LULC classes with an overall accuracy of 86% and Kappa value of 79%. We completed all remote sensing data analyses procedures including data retrieval, classification, and report preparation in the Jupyter notebook, an open-source web application. Computation time for the procedure was less than 15 min. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of this approach for conducting land use and land cover analysis using much less time, money, and human resources. The open-source nature of GEE Python API and its library of remote sensing data could benefit remote sensing projects throughout the world, especially where access to commercial image processing software packages and remote sensing data are limited.

TI  - First human infection of avian influenza A(H5N6) virus reported in Lao People's Democratic Republic, February-March 2021
T2  - INFLUENZA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY VIRUSES
M3  - Article
AB  - In March 2021, Lao People's Democratic Republic (Laos) reported an avian influenza A(H5N6) virus infection in a 5-year-old child identified through sentinel surveillance. This was the first human A(H5N6) infection reported outside of China. A multidisciplinary investigation undertook contact tracing and enhanced human and animal surveillance in surrounding villages and live bird markets. Seven Muscovy ducks tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N6) viruses. Sequenced viruses belonged to clade 2.3.4.4h and were closely related to viruses detected in poultry in Vietnam and to previous viruses detected in Laos. Surveillance and coordinated outbreak response remain essential to global health security.

TI  - Significance of texture features in the segmentation of remotely sensed images
T2  - OPTIK
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes an efficient segmentation algorithm and the significance of texture features over segmentation in multispectral satellite images. In order to preserve the complete details about the earth's surface, initially texture features are extracted from the multispectral satellite images. Texture features are very important in remotely sensed images, since it has the capability to interpret micro and macro level features present in the images. This method has been effectively tested over multi-temporal LANDSAT data set of Hanoi and Balcoc region of vietnam. Qualitative observations made in the proposed work suggest that the addition of DOOG (Difference of Offset Gaussian) filter and texture features provide improved segmentation results compared to traditional methods. As per the quantitative investigations, the proposed method outperforms other contemporary methods in terms of Random Index (RI), Variance of Information (VOI) and Global Consistency Error (GCE).

TI  - Spatiotemporal variations of Alxa national public welfare forest net primary productivity in northwest China and the response to climate change
T2  - ECOHYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Net primary productivity (NPP) is an important index to evaluate vegetation growth. This study used MODIS remote sensing image data during growing seasons to calculate the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and surface water stress coefficient (W-epsilon) and then utilized Carnegie-Ames-Stanford-Approach (CASA) model to estimate the NPP of Alxa public welfare forest. Furthermore, the impacts of national policy, temperature and precipitation on spatiotemporal variations of NPP were also discussed. The results showed that: (1) Significant changes of NDVI and vegetation NPP of Alxa public welfare forest were found since the beginning of the monitoring in 2010. The NDVI of the forest area increased during 2010-2018 from 0.110 to 0.122. In most areas, NDVI showed a significant or insignificant increasing trend. (2) Obviously spatial differences of the distribution of vegetation NPP in Alxa public welfare forest were detected. The vegetation NPP increased from 50.41 to 58.61 gC center dot m(-2)center dot a(-1) during 2010-2018, with an average NPP of 53.95 gC center dot m(-2)center dot a(-1). (3) National policy was the dominant factor affecting the increase of vegetation NPP of Alxa public welfare forest. In addition, among the meteorological factors investigated, precipitation was the main factor affecting the spatial variation of NPP. There was a positive correlation between precipitation and NPP in 63% of the regions, whereas the spatial correlation between temperature and NPP was generally weak. This study could provide a macroscopic basis for the monitoring of vegetation growth in Alxa public welfare forest in recent 10 years.

TI  - In-season variable rate nitrogen recommendation for wheat precision production supported by fixed-wing UAV imagery
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data from optical canopy sensors has been successfully used for precision nitrogen (N) management. This study aimed to explore the potential of multispectral camera mounted on fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in guiding in-season N topdressing for regional wheat production. Wheat plot and field experiments were conducted with multiple cultivars and N rates during 2017-2019. Manual sampling and UAV photography were carried out at wheat key growth stages. A modified sufficiency index algorithm (MSIA), driven by UAV spectral data, was developed and used for variable rate N recommendation (VRNR). Firstly, data from plot experiment was used to determine the local optimum N rate (N-OPT) for attaining the maximum available yield, and to quantify the relationships between vegetation index and above ground biomass, plant N uptake (PNU), and grain yield. The results suggested that local N-OPT was 283.5 kg ha(-1), and red-edge soil adjusted vegetation index (RESAVI) yielded the highest accuracy in constructing PNU monitoring model (R-2 = 0.78) and dynamic curves of UAV spectrum (R-2 > 0.95). Secondly, using UAV spectral data of field experiment, the calculated real-time PNU and sufficiency index, along with N-OPT, were imported into MSIA for in-season VRNR. Compared to local empirical N fertilization, MSIA gave accurate N recommendation rate according to wheat growth status, with harvest index and nitrogen agronomic efficiency averagely increased by 3.1% and 11.9%, respectively under 15.4% reduced N input and undiminished yield return. This study supplies a new approach to implement VRNR for regional wheat production supported by UAV imagery.

TI  - Aggregation-induced emission luminogens for image-guided surgery in non-human primates
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Most applications of aggregation-induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) have been limited in small animal models. Here, the authors show the versatility of AIEgens-based imaging-guided surgical operation from small animals to rhesus macaque, in support of the clinical translation of AIEgens.During the past two decades, aggregation-induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) have been intensively exploited for biological and biomedical applications. Although a series of investigations have been performed in non-primate animal models, there is few pilot studies in non-human primate animal models, strongly hindering the clinical translation of AIE luminogens (AIEgens). Herein, we present a systemic and multifaceted demonstration of an optical imaging-guided surgical operation via AIEgens from small animals (e.g., mice and rabbits) to rhesus macaque, the typical non-human primate animal model. Specifically, the folic conjugated-AIE luminogen (folic-AIEgen) generates strong and stable fluorescence for the detection and surgical excision of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). Moreover, with the superior tumor/normal tissue ratio and rapid tumor accumulation, folic-AIEgen successfully images and guides the precise resection of invisible cancerous metastases. Taken together, the presented strategies of folic-AIEgen based fluorescence intraoperative imaging and visualization-guided surgery show potential for clinical applications.

TI  - The ERA5 global reanalysis: Preliminary extension to 1950
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The extension of the ERA5 reanalysis back to 1950 supplements the previously published segment covering 1979 to the present. It features the assimilation of additional conventional observations, as well as improved use of early satellite data. The number of observations assimilated increases from 53,000 per day in early 1950 to 570,000 per day by the end of 1978. Accordingly, the quality of the reanalysis improves throughout the period, generally joining seamlessly with the segment covering 1979 to the present. The fidelity of the extension is illustrated by the accurate depiction of the North Sea storm of 1953, and the events leading to the first discovery of sudden stratospheric warmings in 1952. Time series of ERA5 global surface temperature anomalies show temperatures to be relatively stable from 1950 until the late 1970s, in agreement with the other contemporary full-input reanalysis covering this period and with independent data sets, although there are significant differences in the accuracy of representing specific regions, Europe being well represented in the early period but Australia less so. The variability of ERA5 precipitation from month to month agrees well with observations for all continents, with correlations above 90% for most of Europe and generally in excess of 70% for North America, Asia and Australia. The evolution of upper air temperatures, humidities and winds shows smoothly varying behaviour, including tropospheric warming and stratospheric cooling, modulated by volcanic eruptions. The Quasi-Biennial Oscillation is well represented throughout. Aspects to be improved upon in future reanalyses include the assimilation of tropical cyclone data, the spin-up of soil moisture and stratospheric humidity, and the representation of surface temperatures over Australia.

TI  - Police Stress and Deleterious Outcomes: Efforts Towards Improving Police Mental Health
T2  - JOURNAL OF POLICE AND CRIMINAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Police officers are subjected, daily, to critical incidents and work-related stressors that negatively impact nearly every aspect of their personal and professional lives. They have resisted openly acknowledging this for fear of being labeled. This research examined the deleterious outcomes on the mental health of police officers, specifically on the correlation between years of service and change in worldviews, perception of others, and the correlation between repeated exposure to critical events and experiencing Post-Traumatic Symptoms. The Cumulative Career Traumatic Stress Questionnaire- Revised (Marshall in J Police Crim Psychol 21(1):62-71, 2006) was administered to 408 current and prior law enforcement officers across the United States. Significant correlations were found between years of service and traumatic events; traumatic events and post-traumatic stress symptoms; and traumatic events and worldview/perception of others. The findings from this study support the literature that perpetual long-term exposure to critical incidents and traumatic events, within the scope of the duties of a law enforcement officer, have negative implications that can impact both their physical and mental wellbeing. These symptoms become exacerbated when the officer perceives that receiving any type of service to address these issues would not be supported by law enforcement hierarchy and could, in fact, lead to the officer being declared unfit for duty. Finally, this research discusses early findings associated with the 2017 Law Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness Act and other proactive measures being implemented within law enforcement agencies who are actively working to remove the stigma associated with mental health in law enforcement.

TI  - Overcomplete pre-learned dictionary for incomplete data SAR imaging towards pervasive aerial and satellite vision
T2  - WIRELESS NETWORKS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Nowadays, pervasive vision through synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging sensors is a crucial part of air-borne and space-borne platforms to reach the concept of internet of multimedia things over satellites and visual flying ad-hoc networks. SAR sensors always need high-performance data reconstruction techniques to provide quality of experience for end-users of the distributed surveillance nodes and ensuring reliable decision-making in the autonomous vehicles. Using prior information in SAR image reconstruction, improves the quality of reconstructed image. Many sparse regularization methods use pre information terms in which the image is sparsely presented based on a predefined dictionary. However, if the desired features of the real image have not a sparse representation based on the predefined dictionary, image reconstruction with enhanced interested features will be failed. Dictionary learning to better adapt with the underlying scene can lead to better image reconstruction. On the other hand, using the idea of dictionary learning in the image reconstruction problem, and considering that the data used to train the dictionary may be incomplete and noisy, will create limitations for this method. In this paper, a new idea based on the use of an overcomplete dictionary consisting of a learned dictionary and a predefined dictionary (pre-learned dictionary) for SAR image reconstruction problem is presented. Developing the necessary mathematical relations and providing the framework for SAR image reconstruction based on the use of the overcomplete pre-learned dictionary, to simultaneously enhance the features considered in advance and the features associated with the image, from incomplete and noisy SAR raw data is presented in this article. We also present an iterative algorithm for solving the corresponding optimization problem. Simulation results based on the real data of TerraSAR-X and the Lynx airborne system show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI  - Robust Bayesian Particle Filter for Space Object Tracking Under Severe Uncertainty
T2  - JOURNAL OF GUIDANCE CONTROL AND DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This paper introduces a robust Bayesian particle filter that can handle epistemic uncertainty in the measurements, dynamics, and initial conditions. The robust filter returns robust bounds on the output quantity of interest, rather than a crisp value. Particles are generated with an importance sampling technique and propagated only one time during the estimation process. The proposal distribution is constructed by running a parallel unscented Kalman filter to drive particles in regions of high expected likelihood and achieve a high effective sample size. The bounds are then computed by an inexpensive tuning of the importance weights via numerical optimization. A Branch & Bound algorithm over simplexes with a Lipschitz bounding function is employed to achieve guaranteed convergence to the lower and upper bounds in a finite number of steps. The filter is applied to the robust computation of the collision probability of SENTINEL 2B with a FENGYUN 1C debris in different operational instances, all characterized by a mix of aleatory and epistemic uncertainty on initial conditions and observation likelihoods.

TI  - Field-Scale Estimation and Comparison of the Sugarcane Yield from Remote Sensing Data: A Machine Learning Approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The present work describes about estimation of crop yield of sugarcane crop from medium resolution LANDSAT 8 OLI (30 m) imageries by the development of a nonlinear empirical model using classical artificial neural networks. Sugarcane crop attributes were retrieved from high-resolution (30 m) satellite imageries to develop yield prediction models. The feed-forward back-propagation neural network algorithm developed and calibrated using the remote sensing retrieved crop parameters and ground truth data in MATLAB environment. The perceptron was trained with 75 out of the 100 possible inputs upto10,000 epochs with 1-10 hidden neurons. Four performance indices: coefficient of determination (R-2), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and the average ratio of estimated yield to target crop yield (R-ratio) were calculated, to achieve optimum neural network. Several runs were performed in determining the optimum number of hidden neurons. The best performance of the models was observed at i + 1 and i + 2 hidden nodes (i = No of input parameters). The range of R-2 values of best performed models were between 0.867 and 0.916 for training and same for testing it ranged from 0.829 to 0.991 and R-ratio values from 0.997 to 1.006, the normalized RMSE values ranged from 0.066 to 0.150; MAE ranged from 0.034 to 0.119 for training and 0.017-0.184 for testing. The statistical analysis recommends the reliability of the ANN model in sugarcane yield estimation. Multivariate linear regression was also performed for training and testing data separately to test the superiority of the ANN model. The estimated yield was in the range of 60,000 kg/ha-1,30,000 with an average of 73,000 kg/ha.

TI  - Mapping Phenological Functional Types (PhFT) in the Indian Eastern Himalayas using machine learning algorithm in Google Earth Engine
T2  - COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Phenological studies involve capturing information on dates of recurrent and seasonal biological events in plants and animals. In plants, phenological events of leaf flushing, full bloom, autumn discolouration, leaf fall etc. can be used to distinguish vegetation into separate classes. We refer here such phenological distinction as Phenological Functional Types (PhFT). The PhFT can be considered as the precursor of Plant Functional Types (PFTs) where PFT uses additional traits (e.g. leaf area, tree height, leaf structure, rate of evapotranspiration and photosynthesis, etc.) to classify vegetation. The PFT classification is essentially needed for developing and running dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) used in studying impacts of climate change on vegetation. We used archived long time series satellite remote sensing data, Landsat 5,7 and 8 (1985-2019), for classifying a landscape into appropriate PhFT. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was calculated for the given period in the Google Earth Engine (GEE). The GEE is a cloud-based platform developed for the retrieval and processing of remotely sensed images and other data. The monthly median values of NDVI for the mentioned period was used to label each pixel into appropriate PhFT classes using Random Forest (RF) algorithm in GEE to obtain four distinct classes of evergreen forest, deciduous forest, agriculture and non-forest. The comparison of PhFT map was done with reference maps of global MCD12Q1 and the forest type map of India; with an overall moderate agreement of 68.55% and 66.22%, respectively. MCD12Q1 has an accuracy of 73% for the land cover map and the forest type map of India has 75% accuracy, whereas, we achieved an overall accuracy of 78%. The PhFT classification accuracy can further be improved using additional indices and topographic variables. The methodology demonstrated in this study can be adopted for classifying a landscape into distinct PhFT/PFT classes.

TI  - Developing a sentinel syndromic surveillance system using school-absenteeism data, example monitoring absences over the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study describes the development of a pilot sentinel school absence syndromic surveillance system. Using data from a sample of schools in England the capability of this system to monitor the impact of disease on school absences in school-aged children is shown, using the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic period as an example. Data were obtained from an online app service used by schools and parents to report their children absent, including reasons/symptoms relating to absence. For 2019 and 2020, data were aggregated into daily counts of 'total' and 'cough' absence reports. There was a large increase in the number of absence reports in March 2020 compared to March 2019, corresponding to the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in England. Absence numbers then fell rapidly and remained low from late March 2020 until August 2020, while lockdown was in place in England. Compared to 2019, there was a large increase in the number of absence reports in September 2020 when schools re-opened in England, although the peak number of absences was smaller than in March 2020. This information can help provide context around the absence levels in schools associated with COVID-19. Also, the system has the potential for further development to monitor the impact of other conditions on school absence, e.g. gastrointestinal infections.

TI  - Evaluation of Marine Gravity Anomaly Calculation Accuracy by Multi-Source Satellite Altimetry Data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to analyze the influence of satellite altimetry data accuracy on the marine gravity anomaly accuracy. The data of 12 altimetry satellites in the research area (5 degrees N-23 degrees N, 105 degrees E-118 degrees E) were selected. These data were classified into three groups: A, B, and C, according to the track density, the accuracy of the altimetry satellites, and the differences of self-crossover. Group A contains CryoSat-2, group B includes Geosat, ERS-1, ERS-2, and Envisat, and group C comprises T/P, Jason-1/2/3, HY-2A, SARAL, and Sentinel-3A. In Experiment I, the 5 ' x5 ' marine gravity anomalies were obtained based on the data of groups A, B, and C, respectively. Compared with the shipborne gravity data, the root mean square error (RMSE) of groups A, B, and C was 4.59 mGal, 4.61 mGal, and 4.51 mGal, respectively. The results show that high-precision satellite altimetry data can improve the calculation accuracy of gravity anomaly, and the single satellite CryoSat-2 enables achieving the same effect of multi-satellite joint processing. In Experiment II, the 2 ' x2 ' marine gravity anomalies were acquired based on the data of groups A, A + B, and A + C, respectively. The root mean square error of the above three groups was, respectively, 4.29 mGal, 4.30 mGal, and 4.21 mGal, and the outcomes show that when the spatial resolution is satisfied, adding redundant low-precision altimetry data will add pressure to the calculation of marine gravity anomalies and will not improve the accuracy. An effective combination of multi-satellite data can improve the accuracy and spatial resolution of the marine gravity anomaly inversion.

TI  - A Comparative Study of the Epidemiology of Treponemal Infection in the Volta and Oti Regions of Ghana: A Five-Year Multisite Parallel Population-Based Analysis vis-a-vis the Sentinel Survey
T2  - BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Treponemal infections can be blood-borne with great public health consequences. This study is aimed at comparatively describing the five-year (2013-2017) regional epidemiology of treponemal infection using pregnant women in the sentinel survey and apparently healthy blood donors as a proxy for the general population at four sentinel sites in the Volta and Oti Regions of Ghana. We analyzed retrospective data from 17,744 prospective blood donors aged 18 to 58 years and 7,817 pregnant women in a sentinel survey with ages from 15 to 49 years at Hohoe, Ho, Tongu, and Krachi West sentinel sites in the Volta and Oti Regions. Laboratory data extracted include variables such as age, gender, date of blood donation, and Treponema pallidum chromatographic immunoassay results from the blood banks of the four study sites. The five-year treponemal infection rate among the pregnant women in the sentinel survey and prospective blood donors was 0.79% and 2.38%, respectively. Site-specific infection rate for population-based/sentinel survey was 4.6%/1.1%, 2.0%/0.5%, 1.3%/1.1, and 1.2%/0.3% for Hohoe, Ho, Krachi West, and Tongu, respectively. Significant gender disparity in Treponemal infection rate exists with a male preponderance. The regional infection rate in the sentinel survey is lower compared to the general population. Therefore, the use of pregnant women as a proxy for population estimates could underestimate the burden in the study jurisdiction.

TI  - Severity grading of unexpected events in paediatric surgery: evaluation of five classification systems and the Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI(R))
T2  - BJS OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Postoperative adverse events may be associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Numerous severity grading systems for these events have been introduced and validated but have not yet been systematically applied in paediatric surgery. This study aimed to analyse the advantages and disadvantages of these classifications in a paediatric cohort. Methods Unexpected events associated with interventional or organizational problems in the department of paediatric surgery during 2017-2020 were prospectively documented daily for all children. Events were classified according to the Clavien-Dindo grading system during monthly morbidity and mortality conferences. All events were also classified according to five additional grading systems: T92, contracted Accordion, expanded Accordion, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI)(R). Results Of 6296 patients, 673 (10.7 per cent) developed adverse events and 240 (35.7 per cent) had multiple events. Overall, 1253 adverse events were identified; of these, 574 (45.2 per cent) were associated with surgical or medical interventions and 679 (54.8 per cent) included organizational problems. The grading systems demonstrated high overall correlation (r(pears) = 0.9), with minor differences in sentinel events. The Clavien-Dindo classification offered the most detailed assessment. However, these details had only limited additional value. The CCI(R) scores were correlated with other grading systems (r(pears) = 0.9) and were useful in analysing multiple events within individual patients. Conclusion Grading systems demonstrated similar scoring patterns for minor and sentinel events, with none being superior for unexpected events in children. However, the CCI(R) can be a major improvement in assessing morbidity in patients with multiple events. Its use is therefore recommended in prospective studies on paediatric surgery.The authors described the use of different severity grading systems and their advantages and disadvantages in a paediatric cohort. None of the five assessed classification systems were shown to be superior. However, the CCI(R) can be a major improvement in assessing morbidity in children with multiple events.

TI  - Does the pattern of lymphatic drainage influence the risk of nodal recurrence in trunk melanoma patients with negative sentinel lymph node biopsy?
T2  - ANAIS BRASILEIROS DE DERMATOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: There are conflicting data regarding the prognostic value of the lymphatic basin drainage pattern in melanoma patients and the evidence is scant in the setting of negative sentinel lymph node biopsy.Objective: To investigate whether the pattern of lymphatic basin drainage influences the risk of nodal disease in patients with melanoma of the trunk and negative sentinel lymph node biopsy.Methods: A case series of patients with trunk melanoma and negative sentinel lymph node biopsy was retrospectively evaluated. Clinicopathological features, the pattern of lymphatic drainage and nodal, metastatic, and overall recurrence-free survival were reviewed.Results: Of the 135 patients included, multiple lymphatic basin drainage was identified in 61 (45.2%). Ten of the 74 (13.5%) patients with single drainage developed nodal recurrence, compared with 2 of the 61 (3.6%) patients with multiple drainages (p = 0.04). Nodal recurrence-free survival was significantly longer in the group with multiple drainages than in the group with single drainage (175.6 vs. 138.7 months; p = 0.04). In multivariate analysis, single drainage was associated with a higher risk of nodal recurrence (HR = 4.54; p = 0.05). No significant differences in metastatic and overall recurrence-free survival were found between groups.Study limitations: Retrospective analysis, single-center study, small sample, detailed histopathologic information not always present.Conclusions: In patients with trunk melanoma and negative sentinel lymph node biopsy, multiple lymphatic basin drainage may be an independent risk factor for nodal disease recurrence. This factor may help to identify patients with negative sentinel lymph node biopsy with a higher risk of nodal recurrence. (C) 2021 Sociedade Brasileira de Dermatologia.

TI  - Using historical spy satellite photographs and recent remote sensing data to identify high-conservation-value forests
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - High-conservation-value forests (HCVFs) are critically important for biodiversity and ecosystem service provisioning, but they face many threats. Where systematic HCVF inventories are missing, such as in parts of Eastern Europe, these forests remain largely unacknowledged and therefore often unprotected. We devised a novel, transferable approach for detecting HCVFs based on integrating historical spy satellite images, contemporary remote sensing data (Landsat), and information on current potential anthropogenic pressures (e.g., road infrastructure, population density, demand for fire wood, terrain). We applied the method to the Romanian Carpathians, for which we mapped forest continuity (1955-2019), canopy structural complexity, and anthropogenic pressures. We identified 738,000 ha of HCVF. More than half of this area was identified as susceptible to current anthropogenic pressures and lacked formal protection. By providing a framework for broad-scale HCVF monitoring, our approach facilitates integration of HCVF into forest conservation and management. This is urgently needed to achieve the goals of the European Union's Biodiversity Strategy to maintain valuable forest ecosystems.

TI  - Sea ice detection from SSMI data based on an improved U-Net convolution neural network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - It is of great significance to accurately obtain the polar sea ice for the study of global hydrosphere and polar climate. The U-Net convolutional neural network (CNN) can achieve end-to-end pixel-level semantic segmentation, and it can learn comprehensive image information as much as possible through the training process. The vertical polarization at 37 GHz and 19 GHz of Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) is used as the input of the improved U-Net CNN, and the improved U-Net CNN is proposed to detect the sea ice. In order to improve the accuracy of sea ice detection, anew feature fusion structure based on the improved U-Net CNN is constructed, which further refines the features of different semantic levels. By using batch normalization (BN), dropout regularization and modifying the loss function to improve the U-Net convolutional neural network, the accuracy of sea ice detection is improved. The results were compared with the NASA Team algorithm, which showed that the improved U-Net CNN is afeasible solution. The sea ice obtained from MODIS data is real result, and our comparison with NASA team algorithm and U-Net CNN showed that the modified U-Net CNN improves the accuracy of sea ice detection to 75%. Therefore, the improved U-Net CNN significantly improves the accuracy of sea ice detection. The improved U-Net CNN had the ability to combine multiple nonlinear transformation functions to solve the problems of sea ice identification, which improved the accuracy and robustness of sea ice detection.

TI  - Climate change effects on desert ecosystems: A case study on the keystone species of the Namib Desert <i>Welwitschia mirabilis</i>
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Deserts have been predicted to be one of the most responsive ecosystems to global climate change. In this study, we examine the spatial and demographic response of a keystone endemic plant of the Namib Desert (Welwitschia mirabilis), for which displacement and reduction of suitable climate has been foreseen under future conditions. The main aim is to assess the association between ongoing climate change and geographical patterns of welwitschia health, reproductive status, and size. We collected data on welwitschia distribution, health condition, reproductive status, and plant size in northern Namibia. We used ecological niche models to predict the expected geographic shift of suitability under climate change scenarios. For each variable, we compared our field measurements with the expected ongoing change in climate suitability. Finally, we tested the presence of simple geographical gradients in the observed patterns. The historically realized thermal niche of welwitschia will be almost completely unavailable in the next 30 years in northern Namibia. Expected reductions of climatic suitability in our study sites were strongly associated with indicators of negative population conditions, namely lower plant health, reduced recruitment and increased adult mortality. Population condition does not follow simple latitudinal or altitudinal gradients. The observed pattern of population traits is consistent with climate change trends and projections. This makes welwitschia a suitable bioindicator (i.e. a 'sentinel') for climate change effect in the Namib Desert ecosystems. Our spatially explicit approach, combining suitability modeling with geographic combinations of population conditions measured in the field, could be extensively adopted to identify sentinel species, and detect population responses to climate change in other regions and ecosystems.

T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Since the opening of Earth Observation (EO) archives (USGS/NASA Landsat and EC/ESA Sentinels), large collections of EO data are freely available, offering scientists new possibilities to better understand and quantify environmental changes. Fully exploiting these satellite EO data will require new approaches for their acquisition, management, distribution, and analysis. Given rapid environmental changes and the emergence of big data, innovative solutions are needed to support policy frameworks and related actions toward sustainable development. Here we present the Swiss Data Cube (SDC), unleashing the information power of Big Earth Data for monitoring the environment, providing Analysis Ready Data over the geographic extent of Switzerland since 1984, which is updated on a daily basis. Based on a cloud-computing platform allowing to access, visualize and analyse optical (Sentinel-2; Landsat 5, 7, 8) and radar (Sentinel-1) imagery, the SDC minimizes the time and knowledge required for environmental analyses, by offering consistent calibrated and spatially co-registered satellite observations. SDC derived analysis ready data supports generation of environmental information, allowing to inform a variety of environmental policies with unprecedented timeliness and quality.

TI  - Impact of spatial configuration of training data on the performance of Amazonian tree species distribution models
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing can provide useful explanatory variables for tree species distribution modeling, but only a few studies have explored this potential in Amazonia at local scales. Particularly for tropical forest management it would be useful to be able to predict the potential distribution of important tree taxa in areas where field data is as yet missing. Forest concessions produce valuable census data that cover large areas with high sampling effort and can be used as occurrence data in species distribution models (SDM). Nevertheless, these tree records are often spatially clumped and possibly only provide accurate predictions over areas close to where the training occurrence records are located. Here, we aim at investigating to what degree SDM performance and spatial predictions differ between models that have different spatial configurations of the occurrence data. For this, we divided the available occurrence data from a forest concession census in Peruvian Amazonia into different spatial configurations (narrow, elongated and compact), each of which contained approximately 20% of the full dataset. We then modelled the distributions of five tree taxa using Landsat data and elevation. More elongated configurations of the training data were more representative of the available environmental space, and also produced more robust SDMs. Average model performance (expressed as AUC) was 5% higher and variation in model performance 50% lower when elongated rather than compact configurations of training area were used. This confirms that covering only a small fraction of the environmental variability in the area of interest may lead to misleading SDM predictions, which needs to be taken into account when forest management decisions are based on SDMs.

TI  - Data-driven feature-oriented modeling of Southwest Monsoon Current
T2  - OCEAN MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - The multiscale synoptic circulation in the southern Bay of Bengal region is simulated using a high-resolution Feature-Oriented Regional Modeling and Simulation (FORMS) approach. First, the region's prevalent ocean circulation features are identified and mapped onto a FORMS template using a literature survey, and analysis of in-situ and remote sensing data. These features include the Southwest Monsoon Current (SMC), Sri-Lanka Dome, Anti-cyclonic Eddy, and Subsurface Baroclinic Eddy to the east of the SMC. New data-driven feature models are developed for the SMC and Subsurface Baroclinic Eddy using observational transects collected during the Bay of Bengal Boundary Layer Experiment (BoBBLE) of July 2016. Specifically, a new elliptical feature model for the SMC's high salinity core is developed and utilized. The developed temperature and salinity feature models are placed on the FORMS template, and pseudo observation profiles are sampled for use in an objective analysis initialization scheme. The background for the objective analysis is taken to be the NEMO global analysis model data on the day of the synoptic initialization. The FORMS derived initialization fields on 04 July 2016 are used with the MIT-MSEAS Primitive Equation modeling system to simulate the ocean circulation in the region from 04 July to 15 July 2016. The forecast skill of the model is quantified by comparison to the time-series observations collected during BoBBLE (but not used in the FORMS development) and Argo data available in the region during the simulation. Four experimental short-term synoptic simulations at a 3 km horizontal resolution and 70 vertical levels, with and without the different components of the feature models are showcased. Results are utilized to calibrate and improve the feature model, including the addition of a Subsurface Baroclinic Eddy and the development of a new surface bias-correction scheme to obtain a better match with validation datasets. The present data-driven feature modeling approach improves the representation and forecast skill for several critical dynamical features: (i) the initial high salinity core at the time-series location (ii) evolution and expansion of the sub-surface high salinity core; and (iii) salinization and freshening events at the time-series location between 3 m to 20 m. The MSEAS model simulation from the final experiment match the BoBBLE temperature and salinity data (total RMSE of 0.14 psu in salinity and 0.57 C in temperature in between 60-120 m depths and total RMSE of 0.17 psu in salinity and 0.33 C in temperature in between 3-60 m depths) and the Argo measured temperature and salinity (total RMSE of 0.16 psu in salinity and 0.66 C in temperature), showcasing the model's success in providing excellent spatio-temporal representation of the ocean in the region of interest.

TI  - Performance comparison of deep learning and machine learning methods in determining wetland water areas using EuroSAT dataset
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are critical to the ecology because they maintain biodiversity and provide home for a variety of species. Researching, mapping, and conservation of wetlands is a challenging and time-consuming process. Because they produce temporal and geographical information, remote sensing and photogrammetric approaches are useful tools for analyzing and managing wetlands. In this study, the water areas of five different wetlands obtained with Sentinel-2 images in Turkey were classified. Although obtaining large amounts of high-dimensional dataset labeled for various land types is costly, it is a significant advantage to use it after model training in a wide range of applications. In this paper, the EuroSAT dataset was used in the validation process. Proposed deep learning-based 1D convolutional neural networks (CNN) and traditional machine learning methods (i.e., support vector machine, linear discriminant analysis, K-nearest neighborhood, canonical correlation forests, and AdaBoost.M1) were compared quantitatively (i.e., accuracy, recall, precision, specificity, F-score, and image quality assessment metrics) and qualitatively. Finally, pairwise comparison was made with chi-square-based McNemar's test. There is a statistical difference between 1D CNN and machine learning method (except the support vector machine vs linear discriminant analysis in Test 1 area). CNN models outperform machine learning algorithms in terms of non-linear function approximation and the ability to extract and articulate data features. Since 1D CNNs can process data in a highly complex and unique feature space, they are very successful in segmenting strongly related and highly correlated discrete signals. It also has advantages over machine learning methods for water body extraction in that it can be integrated with sophisticated image pre-processing and standardization tools, is less susceptible to low-level random noise, and provides shift in variations and contrast-invariant image local transforms.

AB  - Deriving land cover from remotely sensed data is fundamental to many operational mapping and reporting programs as well as providing core information to support science activities. The ability to generate land cover maps has benefited from free and open access to imagery, as well as increased storage and computational power. The accuracy of the land cover maps is directly linked to the calibration (or training) data used, the predictors and ancillary data included in the classification model, and the implementation of the classification, among other factors (e.g., classification algorithm, land cover heterogeneity). Various means for improving calibration data can be implemented, including using independent datasets to further refine training data prior to mapping. Opportunities also arise from a profusion of possible calibration datasets from pre-existing land cover products (static and time series) and forest inventory maps through to observation from airborne and spaceborne lidar observations. In this research, for the 650 Mha forested ecosystems of Canada, we explored approaches to refine calibration data, integrate novel predictors, and optimize classifier implementation. We refined calibration data using measures of forest vertical structure, integrated novel spatial (via distance-to metrics) model predictors, and implemented a regionalized approach for optimizing training data selection and model-building to ensure local relevance of calibration data and capture of regional variability in land cover conditions. We found that additional vetting of training data involved the removal of 44.7% of erroneous samples (e.g. treed vegetation without vertical structure) from the training pool. Nationally, distance to ephemeral waterbodies was a key predictor of land cover, while the importance of distance to permanent water bodies varied on a regional basis. Regionalization of model implementation ensured that classification models used locally relevant descriptors and resulted in improved classification outcomes (overall accuracy: 77.9% +/- 1.4%) compared to a generalized, national model (70.3% +/- 2.5%). The methodological developments presented herein are portable to other land cover projects, monitoring programs, and remotely sensed data sources. The increasing availability of remotely sensed data for land cover mapping, as well as non-image data for aiding with model development (from calibration data to complementary spatial data layers) provide new opportunities to improve and further automate land cover mapping procedures.

TI  - Trends in voluntary vaccination coverage in a Japanese city
T2  - PEDIATRICS INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Large numbers of patients with diseases preventable by voluntary vaccines have been reported in Japan. However, it is difficult to analyze the impact of voluntary vaccination on disease prevention, as governments do not aggregate the number of recipients of vaccines that are not included in the national immunization program. This study investigated the association between the coverage rates of two voluntary vaccines (rotavirus and mumps vaccines) and the incidence of the diseases preventable by these vaccines. Methods We performed a prospective questionnaire-based observational study to investigate the presumptive coverage rates of the rotavirus vaccine in infancy and the mumps vaccine at 1 year of age in Kitakyushu City from 2015 to 2018. The number of children admitted to a secondary medical institution for rotavirus-associated gastroenteritis and the incidence of mumps infection in sentinel medical institutions were also analyzed during the investigation period. Results The rotavirus and mumps vaccine coverage rates since 2016 were 61-63% and late 28-30%, respectively (52.6% and 20.3% in 2015, respectively). The yearly number of children hospitalized for rotavirus-associated gastroenteritis from 2015 to 2018 declined by 41.4% compared with that during the pre-vaccination period (2009-2011). The incidence of mumps infection remained unchanged during the investigation period. Conclusion The coverage rates of two voluntary vaccines were not high enough to control the infections. The incorporation of voluntary vaccines into the routine immunization program should be considered as the one of the effective ways to increase vaccination coverage.

TI  - Multiple Kernel Learning with Maximum Inundation Extent from MODIS Imagery for Spatial Prediction of Flood Susceptibility
T2  - WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying flood prone areas is essential for basin management. In this paper, a spatial prediction technology of flood susceptibility based on multiple kernel learning (MKL) is proposed. We establish the flood susceptibility model by using EasyMKL, nonlinear MKL (NLMKL), Representative MKL(RMKL), Generalized MKL(GMKL), support vector machine(SVM) with linear kernel and SVM with Gaussian radial base function(RBF) kernel, The spatial prediction of flood susceptibility in Sanhuajian basin of the Yellow River is carried out. We use MODIS remote sensing images to obtain historical flood inundation sites in the study area. Then, ten flood conditioning factors are used as inputs to the flood susceptibility model. The model performance is evaluated in terms of accuracy (ACC), balanced F Score (F1 score), and areas under the curve (AUC). According to the results, MKL significantly outperforms the SVM adopting single kernel, and NLMKL(ACC=0.833,F1=0.841,AUC=0.889) demonstrates the best comprehensive performance. The flood susceptibility map generated by MODIS remote sensing images and MKL, therefore, can provide effective help for researchers and decision makers in flood management.

TI  - Zy-4 LOCA cladding burst criteria computed by neural networks
T2  - NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents new Zy-4 cladding burst criteria based on neural networks with up to five input parameters: the temperature, the engineering hoop stress, the circumferential strain, the heat-up rate and the heating mode. A large database composed of more than one thousand Zy-4 Loss Of Coolant Accident (LOCA) burst conditions has been built mainly with data from literature. The database is then used to train a series of neural networks. Many topics are investigated such as numerical technique choices for classification, input parameters normalization, training strategy or regularization. A specific evaluation function was developed to be able to compare network's accuracy whatever the input parameter number is. First, a temperature-engineering stress model is obtained, adding the heating-rate as an input parameter strongly improves model predictions whereas adding burst strain has almost no impact. Finally, risk-informed neural networks are constructed to address various objectives like preventing from fuel rod failure (radiological consequences) or to envelop flow blockage (core reflooding). In the future, these neural networks will be implemented and used in the IRSN DRACCAR LOCA simulation code and further work on uncertainties will be performed.

TI  - Quantifying drought effects in Central European grasslands through regression-based unmixing of intra-annual Sentinel-2 time series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Severe droughts caused unprecedented impacts on grasslands in Central Europe in 2018 and 2019. Yet, spatially varying drought impacts on grasslands remain poorly understood as they are driven by complex interactions of environmental conditions and land management. Sentinel-2 time series offer untapped potential for improving grassland monitoring during droughts with the required spatial and temporal detail. In this study, we quantified drought effects in a major Central European grassland region from 2017 to 2020 using a regression-based unmixing framework. The Sentinel-2-based intra-annual time series of photosynthetic vegetation (PV), nonphotosynthetic vegetation (NPV), and soil fractional cover provide easily interpretable quantities relevant for understanding drought effects on grasslands. Fractional cover estimates from Sentinel-2 matched in-situ conditions observed during field visits. The comparison to a multitemporal reference dataset showed the best agreement for PV cover (MAE = 7.2%). Agreement was lower for soil and NPV, but we observed positive relationships between fractional cover from Sentinel-2 and the reference data with MAE = 10.1% and MAE = 15.4% for soil and NPV, respectively. Based on the fractional cover estimates, we derived a Normalized Difference Fraction Index (NDFI) time series contrasting NPV and soil cover relative to PV. In line with meteorological and soil moisture drought indices, and with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), NDFI time series showed the most severe drought impacts in 2018, followed by less severe, but persisting effects in 2019. Drought-specific metrics from NDFI time series revealed a high spatial variability of onset, duration, impact, and end of drought effects on grasslands. Evaluating drought metrics on different soil types, we found that grasslands on less productive, sandy Cambisols were strongly affected by the drought in 2018 and 2019. In comparison, grasslands on Gleysols and Histosols were less severely impacted suggesting a higher drought resistance of these grasslands. Our study emphasizes that the high temporal and spatial detail of Sentinel-2 time series is mandatory for capturing relevant vegetation dynamics in Central European lowland grasslands under drought.

TI  - Satellite remote sensing analysis to monitor revegetation in the Yangtze River basin, China
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Revegetation programmes aim to avoid land degradation, control soil erosion, reduce floods, and improve ecological conditions. China has planted billions of trees over the past 20 years. However, little is known about the effectiveness of this artificial revegetation and its consequences on China's national conservation policies and changes in biophysical factors at the county level. Here we use satellite time series data and develop a new metric, the revegetation index (RVI), that quickly monitors revegetation and its long-term changes. We found that the number of regions where the Grain to Green Program (GTGP) was successfully implemented was only about 55.8% of the areas of GTGP implementation. Surprisingly, we provide observational evidence that the implementation of the GTGP can decrease soil erosion and drought, and increase water availability, but revegetation in the Yangtze River basin (YRB) in China has a limited impact on soil erosion, water, and drought. In particular, for revegetation between 1999 and 2016, indicating that a previous assessment by the Government revealed as official statistics may have overestimated the effects of the ecological restoration practices.

TI  - Social Ethic or Spiritual Ethos? Non-Orthodox Christian and Coptic Orthodox Perspectives
T2  - STUDIES IN CHRISTIAN ETHICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article modestly anticipates the still-unfolding reception of the laudable document For the Life of the World: Toward a Social Ethos of the Orthodox Church by two broadly-envisioned communities-those of non-Orthodox Christians and Coptic Orthodox Christians. There is much to be commended by the former, especially regarding the document's balanced assessment amidst complicated issues uncharted in the Orthodox world. This balance is possible through the effective coalescence of a theocentric worldview, a comfort with mystery, and a loosely-defined Orthodox anthropology. Regarding the latter community, the document serves as a pioneering and bold example that does not neglect social relevance at the behest of theological commitments. At the same time, Coptic Orthodox Christians, in their insistence on the centrality of desert spirituality, are likely to question the document's sometimes tepid allusions to spiritual transformation, since the principal means out of which come social change, right action and good conscience for Orthodox Christians is through a life entrenched in Godward ascetic spirituality.

TI  - Worldviews and World-Pictures. Avoiding the Myth of the Semantic Given
T2  - TOPOI-AN INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper I focus on the notion of worldview as a conceptual scheme and the role of language in shaping our view of reality. In particular, I engage with Wittgenstein's notion of World-picture in order to suggest an alternative account to the deceptive dogmatic conception of worldview, which is exemplified by C.I. Lewis's account of cognitive experience. I argue that worldviews constitute the way in which the world is given in a particular socio-linguistic context and they presuppose the mastery of a World-picture, that is, the inherited background of our acting and thinking. First, I will distinguish between two different uses of the term "worldview". Then I will show the way in which a metaphysical-dogmatic conception of worldview leads to the Myth of the Semantic Given. Finally, I will present Wittgenstein's notion of World-picture and its connection to the notion of worldview.

TI  - Rerooting the core: Cold War anticommunism and North American Influence in Romanian postmodernism
T2  - NEOHELICON
M3  - Article
AB  - This article examines the range of the anticommunist Cold War mindset in Romanian postmodernism and its evolution from the pre-1989 "anti-political" ethos of writers to a public master narrative that led the competition for political, cultural and literary power after 1989. My main argument challenges the readings of East-Central European postmodernism that overstate its oppositional stance against state structures and its post-Cold War drive towards heteroglossia. Instead, I argue that Romanian postmodernism radicalized a Cold War Manichean worldview with a distinctly North American shape and prolonged its life into a public mythology of anticommunism that worked in service of the power structures of post-communism. With this view, I analyze the two historical stages of these literary and political entanglements. On the one hand, Romanian postmodernism emerged in the 1980s as a partially autocolonial iteration of the American postmodern theory and literature, whose anti-totalizing epistemology befitted the antitotalitarian drive of the pre-1989 literary intelligentsia. As such, Romanian postmodernists could channel their frustration with the regime through the metafictional deconstruction of historical truth and representation and through fictional allegories of the private individual. On the other hand, the principles of liberalism weaved into the literary program developed during the 1980s were recast after 1989 in support of the post-communist market capitalism. Consequently, Romanian postmodernists acted upon their aesthetic choices with a sense of political agency, by advocating a fast-track adjustment to Western type neoliberalism, which disabled the leftist arguments that had nurtured Western variants of postmodernism.

TI  - Resolving the paradox of posttraumatic growth and event centrality in trauma survivors
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAUMATIC STRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - When a traumatic experience is central to an individual's identity and worldview, it can result in either severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, perceived posttraumatic growth (PTG), or, paradoxically, both. To resolve this apparent paradox, we used network analytic methods to estimate the relations among components of event centrality (EC), PTSD symptoms, and PTG in 1,136 undergraduates who had experienced trauma. Participants completed surveys on their experiences with traumatic events as well as the degree to which they experienced PTSD symptoms, components of EC, and components of PTG. We performed network analysis to examine EC, PTSD, and PTG and identify which components of EC were most conducive to its associations with PTSD versus those with PTG. We found that the components of EC most associated with PTSD, the extent to which trauma serves as a script for the future, were markedly distinct from the components associated with PTG, the extent to which trauma is seen as a turning point in one's life. The combined findings suggest that EC may be a catalyst for subsequent positive or negative effects contingent upon how an individual interprets the centrality of their traumatic experience.

TI  - Soil moisture estimation using RISAT-1 and SENTINEL-1 data using modified Dubois model in comparison with averaged NDVI
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In past studies, several researchers took potential use of multi-temporal optical data and dual-polarized SAR data to assess drought by estimating soil moisture. In this study, Modified Dubois Model (MDM) semi-empirical model with Topp's model is used for retrieval of soil moisture. It involves retrieving the backscattering coefficient from RISAT-1 and SENTINEL-1 datasets to derive the surface roughness and soil moisture conditions. The estimated soil moisture retrieved from microwave SAR parameters is validated with field measurements provides soil moisture spatial variability over different land use classes and bare soil condition. The RISAT-1 derived soil moisture has R-2 = 0.53, whereas SENTINEL-1 shows R-2 = 0.84. It also confirms the possibility of two different polarization sigma degrees(HH) and sigma degrees(VV) backscatter involving MDM. It observes that SENTINEL-1 was found well correlated with ground-measured soil moisture. Also, the averaged NDVI sounds reliable with soil moisture ratio, which helps to understand the impact of agricultural drought monitoring.

TI  - How to Perform Repeat Sentinel Node Biopsy Safely After a Previous Mastectomy: Technical Features and Oncologic Outcomes
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The latest National Comprehensive Cancer Network Breast Cancer Guidelines still discourage repeat sentinel node biopsy (SNB) after mastectomy, and the largest multicentric study available reports only 35 cases in the absence of previous axillary dissection (AD). Methods From January 2003 to November 2018, 89 patients of the European Institute of Oncology with local recurrence of breast cancer after mastectomy, free of distant metastases, with a clinically negative axilla and a negative axillary ultrasound, in absence of AD, underwent lymphatic mapping before wide local excision. Results During surgery, SNB was successful for 99% of the patients, with 14% being metastatic. Additional metastatic nodes removed by AD after a positive sentinel node occurred in 82% of cases. After a medium follow-up period of 3.7 years, the overall survival rate was 96.7%, and the disease-free survival rate was 84.4%. No axillary relapse after AD was recorded. One patient who refused human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeted treatment experienced ipsilateral axillary recurrence after a negative repeat SNB. The first axillary level was never directly irradiated because all the patients with positive repeat SNB underwent AD. For invasive luminal-like HER2-negative recurrences, the metastatic sentinel node was significantly associated with the choice to prescribe adjuvant chemotherapy (p = 0.003). Conclusions In specialized centers, repeat axillary SNB for patients with local recurrence after mastectomy in the absence of previous AD can represent a safe option for detection and removal of occult axillary disease that would otherwise not be excised/irradiated to achieve better local control and could possibly influence the choice of adjuvant treatments.

TI  - Development and Internal Validation of a Preoperative Prediction Model for Sentinel Lymph Node Status in Breast Cancer: Combining Radiomics Signature and Clinical Factors
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeTo develop and internally validate a nomogram combining radiomics signature of primary tumor and fibroglandular tissue (FGT) based on pharmacokinetic dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) and clinical factors for preoperative prediction of sentinel lymph node (SLN) status in breast cancer patients. MethodsThis study retrospectively enrolled 186 breast cancer patients who underwent pretreatment pharmacokinetic DCE-MRI with positive (n = 93) and negative (n = 93) SLN. Logistic regression models and radiomics signatures of tumor and FGT were constructed after feature extraction and selection. The radiomics signatures were further combined with independent predictors of clinical factors for constructing a combined model. Prediction performance was assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC), calibration, and decision curve analysis. The areas under the ROC curve (AUCs) of models were corrected by 1,000-times bootstrapping method and compared by Delong's test. The added value of each independent model or their combinations was also assessed by net reclassification improvement (NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) indices. This report referred to the "Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis" (TRIPOD) statement. ResultsThe AUCs of the tumor radiomic model (eight features) and the FGT radiomic model (three features) were 0.783 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.717-0.849) and 0.680 (95% CI, 0.604-0.757), respectively. A higher AUC of 0.799 (95% CI, 0.737-0.862) was obtained by combining tumor and FGT radiomics signatures. By further combining tumor and FGT radiomics signatures with progesterone receptor (PR) status, a nomogram was developed and showed better discriminative ability for SLN status [AUC 0.839 (95% CI, 0.783-0.895)]. The IDI and NRI indices also showed significant improvement when combining tumor, FGT, and PR compared with each independent model or a combination of any two of them (all p < 0.05). ConclusionFGT and clinical factors improved the prediction performance of SLN status in breast cancer. A nomogram integrating the DCE-MRI radiomics signature of tumor and FGT and PR expression achieved good performance for the prediction of SLN status, which provides a potential biomarker for clinical treatment decision-making.

TI  - Spatiotemporal-Spectral Fusion for Gaofen-1 Satellite Images
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the limitations of hardware technology, satellite sensors cannot obtain images with high temporal, spatial, and spectral resolutions at the same time. Current spatiotemporal fusion methods try to solve the contradiction between temporal resolution and spatial resolution, which cannot achieve good reconstruction accuracy partly because the data sources are from heterogeneous platforms with long chains difficult to be modeled. Different from the crossing-platform fusion, this work proposes to improve the spatial and temporal resolutions on a single platform. For the 2-m panchromatic images, 8-m multispectral images, and 16-m wide-field-view images captured by the Gaofen-1 satellite, our goal is to produce 2-m multispectral images with high temporal resolutions. Two convolutional neural networks are built to solve this spatiotemporal-spectral fusion issue with pansharpening and spatiotemporal fusion in serial. In the validation stage, the 2-m multispectral images are built and evaluated with the panchromatic images and 8-m multispectral images. The digital and visual evaluations show that our method can produce visually acceptable fusion quality, which may enhance the feasibility of the Gaofen-1 data.

TI  - The impact of drainage pathways on the detection of nodal metastases in prostate cancer: a phase II randomized comparison of intratumoral vs intraprostatic tracer injection for sentinel node detection
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Previous studies indicated that location and amount of detected sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in prostate cancer (PCa) are influenced where SLN-tracer is deposited within the prostate. To validate whether intratumoral (IT) tracer injection helps to increase identification of tumor-positive lymph nodes (LNs) better than intraprostatic (IP) tracer injection, a prospective randomized phase II trial was performed.Methods PCa patients with a > 5% risk of lymphatic involvement were randomized between ultrasound-guided transrectal injection of indocyanine green-[Tc-99m]Tc-nanocolloid in 2 depots of 1 mL in the tumor (n = 55, IT-group) or in 4 depots of 0.5 mL in the peripheral zone of the prostate (n = 58, IP-group). Preoperative lymphoscintigraphy and SPECT/CT were used to define the location of the SLNs. SLNs were dissected using combination of radio- and fluorescence-guidance, followed by extended pelvic LN dissection and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. Outcome measurements were number of tumor-bearing SNs, tumor-bearing LNs, removed nodes, number of patients with nodal metastases, and metastasis-free survival (MFS) of 4-7-year follow-up data.Results IT-injection did not result in significant difference of removed SLNs (5.0 vs 6.0, p = 0.317) and histologically positive SLNs (28 vs 22, p = 0.571). However, in IT-group, the SLN-positive nodes were 73.7% of total positive nodes compared to 37.3% in IP-group (p = 0.015). Moreover, significantly more node-positive patients were found in IT-group (42% vs 24%, p = 0.045), which did not result in worse MFS. In two patients (3.6%) from whom the IT-tracer injection only partly covered intraprostatic tumor spread, nodal metastases in ePLND without tumor-positive SNs were yielded.Conclusions The percentage-positive SLNs found after IT-injection were significantly higher compared to IP-injection. Significantly more node-positive patients were found using IT-injection, which did not affect MFS. IT-injection failed to detect nodal metastases from non-index satellite lesions. Therefore, we suggest to combine IT- and IP-tracer injections in men with visible tumor on imaging.

TI  - An improved approach for monitoring urban built-up areas by combining NPP-VIIRS nighttime light, NDVI, NDWI, and NDBI
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate extraction of urban built-up areas is crucial to addressing environmental problems related to fast changes in urban land cover, which is fundamental for optimizing land use patterns and supporting global sustainable development. Nighttime light (NTL) from the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP-VIIRS) offer a new data source for extracting urban information. However, this kind of data suffer from drawbacks of blooming effects. To address this problem, in this study, the Enhanced Nighttime Light Urban Index (ENUI) approach, which involves the combination of NPP-VIIRS NTL with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), and Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), is proposed and tested. This approach was used to rapidly monitor the urban built-up areas in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area in 2012, 2015, and 2018. The average overall accuracy and Map-level Image Classification Efficacy (MICE) for the extraction results are 93.56% and 0.77, respectively, while those of the Local-Optimized Thresholding (LOT) are 86.48% and 0.54, respectively; meanwhile, the average F-score values, user's accuracy and producer's accuracy for urban areas using the proposed approach increased by 9.98%, 10.90% and 8.67%, respectively, compared with the LOT. These findings suggest that this approach has a higher extraction accuracy than the LOT; this is primarily ascribed to the integration of NTL data with the NDVI, NDWI, and NDBI, which increases the variability of nighttime light in the urban core area and adequately alleviates the blooming effects of nighttime light brightness in water bodies and vegetated areas. The proposed approach shows great potentials to accurately and effectively monitor multi-temporal urban information and address environmental issues using NPP-VIIRS NTL data in global urban agglomerations.

T2  - INFLUENZA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY VIRUSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Stringent public health measures imposed across Canada to control the COVID-19 pandemic have nearly suppressed most seasonal respiratory viruses, with the notable exception of human rhinovirus/enterovirus (hRV/EV). Thanks to this unexpected persistence, we highlight that hRV/EV could serve as a sentinel for levels of contact rate in populations to inform on the efficiency, or the need of, public health measures to control the subsequent COVID-19 epidemic, but also for future epidemics from other seasonal or emerging respiratory pathogens.

TI  - Overall survival after surgical staging by lymph node dissection versus sentinel lymph node biopsy in endometrial cancer: a national cancer database study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Substituting lymphadenectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy for staging purposes in endometrial cancer has raised concerns about incomplete nodal resection and detrimental oncological outcomes. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the association between the type of lymph node assessment and overall survival in endometrial cancer accounting for node status and histology. Methods Women with stage I-III endometrial cancer who underwent hysterectomy and lymph node assessment from January 2012 to December 2015 were identified in the National Cancer Database. Patients who underwent neoadjuvant therapy, had previous cancer, and whose follow-up was less than 90 days were excluded. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed to assess factors associated with overall survival. Results Of 68 614 patients, 64 796 (94.4%) underwent lymphadenectomy, 1777 (2.6%) underwent sentinel node biopsy only, and 2041 (3.0%) underwent both procedures. On multivariable analysis, neither sentinel lymph node biopsy alone nor sentinel node biopsy followed by lymphadenectomy was associated with significantly different overall survival compared with lymphadenectomy alone (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.17, and HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.08, respectively). When stratified by lymph node status, sentinel node biopsy alone or followed by lymphadenectomy was not associated with different overall survival, both in patients with negative (HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.24, and HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.27, respectively) or positive (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.52, and HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.04, respectively) lymph nodes. These findings held true when sentinel node biopsy alone and sentinel node biopsy plus lymphadenectomy groups were merged, and on stratification by histotype (type one vs type 2) or inclusion of only complete lymphadenectomy (at least 10 pelvic nodes and at least one para-aortic node removed). In all analyses, age, Charlson-Deyo score, black race, AJCC pathological T stage, grade, lymphovascular invasion, brachytherapy, and adjuvant chemotherapy were independently associated with overall survival. Discussion No difference in overall survival was found in patients with endometrial cancer who underwent sentinel node biopsy alone, sentinel node biopsy followed by lymphadenectomy, or lymphadenectomy alone. This observation remained regardless of node status, histotype, and lymphadenectomy extent.

TI  - High-resolution remote sensing data can predict household poverty in pastoral areas, Inner Mongolia, China
T2  - GEOGRAPHY AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate prediction of poverty is critical to efforts of poverty reduction, and high-resolution remote sensing (HRRS) data have shown great promise for facilitating such prediction. Accordingly, the present study used HRRS with 1 m resolution and 238 households data to evaluate the utility and optimal scale of HRRS data for predicting household poverty in a grassland region of Inner Mongolia, China. The prediction of household poverty was improved by using remote sensing indicators at multiple scales, instead of indicators at a single scale, and a model that combined indicators from four scales (building land, household, neighborhood, and regional) provided the most accurate prediction of household poverty, with testing and training accuracies of 48.57% and 70.83%, respectively. Furthermore, building area was the most efficient indicator of household poverty. When compared to conducing household surveys, the analysis of HRRS data is a cheaper and more time-efficient method for predicting household poverty and, in this case study, it reduced study time and cost by about 75% and 90%, respectively. This study provides the first evaluation of HRRS data for the prediction of household poverty in pastoral areas and thus provides technical support for the identification of poverty in pastoral areas around the world.

TI  - Machine learning-based estimates of aboveground biomass of subalpine forests using Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel-2B images in the Jiuzhaigou National Nature Reserve, Eastern Tibet Plateau
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimates of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) are critical for supporting strategies of ecosystem conservation and climate change mitigation. The Jiuzhaigou National Nature Reserve, located in Eastern Tibet Plateau, has rich forest resources on steep slopes and is very sensitive to climate change but plays an important role in the regulation of regional carbon cycles. However, an estimation of AGB of subalpine forests in the Nature Reserve has not been carried out and whether a global biomass model is available has not been determined. To provide this information, Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel-2B data were combined to estimate subalpine forest AGB using linear regression, and two machine learning approaches-random forest and extreme gradient boosting, with 54 inventory plots. Regardless of forest type, Observed AGB of the Reserve varied from 61.7 to 475.1 Mg ha(-1) with an average of 180.6 Mg ha(-1). Results indicate that integrating the Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel-2B imagery significantly improved model efficiency regardless of modelling approaches. The results highlight a potential way to improve the prediction of forest AGB in mountainous regions. Modelled AGB indicated a strong spatial variability. However, the modelled biomass varied greatly with global biomass products, indicating that global biomass products should be evaluated in regional AGB estimates and more field observations are required, particularly for areas with complex terrain to improve model accuracy.

TI  - Dynamics of human-induced lakes and their impact on land surface temperature in Toshka Depression, Western Desert, Egypt
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in land-use/land-cover (LULC) give rise to several environmental problems which modify the microclimate of a region. Therefore, land surface temperature (LST) is a significant environmental variable that is appreciably influenced by LULC changes. The main aim of this research was to quantify the impacts of LULC changes from the drying of Toshka Lakes on LST by remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) techniques. Landsat series Thematic Mapper (TM) and Operational Land Imager (OLI) satellite images were used to estimate LST from 2001 to 2019. Automated Water Extraction Index (AWEI) was applied to the mosaicked Landsat images to extract water bodies from the research area. Optimized Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI) was utilized to predict the reclaimed land in the Toshka region until 2019. The kappa coefficient had been involved in this research to assess the accuracy of water extraction. The results indicated a decrease in the lakes by about 1517.79 km(2) with an average increase in LST by about 25.02 degrees C from 2001 to 2019. It was observed that the dried areas of the lakes were converted to bare soil and are covered by salt crusts. The results indicated that the land-use change was a significant driver for the increased LST. The mean annual LST increased considerably by 0.6 degrees C/year from 2009 to 2019. A strong negative correlation between LST and Toshka Lakes area (R-square = 0.98) estimated from regression analysis implied that Toshka Lakes drying considerably affected the microclimate of the study area. Severe drought conditions, soil degradation, and many environmental issues were predicted due to the rise of LST in the research area. The findings of this research focus on the benefits of satellite data for assessing human-induced changes and their impacts on microclimate. There is an urgent need to develop favorable strategies for sustainable environmental management in the Toshka region.

TI  - Spatial distribution and interannual variability of cyanobacteria blooms on the North-Western shelf of the Black Sea in 1985-2019 from satellite data
T2  - HARMFUL ALGAE
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term high and medium resolution satellite data are used to study spatial, seasonal and interannual variability of the cyanobacteria blooms (CB) in the North-Western Shelf (NWS) of the Black Sea. High-resolution Landsat data demonstrate that CB were regularly observed in the study area on satellite images in 1985-2020. Comparison of quasi-synchronous Landsat and MODIS images was used to study the characteristic features of CB spectra, which are: a "step" formed by MODIS 3 (469) and 4 (488) channel, probably related to the absorption by photoprotective carotenoids; increased reflectance in near-infrared; maximum at 547-555 nm. On the base of these features, we develop the automated algorithm of CB identification and reconstruct the daily dataset of CB over 2003-2019. The main advantage of the developed algorithm is its ability to filter out non-bloom areas in all seasons and meteorological conditions and during blooms of other algae in the deep part of the sea. Analysis of this dataset, complemented by Landsat data, allows to identify two primary sources of the CB in the NWS: the Dnieper-Bug estuary and the Danube mouth, and study the evolution of CB in these areas in detail. CB can penetrate on more than 150 km from the sources reaching in rare cases the Crimean coast. Such offshore propagation is mainly wind-driven and was often related to the upwelling frontal currents. The climatic seasonal peak of CB near the Danube is observed in May-June following the peak of river discharge in April-May. It precedes the peak of CB near the Dnieper-Bug estuary observed during maximum surface heating in August. At the same time, the case study of bloom evolution in 2009 shows that CB can be observed in these areas several times in a season, triggered mainly by periods of low winds. The strongest bloom of CB in 2003-2019 was observed in 2004-2006 and 2008-2010 following by the sharp decrease after 2011. This decrease is related to the observed reduction of the river discharge and, more important, the rise of the wind intensity in summers of the recent period.

TI  - Modeling Spatio-temporal Drought Events Based on Multi-temporal, Multi-source Remote Sensing Data Calibrated by Soil Humidity
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Inspired by recent significant agricultural yield losses in the eastern China and a missing operational monitoring system, we developed a comprehensive drought monitoring model to better understand the impact of individual key factors contributing to this issue. The resulting model, the 'Humidity calibrated Drought Condition Index' (HcDCI) was applied for the years 2001 to 2019 in form of a case study to Weihai County, Shandong Province in East China. Design and development are based on a linear combination of the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), the Temperature Condition Index (TCI), and the Rainfall Condition Index (RCI) using multi-source satellite data to create a basic Drought Condition Index (DCI). VCI and TCI were derived from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data, while precipitation is taken from CHIRPS (Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data) data. For reasons of accuracy, the decisive coefficients were determined by the relative humidity of soils at depth of 10-20 cm of particular areas collected by an agrometeorological ground station. The correlation between DCI and soil humidity was optimized with the factors of 0.53, 0.33, and 0.14 for VCI, TCI, and RCI, respectively. The model revealed, light agricultural droughts from 2003 to 2013 and in 2018, while more severe droughts occurred in 2001 and 2002, 2014-2017, and 2019. The droughts were most severe in January, March, and December, and our findings coincide with historical records. The average temperature during 2012-2019 is 1 degrees C higher than that during the period 2001-2011 and the average precipitation during 2014-2019 is 192.77 mm less than that during 2008-2013. The spatio-temporal accuracy of the HcDCI model was positively validated by correlation with agricultural crop yield quantities. The model thus, demonstrates its capability to reveal drought periods in detail, its transferability to other regions and its usefulness to take future measures.

TI  - Dibenzoylmethane derivative inhibits melanoma cancer in vitro and in vivo through induction of intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways
T2  - CHEMICO-BIOLOGICAL INTERACTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Malignant melanoma has a low incidence, but is the most lethal type of skin cancer. Studies have shown that dibenzoylmethanes (DBMs) have interesting biological activities, including antineoplastic properties. These findings led us to investigate whether news DBM derivatives exert antitumor effects against skin cancers. In a previous study, we found that 1,3-diphenyl-2-benzyl-1,3-propanedione (DPBP) has high in vitro antineoplastic activity against murine B16F10 melanoma cells, with an IC50 of 6.25 mu g/mL. In the current study, we used transdermal and topical formulations of DPBP to evaluate its activity and molecular mechanism of action in a murine model of melanoma. The compound induces tumor cell death with high selectivity (selectivity index of 41.94) by triggering apoptosis through intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. DPBP treatment reduced tumor volume as well as serum VEGF-A and uric acid levels. Hepatomegaly and nephrotoxicity were not observed at the tested doses. Histopathological analysis of sentinel lymph nodes revealed no evidence of metastases. According to the observed data, the DPBP compound was effective for the topical treatment of melanoma cancer, suggesting that it acts as a chemotherapeutic or chemopreventive agent.

TI  - Study of GOES-R Thermodynamic Indices for Short-Term Forecasting of Convective Weather Events Using Machine Learning
T2  - PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forecast models (6-8 h) are proposed for predicting meteorological convective events (MCEs) based on machine learning algorithms for two preestablished areas I and II that correspond to the flight routes from Rio de Janeiro to Sao Paulo, Brazil. As input data, the models take five atmospheric instability indices, extracted from remotely sensed data retrieved from the GOES-R satellite, for January to March of 2018 and 2019. Temporal characterization for the events was carried out using lightning (i.e., atmospheric discharge) data from 2001 to 2019, and the hourly distribution defined the forecast period of the study. Five machine learning algorithms were selected and trained using 400 experiments aimed at forecasting MCEs and their severity. Statistics indicated that the multilayer perceptron and simple logistic algorithms showed the best forecast performance, with probability of detection of 0.86 and 0.94, false alarm rate of 0.14 and 0.08, bias of 1.00 and 1.01, F-measure of 0.86 and 0.94, and Kappa of 0.72 and 0.85 in area I and II, respectively. The hindcasting results for April 2020 reveal that the models can capture physical characteristics related to the convective event patterns and correctly forecast 96% of the days, and are tools that could be used to improve operational forecasts for aviation purposes in this region and elsewhere.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Dynamics of Surface Water in China from the 1980s to 2015 Based on Remote Sensing Monitoring
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and human interference play significant roles on dynamic of water body abundance, and drive related hydrological, biochemical and social/economic processes. Documenting and monitoring surface water area with high resolution multi-temporal satellite imagery provide new perspective to evaluate the dynamics of surface water area, especially in continental and global scale. In this study, based on the Landsat images from 1980s to 2015, we surveyed the spatial and temporal variation of surface water area, including rivers, lakes and reservoirs, in 10-yr temporal slice across China. Furthermore, the driving forces of the variation has been identified to reveal the interaction of water bodies and the changing environment. The results show that, the water surface area expanded over all three decades with strong spatial and temporal difference, despite the drier and warmer climate background; although lakes comprise the largest portion of the surface water area, the highest contributor of surface water expansion was new constructed reservoir located in the densely populated region; climatic parameters alteration, like precipitation and temperature, resulted in the water surface expansion in the northwestern basin by growing water input linked with rain and glacier melting; in the rest part of China, rise of water surface area was predominately attributed to human relocation of water resource, which yielded more new water storage area than the disappeared water body caused by less precipitation and stronger evapotranspiration. The conclusions highlight the integrative water resource management, especially in water conservation and restoration.

TI  - Malignant adenomyoepithelioma of the breast: Two case reports and review of the literature
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF CLINICAL CASES
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUNDMalignant adenomyoepithelioma (AME) of the breast is a rare tumor in which malignancy can arise from either epithelial or myoepithelial components, or from both cell types. The incidence and prognosis of malignant AME of the breast are difficult to assess due to its rarity. Therefore, the optimal treatment for this disease is still controversial.CASE SUMMARYWe present two middle-aged women (48 and 56 years old) with malignant AME of the breast. Core needle biopsy was performed before surgery. However, breast adenoma and malignant tumors were observed. The preoperative diagnosis of malignant AME of the breast is still challenging for pathologists and clinicians. Both patients underwent mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy, both of which were negative, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy.CONCLUSIONThe follow-up duration of the two patients was two years and four months, respectively. No signs of relapse or metastasis have been observed thus far.

TI  - The Making of Goliath: How the Chinese and Japanese far Left Perceived Israel as the 'Frontier' of Global Revolution in the 1950s-1970s
T2  - INTERNATIONAL HISTORY REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Exploring the perceptions held by the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Japanese Red Army (JRA) of the Arab-Israeli conflict, this paper argues that the pursuit of a worldwide Maoist revolution and t the sense of insecurity in the face of a perceived Western threat prompted the East Asian far-leftist government and organization to imagine the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a frontier of the East-West struggle and an epicenter for worldwide revolution. In their theoretical imagination, Israel was a microcosm of Western imperialism, and Arab states served as a buffer blocking that imperialism. In an anticipated domino effect, Israel's victories at the imagined 'frontier' were regarded as a precursor to a Western imperialist invasion of East Asia. This particular worldview not only prompted the global far left to delegitimize Israel, but also constructed a type of negative identity interdependence with Israel in which the far left denied all claims made by Israel as 'imperialist', while Israel saw all pressure from the global far left as simply 'anti-Israel' or even 'anti-Semitic'.

TI  - Modelling actual evapotranspiration using a two source energy balance model with Sentinel imagery in herbaceous-free and herbaceous-cover Mediterranean olive orchards
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Precipitation deficit and more extreme drought and precipitation events are expected to increase in the Mediterranean region due to global warming. A great part of this region is covered by olive orchards, representing 97.5% of the world's olive agricultural area. Thus, the adaptation of olive cultivation demands climate-smart management, such as the optimization of water use efficiency, since evapotranspiration is one of the most important components of the water balance. The novelty of this work is the combination of the remote sensing data fusion and the Two Source Energy Balance (TSEB) model (through Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 imagery) to estimate the actual daily evapotranspiration (ETd), at high spatial (20 m) and temporal (daily) resolution, in an olive orchard under two management regimes: herbaceous free (HF) and herbaceous-cover (HC); along a three years period, based on the hypothesis that TSEB is still able to track and estimate the evapotranspiration over more complex canopies. The study was carried out from 2016 to 2019 in an olive orchard in the South of Spain, where the flux estimates were validated and assessed by in situ eddy covariance (EC) measurements. The results show better agreement in HC for net radiation (R-n) and the soil heat flux (G), but similar for both surfaces regarding the sensible (H) and latent (lambda E) heat fluxes, as well as ETd. On both surfaces greater differences obtained at higher H, and the magnitude of overestimation of lambda E and ETd were influenced by the EC energy imbalance. By contrast, G was overestimated with HC probably influenced by herbs, and equally underestimated for HF surfaces. The obtained results are in agreement with similar studies in tree crop orchards, and show the consistency of the used methodology and its usefulness for some farming activities, even on the more heterogeneous surface.

TI  - Indonesia's 13558 islands: A new census from space and a first step towards a One Map for Small Islands Policy
T2  - MARINE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Indonesia is the largest country made only of islands, with previous census identifying between 13,000 and 25,000 islands. The current official figure puts the number at 17,508 islands. Landsat satellite images were used to provide a documented consistent inventory of the country's islands. A total of 13,558 islands were mapped considering a minimum size of about 0.001 km2-with 87% and 39% of the islands covering less than 1 and 0.01 km2 respectively. These numbers highlight the dominance of small to very small islands. Beyond providing new accurate spatial statistics, we argued that the island census could be the foundation of a One Map for Small Islands Policy. Indonesia launched its One Map Policy in 2017 to mitigate land use conflicts in the largest of the islands, but small islands have their own development, social and conservation issues, and an extension of the One Map Policy vision to Small Islands is warranted.

TI  - Advances in Amazonian Peatland Discrimination With Multi-Temporal PALSAR Refines Estimates of Peatland Distribution, C Stocks and Deforestation
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a data gap in our current knowledge of the geospatial distribution, type and extent of C rich peatlands across the globe. The Pastaza Maranon Foreland Basin (PMFB), within the Peruvian Amazon, is known to store large amounts of peat, but the remoteness of the region makes field data collection and mapping the distribution of peatland ecotypes challenging. Here we review methods for developing high accuracy peatland maps for the PMFB using a combination of multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical remote sensing in a machine learning classifier. The new map produced has 95% overall accuracy with low errors of commission (1-6%) and errors of omission (0-15%) for individual peatland classes. We attribute this improvement in map accuracy over previous maps of the region to the inclusion of high and low water season SAR images which provides information about seasonal hydrological dynamics. The new multi-date map showed an increase in area of more than 200% for pole forest peatland (6% error) compared to previous maps, which had high errors for that ecotype (20-36%). Likewise, estimates of C stocks were 35% greater than previously reported (3.238 Pg in Draper et al. (2014) to 4.360 Pg in our study). Most of the increase is attributed to pole forest peatland which contributed 58% (2.551 Pg) of total C, followed by palm swamp (34%, 1.476 Pg). In an assessment of deforestation from 2010 to 2018 in the PMFB, we found 89% of the deforestation was in seasonally flooded forest and 43% of deforestation was occurring within 1 km of a river or road. Peatlands were found the least affected by deforestation and there was not a noticeable trend over time. With development of improved transportation routes and population pressures, future land use change is likely to put South American tropical peatlands at risk, making continued monitoring a necessity. Accurate mapping of peatland ecotypes with high resolution (< 30 m) sensors linked with field data are needed to reduce uncertainties in estimates of the distribution of C stocks, and to aid in deforestation monitoring.

TI  - Raman Nanotags-Guided Intraoperative Sentinel Lymph Nodes Precise Location with Minimal Invasion
T2  - ADVANCED SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate positioning of sentinel lymph node (SLN) by tracers during surgery is an important prerequisite for SLN biopsy. A major problem of traditional tracers in SLN biopsy is the short surgery window due to the fast diffusion of tracers through the lymphatics, resulting in a misjudgment between SLN and second echelon lymph node (2(nd) LN). Here, a nontoxic Raman nanoparticle tracer, termed gap-enhanced Raman tags (GERTs), for the accurate intraoperative positioning of SLNs with a sufficient surgical time window is designed. In white New Zealand rabbit models, GERTs enable precise identification of SLNs within 10 min, as well as provide the surgeon with a more than 4 h time window to differentiate SLN and 2(nd) LN. In addition, the ultrahigh sensitivity of GERTs (detection limit is 0.5 x 10(-12) m) allows detection of labeled SLNs before surgery, thereby providing preoperative positioning information for minimally invasive surgery. Comprehensive biosafety evaluations carried out in the context of the Food and Drug Administration and International Standard Organization demonstrate no significant toxicity of GERTs, which supports a promising clinical translation opportunity of GERTs for precise SLN identification in breast cancer.

TI  - Describing the indirect impact of COVID-19 on healthcare utilisation using syndromic surveillance systems
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Since the end of January 2020, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has been responsible for a global health crisis. In England a number of non-pharmaceutical interventions have been introduced throughout the pandemic, including guidelines on healthcare attendance (for example, promoting remote consultations), increased handwashing and social distancing. These interventions are likely to have impacted the incidence of non-COVID-19 conditions as well as healthcare seeking behaviour. Syndromic Surveillance Systems offer the ability to monitor trends in healthcare usage over time. Methods This study describes the indirect impact of COVID-19 on healthcare utilisation using a range of syndromic indicators including eye conditions, mumps, fractures, herpes zoster and cardiac conditions. Data from the syndromic surveillance systems monitored by Public Health England were used to describe the number of contacts with NHS 111, general practitioner (GP) In Hours (GPIH) and Out-of-Hours (GPOOH), Ambulance and Emergency Department (ED) services over comparable periods before and during the pandemic. Results The peak pandemic period in 2020 (weeks 13-20), compared to the same period in 2019, displayed on average a 12% increase in NHS 111 calls, an 11% decrease in GPOOH consultations, and a 49% decrease in ED attendances. In the GP In Hours system, conjunctivitis consultations decreased by 64% and mumps consultations by 31%. There was a 49% reduction in attendance at EDs for fractures, and there was no longer any weekend increase in ED fracture attendances, with similar attendance patterns observed across each day of the week. There was a decrease in the number of ED attendances with diagnoses of myocardial ischaemia. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic drastically impacted healthcare utilisation for non-COVID-19 conditions, due to a combination of a probable decrease in incidence of certain conditions and changes in healthcare seeking behaviour. Syndromic surveillance has a valuable role in describing and understanding these trends.

TI  - Discovery of novel phenaleno isoquinolinium-based fluorescence imaging agents for sentinel lymph node mapping
T2  - JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY B
M3  - Article
AB  - Fluorescence imaging agents have recently received huge attention due to their important role in disease diagnostics. However, the intrinsic problems of these probes, such as complex synthetic routes and high molecular weight, remain challenging. Here, we developed novel phenaleno isoquinolinium-based fluorescent agents, Medical Fluorophores 37-41 (MF37-41), applicable to the quantitative and sensitive detection of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). These imaging agents showed no adverse effects on the proliferation of immune and normal cells and did not induce in vivo toxicity. In vivo fluorescence lifetime imaging demonstrated the accumulation of phenaleno isoquinolinium salts in the SLNs of nude mice within 15 min postinjection, consistent with our biodistribution findings. These results suggest that phenaleno isoquinolinium salts are feasible fluorescence imaging agents that can be used as potential lymphatic tracers.

TI  - Monitoring coastline variations in the Pearl River Estuary from 1978 to 2018 by integrating Canny edge detection and Otsu methods using long time series Landsat dataset
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - The coastline of the Pearl River Estuary (PRE) experienced significant changes due to the increasing demand for land. Previous studies have focused on coastline changes of the mainland in China; thus changes of island coastlines have not been well investigated. In this study, the coastlines of the continent and islands of the Pearl River Estuary from 1978 to 2018 were extracted and analyzed by integrating Canny edge detection and Otsu methods based on Landsat data, and the coastline was classified into six types including biological, sandy, muddy, estuarine, rocky, and artificial via visual interpretation. The coastline length, coastline change rate and change area were calculated and analyzed for the 40 years period. The precision test showed that the coastline extraction methods presented in this paper meet the accuracy standard. The coastline length of the Pearl River Estuary was found to have increased rapidly from 789 km in 1978 to 979 km in 2018. During the past four decades, a large proportion of natural coastline converted into artificial one (66% in 2018), while 577 km(2) land increased in this area. The coastline of the western PRE demonstrates more rapid change rates than that of the eastern part, and more land reclamation has occurred in the western area. Between 1988 and 1997, the coastline length and area of reclamation experienced the most extensive changes. Both natural factors, including sediment transport, sea-level rise, wind, tide, as well as anthropogenic factors, such as land reclamation and dam construction, have impacted coastline variation of the Pearl River Estuary in the past four decades. In general, the western part of the study area showed more remarkable coastline change and experienced the enormous influence of land reclamation, dam construction and sediment transport, compared with the eastern part.

TI  - An automated land surface temperature modelling tool box designed using spatial technique for ArcGIS
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The land surface temperature calculation is tedious as it requires different formulas for calculation. To estimate surface temperature the Thermal band can be used which consists of thermal data of demarcated location. The ArcGIS model builder is used for designing the Land Surface Temperature (LST) calculation toolbox, which involves all the steps and process used for LST calculation. The Landsat 8 images consists of two thermal band i.e., Band 10 and 11. The band 10 is used for analysis purpose due to less disturbance as suggested by United States Geological Survey (USGS). Along with thermal band two more bands are used red band 4 and near infrared band 5. For the calculation constant values are required which are collected from the metadata file supplied with the Landsat package. The results shows that the tool box is used for quick calculation of LST of any location. The results of LST tool and manual temperature shows positive agreement. This tool will help researchers on paying less attention on calculation part and more attention on research. The LST tool can be extended with incorporation of LST calculation for Landsat 5 and 7 images.

TI  - The investigation of the relation between expansion strategy and outcomes of two-stage expander-implant breast reconstruction
T2  - GLAND SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Numerous risk factors for the complications of two-stage, immediate implant-based breast reconstruction have been identified, although few studies have directly examined the impact of breast size and expansion protocols on the surgical outcomes of breast reconstruction. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of breast size, expansion velocity, and volume-related variables on postoperative complications of breast reconstruction.Methods: The cohort involved patients who underwent immediate breast expander reconstruction at a single center between 2017 and 2019. The breast size was classified into three categories according to the weight of the mastectomy specimen as small (<300 g), medium (>= 300 g, <= 500 g), or large (>500 g). Multifactorial logistic regressions were used to assess the impact of variables, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to determine the optimal cut-off value for predicting the complication event.Results: Of the 174 breasts (168 patients), 51 (29.3%), 66 (37.9%), and 57 (32.6%) breasts were classified as small, medium, and large, respectively. The rate of infection (P=0.014) and expander/implant failure (P=0.007) significantly differed according to breast size, with the rate being the highest in large breasts. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that body mass index (BMI) [odds ratio (OR): 1.25; P=0.003], nipple-sparing mastectomy (OR: 2.82; P=0.036), sentinel biopsy (OR: 5.10; P=0.016), final expansion volume (OR: 0.99; P=0.022), and expansion velocity (OR: 0.703; P=0.024) were significant independent predictors of any complication. In the ROC analysis, breast weight >696 g could predict the possibility of revision surgery, with a sensitivity of 42.9% and specificity of 81.8%.Conclusion: The final expansion volume and expansion velocity have a significant negative relationship with overall complications in breast reconstruction. A standard expansion protocol needs to be established to ensure the success of two-stage breast reconstruction.

TI  - Hierarchical landform delineation for the habitats of biological communities on the Korean Peninsula
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Landforms determine the locations of particular biological communities based on their components and spatial positions. This study hierarchically classified the topographic spaces serving as habitats for biological communities in the Korean Peninsula and established the habitat types that occur on the classified landform types. We classified landform types by applying cell-based modeling, map algebra, and spatial query techniques to spatial data, including digital elevation model (DEM), Sentinel 2 image, land use, and field survey data to model their ecological characteristics. Landforms were classified into four categories (designated Category 1 through 4) according to their spatial scale based on topographical characteristics such as mountains, plains, alluvial landforms, coastal landforms, islands, and special areas (Baekdudaegan, DMZ), which are found throughout the Korean Peninsula. The landforms of the Korean Peninsula were classified into 47 subcategories in Category 1, 16 in Category 2, 36 in Category 3, and 63 in Category 4. There were 62 main types of habitats that were classified based on their topographic spatial units, and there were 437 types of sub-habitats, for which soil weathering, biodiversity, and geodiversity were combined with the main habitat types. When factor analysis was conducted for the environmental factors used to determine the main and sub-habitats, the first primary components were temperature-related factors, followed by biodiversity, geodiversity, aspect, and slope. When the indicator species were analyzed by habitat type, indicator species diversity was high in Jeju Province, Gangwon Province, and Gaema Plateau. Based on these results, landform elements for species habit conservation were assigned conservation values and classified into (I) absolute conservation areas, (II) transition areas, and (III) areas for coexistence with humans. Topographic spaces are being degraded as biological habitats as a result of climate change and human development; our proposed classifications can be applied to the conservation of landforms and biodiversity.

TI  - Towards a regional high-resolution bathymetry of the North West Shelf of Australia based on Sentinel-2 satellite images, 3D seismic surveys, and historical datasets
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - High-resolution bathymetry forms critical datasets for marine geoscientists. It can be used to characterize the seafloor and its marine habitats, to understand past sedimentary records, and even to support the development of offshore engineering projects. Most methods to acquire bathymetry data are costly and can only be practically deployed in relatively small areas. It is therefore critical to develop cost-effective and advanced techniques to produce regional-scale bathymetry datasets.This paper presents an integrated workflow that builds on satellites images and 3D seismic surveys, integrated with historical depth soundings, to generate regional high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs). The method was applied to the southern half of Australia's North West Shelf and led to the creation of new high-resolution bathymetry grids, with a resolution of 10 x 10 m in nearshore areas and 30 x 30 m elsewhere.The vertical and spatial accuracy of the datasets have been assessed using open-source Laser Airborne Depth Sounder (LADS) and multibeam echosounder (MBES) surveys as a reference. The comparison of the datasets indicates that the seismic-derived bathymetry has a vertical accuracy better than 1 m + 2 % of the absolute water depth, while the satellite-derived bathymetry has a depth accuracy better than 1 m + 5 % of the absolute water depth. This 30 x 30 m dataset constitutes a significant improvement of the pre-existing regional 250 x 250 m grid and will support the onset of research projects on coastal morphologies, marine habitats, archaeology, and sedimentology.All source datasets are publicly available, and the methods are fully integrated into Python scripts, making them readily applicable elsewhere in Australia and around the world.

TI  - Soil Moisture in a Vegetation-Covered Area Using the Improved Water Cloud Model Based on Remote Sensing
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The vegetation canopy parameters in the water cloud model originate from the surface spectrum of the vegetation canopy and do not fully consider its spatial structure, biomass, and water content. This study resolved this problem using a new vegetation canopy water content calculation method to improve the water cloud model. Our results showed that the novel calculation method, which considers the vertical and horizontal structure, biomass, and the water content of the canopy, is suitable for obtaining a more accurate estimation of the vegetation canopy water content. Additionally, this improved water cloud model (IWCM) was used to retrieve the soil moisture content of often greenwood, deciduous forest, mixed forest-, composite shrub grass-, and grassland-covered areas. The tenfold cross-validation determination coefficient (R-2) of the soil moisture content model was 0.43. The relative root mean square error (rRMSE) was 21.89%. When applied to deciduous forest, composite shrub grass, and grassland-covered areas, R-2 = 0.57 and rRMSE = 16.48% were obtained. When the IWCM was applied only to the composite shrub grass- and grassland-covered areas, the R-2 was 0.76, and rRMSE was 9.8%. Therefore, the IWCM provides new insights regarding the remote sensing quantitative inversion of soil moisture content in areas with high vegetation density and woodland cover, which can be applied in the future.

TI  - Leveraging machine learning for quantitative precipitation estimation from Fengyun-4 geostationary observations and ground meteorological measurements
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Deriving large-scale and high-quality precipitation products from satellite remote-sensing spectral data is always challenging in quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE), and limited studies have been conducted even using China's latest Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) geostationary satellite. Taking three rainstorm events over South China as examples, a machine-learning-based regression model was established using the random forest (RF) method to derive QPE from FY-4A observations, in conjunction with cloud parameters and physical quantities. The cross-validation results indicate that both daytime (DQPE) and nighttime (NQPE) RF algorithms performed well in estimating QPE, with the bias score, correlation coefficient and root-mean-square error of DQPE (NQPE) of 2.17 (2.42), 0.79 (0.83) and 1.77 mmh(-1) (2.31 mmh(-1)), respectively. Overall, the algorithm has a high accuracy in estimating precipitation under the heavyrain level or below. Nevertheless, the positive bias still implies an overestimation of precipitation by the QPE algorithm, in addition to certain misjudgements from nonprecipitation pixels to precipitation events. Also, the QPE algorithm tends to underestimate the precipitation at the rainstorm or even above levels. Compared to single-sensor algorithms, the developed QPE algorithm can better capture the spatial distribution of land-surface precipitation, especially the centre of strong precipitation. Marginal difference between the data accuracy over sites in urban and rural areas indicate that the model performs well over space and has no evident dependence on landscape. In general, our proposed FY-4A QPE algorithm has advantages for quantitative estimation of summer precipitation over East Asia.

TI  - Demographic, Behavioral, and Clinical Characteristics of Persons Seeking Care at Sexually Transmitted Disease Clinics-14 Sites, STD Surveillance Network, United States, 2010-2018
T2  - MMWR SURVEILLANCE SUMMARIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Problem: Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are a major cause of morbidity in the United States, with an estimated $15.9 billion in lifetime direct medical costs. Although the majority of STDs are diagnosed in the private sector, publicly funded STD clinics have an important role in providing comprehensive sexual health care services, including STD and HIV screening, for a broad range of patients. In certain cases, STD clinics often are the only source of sexual health care for patients, particularly among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM).Period Covered: 2010-2018.Description of the System: The STD Surveillance Network (SSuN) is an ongoing sentinel surveillance system for monitoring clinical information among patients attending STD clinics. SSuN is a collaboration of competitively selected state and city health departments that conduct facility-based sentinel surveillance in STD clinics. Information routinely collected through the course of patient encounters is obtained for all patients seeking care in the participating STD clinics. This information includes demographic, behavioral, and clinical characteristics (e.g., STD and HIV tests performed and STD and HIV diagnoses). This report presents 2010-2018 SSuN data from 14 STD clinics in five cities (Baltimore, Maryland; New York City, New York; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; San Francisco, California; and Seattle, Washington) to describe the patient populations seeking care in these STD clinics. Estimated numbers and percentages of patients receiving selected STD-related health services were calculated for each year by using an inverse variance weighted random-effects model, adjusting for heterogeneity among SSuN jurisdictions. Trends in receipt of selected STD-related health services were examined and included HIV screening after an acute STD diagnosis among persons not previously known to have HIV infection, annual chlamydia screening among adolescent and young females, and extragenital chlamydia and gonorrhea screening among MSM.Results: During 2010-2018, the total number of annual visits made in the 14 participating STD clinics decreased 29.8% (from 145,728 to 102,275 visits), and the total number of unique patients examined in the clinics decreased 35.1% (from 94,281 to 61,172 patients). Decreases in the number of unique patients occurred both among men who have sex with women only (42.4%; from 37,842 in 2010 to 21,781 in 2018) and among females (51.4%; from 36,485 in 2010 to 17,721 in 2018). The decreases in the number of female patients were observed across all age groups, although they were more pronounced among females aged <= 24 years (66.4%; from 17,721 in 2010 to 5,962 in 2018). In contrast, the number of patients identified as MSM increased 44.0% (from 12,859 in 2010 to 18,512 in 2018), with the greatest increase among MSM aged >= 25 years (58.6%; from 9,918 in 2010 to 15,733 in 2018). Among visits during which an acute STD (defined as chlamydia, gonorrhea, or primary or secondary syphilis) was diagnosed, the percentage of visits during which an HIV test was performed within approximately 14 days of the STD diagnosis increased from 58.2% in 2010 to 70.2% in 2018. Among those patients tested, 1,672 HIV infections were identified, of which 84.0% were among MSM. Among females aged 15-24 years, the percentage screened for chlamydia in any calendar year increased from 88.6% in 2010 to 90.6% in 2018. However, because fewer females aged 15-24 years attended these clinics during the study period, the crude number of adolescent and young females tested for chlamydia decreased from 14,249 in 2010 to 4,507 in 2018. During 2010-2018, the percentage of females retested after their first positive chlamydia diagnosis during the same year ranged from 11.4% to 13.3%. During 2010-2018, the percentage of MSM tested for rectal chlamydia and rectal gonorrhea increased (from 54.7% to 57.8% and from 55.0% to 58.4%, respectively). During the same period, increases were noted in the percentage of MSM with diagnosed rectal chlamydia (from 15.5% in 2010 to 17.7% in 2018) and rectal gonorrhea (from 13.3% in 2010 to 17.1% in 2018). In contrast with pharyngeal chlamydia, pharyngeal gonorrhea screening was more common (from 69.5% in 2010 to 74.6% in 2018), and the percentage positive doubled during the study period (from 7.3% in 2010 to 14.8% in 2018). Pharyngeal chlamydia testing also increased (from 50.3% in 2010 to 72.9% in 2018), with concurrent decreases in positivity (from 4.2% in 2010 to 2.6% in 2018).Interpretation: During 2010-2018, changes occurred in the demographic composition of patients attending STD clinics participating in SSuN. Understanding trends in the demographic profile of STD patients and services provided can help identify addressable gaps in STD control efforts and direct public health action. Overall, fewer females, especially those aged 15-24 years, accessed care in these STD clinics during the study period. Untreated STDs among adolescent and young females can have serious consequences, including pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility. Additional efforts to monitor where adolescent and young females seek care and to ensure they are receiving quality STD-related health services are needed, especially considering increases in reported cases of STDs among females. Increases in the number of MSM attending STD clinics present a unique opportunity to reach this population with STD and HIV prevention services. Although a large percentage of STD cases are diagnosed outside of STD clinics, publicly funded STD clinics are an important safety-net provider of STD-related health services and provide vital STD-related health services for patient populations at risk for the consequences of STDs and HIV infection.Public Health Actions: STD-related health services represent effective strategies for preventing STD and HIV transmission and acquisition or STD-related sequelae. Ensuring that all persons receive quality HIV and STD prevention and treatment services is vital for an effective public health approach to reducing STDs. STD clinics provide crucial safety-net services for preventing STD-related morbidity, including timely identification and treatment of curable STDs such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis. Increases in the numbers of MSM attending STD clinics participating in SSuN provide additional opportunities for linking patients to high-impact HIV preventive services (e.g., pre-exposure prophylaxis), and the clinics are positioned to facilitate initiation or resumption of treatment among persons living with HIV.

TI  - Omitting SLNB in Breast Cancer: Is a Nomogram the Answer?
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Backgrounds. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is standard care as a staging procedure in patients with invasive breast cancer. The axillary recurrence rate, even after positive SLNB, is low. This raises serious doubts regarding the clinical value of SLNB in early breast cancer. The purpose of this study is to select patients with low suspected axillary burden in whom SLNB might be omitted.Patients and Methods. We retrospectively analyzed 2015 primary breast cancer patients between 2007 and 2015, with 982 patients allocated to the training and 961 to the validation cohort. Variables associated with nodal disease were analyzed and used to build a nomogram for predicting nodal disease.Results. A total of 32.8% of patients had macrometastatic disease. A predictive model was constructed based on age, cN0, morphology, grade, multifocality, and tumor size with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.83. Considering a false-negative rate of 5%, 32.8% of patients could be spared axillary surgery. In a subanalysis of patients with relatively favorable characteristics, 26.8% had less than 5% chance of macrometastases.Conclusions. We present a model with excellent predictive value that can select one-third of patients in whom SLNB is deemed not necessary because of less than 5% chance of nodal involvement. Whether missing 1 in 20 patients with macrometastatic disease is worthwhile balanced against preventing side-effects of the SLN procedure remains to be established. A number of ongoing large prospective trials evaluating the outcome of omitting SLNB are awaited. Meanwhile, this nomogram may be used for individual decision-making.

TI  - Are elevated moist layers a blind spot for hyperspectral infrared sounders? A model study
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The ability of the hyperspectral satellite-based passive infrared (IR) instrument IASI to resolve elevated moist layers (EMLs) within the free troposphere is investigated. EMLs are strong moisture anomalies with significant impact on the radiative heating rate profile and typically coupled to freezing level detrainment from convective cells in the tropics. A previous case study by indicated inherent deficiencies of passive satellite-based remote sensing instruments in resolving an EML. In this work, we first put the findings of into the context of other retrieval case studies of EML-like structures, showing that such structures can in principle be retrieved, but retrievability depends on the retrieval method and the exact retrieval setup. To approach a first more systematic analysis of EML retrievability, we introduce our own basic optimal estimation (OEM) retrieval, which for the purpose of this study is based on forward-modelled (synthetic) clear-sky observations. By applying the OEM retrieval to the same EML case as , we find that a lack of independent temperature information can significantly deteriorate the humidity retrieval due to a strong temperature inversion at the EML top. However, we show that by employing a wider spectral range of the hyperspectral IR observation, this issue can be avoided and EMLs can generally be resolved. We introduce a new framework for the identification and characterization of moisture anomalies, a subset of which are EMLs, to specifically quantify the retrieval's ability to capture moisture anomalies. The new framework is applied to 1288 synthetic retrievals of tropical ocean short-range forecast model atmospheres, allowing for a direct statistical comparison of moisture anomalies between the retrieval and the reference dataset. With our basic OEM retrieval, we find that retrieved moisture anomalies are on average 17 % weaker and 15 % thicker than their true counterparts. We attribute this to the retrieval smoothing error and the fact that rather weak and narrow moisture anomalies are most frequently missed by the retrieval. Smoothing is found to also constrain the magnitude of local heating rate extremes associated with moisture anomalies, particularly for the strongest anomalies that are found in the lower to mid troposphere. In total, about 80 % of moisture anomalies in the reference dataset are found by the retrieval. Below 5 km altitude, this fraction is only of the order of 52 %. We conclude that the retrieval of lower- to mid-tropospheric moisture anomalies, in particular of EMLs, is possible when the anomaly is sufficiently strong and its thickness is at least of the order of about 1.5 km. This study sets the methodological basis for more comprehensively investigating EMLs based on real hyperspectral IR observations and their operational products in the future.

TI  - Gold mineralization in the Ajibarang and Majenang blocks, Central Java, Indonesia: Evidence of mineral fertility of the Banyumas basin
T2  - GEOLOGICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Banyumas basin is not only of interest as a hydrocarbon exploration target but also because of its potential to host epithermal gold and porphyry-type deposits. To date, very few studies have been done on the significance of basin tectonics related to mineralization, but such studies are critically needed. This paper is aimed at reviewing and describing characteristics of gold and base-metal mineralization that were recently discovered in the Banyumas basin, focusing on the Ajibarang and Majenang blocks, followed by a discussion of the mineral fertility of the basin. Various primary data collected by the authors during fieldwork with several mineral exploration companies together with data from current research results are reviewed, interpreted, and discussed. Two different styles of gold mineralization are recognized, that is, carbonate-base metal-gold/intermediate-sulphidation epithermal mineralization in the Ajibarang Block and porphyry-style mineralization in the Majenang Block, which occur in close proximity to each other (40-50 km distance) in different geological settings. The Ajibarang mineralization is hosted by a turbidite sedimentary sequence forming part of the Halang Formation, which is phreatically brecciated (diatreme), whereas the Majenang mineralization was formed in the Kumbang Formation in a volcanic and intrusive (diorite) environment. Diatreme breccias associated with gold-base metal mineralization in the Ajibarang Block may be related to remnant hydrothermal activity, recognized in Landsat TM imagery as circular structures. However, it remains unclear whether any volcanic/intrusive activity was directly involved in the formation of the mineralization. In contrast, the Majenang porphyry mineralization is clearly related to magmatism as it is hosted by volcanics of the Kumbang Formation and a diorite as the causative intrusion. The recent discovery of mineralization in both locations suggests the mineralization fertility of the Banyumas basin may be significant, making the region a valuable target for future exploration.

TI  - Relationship between vegetation phenology and snow cover changes during 2001-2018 in the Qilian Mountains
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation phenology has a profound impact on soil and water conservation and biogeochemical cycles, while its relationship with snow parameters has not been well addressed for parts of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). In this study, we identified the variations in vegetation phenology and showed its correlation with snow cover for varied underlying conditions and elevation zones in the Qilian Mountains (QLMs) in northern parts of the QTP based on the MODIS NDVI product (MOD13Q1) and snow cover area dataset. Partial correlation analysis demonstrated that end of snow cover (SCE) is negatively correlated to the start of the growing season (SOS) in relatively higher mountains, but it is positively correlated to SOS around Qinghai Lake and eastern Lenglongling Mountain. On the contrary, the snow cover duration (SCD) is positively correlated with the length of the growing season (LOS) in most parts of the QLMs, but it is negatively correlated with LOS in Lenglongling Mountain and around Qinghai Lake. The influences of snow cover on vegetation phenology depend on the underlying surface conditions which are evidenced by a stronger correlation between the start of snow cover and SCD and SOS of grassland than that of brushland, cropland, and woodland, while the influences of SCE on vegetation phenology are weak. The correlation between snow parameters and vegetation phenological events is significant on the south slopes 30 degrees C with elevation zones of 3500-4200 m asl and < 2800 m asl. The results of the study are significant for facilitating research in the management of the cold region eco-environment in the QLMs.

TI  - Poorly Conserved P15 Proteins of Cileviruses Retain Elements of Common Ancestry and Putative Functionality: A Theoretical Assessment on the Evolution of Cilevirus Genomes
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The genus Cilevirus groups enveloped single-stranded (+) RNA virus members of the family Kitaviridae, order Martellivirales. Proteins P15, scarcely conserved polypeptides encoded by cileviruses, have no apparent homologs in public databases. Accordingly, the open reading frames (ORFs) p15, located at the 5 '-end of the viral RNA2 molecules, are considered orphan genes (ORFans). In this study, we have delved into ORFs p15 and the relatively poorly understood biochemical properties of the proteins P15 to posit their importance for viruses across the genus and theorize on their origin. We detected that the ORFs p15 are under purifying selection and that, in some viral strains, the use of synonymous codons is biased, which might be a sign of adaptation to their plant hosts. Despite the high amino acid sequence divergence, proteins P15 show the conserved motif [FY]-L-x(3)-[FL]-H-x-x-[LIV]-S-C-x-C-x(2)-C-x-G-x-C, which occurs exclusively in members of this protein family. Proteins P15 also show a common predicted 3D structure that resembles the helical scaffold of the protein ORF49 encoded by radinoviruses and the phosphoprotein C-terminal domain of mononegavirids. Based on the 3D structural similarities of P15, we suggest elements of common ancestry, conserved functionality, and relevant amino acid residues. We conclude by postulating a plausible evolutionary trajectory of ORFans p15 and the 5 '-end of the RNA2 of cileviruses considering both protein fold superpositions and comparative genomic analyses with the closest kitaviruses, negeviruses, nege/kita-like viruses, and unrelated viruses that share the ecological niches of cileviruses.

TI  - Estimation of temporal snowmelt runoff using geospatial technique in Gangotri glacier basin, Uttarakhand, India
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Greater Himalaya, accommodating huge ice mass in the form of glaciers and snow cover, comprises a source of many perennial rivers. Gangotri glacier, one of the largest glaciers, located in the Central Himalaya is a major source of water for the river Bhagirathi, a tributary of the Ganges. In the present study, an attempt is made to model glacier melt runoff of the Gangotri glacier basin, over a continuous time period from the year 2010-2019 using MODIS satellite data and by employing the SNOWMOD model in the GIS domain. Parameters pertaining to snow cover area, snow-free area, and subsurface flow including climatic parameters viz., temperature, and precipitation, for different elevation zones, were computed. The peak discharge was observed in the year 2010 (256.79m3/sec) in contrast to the lowest melt discharge (80.65 m3/sec) in the year 2019 reflecting marked changes possibly due to reduced precipitation and higher intensity of insolation. The decrement in the melt discharge from 2010 (256.79m3/sec) to 2012 (83.53 m3/sec) followed by increment up to 2016 (204.06 m3/sec), and subsequent fall till 2019 (80.65 m3/sec) reflects vast climatic fluctuation. A positive correlation of estimated discharge with temperature and precipitation reflects glacier melt discharge as a potential indicator of climate change. The study proved the potential of satellite data in the accurate assessment of snowmelt runoff in data-scarce and inaccessible terrain of the Himalayas.

TI  - Testing stomatal models at the stand level in deciduous angiosperm and evergreen gymnosperm forests using CliMA Land (v0.1)
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - At the leaf level, stomata control the exchange of water and carbon across the air-leaf interface. Stomatal conductance is typically modeled empirically, based on environmental conditions at the leaf surface. Recently developed stomatal optimization models show great skills at predicting carbon and water fluxes at both the leaf and tree levels. However, how well the optimization models perform at larger scales has not been extensively evaluated. Furthermore, stomatal models are often used with simple single-leaf representations of canopy radiative transfer (RT), such as big-leaf models. Nevertheless, the single-leaf canopy RT schemes do not have the capability to model optical properties of the leaves nor the entire canopy. As a result, they are unable to directly link canopy optical properties with light distribution within the canopy to remote sensing data observed from afar. Here, we incorporated one optimization-based and two empirical stomatal models with a comprehensive RT model in the land component of a new Earth system model within CliMA, the Climate Modelling Alliance. The model allowed us to simultaneously simulate carbon and water fluxes as well as leaf and canopy reflectance and fluorescence spectra. We tested our model by comparing our modeled carbon and water fluxes and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) to two flux tower observations (a gymnosperm forest and an angiosperm forest) and satellite SIF retrievals, respectively. All three stomatal models quantitatively predicted the carbon and water fluxes for both forests. The optimization model, in particular, showed increased skill in predicting the water flux given the lower error (ca. 14.2 % and 21.8 % improvement for the gymnosperm and angiosperm forests, respectively) and better 1:1 comparison (slope increases from ca. 0.34 to 0.91 for the gymnosperm forest and from ca. 0.38 to 0.62 for the angiosperm forest). Our model also predicted the SIF yield, quantitatively reproducing seasonal cycles for both forests. We found that using stomatal optimization with a comprehensive RT model showed high accuracy in simulating land surface processes. The ever-increasing number of regional and global datasets of terrestrial plants, such as leaf area index and chlorophyll contents, will help parameterize the land model and improve future Earth system modeling in general.

TI  - Primary Giant Cell Tumor of the Breast With Pulmonary Metastasis: A Case Report and Review of the Literature
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Giant cell tumor of soft tissue (GCT-ST) is an extremely rare tumor that is similar in morphology and immunohistochemistry to giant cell tumor of the bone. Almost 80% of these tumors occur in the upper and lower extremities, and the breast is a very rare location. Here, we report a case of a 65-year-old female patient with a small mobile palpable lump in the left breast. Although the left breast tumor was considered malignant on preoperative imaging, no evidence of malignant tumor was found by ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy (CNB). Subsequently, the left breast tumor was confirmed as a malignant tumor by intraoperative rapid pathological examination. The initial treatment of the tumor was wide local excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy, and it was confirmed to be GCT-ST by histopathology and immunohistochemistry. Despite surgical treatment achieving clear surgical margins, the patient experienced lung metastases within a year of her initial treatment. Fortunately, the patient underwent surgical treatment of lung metastases, and at the last follow-up, the patient was still alive. This is the first case of a primary soft tissue tumor of the breast that has undergone surgical intervention after lung metastasis. This case report highlights the complexity of the clinical diagnosis and treatment of GCT-ST arising from the breast. Surgery may be another good treatment when the patient develops lung metastases.

TI  - Assessment of snow cover variability and its sensitivity to hydrometeorological factors in the Karakoram and Himalayan region
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover plays an important role in hydrological modelling and influences the energy balance. Daily Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow products are widely used for snow cover monitoring; however, the cloud cover causes a discontinuity in spatial and temporal scale. Therefore, we have implemented a composite (five-step) methodology for cloud removal over the Karakoram and Himalayan (KH) region during 2000-2019. The cloud-gap-filled snow cover area (SCA) was compared with Landsat-8 data, and the relationship with in situ observations (snowfall and temperature) was examined. The annual SCA illustrates an increasing trend for the entire KH except in the eastern Himalayas. The snow cover day and nine snow cover timing indices were assessed to explore the snow cover characteristics. The relationships between SCA and meteorological variables were evaluated, suggesting a higher correlation with temperature and shortwave radiation. A sensitivity analysis was performed, indicating higher sensitivity of SCA to radiation than to other selected variables.

TI  - Linking mountaintop removal mining to water quality for imperiled species using satellite data
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental laws need sound data to protect species and ecosystems. In 1996, a proliferation of mountaintop removal coal mines in a region home to over 50 federally protected species was approved under the Endangered Species Act. Although this type of mining can degrade terrestrial and aquatic habitats, the available data and tools limited the ability to analyze spatially extensive, aggregate effects of such a program. We used two large, public datasets to quantify the relationship between mountaintop removal coal mining and water quality measures important to the survival of imperiled species at a landscape scale across Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia. We combined an annual map of the extent of surface mines in this region from 1985 to 2015 generated from Landsat satellite imagery with public water quality data collected over the same time period from 4,260 monitoring stations within the same area. The water quality data show that chronic and acute thresholds for levels of aluminum, arsenic, cadmium, conductivity, copper, lead, manganese, mercury, pH, selenium, and zinc safe for aquatic life were exceeded thousands of times between 1985 and 2015 in streams that are important to the survival and recovery of species on the Endangered Species List. Linear mixed models showed that levels of manganese, sulfate, sulfur, total dissolved solids, total suspended solids, and zinc increased by 6.73E+01 to 6.87E+05 mu g/L and conductivity by 3.30E+06 mu S /cm for one percent increase in the mined proportion of the area draining into a monitoring station. The proportion of a drainage area that was mined also increased the likelihood that chronic thresholds for copper, lead, and zinc required to sustain aquatic life were exceeded. Finally, the proportion of a watershed that was mined was positively related to the likelihood that a waterway would be designated as impaired under the Clean Water Act. Together these results demonstrate that the extent of mountaintop removal mining, which can be derived from public satellite data, is predictive of water quality measures important to imperiled species-effects that must be considered under environmental law. These findings and the public data used in our analyses are pertinent to ongoing re-evaluations of the effects of current mine permitting regulations to the recovery and survival of federally protected species.

TI  - Satellite-based estimation of roughness lengths and displacement heights for wind resource modelling
T2  - WIND ENERGY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Wind turbines in northern Europe are frequently placed in forests, which sets new wind resource modelling requirements. Accurate mapping of the land surface can be challenging at forested sites due to sudden transitions between patches with very different aerodynamic properties, e.g. tall trees, clearings, and lakes. Tree growth and deforestation can lead to temporal changes of the forest. Global or pan-European land cover data sets fail to resolve these forest properties, aerial lidar campaigns are costly and infrequent, and manual digitization is labour-intensive and subjective. Here, we investigate the potential of using satellite observations to characterize the land surface in connection with wind energy flow modelling using the Wind Atlas Analysis and Application Program (WAsP). Collocated maps of the land cover, tree height, and leaf area index (LAI) are generated based on observations from the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 missions combined with the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2). Three different forest canopy models are applied to convert these maps to roughness lengths and displacement heights. We introduce new functionalities for WAsP, which can process detailed land cover maps containing both roughness lengths and displacement heights. Validation is carried out through cross-prediction analyses at eight well-instrumented sites in various landscapes where measurements at one mast are used to predict wind resources at another nearby mast. The use of novel satellite-based input maps in combination with a canopy model leads to lower cross-prediction errors of the wind power density (rms = 10.9 %-11.2 %) than using standard global or pan-European land cover data sets for land surface parameterization (rms = 14.2 %-19.7 %). Differences in the cross-predictions resulting from the three different canopy models are minor. The satellite-based maps show cross-prediction errors close to those obtained from aerial lidar scans and manually digitized maps. The results demonstrate the value of using detailed satellite-based land cover maps for micro-scale flow modelling.

AB  - Based on Geoscience Laser Altimeter System onboard the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat/GLAS) data, this paper analyzes the vertical accuracy of four kinds of digital elevation model (DEM)dataset in Hubei Province, and discusses the influence of the geographical factors (slope, aspect, geomorphic and land-use types) on DEM data accuracy. The results show that: (1) Among the four kinds of DEM data in Hubei Province, the ALOS World 3D -30 m (AW3D30) offers the highest data accuracy; (2) High slope and vegetation coverage will affect DEM data accuracy, and AW3D30 data accuracy is the least affected by this; (3) No obvious relationship has been found between data accuracy and aspect. In addition, using ICESat/GLAS data as reference, this paper also attempts to improve the vertical accuracy of DEM by employing five machine learning based methods, the results show that each DEM dataset obviously outperform themselves by using the models selected in this paper.

TI  - Tpl2 contributes to IL-1β-induced IL-8 expression via ERK1/2 activation in canine dermal fibroblasts
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - In autoimmune diseases, fibroblasts produce and secrete various cytokines and act as sentinel immune cells during inflammatory states. However, the contribution of sentinel immune cells (i.e. dermal fibroblasts) in autoimmune diseases of the skin, such as atopic dermatitis, has been obscure. The pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta) induces the expression of chemokines, such as interleukin 8 (IL-8), in autoimmune diseases of the skin. IL-8 induces the activation and recruitment of innate immune cells such as neutrophils to the site of inflammation. IL-1 beta-mediated induction of IL-8 expression is important for the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases; however, the intracellular singling remains to be understood. To elucidate the mechanism of the onset of autoimmune diseases, we established a model for IL-1 beta-induced dermatitis and investigated MAPK signaling pathways in IL-1 beta-induced IL-8 expression. We also identified that a MAP3K Tpl2 acts as an upstream modulator of IL-1 beta-induced ERK1/2 activation in dermal fibroblasts. We observed an increase in the expression of IL-8 mRNA and protein in cells treated with IL-1 beta. ERK1/2 inhibitors significantly reduced IL-1 beta-induced IL-8 expression, whereas the inhibitor for p38 MAPK or JNK had no effect. IL-1 beta induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which was attenuated in the presence of an ERK1/2 inhibitor. IL-1 beta failed to induce IL-8 expression in cells transfected with siRNA for ERK1, or ERK2. Notably, a Tpl2 inhibitor reduced IL-1 beta-induced IL-8 expression and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. We confirmed that the silencing of Tpl2 in siRNA-transfected fibroblasts prevented both in IL-1 beta-induced IL-8 expression and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Taken together, our data indicate the importance of Tpl2 in the modulation of ERK1/2 signaling involved in the IL-1 beta-induced development of autoimmune diseases affecting the dermal tissue, such as atopic dermatitis.

TI  - Optoacoustic imaging-Applications and advancements of innovative imaging techniques
T2  - HAUTARZT
M3  - Article
AB  - Optoacoustic imaging (OAB) has developed steadily in recent years. By means of partly pulsed light, in a wide variety of wavelengths, different colour carriers (chromophores) are excited to form sound waves. These in turn are detected by the newly developed systems and converted into three-dimensional images by means of various algorithms. The technique is characterised by a good ratio between contrast and penetration depth and can create macro-, meso- and microscopic images due to its scalability. Optoacoustic macroscopy broadly irradiates the area to be examined with laser light. This can produce images with a high penetration depth, but only with a moderate resolution. Clinically interesting fields of application are for example the results of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) examined ex vivo using macroscopic optoacoustics. Due to the ability of OAB to visualise melanin, the detection rate of metastases was superior to previous methods, but not to histology. The ability to visualise dermal and epidermal structures, especially vessels, with good resolution makes optoacoustic mesoscopy useful in the examination of inflammatory skin diseases and could contribute to the verification of the success of therapy, e.g., with biologics for psoriasis vulgaris or atopic eczema (AE), in the future. Optoacoustic microscopy, which has so far been limited mainly to preclinical in vivo research, could be used in the future to detect even finer vascular structures and their changes. The clinical possibilities of OAB seem to be of great benefit and continue to be the subject of intensive research.

T2  - CPT-PHARMACOMETRICS & SYSTEMS PHARMACOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The identification of influenza epidemics and assessment of the efficacy of vaccination against this infection are major challenges for the implementation of effective public health strategies, such as vaccination programs. In this study, we developed a new pharmacometric model to evaluate the efficacy of vaccination based on infection surveillance data from the 2010/2011 to 2018/2019 influenza seasons in Japan. A novel susceptible-infected-removed plus vaccination model, based on an indirect response structure with the effect of vaccination, was applied to describe seasonal influenza epidemics using a preseasonal collection of data regarding serological H-1 antibody titer positivity and the fraction of virus strains. Using this model, we evaluated K-in (a parameter describing the transmission rate of symptomatic influenza infection) for different age groups. Furthermore, we defined a new parameter (prevention factor) showing the efficacy of vaccination against each viral strain and in different age groups. We found that the prevention factor of vaccination against influenza varied among age groups. Notably, children aged 5-14 years showed the highest K-in value during the 10 influenza seasons and the greatest preventive effect of vaccination (prevention factor = 70.8%). The propagation of influenza epidemics varies in different age groups. Children aged 5-14 years most likely play a leading role in the transmission of influenza. Prioritized vaccination in this age group may be the most effective strategy for reducing the prevalence of influenza in the community.

TI  - Clinicopathologic models predicting non-sentinel lymph node metastasis in cutaneous melanoma patients: Are they useful for patients with a single positive sentinel node?
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objectives Of clinically node-negative (cN0) cutaneous melanoma patients with sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis, between 10% and 30% harbor additional metastases in non-sentinel lymph nodes (NSLNs). Approximately 80% of SLN-positive patients have a single positive SLN. Methods To assess whether state-of-the-art clinicopathologic models predicting NSLN metastasis had adequate performance, we studied a single-institution cohort of 143 patients with cN0 SLN-positive primary melanoma who underwent subsequent completion lymph node dissection. We used sensitivity (SE) and positive predictive value (PPV) to characterize the ability of the models to identify patients at high risk for NSLN disease. Results Across Stage III patients, all clinicopathologic models tested had comparable performances. The best performing model identified 52% of NSLN-positive patients (SE = 52%, PPV = 37%). However, for the single SLN-positive subgroup (78% of cohort), none of the models identified high-risk patients (SE > 20%, PPV > 20%) irrespective of the chosen probability threshold used to define the binary risk labels. Thus, we designed a new model to identify high-risk patients with a single positive SLN, which achieved a sensitivity of 49% (PPV = 26%). Conclusion For the largest SLN-positive subgroup, those with a single positive SLN, current model performance is inadequate. New approaches are needed to better estimate nodal disease burden of these patients.

TI  - Stripe segmentation of oceanic internal waves in SAR images based on SegNet
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of ocean remote sensing makes it possible to obtain valuable information from a large amount of data. Deep learning is a powerful tool that is beneficial for obtaining ocean information from remote sensing data. Oceanic internal waves play an essential role in ocean activities. To obtain information on irregular stripes from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images, a stripe segmentation algorithm for oceanic internal waves is proposed based on SegNet. The research results show that the proposed method can identify whether the SAR images contain oceanic internal waves and obtain the respective locations of the light and dark stripes of the oceanic internal waves from SAR images. Furthermore, because this method can accurately determine the relative locations of the light and dark stripes, it can distinguish the moment when oceanic internal waves undergo polarity conversion.

TI  - Monitoring the morphological evolution of a reach of the Italian Po River using multispectral satellite imagery and stage data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The knowledge of the hydro-morphological evolution of lowland rivers is essential to develop integrated river management plans. Satellite data can provide continuous and efficient means to monitor fluvial geomorphological changes at various spatiotemporal scales. In this study, an automatic classification method was exploited to analyze the evolution of a 40 km reach of the Italian Po River from 1986 to 2020. Public domain multispectral satellite data acquired by Landsat 4-5-TM, Landsat-8-OLI and Sentinel-2-MSI were processed to extract the wet-channel and its variations over time. Very high-resolution GeoEye-01 and WorldView-02 images were employed for validating the classification method. The overall accuracy, obtained by multitemporal controls with very high-resolution images, was always greater than 0.90 for all the missions, showing that the classification accuracy remains consistent through time. Combining satellite data with hydrological measurements permitted to monitor the river at the reach scale and investigate the effects of river restoration works.

TI  - Magnitudes and patterns of large-scale permafrost ground deformation revealed by Sentinel-1 InSAR on the central Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Permafrost on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) undergoes significant thawing and degradation, which affects the hydrological processes, ecosystems and infrastructure stability. The ground deformation, a key indicator of permafrost degradation, can be quantified via geodetic observations, especially using multi-temporal InSAR techniques. The previous InSAR studies, however, either rely on data-driven models or Stefan-equation-based models, which are both lacking of consideration of the spatial-temporal variations of freeze-thaw processes. Furthermore, the magnitudes and patterns of the permafrost-related ground deformation over large scales (e.g., 1 x 10(5) km(2) or larger) is still insufficiently quantified or poorly understood. In this study, to account for the spatial heterogeneity of freeze-thaw processes, we develop a permafrost-tailored InSAR approach by incorporating a MODIS-land-surface-temperature-integrated ground deformation model to reconstruct the seasonal and long-term deformation. Utilizing the approach to Sentinel-1 SAR images on the vast regions of about 140,000 km(2) of the central QTP during 2014-2019, we observe widespread seasonal deformation up to about 80 mm with a mean value of about 10 mm and linear subsidence up to 20 mm/year. We apply the geographical detector to determine the controlling factors on the permafrost-related deformation. We find that the slope angle is the primary controller on the seasonal deformation: strong magnitudes and variations of seasonal deformation are most pronounced in flat or gentle-slope regions. The aspect angle, vegetation and soil bulk density exhibit a certain correlation with seasonal deformation as well. Meanwhile, we find that a linear subsidence is higher in the regions with high ground ice content and warm permafrost. It indicates that warm and ice-rich permafrost regions are more vulnerable to extensive long-term subsidence. We also observe that the cold permafrost regions experience lower linear subsidence even with high ground ice content, which indicate ice loss is limited. Thus, we infer that under continuously warming, the transition from cold permafrost to warm permafrost may lead to more extensive ground ice melting. Moreover, the strong subsidence/uplift signals surrounding some lakes suggesting that the change of local hydrological conditions may induce localized permafrost degradation/aggradation. Our study demonstrates the capability of the permafrost-tailored InSAR approach to quantify the permafrost freeze-thaw dynamics as well as their spatial-temporal patterns over large scales in vast permafrost areas.

M3  - Article
AB  - The ecosystem services in an area are quite dependent on its ambient land use and land cover (LULC) attributes. Here we assess the spatio-temporal distribution of Ecosystem Services Value (ESV) for the years 1990, 2000, 2010, 2020, based on the then existing LULC aspects of the Kolkata Urban Agglomeration in eastern India. Further, these are simulated for 2030, 2040 and 2050 to determine the future potential ESV. The respective LULC layers were extracted from Landsat images using the support vector machine method and future projections were done using Markov Chain-Cellular Automata models. Results reveal that all LULC aspects are likely to significantly decrease except built-up tracts. The available ESV shall concomitantly decline by 29.7%, especially due to wetland loss. The ESV patterns also showed strong spatial correlation/clustering, with higher ESV patches locating along rivers/wetlands. These results can better inform management of high-value EVS components for sustaining/improving the urban environmental quality.

TI  - SBAS-InSAR-Based Analysis of Surface Deformation in the Eastern Tianshan Mountains, China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the unique geographical characteristics of cold alpine and high-altitude regions, glaciers, permafrost, ground ice, rock glaciers, and other periglacial geomorphology have developed with fragile habitats, and these areas are often the birthplaces of many river basins and natural hazards. With global warming and the extensive cryogenesis and physical weathering, the thermal state of permafrost and the mass balance of glaciers have been changed, and thus it can be deduced that the surface deformation is of great concern. To obtain ground subsidence or uplift over a large area to understand local surface changes, the small baseline subset interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SBAS-InSAR) technique was applied to process 89-scene of Sentinel-1A images ranging from December 25, 2017 to January 2, 2021 to obtain surface deformation for these 3 years for the eastern Tianshan Mountains, China. The surface deformation characteristics of the area were analyzed to provide a basic dataset for environmental protection policies and mitigation or reduction of natural hazards in this region, and to verify the applicability of SBAS-InSAR technology in alpine and high-altitude areas. The results show that the SBAS-InSAR technique processing with sentinel-1A dataset cannot be effectively used to acquire ground deformation in areas covered by trees, scrub/shrub, glaciers, snow, and ground ice, where the decohered phenomenon is serious. In other regions, SBAS-InSAR can effectively measure surface subsidence or uplift. Surface deformation is significant throughout the study area, with rates ranging from -70.7 to 50.8 mm/a and with an average rate of 1.1 mm/a. There are obvious regions of uplift in the northwest, northeast, and central sections of the study area, with uplift greater than 155.73 mm in 3 years, and three obvious regions of subsidence in the northeast and west sections of the study area, with subsidence of at least -125.20 mm in 3 years. The remaining areas of deformation are scattered, with smaller amounts of settlement and uplift and with an isolated and sporadic distribution. Areas with elevations of 3,150 to 4,275 m.a.s.l., slopes of 15 degrees-50 degrees, and southwest, west, and northwest aspects are geologic disaster-prone regions and should receive more attention and more field monitoring. The results of this study have important implications for local environmental protection and hazard prevention.

TI  - CT of acute abdominopelvic hemorrhage: protocols, pearls, and pitfalls
T2  - ABDOMINAL RADIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Abdominal and pelvic hemorrhage may be secondary to a number of causes and is often a medical emergency. Patient presentation ranges from obvious trauma with evidence of hemodynamic instability to vague symptoms. CT has become the imaging modality of choice for identifying abdominopelvic hemorrhage. Recognizing acute hemorrhage as well as identifying its location and severity are key to expediting management. In the Emergency Department, ultrasound often used in the initial evaluation of trauma patients, but is not sensitive for subtle bleeds or injuries. CT is the best first-line imaging tool to identify abdominal hemorrhage and, compared with angiography, has been shown to be superior in detecting intra-abdominal bleeding, especially when the bleeding rate is low. Depending on location and etiology, abdominopelvic hemorrhage may have a characteristic appearance, such as the "sentinel clot" sign associated with blunt trauma to the solid organs or the "triangle sign" of a mesenteric bleed. The following pictorial essay reviews CT technique, study interpretation, and interpretative pearls and pitfalls in the recognition of acute abdominopelvic hemorrhage.

TI  - Potential utilization of satellite remote sensing for field-based agricultural studies
T2  - CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL TECHNOLOGIES IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Review
AB  - Using satellite remote-sensing is a useful approach for agriculture to monitor plant and soil conditions and provide decision-making support to farmers. Recently, several types of tools and indices by the satellite remote-sensing have been developed for monitoring drought stress, changes in land uses, and crop-soil water relations. Although these techniques are powerful tools, especially in developing countries and regions where precise data of crop evaluation and yield statistics are not accessible, it is quite difficult for beginners to select the most suitable tool or index for their objectives. Major difficulties are in the specificity of the terminology, differences among the sensors (e.g., active vs. passive sensors), interpretation of imaginary data, and multidisciplinary topics. This work offers non-expert readers basic knowledge of remote-sensing use in agriculture, presenting advancements in the field and future insights. We review different sensors that are frequently used, such as optical sensors and synthetic aperture radar, as well as the following different purposes for using remote-sensing in agriculture: drought stress detection, monitoring land use in tropical regions (e.g., deforestation), and estimating water balance evapotranspiration in emerging and developing countries. Additionally, the integrated approach of remote-sensing data into the crop simulation model, which can provide a more holistic view of the plant and field status over cropping season, is described for the field-based studies.

TI  - Shoreline extraction and change estimation using geospatial techniques: a study of coastal West Bengal, India
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE INDIAN NATIONAL SCIENCE ACADEMY
M3  - Article
AB  - Shoreline identification is a complicated and time-consuming process for larger and inaccessible areas such as the coastal region of West Bengal (India) using traditional and repetitive ground surveying techniques. Though the recent advancement of geospatial technologies has overcome many of these issues, low spatial resolution, mixed pixels, on-screen shoreline delineation accuracy are not entirely reliable. Moreover, coastal land changes along the shoreline, especially islands, are the major concern mainly related to mangroves destruction. normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI)-Tasseled-Cap transformation technique has been used to automatically generate shoreline using seven Landsat image pairs (1989-2018). The shorelines have been quantified and analysed by end point rate (EPR) and linear regression rate (LRR) algorithms in the digital shoreline analysis system (DSAS) add-in tool within the ArcGIS platform. The rate of shoreline change has been analysed for delineating zones of accretion and erosion. The result reveals that the coastal region of West Bengal has undergoing erosion at the rate of - 3.36 m/year and - 4.70 m/year as per EPR and LRR methods, respectively. Moreover, the study also shows the zone along the islands is more susceptible to erosion than the other zones. The island-wise shoreline study reveals except Lothian Island, the rest of the selected islands viz. Bulchery, Dalhousie, Bhangaduni, Sagar and Baghmara Reserve Forest are erosion-prone. The results would be valuable for coastal and forest conservation planners to identify the most vulnerable zones and propose appropriate policy measures.

TI  - A novel approach for predicting the tc center of remotely sensed images using pso based density matrix
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present work,an image extraction technique has been designed to fix the center spot of the tropical cyclone. The cyclone prediction is processed within the CBIR system and hence it established a well-effective output. A raw cyclone image is being processed under the image processing techniques such as Adaptive Gaussian Notch Filter (Pre-processing), Adaptive Thresholding (segmentation) and Feature-extraction. The extracted features are collectively used as an input to the CNN-HMO classifier which produces a relevant classified output. Relevance feedback is a key factor which passes these corresponding outputs to the user. User selects the required cyclone image after then, the image extraction process of PSO based density matrix takes place. The extractor has variance, gradient and density matrix (DM) to predit the center spot. So that the brightness temperature is computed for each pixel coordinates in both zonal and meridional axial direction. After then DM point converges over every pixel in an image and a PSO is followed towards the pixel orientation of each convergence line to determine the best optimal solution (i.e.,) the center of the Tropical Cyclone. With this optimizing criterion, the center of the Tropical Cyclone is generated.

TI  - Use of Cervid Serosurveys to Monitor Eastern Equine Encephalitis Virus Activity in Northern New England, United States, 2009-2017
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Vertebrate surveillance for eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) activity usually focuses on three types of vertebrates: horses, passerine birds, and sentinel chicken flocks. However, there is a variety of wild vertebrates that are exposed to EEEV infections and can be used to track EEEV activity. In 2009, we initiated a pilot study in northern New England, United States, to evaluate the effectiveness of using wild cervids (free-ranging whitetailed deer and moose) as spatial sentinels for EEEV activity. In Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont during 2009-2017, we collected blood samples from hunter-harvested cervids at tagging stations and obtained harvest location information from hunters. U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention processed the samples for EEEV antibodies using plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNTs). We detected EEEV antibodies in 6 to 17% of cervid samples in the different states and mapped cervid EEEV seropositivity in northern New England. EEEV antibody-positive cervids were the first detections of EEEV activity in the state of Vermont, in northern Maine, and northern New Hampshire. Our key result was the detection of the antibodies in areas far outside the extent of documented wild bird, mosquito, human case, or veterinary case reports of EEEV activity in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont.These findings showed that cervid (deer and moose) serosurveys can be used to characterize the geographic extent of EEEV activity, especially in areas with low EEEV activity or with little or no EEEV surveillance. Cervid EEEV serosurveys can be a useful tool for mapping EEEV activity in areas of North America in addition to northern New England.

T2  - AMERICAN SURGEON
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z1071 trial in 2013 demonstrated the fesability of sentinel lymph node biopsy in clinically node-positive patients following neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The goal of this study was to determine the continued impact of this study on our practice pattern. Materials and Methods This is a retrospective review of institutional changes in the management of axillary nodal disease following the publication of Z1071. Patients with clinically node-positive disease that completed neoadjuvant chemotherapy between 2014 and 2020 were included. The Cocoran-Armitage trend test was used to analyze change in categorical variables over time, and the Spearman's rank coefficient was used to analyze two-ranked variables. Results A cohort of 102 patients were included in the study and demonstrated that the number of sentinel lymph node biopsies to evaluate axillary disease increased over time. Additionally, the number of biopsies of suspicious nodes, and the use of marker clips on the biopsied nodes increased over time. Conclusion Our institution has continued to incorporate the result from Z1071 in our practice patterns.

TI  - The potential of numerical prediction systems to support the design of Arctic observing systems: Insights from the APPLICATE and YOPP projects
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerical systems used for weather and climate predictions have substantially improved over past decades. We argue that despite a continued need for further addressing remaining limitations of their key components, numerical prediction systems have reached a sufficient level of maturity to examine and critically assess the suitability of Earth's current observing systems - remote and in situ, for prediction purposes; and that they can provide evidence-based support for the deployment of future observational networks. We illustrate this point by presenting recent, co-ordinated international efforts focused on Arctic observing systems, led in the framework of the Year of Polar Prediction and the H2020 project APPLICATE. The Arctic, one of the world's most rapidly changing regions, is relatively poorly covered in terms of in situ data but richly covered in terms of satellite data. In this study, we demonstrate that existing state-of-the-art datasets and targeted sensitivity experiments produced with numerical prediction systems can inform us of the added value of existing or even hypothetical Arctic observations, in the context of predictions from hourly to interannual time-scales. Furthermore, we argue that these datasets and experiments can also inform us how the uptake of Arctic observations in numerical prediction systems can be enhanced to maximise predictive skill. Based on these efforts we suggest that (a) conventional in situ observations in the Arctic play a particularly important role in initializing numerical weather forecasts during the winter season, (b) observations from satellite microwave sounders play a particularly important role during the summer season, and their enhanced usage over snow and sea ice is expected to further improve their impact on predictive skill in the Arctic region and beyond, (c) the deployment of a small number of in situ sea-ice thickness monitoring devices at strategic sampling sites in the Arctic could be sufficient to monitor most of the large-scale sea-ice volume variability, and (d) sea-ice thickness observations can improve the simulation of both the sea ice and near-surface air temperatures on seasonal time-scales in the Arctic and beyond.

TI  - A reliable and adaptive spatiotemporal data fusion method for blending multi-spatiotemporal-resolution satellite images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal image fusion is a potential way to resolve the constraint between the spatial and temporal resolutions of satellite images and has been developed rapidly in recent years. However, two key challenges related to fusion accuracy remain: a) reducing the uncertainty of image fusion caused by sensor differences and b) addressing strong temporal changes. To solve the above two issues, this paper presents the newly proposed Reliable and Adaptive Spatiotemporal Data Fusion (RASDF) method. In RASDF, the effects of four kinds of sensor differences on fusion are analyzed systematically. A reliability index is therefore proposed to describe the spatial distribution of the reliability in input data for image fusion. An optimization strategy based on the spatial distribution of the reliability quantified by the index is developed to improve the robustness of the fusion. In addition, an adaptive global unmixing model and an adaptive local unmixing model are constructed and utilized collaboratively to enhance the ability to retrieve strong temporal changes. The performance and robustness of RASDF were compared with six representative fusion methods for both real and simulated datasets covering both homogeneous and heterogeneous sites. Experimental results indicated that RASDF achieves a better performance and provides a more reliable image fusion solution in terms of reducing the impact of sensor differences on image fusion and retrieving strong temporal changes.

TI  - Augmenting possibilistic <i>c</i>-means classifier to handle noise and within class heterogeneity in classification
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A conventional possibilistic c-mean (PCM)-based algorithm uses means or variance-covariance statistical variables computed from training data sets for classification. Two objectives were covered; in the first objective, the PCM classifier using the training samples as "individual sample as mean" (PCM_IM) in place of "mean" was experimented with handling heterogeneity within the class. The second objective, the PCM-based local convolutional method, was tested with different parameters to handle the noisy pixel. Local convolution algorithms reduce the effect of noise, and PCM_IM handles heterogeneity to enhance the classification performance within the class. The optimized algorithm was first calculated in this research by applying the local convolutional methods for different distance measures and fuzziness factors. This optimized algorithm was obtained by classifying the dense forest, eucalyptus, riverine sand, water, wheat, and grassland classes using the multispectral images of Landsat-8 and Formosat-2 of the Haridwar area. It was observed that the Bray-Curtis distance measures at m = 2.9 (fuzziness factor) for possibilistic local information c-means using the base PCM classifier yields the highest overall accuracy (OA) (86.37%), irrespective of the classifier. Then, PCM_IM provides a classwise and OA that handles heterogeneity within the class. The classwise accuracy of dense forest, eucalyptus, grassland, sand, water, and wheat is 88.12%, 95.29%, 78.79%, 89.17%, 89.72%, and 92.43%, respectively, and the OA is 85.72%, whereas OA of the PCM classifier using the training sample as mean is 75.18%.

TI  - Assessment of heavy metal pollution in agricultural soil around a gold mining area in Yitong County, China, based on satellite hyperspectral imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil is one of the essential natural resources that is at risk from heavy metal pollution. The traditional sampling method for soil heavy metal monitoring and assessment cannot meet the requirements for large-scale areas. The purpose of this study was to estimate the soil heavy metal concentrations based on Gaofen 5 (GF5) satellite hyperspectral imagery for the assessment of the heavy metal pollution in the study area and to analyze the scale effect under different resolutions. A total of 96 topsoil samples were collected in this work, and these samples were analyzed for the arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn) contents. To solve the problem of the insignificant features caused by the complex imaging conditions of spaceborne hyperspectral satellite imagery, the binary weight symbiotic organisms search algorithm (BWSOS) was developed. After feature selection based on the BWSOS method, the heavy metal contents are inverted by the use of support vector machine regression. The experimental results show that the BWSOS feature selection method shows a good performance, with the R-p(2) values for As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn being 0.67, 0.68, 0.73, 0.71, 0.66, 0.65, and 0.71, respectively. Based on the estimated heavy metal concentration maps, the geoaccumulation index (I-geo), the pollution index, and the potential ecological risk index were calculated to assess the heavy metal pollution status in the study area. The results showed that only As contamination is present at a significant level, but with a low level of potential risk for the whole study area. A comparison with the results obtained using HyMap airborne hyperspectral imagery showed that the GF5 satellite hyperspectral imagery can obtain consistent results for heavy metal pollution assessment. The airborne hyperspectral imagery can provide more fine details, whereas the spaceborne hyperspectral imagery is more suitable for large-scale pollution assessment at a low cost.

This study presents a detailed and an updated glacier inventory of 2020 for the Upper Jhelum Basin (UJB), Kashmir Himalayas using Sentinel-2 data and documents 308 glaciers. The glaciers range in size from 0.01 to 10.51 km(2) and cover an area of 102.1 km(2). All glaciers are located in the elevation zone between 3500 and 5000 masl. About 86% of glaciers are small in size (< 0.5 km(2)) and constitute 38.7% of total ice cover. However, glaciers with size greater than 0.5 km(2) are only 14% but constitute a major proportion 61.3% of glacier area. Majority of small glaciers are a result of defragmentation of larger ones, hence more vulnerable to melting. Multi-date satellite images were used to assess glacier fluctuations of selected glaciers (>= 0.3) for the period 1990-2020. The total glacier area has reduced from 85.25 to 68.17 km(2) (20%) at the rate of 0.56 km(2) a(-1). Glaciers in the lower elevation zone (3800-4200 masl) have lost about 35% of their area at the rate of 0.22 km(2) a(-1). The analysis of meteorological data using Thel-Sen method and Mann-Kendall test before examining its impact on glacier mass loss reveals that a persistent warming trend in mean annual temperatures is observed over the region. This is strictly under the influence of global climate change having a potential to cause enhanced shrinking and thinning of glaciers in the study region.

TI  - Underestimation of invasive breast carcinoma in patients with initial diagnosis of ductal carcinoma <i>in situ</i>: Size matters
T2  - CIRUGIA ESPANOLA
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The aim of our study was to identify those patients with preoperative diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and high risk of upstaging to invasive breast carcinoma (IBC), in whom sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) should be considered.Methods: One-hundred and five DCIS patients treated with breast-conserving surgery (BCS) or mastectomy were studied. Preoperative features of the tumors were analyzed to investigate its association with underestimation of IBC on final pathology.Results: Overall, the underestimation rate of IBC was 16.2%. The underestimation rate was highest in lesions with initial size >2 cm compared with those with size <= 2 cm (26.8% vs. 4.1%, respectively; p < 0.003). Eighty-eight patients (83.8%) underwent concurrent SLNB and only one case had lymph node involvement (1.1%).Conclusions: SLNB should be considered in DCIS patients receiving BCS with lesions greater than 2 cm since approximately one in four will harbor an IBC.

TI  - Quantifying irrigation water use with remote sensing: Soil water deficit modelling with uncertain soil parameters
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Water sharing plans have been implemented to allocate water fairly between irrigated agriculture and other stakeholders. Water accounting is an important feature of successful water management and sharing. Remote regions are often neglected with metering infrastructure and therefore remote sensing is an option for the quantification of irrigation water use. The guides published in FAO Irrigation and Drainage paper No. 56 (FAO56) can provide some information in data poor regions although it has its own limitations without direct observations. This study uses the constellation of Landsat satellites (5-8) to monitor crop conditions via the vegetation index to assess crop growth through a crop coefficient (Kc) based on an actual field condition. This remotely sensed input is then used in soil water deficit modelling based on the FAO56 approach over two fields, an almond plantation and a vineyard, located in South Australia. Soil parameters, such as readily available water (RAW), are taken from in-situ observations and digital soil maps for comparison. The results closely matched metered irrigation time series with only small changes in results when interchanging in-situ soil properties or digital soil maps. Following this an uncertainty analysis using a Monte Carlo approach was performed using the range of parameter values for RAW. A small period of this study (9 months of 2015/16) overlapped with the Sentinel-2a operational period, which was investigated for its improved spatial resolution and differences in spectral band width of key vegetation observation bands. When comparing these results to previous studies, which did not consider soil water deficits, the improvements are substantial (improvements ranged from 3% to 15% monthly and 56% to 68% annually). These improvements require extra data, which has the limitation of comprehensive field data being difficult to obtain and digital soil maps being potentially unreliable. The choice to include soil water deficit modelling or not is dependent on the required accuracy to effectively use the quantified irrigation for the intended use.

TI  - Multi-sensor change detection for within-year capture and labelling of forest disturbance
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of forest change type and timing is required for forest management, reporting, and science. Time series of historic satellite data (e.g. Landsat) have resulted in an invaluable record of changes in forest conditions. Natural resource management and reporting typically operate at an annual time step, yet the recent addition of data streams from compatible satellites (e.g., Sentinel-2) offer the possibility of generating frequent, management-relevant forest status assessments and maps of change. Analytical approaches that rely on a time series of observations to identify change often struggle to provide reliable estimates of change events in terminal years of the time series until subsequent, additional observations are available. Methods to meaningfully integrate observations from compatible satellite platforms can provide short-term information to augment and refine estimates of change area and type in those terminal years of the time series. In this research we fuse Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A and -2B data streams to capture, with reduced latency, stand replacing forest change (harvest and wildfire), tagged to a temporal window of occurrence over an similar to 10,000 km(2) area of central British Columbia, Canada. We introduce a new algorithm, SLIMS (Shrinking Latency in Multiple Streams), to rapidly and reliably detect change, and then use an established Bayesian approach to meaningfully combine changes detected in the Landsat and Sentinel data streams. Our results indicate that the type and timing of stand-replacing disturbances can be identified in these forests with high accuracy. Overall, 13.9% of the study area was disturbed between the end of 2016 and the end of 2017, with the majority of disturbed area attributable to wildfire and a smaller amount attributed to forest harvesting, mostly in the winter 2016-2017 with some limited summer harvest also occurring. Overall accuracy of the change, assessed using independent validation data, was 95% +/- 2.3%. The capacity of these change results to augment a trend-based assessment of change for 2017 was also demonstrated and provides a framework for how short- and long-term change detection approaches provide complementary information that can increase the timeliness and accuracy of change area estimates in the terminal years of a time series. These findings also demonstrate the capacity to regard Landsat and Sentinel-2 sensors as elements of a virtual constellation to obtain forest change information in a timely (i.e., end of growing season) and reliable fashion over large areas.

TI  - CBERS data cubes for land use and land cover mapping in the Brazilian Cerrado agricultural belt
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The agricultural frontier expansion in the Cerrado biome made Brazil a leader in commodity exports and is changing its landscape. Hence, efforts to accurate land use and land cover (LULC) monitoring in this region are strategic, due to its role in Brazil's food, environmental, and economic security policy. Thinking on planning and technical sovereignty in the spatial sector, the China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS) Program was launched to provide useful data for decision-makers to manage the Brazilian territory independently of external policies. Their data, especially from CBERS-4 Wide-Field Imager (CBERS-4/WFI), are largely applied in deforestation monitoring by remote sensing specialists but less applied than data from other image providers for machine learning-based LULC mapping due to the small number of spectral bands and limitations related to clouds and shadows detection. However, with advances in orbital data analysis, data cubes enabled storing and accessing large spatio-temporal analysis-ready data. Within this scope, the Brazil Data Cube Project (BDC) creates multidimensional data cubes from orbital sensors' data for all Brazilian territory. We applied BDC CBERS-4/WFI data cubes to generate LULC classifications for the Extremo Oeste Baiano agricultural belt correspondent to the 2017/2018 and 2019/2020 harvest periods, at two levels of detail: broad and crop type, incorporating ground truth samples, crop calendar knowledge, and vegetation indices to a dense time series analysis approach. Overall Accuracies were equal to 0.87 and 0.89 for broad, and 0.91 and 0.94 for crop type classifications. The results indicate CBERS-4/WFI data cubes as a useful tool for improving crop monitoring in the Cerrado biome based on machine learning.

T2  - CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Nodal naevi (NN) represent aggregates of melanocytes within peripheral lymph nodes. NN are relatively often found in patients with malignant melanoma (MM), and may mimic metastatic disease. Aim To study mutation profiles in MM and NN to find out whether NN descend from a primary MM. Methods Next-generation sequencing was performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue of 26 pairs of primary MM and corresponding NN detected by sentinel lymph node biopsy, and 29 MM-characteristic genes were investigated. Results In this study, 90% of mutations were detected exclusively in either MM or NN, but not both, in the same patient; the percentage of identical NN and MM mutations in the same individual was only 10%. The most frequently discovered shared mutations were a C>G substitution in the CDKN2A gene and in-frame deletion in ARID1A. Oncogenic driver mutations were frequently observed in MM but only rarely in NN. About three-quarters of mutations in both MM and NN were characterized by C>T or G>A substitutions. The detected rate of ultraviolet (UV)-related C>T base changes was comparably high in both primary MM (35%) and NN (32%). Conclusions Based on our data, it seems that NN descend from previously UV-exposed BRAF wildtype cutaneous melanocytes, rather than from primary MM or arrested progenitor cells.

TI  - Analysis of Urban Heat Island and Heat Waves Using Sentinel-3 Images: a Study of Andalusian Cities in Spain
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - At present, understanding the synergies between the Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) phenomenon and extreme climatic events entailing high mortality, i.e., heat waves, is a great challenge that must be faced to improve the quality of life in urban zones. The implementation of new mitigation and resilience measures in cities would serve to lessen the effects of heat waves and the economic cost they entail. In this research, the Land Surface Temperature (LST) and the SUHI were determined through Sentinel-3A and 3B images of the eight capitals of Andalusia (southern Spain) during the months of July and August of years 2019 and 2020. The objective was to determine possible synergies or interaction between the LST and SUHI, as well as between SUHI and heat waves, in a region classified as highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. For each Andalusian city, the atmospheric variables of ambient temperature, solar radiation, wind speed and direction were obtained from stations of the Spanish State Meteorological Agency (AEMET); the data were quantified and classified both in periods of normal environmental conditions and during heat waves. By means of Data Panel statistical analysis, the multivariate relationships were derived, determining which ones statistically influence the SUHI during heat wave periods. The results indicate that the LST and the mean SUHI obtained are statistically interacted and intensify under heat wave conditions. The greatest increases in daytime temperatures were seen for Sentinel-3A in cities by the coast (LST = 3.90 degrees C, SUHI = 1.44 degrees C) and for Sentinel-3B in cities located inland (LST = 2.85 degrees C, SUHI = 0.52 degrees C). The existence of statistically significant positive relationships above 99% (p < 0.000) between the SUHI and solar radiation, and between the SUHI and the direction of the wind, intensified in periods of heat wave, could be verified. An increase in the urban area affected by the SUHI under heat wave conditions is reported.

TI  - Worlds More or Less: Nineteenth-Century Ethno-Astronomy and Cosmologies of Reference
T2  - EUROPEAN ROMANTIC REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - This essay reads William Herschel's nebular hypothesis (and the debates it galvanized) in light of Sylvia Wynter's account of the cosmology of Man. Tracing the relationship between Western monohumanism and "ethno-astronomy," Wynter demonstrates how the post-Copernican worldview posited Earth as materially contiguous with the heavens and only one sphere among many. If, as Wynter argues, this rupture facilitated the transhistorical absolutization of Man as the human, the question of form is key to this history. For, insofar as the form of the sphere differentiates world-making Man from merely world-inhabiting Others (both human and nonhuman), it subtends British colonial schemas of empire and race. Nineteenth-century writings about nebulae are curious in this context for how they figure beyond the ethno-astronomy of Man. In attempting to formalize nebulae-gossamer celestial objects that possess no outline-thinkers from Thomas De Quincey to John Pringle Nichol glimpse a cosmos that discomposes the contiguities of both matter and reference upon which the colonial liberal subject's cosmology of whiteness depends. This becomes especially apparent as nebulae turn the workings of analogy haywire. Pushed to the point of failure, analogy inadvertently discerns and asserts a world whose pluriversal configurations of human and nonhuman might inform anti- and decolonial projects.

TI  - Late-onset of ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency: A rare medical examiner case
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORENSIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Ornithine Transcarbamylase (OTC) is an enzyme of the urea cycle, which converts ammonia into urea in the liver cells. OTC plays a crucial role in the breakdown and removal of nitrogen in the body. OTC deficiency is a rare X-linked recessive disorder that classically presents in early life with signs of hyperammonemia and progressive central nervous system involvement resulting in seizures, coma, and death. Sentinel presentation in adulthood is quite rare. A 29-year-old man developed altered mental status after receiving an epidural steroid injection 3 days earlier for back pain. He presented to the emergency department severely agitated, and his workup revealed an elevated ammonia level of 125 mu mol/L. He refused admission and was discharged against medical advice. The following day, his mentation deteriorated, he developed status epilepticus, and was transported to another emergency department. He was admitted with worsening hyperammonemia (levels rising to over 700 mu mol/L). His clinical condition progressive deteriorated, and he developed encephalopathy and diffuse cerebral edema. Liver function testing indicated progressive liver damage, and amino acids were detected in his blood and urine. Clinical and laboratory findings suggested undiagnosed OTC enzyme deficiency. He died 2 days after admission. An autopsy showed an 1890 g liver with diffuse yellow discoloration and softening. Histology and electron microscopy revealed findings suggestive of urea cycle disorder, such as microvesicular steatosis, apoptosis, and scattered mitosis, clusters of clear hepatocytes at the PAS stain, and mitochondria abnormalities. Genetic analysis revealed a hemizygous pathogenic variant of the OTC gene (c.622G>A). OTC deficiency should be suspected in subjects with hyperammonemic encephalopathy. If a genetic mutation is identified in the deceased, surviving family members should be screened to prevent potential life-threatening complications.

TI  - Multi-resolution satellite images bathymetry inversion of Bangda Co in the western Tibetan Plateau
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water depth is important information for lake research. However, it is difficult to obtain the depth distribution of a whole lake. The method of remote-sensing inversion by combining bathymetric data has been proved to be feasible. In order to improve the inversion accuracy, it is very crucial to research the optimal inversion model and the most suitable depth for modelling, and the most appropriate satellite images for the study area. In this study, we used the three kinds of multispectral image data (Sentinel-2, GF-1, and Landsat-8) to establish models by combining bathymetric data in Bangda Co, which is located in the northwestern Tibetan Plateau. We verified the two empirical models (Stumpf model and Lyzenga model) with the three bands of blue, green, and red in 0-30 m water depth. We created a multi-factor combination model (S-L model) to compare with a BP neural network model using three images in five different water depth ranges (0-10, 0-15, 0-20, 0-25, and 0-30 m). The results indicated that the S-L model with mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.09-4.70 m, which the accuracy was slightly better than that of the two empirical models (3.35-5.03 and 3.23-4.94 m). The MAE of the BP model over the five depth ranges was 0.71-2.41 m for Landsat-8, 1.02-3.53 m for GF-1, and 1.15-3.68 m for Sentinel-2, which was higher than the S-L model. For the five ranges of three images by using the BP model, both the accuracy of Sentinel-2 and GF-1 in the range of 0-15 m was higher, but Landsat-8 was the highest at 0-20 m among five ranges; the mean relative errors (MRE) were 19.5%, 18.7%, 13.1%, and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) were 1.82, 1.72, and 1.86 m, respectively. The best applicability of the three images was Landsat-8, followed by GF-1 and Sentinel-2 in this study. The results suggested that the freely available Sentinel-2, GF-1 and Landsat-8 images could be used to estimate water storage for a shallow lake by combining bathymetric data on the Tibetan Plateau.

TI  - Relationship between anthropization and spatial patterns in two contrasting landscapes of Chile
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluated the anthropization dynamics and its relationship on landscape spatial patterns (LSPs) in two contrasting Chilean landscapes (N similar to uble and Coyhaique) over the last four decades. Using remote sensing data, we built an anthropization index (AI) derived from land use and land cover (LULC) maps, and it was evaluated between the landforms of the landscapes. The AI was compared between the two study areas with landscape metrics using generalized linear mixed effect models (GLMMs). The results showed that the mean AI for N similar to uble landscape was higher (AI = 0.53) than Coyhaique landscape (AI = 0.25). In N similar to uble, the Andean Range presented the highest rate of change in AI (31%), while in Coyhaique the Steppe showed the highest change rate (5%). It was evidenced that urban expansion, agricultural, and tree plantation were the main land uses that led to an AI's increase in both landscapes. The relationship between AI with the landscape metrics were oppositely related in each landscape. For example, the patch density and edge density metrics showed a positive relationship in Coyhaique, while in N similar to uble was negative. The proposed AI may be considered as a useful tool to deal with anthropization processes at larger spatial scales to improve landscape governance.

TI  - Habitat protection planning for Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (<i>Sousa chinensis</i>) in deteriorating environments: Knowledge gaps and recommendations for action
T2  - AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Review
AB  - In Chinese and South-east Asian waters, the coastal and estuarine environments are important habitats for the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis). Coastal and estuarine maritime engineering (CEME), including land reclamation, embankment or shoreline armouring, harbour construction and marine farming, permanently changes coastal environments and threatens the long-term persistence of marine biota and ecosystems. Such impacts on humpback dolphin viability, however, are rarely discussed. Likely core habitat of the humpback dolphin was extrapolated based on present understanding of habitat characteristics, which is much narrower than present data describing the species' range. Some uninvestigated habitats near densely populated landscapes may be prone to intense CEME impacts. CEME impacts compromise humpback dolphin survival through habitat loss, population fragmentation, alteration of ecological regimes and deterioration of ecosystem functionality. A 30% loss of core habitat can catastrophically reduce the population viability of this species. The best strategy to avoid CEME impacts on humpback dolphin viability is to adopt a conservative planning regime from the outset. To inform habitat protection planning, current and past habitat configuration and habitat characteristics of the humpback dolphin can be clarified by systematically designed surveys, local ecological knowledge investigation, long-term satellite remote-sensing data and species distribution modelling exercises. Sound habitat protection planning includes mapping hierarchical marine protected area (MPA) networks using spatial planning algorithms and carefully examining CEME impacts from an ecosystem perspective. To prevent inappropriate CEME planning, the inclusion of citizen science, local community participation, marine environmental education and effective information delivery is proposed. Questions relating to the proposed areas of habitat loss, the extent of environmental change and the status of population-habitat viability under the scenario of CEME impacts are proposed in order to examine and re-examine the environmental impacts of any CEME project.

TI  - Earth data assimilation in hydrologic models: recent advances
T2  - International Journal of Environmental Studies
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrologic model forecasts have inherent uncertainties from input errors, lack of physical representation, and parameter equifinality. Accurate modelling results with reduced uncertainty are necessary for water resources management and decision-making, especially in a changing climate scenario. To this end, the hydrologic modelling community widely accepts the assimilation of satellite remote sensing data. This paper reviews the recent developments in hydrologic data assimilation (DA) focusing on progress in the role of satellite remote sensing data in reducing model uncertainty.

TI  - Region based multi-spectral fusion method for remote sensing images using differential search algorithm and IHS transform
T2  - EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing applications such as clustering, classification, feature extraction, measurement and change detection need fused high-resolution images that contain complementary information coming from multispectral bands. To transfer as much information as possible from source images to the fused image, image fusion can be considered as an optimization problem. In this paper, a new, two-stage, multi-spectral, region based, optimal fusion method is proposed. Panchromatic and infrared bands of Landsat 8 satellite images are fused with K-medoids segmentation and Differential Search Algorithm (DSA). The fused image is combined with the red, green, and blue (RGB) bands of the same area with intensity-hue-saturation (IHS) transform. Experiments carried out on test images indicate that developed method performed better than most of the state-of-theart fusion techniques in terms of both visual and numerical evaluations.

T2  - RUSSIAN STUDIES IN PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article, for which the focus is an intellectual autobiography, examines the development of worldview of a young person who graduated from the Moscow University Faculty of Philosophy in 1970. It highlights the main socially significant events of those times, events that determined the formation of the sociopolitical views of youth who did not accept Soviet ideology. It presents the reading circles and interactions of that period and tells of the outstanding Russian philosophers of the 1960s-1970s under whose influence this professional development took place. It considers the main topics of the key scholarship in philosophy, as well as the dynamics of research interests and problems. Particular attention is paid to the story of the originality of work by the Moscow Methodological Circle, led by Georgy P. Shchedrovitsky. The circle's main task was to put all acts of reasoning and mental operations-naming, defining, describing, building ontological models and theoretical constructions, and so forth-under reflexive control. This was, to some extent, reminiscent of the inquiries of Western analytical philosophy, which made it a "suspicious" activity in the ideological sense in the Soviet Union. Cognition as a whole no longer seemed a "reflection" of reality, as had been proclaimed in the leading epistemological understanding of Marxist-Leninist philosophy. However, this also reflected the desire of intellectuals of the sixties and seventies to rationalize all social life as a whole. These dreams of "rationality" manifested at the time in the development of relevant topics in disciplines such as epistemology, in philosophy and methodology of science, and in sociological and psychological research. The author tells how the discussions of methodological problems of historical reconstruction began from positions like these. The discussion of discourse on knowledge in the humanities required not only intellectual audacity but social audacity as well. These discussions took place in informal, home-based seminars and represented a marginal, "clandestine" phenomenon.

TI  - Temperature-Vegetation-soil Moisture-Precipitation Drought Index (TVMPDI); 21-year drought monitoring in Iran using satellite imagery within Google Earth Engine
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote Sensing (RS) offers efficient tools for drought monitoring, especially in countries with a lack of reliable and consistent in-situ multi-temporal datasets. In this study, a novel RS-based Drought Index (RSDI) named Temperature-Vegetation-soil Moisture-Precipitation Drought Index (TVMPDI) was proposed. To the best of our knowledge, TVMPDI is the first RSDI using four different drought indicators in its formulation. TVMPDI was then validated and compared with six conventional RSDIs including VCI, TCI, VIII, TVDI, MPDI and TVMDI. To this end, precipitation and soil temperature in-situ data have been used. Different time scales of meteorological Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) index have also been used for the validation of the RSDIs. TVMPDI was highly correlated with the monthly precipitation and soil temperature in-situ data at 0.76 and 0.81 values respectively. The correlation coeffi-cients between the RSDIs and 3-month SPI ranged from 0.07 to 0.28, identifying the TVMPDI as the most suitable index for subsequent analyses. Since the proposed TVMPDI could considerably outperform the other selected RSDIs, all spatiotemporal drought monitoring analyses in Iran were conducted by TVMPDI over the past 21 years. In this study, different products of the Moderate Resolution Imag-ing Spectrometer (MODIS), Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), and Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) datasets containing 15,206 images were used on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. According to the results, Iran expe-rienced the most severe drought in 2000 with a 0.715 TVMPDI value lasting for almost two years. Conversely, the TVMPDI showed a minimum value equal to 0.6781 in 2019 as the lowest annual drought level. The drought severity and trend in the 31 provinces of Iran have also been mapped. Consequently, various levels of decrease over the 21 years were found for different provinces, while Isfahan and Gilan were the only provinces showing an ascending drought trend (with a 0.004% and 0.002% trendline slope respectively). Khuzestan also faced a worrying drought prevalence that occurred in several years. In summary, this study provides updated information about drought trends in Iran using an advanced and efficient RSDI implemented in the cloud computing GEE platform. These results are ben-eficial for decision-makers and officials responsible for environmental sustainability, agriculture and the effects of climate change. (c) 2021 COSPAR.

TI  - OpenET: Filling a Critical Data Gap in Water Management for the Western United States
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The lack of consistent, accurate information on evapotranspiration (ET) and consumptive use of water by irrigated agriculture is one of the most important data gaps for water managers in the western United States (U.S.) and other arid agricultural regions globally. The ability to easily access information on ET is central to improving water budgets across the West, advancing the use of data-driven irrigation management strategies, and expanding incentive-driven conservation programs. Recent advances in remote sensing of ET have led to the development of multiple approaches for field-scale ET mapping that have been used for local and regional water resource management applications by U.S. state and federal agencies. The OpenET project is a community-driven effort that is building upon these advances to develop an operational system for generating and distributing ET data at a field scale using an ensemble of six well-established satellite-based approaches for mapping ET. Key objectives of OpenET include: Increasing access to remotely sensed ET data through a web-based data explorer and data services; supporting the use of ET data for a range of water resource management applications; and development of use cases and training resources for agricultural producers and water resource managers. Here we describe the OpenET framework, including the models used in the ensemble, the satellite, meteorological, and ancillary data inputs to the system, and the OpenET data visualization and access tools. We also summarize an extensive intercomparison and accuracy assessment conducted using ground measurements of ET from 139 flux tower sites instrumented with open path eddy covariance systems. Results calculated for 24 cropland sites from Phase I of the intercomparison and accuracy assessment demonstrate strong agreement between the satellite-driven ET models and the flux tower ET data. For the six models that have been evaluated to date (ALEXI/DisALEXI, eeMETRIC, geeSEBAL, PT-JPL, SIMS, and SSEBop) and the ensemble mean, the weighted average mean absolute error (MAE) values across all sites range from 13.6 to 21.6 mm/month at a monthly timestep, and 0.74 to 1.07 mm/day at a daily timestep. At seasonal time scales, for all but one of the models the weighted mean total ET is within +/- 8% of both the ensemble mean and the weighted mean total ET calculated from the flux tower data. Overall, the ensemble mean performs as well as any individual model across nearly all accuracy statistics for croplands, though some individual models may perform better for specific sites and regions. We conclude with three brief use cases to illustrate current applications and benefits of increased access to ET data, and discuss key lessons learned from the development of OpenET.

TI  - Characterizing the spatial distribution of coral reefs in the South-Central Coast region of Viet Nam using Planetscope imagery
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to understand the spatial distribution of coral reefs in the central region of Viet Nam. We classified live coral cover in Son Tra Peninsula (ST) and Cu Lao Cham Island (CLC) in the South-Central Coast Region of Viet Nam using the Maximum Likelihood Classifier on 3 m Planetscope imagery. Confusion matrices and the accuracy of the classifier were assessed using field data (1,543 and 1,560 photographs in ST and CLC, respectively). The results showed that the reef's width ranged from 30 to 300 m across the study site, and we were able to detect live coral cover across a depth gradient of 2 to 6 m below the sea surface. The overall accuracies of the classifier (the Kappa coefficient) were 76.78% (0.76) and 78.08% (0.78) for ST and CLC, respectively. We found that 60.25% of coral reefs in ST were unhealthy and the live coral cover was less than 50%, while 25.75% and 11.46% of those in CLC were in good and excellent conditions, respectively. This study demonstrates the feasibility of utilizing Planetscope imagery to monitor shallow coral reefs of small islands at a high spatial resolution of 3 m. The results of this study provide valuable information for coral reef protection and conservation.

A1  - Stimulant Syndrome Dev Validation
TI  - Development and Validation of a Syndrome Definition for Suspected Nonfatal Unintentional/Undetermined Intent Stimulant-Involved Overdoses
T2  - PUBLIC HEALTH REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives To monitor stimulant-involved overdose (SOD) trends, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) developed and evaluated the validity of a syndromic surveillance definition for suspected nonfatal, unintentional/undetermined intent stimulant-involved overdose (UUSOD). Methods We analyzed all emergency department (ED) visits in CDC's surveillance system that met the UUSOD syndrome definition (January 2018-December 2019). We classified visits as true positive, possible, or not UUSODs after reviewing diagnosis codes and chief complaints. We first assessed whether visits were acute SODs, subsequently classifying acute SODs by intent. The percentage of true-positive UUSODs did not include intentional or possibly intentional visits. We considered all visits with UUSOD diagnosis codes to be acute SODs and reviewed them for intent. We manually reviewed and double-coded a 10% random sample of visits without UUSOD diagnosis codes using decision rules based on signs and symptoms. The overall percentage of true-positive UUSODs was a weighted average of the percentage of true-positive UUSODs based on diagnosis codes and the percentage of true-positive UUSODs determined by manually reviewing visits without codes. Results During 2018-2019, 40 045 ED visits met the syndrome definition for UUSOD. Approximately half (n = 18 793; 46.9%) of 40 045 visits had UUSOD diagnosis codes, indicating acute SOD; of these, 98.6% (n = 18 534) were true-positive UUSODs. Of 2125 manually reviewed visits without UUSOD diagnosis codes, 32.6% (n = 693) were true-positive UUSODs, 54.2% (n = 1151) were possible UUSODs, and 13.2% (n = 281) were not UUSODs. Overall, 63.6% of visits were true-positive UUSODs, 29.3% were possible UUSODs, and 7.1% were not UUSODs. Practice Implications CDC's UUSOD definition may assist in surveillance efforts with further refinement to capture data on SOD clusters and trends.

TI  - Transfer learning based ship classification in Sentinel-1 images incorporating scale variant features
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - With the accessibility of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data and evolution of deep learning, several experiments have been performed in the recent years to actively monitor human activities at sea. Due to the flexible network configuration and complex nature, models based on Convolutional Neural Networks have been able to boost the performance of maritime target classification systems. The novel idea behind these techniques is to enhance the efficiency and automation in the process. However, the limited availability of labeled data and lower resolution of Sentinel-1 (SAR) images have constrained the accuracy of classification models based on the deep learning methods. Besides, it is observed that image processing techniques have resulted in the loss of information present in the images. To overcome these issues, a new method has been developed in the present work that integrates transfer learning techniques (referred to as ResNet50) with additional scale-variant features extracted before image processing. To test our model, SAR and Automatic Identification System (AIS) data were collected from 3 locations: Jawaharlal Nehru (JN) Port (India), Singapore Port (Singapore), and Shanghai-Zhoushan Port (China). A labeling process was done by using the SAR-AIS Neighbourhood integration. Experimental work showed that the proposed architecture of ResNet50 model synergized with extracted scale variant features provides promising results with the classification accuracy of 82.35% and F score of 0.82 on the test dataset, when no models have been developed and trained on Sentinel-1 20 m resolution data for given ship classes.

TI  - Estimation of extent of the mangrove defoliation caused by insect <i>Hyblaea puera</i> (Cramer, 1777) around Dharamtar creek, India using Sentinel 2 images
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves have been continuously affected due to human-induced and natural stresses. Therefore, reliable, accurate, and timely mangrove information is essential for conservation, protection, and sustainable management. Recent advances in remote sensing technology have provided an opportunity to observe and monitor mangroves spatially and temporally. Remote sensing technology could detect and acquire information like mangrove extent, cover change, species composition, canopy density, mangrove biomass, and carbon sequestration. In this study, European satellite Sentinel-2 data was used to map the defoliation of mangroves of Dharamtar creek, India, caused by the insect 'teak defoliator' (Hyblaea puera). Defoliation from the study area was recorded from August 2019 to October 2019. Mangrove plant Avicennia marina is the most dominant species distributed across the forest, and it was the only species observed to be infested. The total area of mangroves of Dharamtar creek was estimated to be 8175.5 ha. Out of the total mangrove area, high defoliated, moderately defoliated, low defoliated and very low defoliated and un-defoliated mangrove areas were estimated as 6.6%, 9.9%, 8.3%, 50.17% and 25.0%, respectively. The infestation was affected more than 6,000 hectares of mangroves. Unhealthy and stressed mangroves due to defoliation caused by the infestation of H. puera were detected using NDVI in the study area. The details regarding the moth, infestation of mangroves, its causes, impacts and other related information was discussed. We recommend further studies to investigate the causes of outbreaks, preference of this insect to this particular species of mangroves over other species and other implications of defoliation.

TI  - Characteristics of suspended sediment in Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The main purpose of this study is to quantitatively examine the characteristics of suspended sediment on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations of sea roughness. In this work, seven Sentinel-1 (S-1) SAR images in 2019 acquired in the Interferometric Wide-swath (IW) mode at vertical-vertical (VV) polarization channel were collected, where Yangtze River freshwater dominants and suspended sediment concentration (SSC) are higher in continental shelf of East China Sea (ECS). These images were collocated with waves simulated from WAVEWATCH-III (WW3) and SSC inverted from the Haiyang-1C (HY-1C) Coastal Zone Imager (CZI) image. The comparison of WW3-simulated SWH yielded a 0.45-m root-mean-square error (RMSE) with a 0.78 correlation (COR) when comparing the simulations with the measurements from Haiyang-2B (HY-2B). The SAR-measured normalized radar cross-section (NRCS) is linearly related with the HY-1 C SSC at SSC > 1200 mg l(-1), which is caused by the change of dielectric constant of sea water and viscosity. Moreover, the NRCS is simulated by the three-scale radar backscattering model. It is generally found that HY-1 C SSC enhances the NRCS in difference between simulations and observations up to 8 dB at SSC of 2000 mg l(-1), which could distort the accuracy of SAR wind retrieval.

TI  - Assessing the effects of different land-use/land- cover input datasets on modelling and mapping terrestrial ecosystem services- Case study Terceira Island (Azores, Portugal)
T2  - ONE ECOSYSTEM
M3  - Article
AB  - Modelling ecosystem services (ES) has become a new standard for the quantification and assessment of various ES. Multiple ES model applications are available that spatially estimate ES supply on the basis of land-use/land-cover (LULC) input data. This paper assesses how different input LULC datasets affect the modelling and mapping of ES supply for a case study on Terceira Island, the Azores (Portugal), namely: (1) the EU-wide CORINE LULC, (2) the Azores Region official LULC map (COS.A 2018) and (3) a remote sensing-based LULC and vegetation map of Terceira Island using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. The InVEST model suite was applied, modelling altogether six ES (Recreation/ Visitation, Pollination, Carbon Storage, Nutrient Delivery Ratio, Sediment Delivery Ratio and Seasonal Water Yield). Model outcomes of the three LULC datasets were compared in terms of similarity, performance and applicability for the user. For some InVEST modules, such as Pollination and Recreation, the differences in the LULC datasets had limited influence on the model results. For InVEST modules, based on more complex calculations and processes, such as Nutrient Delivery Ratio, the output ES maps showed a skewed distribution of ES supply. Yet, model results showed significant differences for differences in all modules and all LULCs. Understanding how differences arise between the LULC input datasets and the respective effect on model results is imperative when computing model-based ES maps. The choice for selecting appropriate LULC data should depend on: 1) the research or policy/decision-making question guiding the modelling study, 2) the ecosystems to be mapped, but also on 3) the spatial resolution of the mapping and 4) data availability at the local level. Communication and transparency on model input data are needed, especially if ES maps are used for supporting land use planning and decision -making.

TI  - Assessment of Agricultural Relevance on Groundwater Indicator in a Command Area of Eastern India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater is a ubiquitous natural resource and one of the most reliable sources of freshwater worldwide. The rapid population growth, water demand in various sectors as well as maximizing agricultural production have led to over-exploitation of groundwater in different parts of the world, including India. Therefore, the information on crop water demands and availability of reliable groundwater resources is necessary for establishing strategies for optimal irrigation water supply. This study aims to map 'potential groundwater resources' (PGWR), 'fraction of vegetation' (FV) as an alternative crop coefficient using remote sensing data and 'crop water demands' and to develop a new indicator named 'Agricultural Groundwater Resources Indicator' (AGRI) for 'Normal', 'Dry' and 'Wet' years in the Damodar Canal Command (DCC). The mean, median, SD and CV of the groundwater fluctuation are evaluated at 4.56 m, 4.6 m, 0.85 m and 0.19 m/m, respectively. The maximum and minimum potential groundwater resources were computed at 1247 mm and 245 mm, respectively. The maximum annual crop evapotranspiration (ETc) for the 'Normal', 'Dry' and 'Wet' years of the study command was computed at 1166 mm year(-1), 1290 mm year(-1) and 999 mm year(-1), respectively. During the 'Normal' year, crop water demands in about 60% of the study area could be fulfilled from the PGWR supply. In this study, an indicator named AGRI was used for the first time in identifying possible spatial irrigation adequacy from the potential groundwater resources. The map of AGRI could be the reference map for managing the uniform distribution of irrigation water supply in the DCC. The developed AGRI map will provide valuable information to the water planners, water managers, decision-makers, engineers, agriculturists and farmers in particular for sustainable water management. Being adaptive in nature, the proposed model can be applied worldwide irrespective of diverse agro-climatic conditions.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The resolution of remote-sensing images is directly related to the application value of data products. Due to differences in imaging characteristics between digital cameras and remote-sensing cameras, the existing network models cannot get the best super resolution (SR) results of satellite images. In response to the requirements of remote-sensing image production, we propose a single image super-resolution (SISR) reconstruction method for specific type of remote-sensing satellite. First, we measure and model the imaging degradation phenomenon of remote-sensing satellite, including the image blur and noise model. Then, high-quality aerial images are down-sampled and degraded to construct paired training image datasets. We chose the most popular Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (ESRGAN) as the basic structure and optimized the number of Residual-in-Residual Dense Block (RRDB) modules to further improve the processing efficiency. Finally, we perform a series of quantitative measurements of the SR image results, including image interpretation capability, reconstruction accuracy, ground resolution distance, and data processing efficiency, using higher resolution remote-sensing images as the benchmark. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method has higher interpretation capability and reconstruction accuracy for the SR processing of specific type remote-sensing satellite. Our proposed method is evaluated within a real satellite image product, that demonstrated it has the capability of pipeline super-resolution processing of remote sensing data products.

TI  - Infrared precipitation estimation using convolutional neural network for FengYun satellites
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Infrared (IR) is an important data source for satellite quantitative precipitation estimation, and has been widely applied in the fields of meteorology, hydrology, and agriculture. In the past decades, a series of IR retrieval algorithms have been developed to support the production of IR-based and IR-microwave merged precipitation products. Recently, deep learning techniques such as the convolutional neural network (CNN) show great potential in obtaining IR precipitation estimates with higher accuracy than traditional retrieval algorithms. In this study, we present an upgraded version of IR Precipitation Estimation using CNN (IPEC), i.e., IPEC version 2 (IPEC-V2), with a new end-to-end manner. IPEC-V2 is used to generate a precipitation dataset based on IR data from China's Fengyun (FY) geostationary satellites (FY-2F, 2G, and 4A). To overcome the difficulty of model training in regions with sparse observations, IPEC-V2 models are firstly pre-trained over the data-rich Continental US (CONUS) using IR data from the Geostationary Operational Environment Satellite (GOES). The models are then transferred to China through re-training with multi-band IR signals from FY satellites. Finally, a long-term record of high-resolution FY IR precipitation estimates is produced during the period from November 9, 2012 to February 28, 2021, which is named as IPEC-FY. IPEC-FY shows better performance than the baseline Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Cloud Classification System (PERSIANN-CCS) with 76.2% gain in Pearson's correlation coefficient and 18.4% gain in root mean squared error in China. This study shows that transfer learning is an effective way to build CNN models in regions without enough observations, and the high-quality IPEC-FY can act as an alternative precipitation dataset for research in China.

TI  - A boundary finding-based spatiotemporal fusion model for vegetation index
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatiotemporal image fusion technique is regarded as an effective and efficient remedy to blend two or more geometrically registered remote sensing images of the same scene acquired from different sensors into a single image with both high temporal and high spatial resolutions. A number of existing fusion methods developed for generating Landsat-like images from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) have successfully solved limitations on vegetation dynamics monitoring. However, these methods either treat the weighting parameters as constants or adopt insufficient linear regression coefficients (considering only spatial, temporal or spectral weights), which may contribute to blocky artefacts and dissimilar pixels in the predicted image. In this study, a boundary finding-based vegetation index spatiotemporal fusion model (BESFM) is newly proposed to generate high spatial and high temporal resolutions Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) images in homogeneous and heterogeneous regions with rapid vegetation changes. The cloud-free Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and the MODIS (MOD09GA) data acquired from two study sites, located in Queensland and New South Wales and Australia, were selected to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Compared with the enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (ESTARFM) and flexible spatiotemporal data fusion (FSDAF), the BESFM outperforms in both visible image quality (reducing the spatial distortion and blocky artefacts in prediction caused by abrupt land cover changes) and quantitative indices (with RSME minimum to 0.011 and R-2 maximum to 0.956). Since the BESFM method not only uses adjustable linear regression assumptions for heterogeneous and homogeneous regions differently but also implements boundary detection-based spatial weight with temporal and spectral weights together to enhance the predicted spatial details, it has the potential to increase the availability of fine spatial resolution data.

TI  - Retrieving the displacements of the Hutubi (China) underground gas storage during 2003-2020 from multi-track InSAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Many countries and regions build underground gas storages (UGSs) to regulate the energy demand and supply in different seasons. The Hutubi underground gas storage (HUGS) in Xinjiang province is the largest UGS in China, so it is of great significance to monitor its operation. At present, the researches on the HUGS mainly rely on traditional geodetic monitoring (e.g., in-situ leveling and global navigation satellite system (GNSS)), which has a short time span and low spatial resolution. The whole-domain and long-temporal sequence surface displacements induced by gas recovery (before 2013) and injection/extraction (since 09/06/2013) were seldom reported. In this study, the large-scale background deformation was firstly obtained using the ALOS PALSAR data (2006-2011), and the displacement time series of the HUGS over 2003-2020 was observed by all available Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data from multiple SAR sensors (Envisat ASAR, TerraSAR/TanDEM-X, Sentinel1). The results show that this area had a long history of slow subsidence (2.2 mm/yr) before 2013. Since 06/ 2013, the surface of the HUGS showed periodic uplift and subsidence with a net uplift. The average uplift rate in the center was about 7 mm/yr during 08/2013-07/2015 and 13 mm/yr during 03/2015-05/2020. The deformation has a temporal correspondence with the gas extraction/injection process. The accuracy is assessed by the cross-validation of the results of different datasets and the GNSS measurements. The compound dislocation model (CDM) is used to model the dynamic displacements caused by gas injection/extraction in HUGS. This model can reflect the UGS volume changes and the estimated central depth (3499.7 m) and height (108.6 m) of the storage are consistent with the actual central depth (-3585 m) and height (-110 m). We also restore the dynamic change of the pore pressure and the injected gas volume during the 5-7 cycles, on the basis of the linear relations between gas injection volume, pore pressure, and CDM parameters. In 12/2017, the estimated gas inventory of the HUGS is 91.29 x 108 m3, about 4.7% smaller than the real gas inventory of 95.77 x 108 m3. At the end of the seventh injection/extraction cycle, the predicted maximum gas injection volume and pore pressure reached 11.2 billion m3 and 36 MPa, respectively.

TI  - Semantic segmentation of high-resolution remote sensing images based on a class feature attention mechanism fused with Deeplabv3+
T2  - COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Aiming at solving the problems of inaccurate segmentation of edge targets, inconsistent segmentation of different types of targets, and slow prediction efficiency on semantic segmentation of high-resolution remote sensing images by classical semantic segmentation network, this study proposed a class feature attention mechanism fused with an improved Deeplabv3+ network called CFAMNet for semantic segmentation of common features in remote sensing images. First, the correlation between classes is enhanced using the class feature attention module to extract and process different categories of semantic information better. Second, the multi-parallel atrous spatial pyramid pooling structure is used to enhance the correlation between spaces, to extract the context information of different scales of an image better. Finally, the encoder-decoder structure is used to refine the segmentation results. The segmentation effect of the proposed network is verified by experiments on the public data set GaoFen image dataset (GID). The experimental results show that the CFAMNet can achieve the mean intersection over union (MIOU) and overall accuracy (OA) of 77.22% and 85.01%, respectively, on the GID, thus surpassing the current mainstream semantic segmentation networks.

TI  - Phenology-based decision tree classification of rice-crayfish fields from Sentinel-2 imagery in Qianjiang, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice-crayfish farming systems combining rice cultivation and crayfish breeding have been a widely adopted unique cropping system in Central and Southern China. Despite the importance of understanding and monitoring the rice-crayfish fields, mapping rice-crayfish fields and identifying it from pure rice fields are challenging due to their spectral similarity and complexity. To solve this problem, we propose a new rice-crayfish mapping method based on Sentinel-2 data, a decision tree model and phenological characteristics. In doing so, segmentation of Sentinel-2 image data was first performed using an object-oriented approach, and spectral features of the images were extracted as segmented image objects. Crops were then classified using a decision tree classifier by selecting spectral features and texture features as classification indices. Summer and winter datasets for two special periods were finally used to construct a decision tree classifier to distinguish rice-crayfish fields from midseason rice fields. We tested this method in the birthplace of rice-crayfish farming system, Qianjiang county, China. A comparison with surveyed sample points showed a rice-crayfish field classification producer accuracy of 0.84 and user accuracy of 0.92. This indicates that the proposed approach is suitable for mapping regional-scale rice-crayfish fields and could be valuable for the monitoring and management of rice-crayfish fields.

TI  - Simulation and mapping of drought and soil erosion in Central Yunnan Province, China
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Central Yunnan Province is the political, economic, cultural, and transportation hub of Yunnan Province, China. Climate change has resulted in increased seasonality of global averaged precipitation, temperature, runoff, and evapotranspiration, thereby exacerbating extreme events such as drought and soil erosion. The simulation and mapping of drought and soil erosion within Central Yunnan Province is important for achieving sustainable development. This study constructed a comprehensive drought monitoring model and a soil erosion model based on multiple sources of remote sensing data, considering numerous drought and soil erosion factors. The temporal and spatial characteristics of dry-season drought and soil erosion for 2010 to 2018 in Central Yunnan Province were explored, and the extents of soil erosion in different parts of Central Yunnan Province were quantified using the soil erosion intensity index. The results showed that: (1) The multi-year average percentage dry-season drought coverage and average drought frequency were 33.98% and 18.33 months, respectively. Although drought frequency was higher in areas with high drought intensity, dry-season drought showed a long-term weakening trend. (2) Over the study period, the multi-year average soil erosion of Central Yunnan Province was 1,551.45 t km(-2).yr(-1). Soil erosion showed an initial overall increasing trend, followed by a decreasing trend, dominated by micro erosion, mild erosion, and moderate erosion, whereas the mountains and valleys in north and southwest parts of Central Yunnan Province experienced severe erosion. Vegetation coverage and slope were identified as the main factors driving soil erosion. (3) The soil erosion intensity index was a good indicator of soil erosion severity across different spatial scales and different drought grades. The soil erosion intensity index showed a positive relationship with drought grade. The correlation coefficients between soil erosion intensity and drought frequency and between soil erosion intensity and drought intensity were 0.2623 and -0.2679, respectively. This study demonstrated that drought affects soil erosion and that water and soil conservation measures such as afforestation and vegetation greening are beneficial to mitigating soil erosion and drought in Central Yunnan Province.

TI  - Determination of global land surface temperature using data from only five selected thermal infrared channels: Method extension and accuracy assessment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is an essential input for modeling the processes of energy exchange and balance of the earth's surface. Thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing is considered to be the most efficient way to obtain accurate LST, both regionally and globally. Currently, many LST retrieval algorithms have been developed, including the up-to-date SW-TES (SW: split window; TES: temperature-emissivity separation) method, which is claimed to be able to accurately derive LST without the need for atmospheric information and land surface emissivity (LSE) based on the selected multiple TIR channel configuration. However, this hybrid method is actually not applicable to observations with large viewing angles and was only preliminarily evaluated in Australia. In this study, this method was extended for application to global TIR measurements with different viewing angles. Additionally, the performance of this extended SW-TES method was assessed globally for different seasons by using the MODIS LST product as a reference, and was also validated using in-situ LST measurements from the SURFRAD (SURFace RADiation budget network) sites. The results showed that the LST retrievals using the extended SW-TES method were comparable to the MODIS LST product, with discrepancies of <2.7 K and < 1.8 K for global daytime and nighttime observations, respectively. Validations based on the SURFRAD in-situ LST measurements indicated that the extended method could be used to retrieve LST accurately with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of approximately 3.6 K during the daytime and 2.4 K during the nighttime. However, special attention should be paid when applying the extended method to daytime observations on grasslands and shrublands during hot seasons, considering the relatively large discrepancy when using this method compared with that obtained with the MODIS LST product (>4.0 K). Overall, in this study, the SW-TES method was extended, and the performance was comprehensively evaluated at the global scale, which may help in facilitating its potential applications.

TI  - A Dual Network for Super-Resolution and Semantic Segmentation of Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a growing interest in the development of automated data processing workflows that provide reliable, high spatial resolution land cover maps. However, high-resolution remote sensing images are not always affordable. Taking into account the free availability of Sentinel-2 satellite data, in this work we propose a deep learning model to generate high-resolution segmentation maps from low-resolution inputs in a multi-task approach. Our proposal is a dual-network model with two branches: the Single Image Super-Resolution branch, that reconstructs a high-resolution version of the input image, and the Semantic Segmentation Super-Resolution branch, that predicts a high-resolution segmentation map with a scaling factor of 2. We performed several experiments to find the best architecture, training and testing on a subset of the S2GLC 2017 dataset. We based our model on the DeepLabV3+ architecture, enhancing the model and achieving an improvement of 5% on IoU and almost 10% on the recall score. Furthermore, our qualitative results demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed approach.

TI  - Evolution of the Koma Bangou Gold Panning Site (Niger) From 1984 to 2020 Using Landsat Imagery
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The severe drought of 1983-1984 in the Sahel region, and its socio-economic impacts for people relying on farming had for consequence the first major gold rush at Koma Bangou in the southwestern part of Niger. Initiated in 1984, the gold panning activities were interrupted from 1989 to 1999 with exploration permits assigned to the mining industry. The site was reclassified at the year-end 1999 as a gold panning site and artisanal mining resumed until present-day. Gold panning activities such as ore extraction and cyanide processing produced mining waste including rocks, mine tailings, and treatment residues. Mining waste is a serious environmental, health and safety problem. Multispectral Landsat images (TM4-5, ETM7+, OLI/TIRS) acquired between 1984 and 2020 were used to map the spatial evolution of waste generated by gold panning activities at Koma Bangou. Different processing methods were tested, including Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) transform, Band Ratio (BR), and Feature Oriented Principal Component Selection (FPCS). The FPCS applied to hydroxyl-bearing minerals appears to be most efficient to map gold extraction and cyanidation waste areas. The waste surface associated with ore extraction has increased from 9.43 ha in 1984 to 234.20 ha in 2020, with continuous expansion during the period of clandestine activity (1989-1999). The waste surface associated with cyanidation has increased from 5.56 ha in 2009 (the year of cyanide treatment introduction) to 99.53 ha in 2020. Landsat multispectral imagery proved a suitable data source for monitoring the evolution of gold mining waste and consequences of public policies at Koma Bangou.

TI  - Investigation of Potential of Solar Photovoltaic System as an Alternative Electric Supply on the Tropical Island of Mantanani Sabah Malaysia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article reports on the potential use of a photovoltaic solar system on Mantanani Island. This island has its attractions in terms of flora and fauna as well as the uniqueness of its local community. The electricity supply status of the island is minimal, and the local electricity provider only provides two units of electrical generator that only supply energy from 18:00 to 06:00. This study is motivated by the hypothesis that if the target resident can obtain a better electricity supply, they can generate higher income and improve their standard of living. This study aims to identify the status of solar energy sources, estimate the basic electrical load, and conduct a techno-economic analysis of homestay enterprises of residents. Geostationary satellite data on solar energy resources were gathered and analyzed using Solargis. The electricity load was calculated based on the daily routine activities of the residents and usage of primary electrical appliances. Techno-economic analysis was done by determining the key parameters to calculate the return on investment and payback period. The results showed that Mantanani Island had great potential for implementing a photovoltaic system, by the estimated value of the total annual solar energy and peak sun hour of 1.447 MWh/m(2)/y and 4.05 h, respectively. The variation in total monthly solar energy was minimal, with a range of only 61.3 Wh/m(2). The calculated electrical load was 7.454 kWh/d. The technoeconomic assessment showed that the return on investment was MYR 3600 per year. However, the value of the payback period varies according to the value of the cost of capital spent. Regarding the cost of capital of this study, the shortest and longest payback periods achievable were 2.78 and 13.89 years, respectively. This calculation is in line with a photovoltaic system with a capacity of 2.2 kWp.

TI  - Synergy of Remote Sensing Data for Exploring Hydrothermal Mineral Resources Using GIS-Based Fuzzy Logic Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Arabian Nubian Shield (ANS) contains a variety of gold deposits in the form of veins and veinlets formed by hydrothermal fluids. Characterizing potential areas of hydrothermal alteration zones therefore provides a significant tool for prospecting for hydrothermal gold deposits. In this study, we develop a model of exploration for hydrothermal mineral resources in an area located in the ANS, Egypt, using multiple criteria derived from Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), Landsat-Operational Land Imager (OLI), and Sentinel-2 data and field work through GIS-based fuzzy logic approach. The hydrothermal alteration zones (HAZs) map extracted from combining mineral indices, spectral bands, and ratios is consistent with observed argillic alteration zones around the mineralized veins. Combining HAZs and lineament density led to identification of six zones based on their mineralization potential, and provides a tool for successful reconnaissance prospecting for future hydrothermal mineral deposits. The detected zones are labeled as excellent, very high, high, moderate, low, and very low, based on their potential for Au production, and the predictive excellent and very high zones cover about 1.6% of the study area. This model also shows that target prospective zones are quartz veins controlled by NNW-SSE trending fracture/fault zones all crosscutting Precambrian rocks of the ANS. Field observations and petrographic and X-ray diffraction analyses were performed to validate the mineral prospective map and revealed that quartz veins consist of gold-sulfide mineralization (e.g., gold, pyrite, chalcopyrite, and sphalerite). Consistency between the high potential hydrothermal alterations zones (HAZs) and the location of gold mineralization is achieved.

TI  - Coupling Remote Sensing Data and AquaCrop Model for Simulation of Winter Wheat Growth under Rainfed and Irrigated Conditions in a Mediterranean Environment
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The coupling of remote sensing technology and crop growth models represents a promising approach to support crop yield prediction and irrigation management. In this study, five vegetation indices were derived from the Copernicus-Sentinel 2 satellite to investigate their performance monitoring winter wheat growth in a Mediterranean environment in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley. Among those indices, the fraction of canopy cover was integrated into the AquaCrop model to simulate biomass and yield of wheat grown under rainfed conditions and fully irrigated regimes. The experiment was conducted during three consecutive growing seasons (from 2017 to 2019), characterized by different precipitation patterns. The AquaCrop model was calibrated and validated for different water regimes, and its performance was tested when coupled with remote sensing canopy cover. The results showed a good fit between measured canopy cover and Leaf Area Index (LAI) data and those derived from Sentinel 2 images. The R-2 coefficient was 0.79 for canopy cover and 0.77 for LAI. Moreover, the regressions were fitted to relate biomass with Sentinel 2 vegetation indices. In descending order of R-2, the indices were ranked: Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC), LAI, the fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (fAPAR), the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). Notably, FVC and LAI were highly correlated with biomass. The results of the AquaCrop calibration showed that the modeling efficiency values, NSE, were 0.99 for well-watered treatments and 0.95 for rainfed conditions, confirming the goodness of fit between measured and simulated values. The validation results confirmed that the simulated yield varied from 2.59 to 5.36 t ha(-1), while the measured yield varied from 3.08 to 5.63 t ha(-1) for full irrigation and rainfed treatments. After integrating the canopy cover into AquaCrop, the % of deviation of simulated and measured variables was reduced. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for yield ranged between 0.08 and 0.69 t ha(-1) before coupling and between 0.04 and 0.42 t ha(-1) after integration. This result confirmed that the presented integration framework represents a promising method to improve the prediction of wheat crop growth in Mediterranean areas. Further studies are needed before being applied on a larger scale.

TI  - Toward an Integrated Disaster Management Approach: How Artificial Intelligence Can Boost Disaster Management
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Review
AB  - Technical and methodological enhancement of hazards and disaster research is identified as a critical question in disaster management. Artificial intelligence (AI) applications, such as tracking and mapping, geospatial analysis, remote sensing techniques, robotics, drone technology, machine learning, telecom and network services, accident and hot spot analysis, smart city urban planning, transportation planning, and environmental impact analysis, are the technological components of societal change, having significant implications for research on the societal response to hazards and disasters. Social science researchers have used various technologies and methods to examine hazards and disasters through disciplinary, multidisciplinary, and interdisciplinary lenses. They have employed both quantitative and qualitative data collection and data analysis strategies. This study provides an overview of the current applications of AI in disaster management during its four phases and how AI is vital to all disaster management phases, leading to a faster, more concise, equipped response. Integrating a geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) into disaster management enables higher planning, analysis, situational awareness, and recovery operations. GIS and RS are commonly recognized as key support tools for disaster management. Visualization capabilities, satellite images, and artificial intelligence analysis can assist governments in making quick decisions after natural disasters.

TI  - Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in Hydrology and Water Management: Applications, Challenges, and Perspectives
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - The hydrologic sciences and water resources management have long depended on a combination of in situ measurements and remotely sensed data for research and regulatory purposes. In situ measurements are constrained in their spatial distribution by both logistics and costs. Satellite- and manned aircraft-based remote sensing provide spatially broad data, but often of a coarse resolution. Furthermore, all these data collection methods are often limited in their ability to respond to specific short-term events when the data and imagery could inform real-time assessment and decision-making, especially during and immediately after natural disasters. Researchers and regulators are increasingly using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to fill these gaps in both spatial and temporal data resolution. UAVs are often more cost-effective than traditional remote sensing or in situ data collection methodologies and the availability of new advancements in UAV design, power supply, payload capacity, and sensors has been driving rapid innovations in their use in the hydrological sciences. This in-depth review explores these UAV technologies and how they are being employed for on-demand and cost-effective characterization, monitoring, assessment, and modeling of soil and water resources. Our discussion addresses both key opportunities and challenges in surface water and groundwater studies, land-atmosphere interaction studies, water management in agriculture and forestry, ecosystem monitoring, and hydrological modeling.

TI  - Moving Toward L-Band NASA-ISRO SAR Mission (NISAR) Dense Time Series: Multipolarization Object-Based Classification of Wetlands Using Two Machine Learning Algorithms
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Given the key role wetlands play in climate regulation and shoreline stabilization, identifying their spatial distribution is essential for the management, restoration, and protection of these invaluable ecosystems. The increasing availability of high spatial and temporal resolution optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing data coupled with advanced machine learning techniques have provided an unprecedented opportunity for mapping complex wetlands' ecosystems. A recent partnership between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) resulted in the design of the NASA-ISRO SAR (NISAR) mission. In this study, the capability of L-band simulated NISAR data for wetland mapping in Yucatan Lake, Louisiana, is investigated using two object-based machine learning approaches: Support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF). L-band Unmanned Aerial Vehicle SAR (UAVSAR) data are exploited as a proxy for NISAR data. Specifically, we evaluated the synergistic use of different polarimetric features for efficient delineation of wetland types, extracting 84 polarimetric features from more than 10 polarimetric decompositions. High spatial resolution National Agriculture Imagery Program imagery is applied for image segmentation using the mean-shift algorithm. Overall accuracies of 74.33% and 81.93% obtained by SVM and RF, respectively, demonstrate the great possibility of L-band prototype NISAR data for wetland mapping and monitoring. In addition, variable importance analysis using the Gini index for RF classifier suggests that H/A/ALPHA, Freeman-Durden, and Aghababaee features have the highest contribution to the overall accuracy.

TI  - Effect of Using Different Amounts of Multi-Temporal Data on the Accuracy: A Case of Land Cover Mapping of Parts of Africa Using FengYun-3C Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Regional or continental-scale land cover mapping requires various amounts of months of multi-temporal satellite data to pick phenological variation in vegetation, enhancing differentiability among surface cover types and improving accuracy. However, little has been addressed about the number of months/multi-temporal images needed to obtain the best result and the impact of using different amounts of these data on the accuracy of individual classes. This work aimed to analyze these effects by utilizing the various amounts of months of time series FengYun-3C (FY-3C) data within one year for land cover mapping of parts of Africa using a random forest classifier. The study area covers roughly one-third of Africa, including eastern, central, and northern parts of the continent. One-year FY-3C ten-day composite images consisting of eleven-band each with 1-km spatial resolution were divided into seven input datasets that comprise stacked images of 1-month, 3-month, 6-month, consecutive 9-month, 12-month, selected images from 12 months using band/feature importance, and selected 9-month. Comparisons of these datasets on independent test samples revealed that overall accuracy, kappa coefficient, and the accuracy of the individual classes generally increase significantly with increasing the number of data/months. However, the highest accuracy and kappa coefficient, 0.86 and 0.83, were obtained by processing selected 9-month imageries. The second maximum accuracy and kappa (0.85 and 0.82,) were found by manipulating 12-month scenes which are the same as the results obtained by applying feature reduction. Although 4% and 5% higher accuracy were achieved by manipulating 3-month and 6-month data relative to 1-month imageries, no variation of accuracy was observed between six- and nine-months of consecutive data, both yielding equal accuracy and kappa value (0.84 and 0.81) indicating redundancy of information. Overall, the high accuracy results show the feasibility of FY-3C data for land cover mapping of Africa.

TI  - Vegetation Types Mapping Using Multi-Temporal Landsat Images in the Google Earth Engine Platform
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation Types (VTs) are important managerial units, and their identification serves as essential tools for the conservation of land covers. Despite a long history of Earth observation applications to assess and monitor land covers, the quantitative detection of sparse VTs remains problematic, especially in arid and semiarid areas. This research aimed to identify appropriate multi-temporal datasets to improve the accuracy of VTs classification in a heterogeneous landscape in Central Zagros, Iran. To do so, first the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) temporal profile of each VT was identified in the study area for the period of 2018, 2019, and 2020. This data revealed strong seasonal phenological patterns and key periods of VTs separation. It led us to select the optimal time series images to be used in the VTs classification. We then compared single-date and multi-temporal datasets of Landsat 8 images within the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform as the input to the Random Forest classifier for VTs detection. The single-date classification gave a median Overall Kappa (OK) and Overall Accuracy (OA) of 51% and 64%, respectively. Instead, using multi-temporal images led to an overall kappa accuracy of 74% and an overall accuracy of 81%. Thus, the exploitation of multi-temporal datasets favored accurate VTs classification. In addition, the presented results underline that available open access cloud-computing platforms such as the GEE facilitates identifying optimal periods and multitemporal imagery for VTs classification.

TI  - Local Climate Zones and Thermal Characteristics in Riyadh City, Saudi Arabia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Using the local climate zone (LCZ) framework and multiple Earth observation input features, an LCZ classification was developed and established for Riyadh City in 2017. Four land-cover-type and four urban-type LCZs were identified in the city with an overall accuracy of 87%. The bare soil/sand (LCZ-F) class was found to be the largest LCZ class, which was within the nature of arid climate cities. Other land-cover LCZs had a lower coverage percentage (each class with < 7%). The compact low-rise (LCZ-3) class was the largest urban type, as urban development in arid climate cities tends to extend horizontally. The daytime surface thermal characteristics of the developed LCZs were analyzed at seasonal timescales using land surface temperature (LST) estimated from multiple Landsat 8 satellite images (June 2017-May 2018). The highest daytime mean LST was found over large low-rise (LCZ-8) class areas throughout the year. This class was the only urban-type LCZ class that demonstrated a positive LST departure from the overall mean LST across seasons. Other urban-type LCZ classes showed lower LSTs and negative deviations from the overall mean LSTs. The overall thermal results suggested the presence of the surface urban heat island sink phenomenon as urban areas experienced lower LSTs than their surroundings. Thermal results demonstrated that the magnitudes of LST differences among LCZs were considerably dependent on the way the region of interest/analysis was defined. This was related to the types of LCZ classes presented in the study area and the spatial distribution and abundance of these LCZ classes. The developed LCZ classification and thermal results have several potential applications in different areas including planning and urban design strategies and urban health-related studies.

TI  - Global Satellite-Based Coastal Bathymetry from Waves
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The seafloor-or bathymetry-of the world's coastal waters remains largely unknown despite its primary importance to human activities and ecosystems. Here we present S2Shores (Satellite to Shores), the first sub-kilometer global atlas of coastal bathymetry based on depth inversion from wave kinematics captured by the Sentinel-2 constellation. The methodology reveals coastal seafloors up to a hundred meters in depth which allows covering most continental shelves and represents 4.9 million km2 along the world coastline. Although the vertical accuracy (RMSE 6-9 m) is currently coarser than that of traditional surveying techniques, S2Shores is of particular interest to countries that do not have the means to carry out in situ surveys and to unexplored regions such as polar areas. S2Shores is a major step forward in mitigating the effects of global changes on coastal communities and ecosystems by providing scientists, engineers, and policy makers with new science-based decision tools.

TI  - Quantification of Urban Patterns and Processes through Space and Time Using Remote Sensing Data: A Comparative Study between Three Saudi Arabian Cities
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Saudi Arabia has developed rapidly over the last five decades in the wake of an extensive development programme implemented by the government throughout the entire country. Several previous studies have measured the extent and rate of urbanization in Saudi Arabian cities, but most of this research used only remote sensing data or a single index to explain urban growth patterns. This study used satellite data and a set of landscape metrics to quantify the spatiotemporal urban growth patterns and processes in three Saudi Arabian cities-Riyadh, Jeddah and Makkah. First, Landsat images were collected and classified for the years 1985, 1990, 2000, 2007, 2014 and 2020. Classification was carried out through an object-based image analysis (OBIA) to map the extent of urbanization. The classified maps were then used to compute seven landscape metrics to determine the spatial configuration of urban areas. The spatial metrics were calculated for the entire landscape and across buffer zones that were delineated from the urban core centre of each city. The overall accuracies were > 94% for all the classified maps. The spatiotemporal results indicated that all three cities have experienced significant urban growth during the last four decades. Urban patterns in Jeddah were more dispersed than in Riyadh, which showed aggregated patterns (especially in recent years), while urban growth in Makkah tended to be more fragmented. The urban form in Riyadh was relatively simple, while a complex form was associated with Makkah and Jeddah. Understanding the rates, patterns, processes and trajectories of changes to urban land use is essential for various decision-making processes.

TI  - R. Bukharaevs poem "Prayer for the Cup" as a transcultural text
T2  - FILOLOGICHESKIE NAUKI-NAUCHNYE DOKLADY VYSSHEI SHKOLY-PHILOLOGICAL SCIENCES-SCIENTIFIC ESSAYS OF HIGHER EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The characteristics of a new type of literary dis- course having a feature of transculturality is given on the material of a poem "Prayer for the Cup" (1989-1991) a significant work by R. Bukharaev. A global, multicultural and international world is reconstructed in the poem, the existence of which is determined by the idea of transitivity - simultane- ity and continuous flow, transitions from one into another: epochs, events, topos, languages. The hero of this world - is a lonely stranger, walking along the road of life, linearly opening the autonomous world of his "I". the history of his spiritual travel correlates with the way of Christ full of suffering. The poem is full of historical and literary allusions and reminiscences from the world literary works, performing an identifying function. It is stated that identification performed by different elements of a literary text is carried out both "on the borders", "in the interval" between different traditions, as well as "within the limits", "inside" a homogeneous culture. Therefore, it is multiple, and meanwhile fundamentally incomplete, "split", "fluid", "inter- mediate", "flickering", probabilistically multiple, constantly questioning its status and revealing the growing plasticity of the subject, who is in the pro- cess of constantly recreating its own "I". A new form of worldview, the product of which is a phenomenon of transcultural literature, is formed by synthesizing tendency. It functions within the artistic world of the poem and overcomes the boundaries between different types of culture and traditions, demon- strating the way new meanings overcome it, tole-rant in their content and functions, can be appear from confrontation. An ability of an artistic image to endless mutual overflowing and transformations of meaning is a new quality of poetic language cor- responding to the peculiarities of the transcultural type of artistic consciousness.

TI  - The Spatiotemporal Implications of Urbanization for Urban Heat Islands in Beijing: A Predictive Approach Based on CA-Markov Modeling (2004-2050)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid increase in infrastructural development in populated areas has had numerous adverse impacts. The rise in land surface temperature (LST) and its associated damage to urban ecological systems result from urban development. Understanding the current and future LST phenomenon and its relationship to landscape composition and land use/cover (LUC) changes is critical to developing policies to mitigate the disastrous impacts of urban heat islands (UHIs) on urban ecosystems. Using remote sensing and GIS data, this study assessed the multi-scale relationship of LUCC and LST of the cosmopolitan exponentially growing area of Beijing, China. We investigated the impacts of LUC on LST in urban agglomeration for a time series (2004-2019) of Landsat data using Classification and Regression Trees (CART) and a single channel algorithm (SCA), respectively. We built a CA-Markov model to forecast future (2025 and 2050) LUCC and LST spatial patterns. Our results indicate that the cumulative changes in an urban area (UA) increased by about 908.15 km(2) (5%), and 11% of vegetation area (VA) decreased from 2004 to 2019. The correlation coefficient of LUCC including vegetation, water bodies, and built-up areas with LST had values of r = -0.155 (p > 0.419), -0.809 (p = 0.000), and 0.526 (p = 0.003), respectively. The results surrounding future forecasts revealed an estimated 2309.55 km(2) (14%) decrease in vegetation (urban and forest), while an expansion of 1194.78 km(2) (8%) was predicted for a built-up area from 2019 to 2050. This decrease in vegetation cover and expansion of settlements would likely cause a rise of about ~5.74 & DEG;C to ~9.66 & DEG;C in temperature. These findings strongly support the hypothesis that LST is directly related to the vegetation index. In conclusion, the estimated overall increase of 7.5 & DEG;C in LST was predicted from 2019-2050, which is alarming for the urban community's environmental health. The present results provide insight into sustainable environmental development through effective urban planning of Beijing and other urban hotspots.

TI  - Classifying Crop Types Using Two Generations of Hyperspectral Sensors (Hyperion and DESIS) with Machine Learning on the Cloud
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Advances in spaceborne hyperspectral (HS) remote sensing, cloud-computing, and machine learning can help measure, model, map and monitor agricultural crops to address global food and water security issues, such as by providing accurate estimates of crop area and yield to model agricultural productivity. Leveraging these advances, we used the Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) Hyperion historical archive and the new generation DLR Earth Sensing Imaging Spectrometer (DESIS) data to evaluate the performance of hyperspectral narrowbands in classifying major agricultural crops of the U.S. with machine learning (ML) on Google Earth Engine (GEE). EO-1 Hyperion images from the 2010-2013 growing seasons and DESIS images from the 2019 growing season were used to classify three world crops (corn, soybean, and winter wheat) along with other crops and non-crops near Ponca City, Oklahoma, USA. The supervised classification algorithms: Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes (NB), and the unsupervised clustering algorithm WekaXMeans (WXM) were run using selected optimal Hyperion and DESIS HS narrowbands (HNBs). RF and SVM returned the highest overall producer's, and user's accuracies, with the performances of NB and WXM being substantially lower. The best accuracies were achieved with two or three images throughout the growing season, especially a combination of an earlier month (June or July) and a later month (August or September). The narrow 2.55 nm bandwidth of DESIS provided numerous spectral features along the 400-1000 nm spectral range relative to smoother Hyperion spectral signatures with 10 nm bandwidth in the 400-2500 nm spectral range. Out of 235 DESIS HNBs, 29 were deemed optimal for agricultural study. Advances in ML and cloud-computing can greatly facilitate HS data analysis, especially as more HS datasets, tools, and algorithms become available on the Cloud.

TI  - Surface Albedo and Temperature Models for Surface Energy Balance Fluxes and Evapotranspiration Using SEBAL and Landsat 8 over Cerrado-Pantanal, Brazil
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The determination of the surface energy balance fluxes (SEBFs) and evapotranspiration (ET) is fundamental in environmental studies involving the effects of land use change on the water requirement of crops. SEBFs and ET have been estimated by remote sensing techniques, but with the operation of new sensors, some variables need to be parameterized to improve their accuracy. Thus, the objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of algorithms used to calculate surface albedo and surface temperature on the estimation of SEBFs and ET in the Cerrado-Pantanal transition region of Mato Grosso, Brazil. Surface reflectance images of the Operational Land Imager (OLI) and brightness temperature (Tb) of the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) of the Landsat 8, and surface reflectance images of the MODIS MOD09A1 product from 2013 to 2016 were combined to estimate SEBF and ET by the surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL), which were validated with measurements from two flux towers. The surface temperature (Ts) was recovered by different models from the Tb and by parameters calculated in the atmospheric correction parameter calculator (ATMCORR). A model of surface albedo (asup) with surface reflectance OLI Landsat 8 developed in this study performed better than the conventional model (acon) SEBFs and ET in the Cerrado-Pantanal transition region estimated with asup combined with Ts and Tb performed better than estimates with acon. Among all the evaluated combinations, SEBAL performed better when combining asup with the model developed in this study and the surface temperature recovered by the Barsi model (Tsbarsi). This demonstrates the importance of an asup model based on surface reflectance and atmospheric surface temperature correction in estimating SEBFs and ET by SEBAL.

M3  - Article
AB  - The geomorphic studies are extremely dependent on the quality and spatial resolution of digital elevation model (DEM) data. The unique terrain characteristics of a particular landscape are derived from DEM, which are responsible for initiation and development of ephemeral gullies. As the topographic features of an area significantly influences on the erosive power of the water flow, it is an important task the extraction of terrain features from DEM to properly research gully erosion. Alongside, topography is highly correlated with other geo-environmental factors i.e. geology, climate, soil types, vegetation density and floristic composition, runoff generation, which ultimately influences on gully occurrences. Therefore, terrain morphometric attributes derived from DEM data are used in spatial prediction of gully erosion susceptibility (GES) mapping. In this study, remote sensing-Geographic information system (GIS) techniques coupled with machine learning (ML) methods has been used for GES mapping in the parts of Semnan province, Iran. Current research focuses on the comparison of predicted GES result by using three types of DEM i.e. Advanced Land Observation satellite (ALOS), ALOS World 3D-30 m (AW3D30) and Advanced Space borne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) in different resolutions. For further progress of our research work, here we have used thirteen suitable geo-environmental gully erosion conditioning factors (GECFs) based on the multi-collinearity analysis. ML methods of conditional inference forests (Cforest), Cubist model and Elastic net model have been chosen for modelling GES accordingly. Variable's importance of GECFs was measured through sensitivity analysis and result show that elevation is the most important factor for occurrences of gullies in the three aforementioned ML methods (Cforest = 21.4, Cubist = 19.65 and Elastic net = 17.08), followed by lithology and slope. Validation of the model's result was performed through area under curve (AUC) and other statistical indices. The validation result of AUC has shown that Cforest is the most appropriate model for predicting the GES assessment in three different DEMs (AUC value of Cforest in ALOS DEM is 0.994, AW3D30 DEM is 0.989 and ASTER DEM is 0.982) used in this study, followed by elastic net and cubist model. The output result of GES maps will be used by decision-makers for sustainable development of degraded land in this study area.

TI  - Comparative Study of Flooding Area Detection with SAR Images based on Thresholding and Difference Images Acquired Before and After the Flooding
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Comparative study of flooding area detection with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images based on thresholding and difference images acquired before and after the flooding is conducted. Method for flooding, landslide and sediment disaster area detections with SAR is proposed. The following two different methods for flooding detection are common. It is not so easy to determine a threshold for the thresholding method while subtraction method between before and after images of a disaster occurrence has the disadvantage that false disaster areas are detected due to a variation of ground cover targets. Therefore, a comparative study between both methods is required. Its application is demonstrated for the disaster which is occurred in Saga Prefecture, Japan due to a long term of heavy rain during from the begging of August to the middle of August in 2021. Through experiments with Sentinel-1 SAR imagery data, it is found that the proposed method works well for the detection of the disaster.

TI  - Evidence of Climate Change Based on Lake Surface Temperature Trends in South Central Chile
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake temperature has proven to act as a good indicator of climate variability and change. Thus, a surface temperature analysis at different temporal scales is important, as this parameter influences the physical, chemical, and biological cycles of lakes. Here, we analyze monthly, seasonal, and annual surface temperature trends in south central Chilean lakes during the 2000-2016 period, using MODIS satellite imagery. To this end, 14 lakes with a surface area greater than 10 km(2) were examined. Results show that 12 of the 14 lakes presented a statistically significant increase in surface temperature, with a rate of 0.10 degrees C/decade (0.01 degrees C/year) over the period. Furthermore, some of the lakes in the study present a significant upward trend in surface temperature, especially in spring, summer, and winter. In general, a significant increase in surface water temperature was found in lakes located at higher altitudes, such as Maule, Laja and Galletue lakes. These results contribute to the provision of useful data on Chilean lakes for managers and policymakers.

TI  - Reproducibility of Pansharpening Methods and Quality Indexes versus Data Formats
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, we investigate whether the performance of pansharpening methods depends on their input data format; in the case of spectral radiance, either in its original floating-point format or in an integer-packed fixed-point format. It is theoretically proven and experimentally demonstrated that methods based on multiresolution analysis are unaffected by the data format. Conversely, the format is crucial for methods based on component substitution, unless the intensity component is calculated by means of a multivariate linear regression between the upsampled bands and the lowpass-filtered Pan. Another concern related to data formats is whether quality measurements, carried out by means of normalized indexes depend on the format of the data on which they are calculated. We will focus on some of the most widely used with-reference indexes to provide a novel insight into their behaviors. Both theoretical analyses and computer simulations, carried out on GeoEye-1 and WorldView-2 datasets with the products of nine pansharpening methods, show that their performance does not depend on the data format for purely radiometric indexes, while it significantly depends on the data format, either floating-point or fixed-point, for a purely spectral index, like the spectral angle mapper. The dependence on the data format is weak for indexes that balance the spectral and radiometric similarity, like the family of indexes, Q2(n), based on hypercomplex algebra.

TI  - Assessment of Land Cover Dynamics and Drivers of Urban Expansion Using Geospatial and Logistic Regression Approach in Wa Municipality, Ghana
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The current trends of land use dynamics have revealed a significant transformation of settlement spaces. In the Wa Municipality of Ghana, the changes in land use and land cover are inspired by a plethora of driving forces. In this study, we assessed the geo-physical drivers of settlement expansion under land use dynamics in the Wa Municipality of Ghana. The study employed geospatial and remote sensing tools to map and analyse the spatio-temporal dynamics of the landscape, using Landsat satellite imageries: thematic mapper (TM), enhanced thematic mapper (ETM) and operational land imager (OLI) from 1990 to 2020. The study employed a binomial logistic regression model to statistically assess the geo-physical drivers of settlement expansion. Random forest (RF)-supervised classification based on spatio-temporal analyses generated relatively higher classification accuracies, with overall accuracy ranging from 89.33% to 93.3%. Urban expansion for the last three decades was prominent, as the period from 1990 to 2001 gained 11.44 km(2) landmass of settlement, while there was 11.30 km(2) gained from 2001 to 2010, and 29.44 km(2) gained from 2010 to 2020. Out of the independent variables assessed, the distance to existing settlements, distance to river, and distance to primary, tertiary and unclassified roads were responsible for urban expansion.

TI  - Review of near-shore satellite derived bathymetry: Classification and account of five decades of coastal bathymetry research
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEAN ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - The number of civilian, commercial and military applications are dependant on accurate knowledge of bathymetry of coastal regions. Conventionally, hydrographic surveying methods are used for bathymetric surveys carried by ship-based acoustic systems, but needs high cost resources. Space technology has provided a cost-effective alternate means for charting near shore and inaccessible waters. The optical satellite data have capabilities to offer alternate solution in near-shore region, which has been researched for past 50 years, using evolving algorithms to estimate Satellite Derived Bathymetry (SDB). However, there is no agreement on use of terms like approach, model, method and techniques, which have been used varyingly and interchangeably as per context of SDB research. This paper suggests a classification scheme for SDB algorithms which is also applicable to other Marine Remote Sensing studies. In this paper, based on literature available on SDB for the past five decades, an insight on SDB classification has been offered grounded in research philosophy. The SDB approaches, models, methods and techniques have been elaborated with chronological development, along with SDB studies based on them, their accuracy and errors in SDB retrieval. We have suggested a matrix of prerequisite satellite data, in-situ data resolution, methods and algorithms of SDB based on level of accuracy needs to be achieved, which will guide future researchers to select one as per their context of research.

TI  - Is green space exposure beneficial in a developing country?
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous studies have confirmed the beneficial effects of green space exposure on depressive disorders, but the majority of them were conducted in developed countries. Given the difference in utilization of green spaces in countries with agriculturally heavy economies such as Indonesia, the effects of green space remain unknown. This study aimed to investigate the association between green space exposure and depressive disorders, focusing on Indonesia. Depressive disorders data provided by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation was used. Exposure to the green space was based on the normalized difference vegetation index (MODIS-NDVI) and green land-cover data provided by the Geospatial Information Agency of Indonesia. A generalized additive mixed model was conducted, followed by a sensitivity test and positive-negative control analysis, to evaluate the as-sociation. Stratified analysis was employed to assess the effects of green space on depressive disorders in areas with different levels of urbanization. Exposure to green space significantly reduced the risk of depressive dis-orders by up to 5% per interquartile unit increment of NDVI. Moreover, there was a 12.4% reduced risk of depressive disorders coinciding with an 8.4% increase in the proportion of forest and total vegetation. In high-urbanization areas, the results of sensitivity analysis illustrated that green spaces reduced the risk of depressive disorders by 10%. Exposure to green spaces was confirmed to be associated with a reduced risk of depressive disorders in Indonesia. Findings of this ecological study could serve as references for urban planning, considering the health benefits of green spaces in developing countries.

TI  - Summer Statistical Models of Cloud Parameters over Western Siberia According to MODIS Data
T2  - RUSSIAN METEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Summer statistical models of textural features and physical parameters for various cloud types over the northern and southern parts of Western Siberia are proposed. The MODIS satellite data obtained over the study region in June, July, and August from 2010 to 2019 are considered. The model was constructed by determining the distribution laws that describe fluctuations in the values of various cloud parameters based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The summer cloud classification, that includes 14 cloud types, is presented. A feature of constructing a statistical model of optical thickness for powerful towering vertical clouds is considered. Estimates of the mean and relative standard deviation are given for some parameters and all considered cloud types in the northern and southern parts of Western Siberia. The results of forming statistical models both for individual cloud levels and for all varieties in general are discussed. Promising areas of developing the present study are given.

TI  - Deriving Large-Scale Coastal Bathymetry from Sentinel-2 Images Using an HIGH-Performance Cluster: A Case Study Covering North Africa's Coastal Zone
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coasts are areas of vitality because they host numerous activities worldwide. Despite their major importance, the knowledge of the main characteristics of the majority of coastal areas (e.g., coastal bathymetry) is still very limited. This is mainly due to the scarcity and lack of accurate measurements or observations, and the sparsity of coastal waters. Moreover, the high cost of performing observations with conventional methods does not allow expansion of the monitoring chain in different coastal areas. In this study, we suggest that the advent of remote sensing data (e.g., Sentinel 2A/B) and high performance computing could open a new perspective to overcome the lack of coastal observations. Indeed, previous research has shown that it is possible to derive large-scale coastal bathymetry from S-2 images. The large S-2 coverage, however, leads to a high computational cost when post-processing the images. Thus, we develop a methodology implemented on a High-Performance cluster (HPC) to derive the bathymetry from S-2 over the globe. In this paper, we describe the conceptualization and implementation of this methodology. Moreover, we will give a general overview of the generated bathymetry map for NA compared with the reference GEBCO global bathymetric product. Finally, we will highlight some hotspots by looking closely to their outputs.

TI  - Living According to Conscience
T2  - POLITICKA MISAO-CROATIAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - We discuss the proposal of Chandran Kukathas engaged in one of the goals of liberal theories: the protection of freedom of conscience. Kukathas proposes the metaphor of a liberal archipelago where different communities are sovereign in enforcing their worldview on their territory. We share Kukathas's intention to strongly protect freedom of conscience, but we think that Kukathas's theory fails to adequately protect it. In Kukathas's view, freedom of conscience is protected through freedom of association and the related freedom to exit an association. But freedom of exit, intended only as a right not to be coerced when one wants to leave, is insufficient. It must be sustained by the provision of capabilities to leave that one can exercise, as well as by capabilities to evaluate her condition. We discuss, then, a more promising proposal of an egalitarian libertarian archipelago proposed by Michael Otsuka. After explaining why this system isn't sufficiently stable, we conclude that the constitutional egalitarian liberal state is a better candidate.

TI  - Analysis-Ready Data from Hyperspectral Sensors-The Design of the EnMAP CARD4L-SR Data Product
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Today, the ground segments of the Landsat and Sentinel missions provide a wealth of well-calibrated, characterized datasets which are already orthorectified and corrected for atmospheric effects. Initiatives such as the CEOS Analysis Ready Data (ARD) propose and ensure guidelines and requirements so that such datasets can readily be used, and interoperability within and between missions is a given. With the increasing availability of data from operational and research-oriented spaceborne hyperspectral sensors such as EnMAP, DESIS and PRISMA, and in preparation for the upcoming global mapping missions CHIME and SBG, the provision of analysis ready hyperspectral data will also be of increasing interest. Within this article, the design of the EnMAP Level 2A Land product is illustrated, highlighting the necessary processing steps for CEOS Analysis Ready Data for Land (CARD4L) compliant data products. This includes an overview of the design of the metadata, quality layers and archiving workflows, the necessary processing chain (system correction, orthorectification and atmospheric correction), as well as the resulting challenges of this procedure. Thanks to this operational approach, the end user will be provided with ARD products including rich metadata and quality information, which can readily be integrated in analysis workflows, and combined with data from other sensors.

TI  - Can Conization Specimens Predict Sentinel Lymph Node Status in Early-Stage Cervical Cancer? A SENTICOL Group Study
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple SummaryLymph node involvement is one of the major prognosis factors for early-stage cervical cancer. Improvement in preoperative identification of node-positive patients may lead to a more accurate triage to primary chemoradiation for these patients instead of radical surgery followed by adjuvant radiotherapy, given the increased morbidity of combined treatment. Several studies have well established risk factors for node involvement, but they are based on final pathologic examination of radical hysterectomy specimens and are usually extrapolated for preoperative risk assessment. Among these risk factors, tumor size, lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) and depth of stromal invasion might be assessed in conization specimens. Our findings suggest that patients with depth of stromal invasion lower than 10 mm and no LVSI in conization specimens had lower risk of micro- and macrometastatic SLN. In this subpopulation, full node dissection may be questionable in case of SLN unilateral detection.Background: The prognosis of patients with cervical cancer is significantly worsened in case of lymph node involvement. The goal of this study was to determine whether pathologic features in conization specimens can predict the sentinel lymph node (SLN) status in early-stage cervical cancer. Methods: An ancillary analysis of two prospective multicentric database on SLN biopsy for cervical cancer (SENTICOL I and II) was carried out. Patients with IA to IB2 2018 FIGO stage, who underwent preoperative conization before SLN biopsy were included. Results: Between January 2005 and July 2012, 161 patients from 25 French centers fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Macrometastases, micrometastases and Isolated tumor cells (ITCs) were found in 4 (2.5%), 6 (3.7%) and 5 (3.1%) patients respectively. Compared to negative SLN patients, patients with micrometastatic and macrometastatic SLN were more likely to have lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) (60% vs. 29.5%, p = 0.04) and deep stromal invasion (DSI) & GE; 10 mm (50% vs. 17.8%, p = 0.04). Among the 93 patients with DSI < 10 mm and absence of LVSI on conization specimens, three patients (3.2%) had ITCs and only one (1.1%) had micrometastases. Conclusions: Patients with DSI < 10 mm and no LVSI in conization specimens had lower risk of micro- and macrometastatic SLN. In this subpopulation, full node dissection may be questionable in case of SLN unilateral detection.

T2  - HEMATOLOGY TRANSFUSION AND CELL THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Low levels of neutrophils can be an intrinsic condition, with no clinical consequences or immunity impairment. This condition is the benign constitutional neutropenia (BCN), defined as an absolute neutrophils count (ANC) <= 2000 cells/mm. Diagnosis of BCN is of exclusion where patients are submitted to blood tests and possibly to invasive diagnostic search until secondary causes of neutropenia are ruled out. The natural history of the disease suggests benign evolution and Brazilian study showed an overall frequency of 2.59%. The main mechanisms include reduced neutrophil production, increased marginalization, extravasation to the tissues and immune destruction. Genetic studies showed strong association between the single nucleotide variant rs2814778 located on chromosome 1q23.2 in the promoter region of the atypical chemokine receptor 1 (Duffy blood group system) gene (ACKR1, also termed DARC) and BCN. The aim of this study is to evaluate FY phenotypes and genotypes including the analysis of the rs2814778 SNP in Brazilian patients with BCN in order to determine an effective diagnostic tool, allowing reassurance of the patient and cost reduction in their care.Methods: Case control study, with 94 individuals (18 patients and 76 controls). Phenotyping was performed by gel test and genotyping was performed by PCR-RFLP.Results: White blood cell (WBC) and absolute neutrophils (AN) counts showed lower levels in patients compared to controls. In the patient group 83.3% were genotyped as FY*B/FY*B. The SNP rs2814778 (-67T > C) was identified in 77.8% of the patients genotyped as FY*B67C/FY*B-67C. In the control group, 72.7% were homozygous for the wild type and 23.3% were heterozygous.Conclusion: This study reinforces that FY phenotyping and genotyping can be used to detect most people with BCN, avoiding excessive diagnostic investigation. Besides, this procedure may reduce health costs and be reproductible in clinical practice.

TI  - Expanding infrastructure and growing anthropogenic impacts along Arctic coasts
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The accelerating climatic changes and new infrastructure development across the Arctic require more robust risk and environmental assessment, but thus far there is no consistent record of human impact. We provide a first panarctic satellite-based record of expanding infrastructure and anthropogenic impacts along all permafrost affected coasts (100 km buffer, approximate to 6.2 Mio km(2)), named the Sentinel-1/2 derived Arctic Coastal Human Impact (SACHI) dataset. The completeness and thematic content goes beyond traditional satellite based approaches as well as other publicly accessible data sources. Three classes are considered: linear transport infrastructure (roads and railways), buildings, and other impacted area. C-band synthetic aperture radar and multi-spectral information (2016-2020) is exploited within a machine learning framework (gradient boosting machines and deep learning) and combined for retrieval with 10 m nominal resolution. In total, an area of 1243 km(2) constitutes human-built infrastructure as of 2016-2020. Depending on region, SACHI contains 8%-48% more information (human presence) than in OpenStreetMap. 221 (78%) more settlements are identified than in a recently published dataset for this region. 47% is not covered in a global night-time light dataset from 2016. At least 15% (180 km(2)) correspond to new or increased detectable human impact since 2000 according to a Landsat-based normalized difference vegetation index trend comparison within the analysis extent. Most of the expanded presence occurred in Russia, but also some in Canada and US. 31% and 5% of impacted area associated predominantly with oil/gas and mining industry respectively has appeared after 2000. 55% of the identified human impacted area will be shifting to above 0 C-circle ground temperature at two meter depth by 2050 if current permafrost warming trends continue at the pace of the last two decades, highlighting the critical importance to better understand how much and where Arctic infrastructure may become threatened by permafrost thaw.

TI  - Sensitivity of Landsat NDVI to subpixel vegetation and topographic components in glacier forefields: assessment from high-resolution multispectral UAV imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, deglaciated landscapes are ideal natural arenas to investigate ecological succession processes. However, ground data acquisition remains complicated as glacier forefields are often difficult to access and fieldwork possibilities remain limited. Remote sensing offers an opportunity to bypass this issue and increase spatial and temporal coverage of ecological parameters. The Landsat satellites (5 to 8) provide reflectance data for the past 40 years, which align with recent phenomena of glacier retreat and related ecological and geomorphological dynamics in glacier forefields. Difficulties remain as information retrieved from 30-m Landsat pixels are the result of a mixture of objects influencing reflectance signals. Here, we used a submeter multispectral unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) image of the Glacier noir foreland, France, to assess the sensitivity of Landsat normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to subpixel vegetation and topographic components. We found a twofold linear relationship (a = 0.456) and high sensitivity between fractional vegetation cover (FVC) and Landsat NDVI with detection of low vegetation changes (FVC > 5%) at low NDVI values (<0.1) (F-score = 0.75). We also showed that vegetation height and subpixel topographic heterogeneity leads to misestimation of vegetation cover as quantified by Landsat NDVI. Overall, our comparative analysis using very-high resolution UAV imagery provides support for the use of widely available Landsat imagery for investigating vegetation dynamics in glacier forefields.

TI  - Multitemporal and Multisensor InSAR Analysis for Ground Displacement Field Assessment at Ischia Volcanic Island (Italy)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Volcanic islands are often affected by ground displacement such as slope instability, due to their peculiar morphology. This is the case of Ischia Island (Naples, Italy) dominated by the Mt. Epomeo (787 m a.s.l.), a volcano-tectonic horst located in the central portion of the island. This study aims to follow a long temporal evolution of ground deformations on the island through the interferometric analysis of satellite SAR data. Different datasets, acquired during Envisat, COSMO-SkyMed and Sentinel-1 satellite missions, are for the first time processed in order to obtain the island ground deformations during a time interval spanning 17 years, from November 2002 to December 2019. In detail, the multitemporal differential interferometry technique, named small baseline subset, is applied to produce the ground displacement maps and the associated displacement time series. The results, validated through the analysis and the comparison with a set of GPS measurements, show that the northwestern side of Mt. Epomeo is the sector of the island characterized by the highest subsidence movements (maximum vertical displacement of 218 mm) with velocities ranging from 10 to 20 mm/yr. Finally, the displacement time series allow us to correlate the measured ground deformations with the seismic swarm started with the Mw 3.9 earthquake that occurred on 21 August 2017. Such correlations highlight an acceleration of the ground, following the mainshock, characterized by a subsidence displacement rate of 0.12 mm/day that returned to pre-earthquake levels (0.03 mm/day) after 6 months from the event.

TI  - Impacts of land use/land cover and climate changes on soil erosion in Muga watershed, Upper Blue Nile basin (Abay), Ethiopia
T2  - ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Soil erosion is one of the major threats in the Ethiopian highlands. In this study, soil erosion in the Muga watershed of the Upper Blue Nile Basin (Abay) under historical and future climate and land use/land cover (LULC) change was assessed. Future LULC was predicted based on LULC map of 1985, 2002, and 2017. LULC maps of the historical periods were delineated from Landsat images, and future LULC was predicted using the CA-Markov chain model. Precipitation for the future period was projected from six regional circulation models. The RUSLE model was used to estimate the current and future soil erosion rate in Muga watershed. Results The average annual rate of soil erosion in the study area was increased from about 15 t ha(-1) year(-1) in 1985 to 19 t ha(-1) year(-1) in 2002, and 19.7 t ha(-1) year(-1) in 2017. Expansion of crop cultivation and loss of vegetation caused an increase in soil erosion. Unless proper measure is taken against the LULC changes, the rate of soil loss is expected to increase and reach about 20.7 t ha(-1) year(-1) in 2033. In the 2050s, soil loss is projected to increase by 9.6% and 11.3% under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively, compared with the baseline period. Thus, the soil loss rate is expected to increase under both scenarios due to the higher erosive power of the future intense rainfall. When both LULC and climate changes act together, the mean annual soil loss rate shows a rise of 13.2% and 15.7% in the future under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively, which is due to synergistic effects. Conclusions The results of this study can be useful for formulating proper land use planning and investments to mitigate the adverse effect of LULC on soil loss. Furthermore, climate change will exacerbate the existing soil erosion problem and would need for vigorous proper conservation policies and investments to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change on soil loss.

TI  - Spiritual Care as the Foundation for a Child's Religious Education
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article outlines spiritual care as the foundation for a child's religious education. The elements of spiritual care are described by identifying how God concepts form in the young, by naming children's inherent spiritual needs, by offering perspectives from human spirituality research over the last 60 years, particularly as it applies to children, by analyzing the way meaning forms through experience as it finds its way into worldviews each of us holds by early adolescence, and finally, by depicting four types of literacy (cognitive, emotional, imaginative and social) at the basis of spiritual care and as the groundwork for a child's future development within various religious traditions. The purpose of spiritual care is to focus on the humanity of children and to situate their education within a framework built on their spiritual needs. This article is deeply embedded in assumptions associated with the Christian tradition. However, a fundamental assumption of spirituality research is that every person is spiritual. As a result, the intention to educate the human spirit as a first step to initiating children into a faith tradition is well founded; it also raises the possibility of spiritual care as undergirding secular education, but that question is beyond this article's purview. The intention is to spark a conversation among religious traditions as one way to meet the deepest spiritual needs of children, which is an urgent dialogue to engage in at present. If French philosopher Jean Baudrillard was correct, the age we are living in is well described as a revolution of confusion. A response to confusion requires [meeting] the spiritual needs of children and creating a broad theoretical and practical approach to how they think and act, as they move into a tradition that they take on board, along with their developed capacity to reflect on that tradition from personal and socially informed perspectives.

TI  - SYSTEM FOR DECISION-MAKING IN THE APPLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF INTERCULTURALITY THROUGH A HIERARCHICAL ANALYTICAL PROCESS AND ITS APPLICATION TO EDUCATION
T2  - REVISTA CONRADO
M3  - Article
AB  - Indigenous communities have rules for the application of sanctions to members of their community in case of violation of the general rules of coexistence. Having an intercultural legal system leads to the resolution of conflicts within their own worldview, whose sanctions have a social purpose and the effective reparation to the victims. However, jurisprudence has been established from the resolution of the Constitutional Court that determines that any case that attempts against the lives of people whose actors belong to any indigenous community, the competence to know, resolve and sanction is exclusive and excluding faculty of the Ordinary Criminal Law System. On the other hand, intercultural education is the proposal of an inclusive education that promotes knowledge and cultural exchange as a positive valuation of cultural diversity in terms of coexistence, curricular innovation and promotion of intercultural education. The present research aims to develop a method for the evaluation and decision in the application of the principle of interculturality through the Analytical Hierarchical Process. The proposal is implemented in the province of Pastaza from which is achieved as a result the decision making for the appropriate sanction with the application of the principle of interculturality in justice and education.

TI  - Assessing Non-Photosynthetic Cropland Biomass from Spaceborne Hyperspectral Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) biomass has been identified as a priority variable for upcoming spaceborne imaging spectroscopy missions, calling for a quantitative estimation of lignocellulosic plant material as opposed to the sole indication of surface coverage. Therefore, we propose a hybrid model for the retrieval of non-photosynthetic cropland biomass. The workflow included coupling the leaf optical model PROSPECT-PRO with the canopy reflectance model 4SAIL, which allowed us to simulate NPV biomass from carbon-based constituents (CBC) and leaf area index (LAI). PROSAIL-PRO provided a training database for a Gaussian process regression (GPR) algorithm, simulating a wide range of non-photosynthetic vegetation states. Active learning was employed to reduce and optimize the training data set. In addition, we applied spectral dimensionality reduction to condense essential information of non-photosynthetic signals. The resulting NPV-GPR model was successfully validated against soybean field data with normalized root mean square error (nRMSE) of 13.4% and a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.85. To demonstrate mapping capability, the NPV-GPR model was tested on a PRISMA hyperspectral image acquired over agricultural areas in the North of Munich, Germany. Reliable estimates were mainly achieved over senescent vegetation areas as suggested by model uncertainties. The proposed workflow is the first step towards the quantification of non-photosynthetic cropland biomass as a next-generation product from near-term operational missions, such as CHIME.

TI  - Analysis of deforestation multispectral satellite data using remote sensing techniques
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEXT-GENERATION COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - The coverage of global forest cover is most essential for soil health, climate, water cycle and air quality. The condition can be improved by reforestation and afforestation to some extent but cannot be restored to full range. The satellite images used for this analysis of forest change detection are of planet scope having 3 m resolution. The target of this research is to detect the forest cover change using remote sensing and GIS. For the identification of forest covers various techniques like segmentation and classification are used. The best classification is by Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) which identifies the health of vegetation along with the changes in the different parameters. After using NDVI some values generated will detect the areas of forest changes with the amount of change. And with the help of this research it is observed that out of total forest area i.e. 76740.32 hectares, the negative forest change is reduced to 29.44% due to degradation of forests maybe due to fires, deforestation, leaf shedding etc.

TI  - Nineteen Years of Trophic State Variation in Large Lakes of the Yangtze River Delta Region Derived from MODIS Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Yangtze River Delta (YRD) is one of the regions with the most intensive human activities. The eutrophication of lakes in this area is becoming increasingly serious with consequent negative impacts on the water supply of the surrounding cities. But the spatial-temporal characteristics and driving factors of the trophic state of the lake in this region are still not clearly addressed. In this study, a semi-analytical algorithm for estimating the trophic index (TSI) using particle absorption at 645 nm based on MODIS images is proposed to monitor and evaluate the trophic state of 41 large lakes (larger than 10 km(2)) in the YRD from 2002 to 2020. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated using an independent dataset. Results showed that the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the algorithm is less than 6 and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) does not exceed 8%, indicating that it can be applied for remotely deriving the TSI in the YRD. The spatial-temporal patterns revealed that there were significantly more lakes with moderate eutrophication in the Lower Yangtze River (LYR) than in the Lower Huaihe River (LHR). The overall average value of the TSI reaches a maximum in summer and a minimum in winter. The TSI value in the YRD over the period 2002-2020 showed a downward trend, especially after 2013. Individually, 33 lakes showed a downward trend and 8 lakes showed an upward trend. Furthermore, marked seasonal and interannual temporal variations can be clearly observed in the LYR and LHR and the sum of the variance contributions of seasonal and interannual components is more than 50%. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that human activities can explain 65% of the variation in the lake TSI in the YRD.

TI  - Sea Surface Salinity Subfootprint Variability from a Global High-Resolution Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Subfootprint variability (SFV) is variability at a spatial scale smaller than the footprint of a satellite, and it cannot be resolved by satellite observations. It is important to quantify and understand, as it contributes to the error budget for satellite data. The purpose of this study was to estimate the SFV for sea surface salinity (SSS) satellite observations. This was performed by using a high-resolution numerical model, a 1/48 & DEG; version of the MITgcm simulation, from which one year of output has recently become available. SFV, defined as the weighted standard deviation of SSS within the satellite footprint, was computed from the model for a 2 & DEG; x 2 & DEG; grid of points for the one model year. We present maps of median SFV for 40 and 100 km footprint size, display histograms of its distribution for a range of footprint sizes and quantify its seasonality. At a 100 km (40 km) footprint size, SFV has a mode of 0.06 (0.04). It is found to vary strongly by location and season. It has larger values in western-boundary and eastern-equatorial regions, as well as in a few other areas. SFV has strong variability throughout the year, with the largest values generally being in the fall season. We also quantified the representation error, the degree of mismatch between random samples within a footprint and the footprint average. Our estimates of SFV and representation error can be used in understanding errors in the satellite observation of SSS.

TI  - Organizational liability: new frontier of medical malpractice? Seventeen-year experience as a medico-legal observer
T2  - GAZZETTA MEDICA ITALIANA ARCHIVIO PER LE SCIENZE MEDICHE
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: The study of claims for medical malpractice can be a useful tool to understand Clinical Risk. Indeed, the identification of the events that cause or foresee damage to the patient allows the proposal of new strategies to prevent the recurrence of the same event. This ensures better medical case security and health maintenance of individuals and overall society. In particular, this study focuses on the cases regarding secondary errors due to organizational deficit in order to understand the origins of such organizational deficit and to start specific prevention measures.METHODS: The claims for medical damage were analyzed in the period between 1st January 2003 and 31st December 2019 and divided in specific sub-categories.RESULTS: The claims due to deficiencies in organizational responsibility covers 10% of the total cases. The distribution according to the macro-areas shows that the surgical field is the most represented area (68%). The classification of these deficiencies shows the preponderance of "sentinel events" (30%) compared to "diagnostic/therapeutic delay" (27%) and "infections" (23%).CONCLUSIONS: From the present research, it was possible to identify the main cause of errors and propose specific risk mitigating measures to prevent such errors due to system deficiencies.

TI  - Developing a Baseline Characterization of River Bathymetry and Time-Varying Height for Chindwin River in Myanmar Using SRTM and Landsat Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a method was developed for the baseline characterization of river bathymetry and time-varying heights using globally available datasets from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) elevation data and Landsat visible imagery. Using independent data on river water elevations from satellite altimetry, the SRTM-Landsat approach was verified as to how well it can work for baseline characterization. The technique was demonstrated for Chindwin River locations in Myanmar that were also independently sampled by Sentinel 3A and Jason 3 altimeters. The Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) was used for estimating the water areas and widths using Landsat 8 from 2016 to 2019. A comparison of SRTM-Landsat with Sentinel 3A/Jason 3-based elevation changes resulted in a correlation coefficient up to 0.89 and 0.82 using area-elevation and width-elevation curves, respectively. The presence of river islands during the dry season resulted in a weaker correlation between our proposed SRTM-Landsat technique and altimeter water elevations. This case study over the Chindwin River in Myanmar demonstrated that the use of the SRTM-Landsat combined technique could yield an acceptable baseline for characterization of river bathymetry and time-varying heights at ungauged locations around the world.

TI  - Analysis of the wetland classification using optical satellite imagery in the environmental protection area of Guaraquecaba, PR, Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Located at an interface between water and land, wetlands are complex ecosystems, which are important for the maintenance of biodiversity. The objective of this work was to evaluate five different optical satellite imagery with different spatial resolution (original: RapidEye - 5 m; Sentinel-2B - 10 m; Landsat 8-30 m; resampled: RapidEye - 30 m; Sentinel-2B - 30 m) in order to obtain the classification of Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) types of a coastal ecosystem, including its wetlands, in the Environmental Protection Area of Guaraquecaba, PR, Brazil. For this, a supervised classification was made using the algorithm of maximum likelihood to obtain the LULC of each satellite image, using a mosaic of high-resolution spatial imagery from DigitalGlobe as ground-truth verification. A SRTM relief image was used to check wetlands classification against their location in flat and low altitude areas. Analyzing the spatial resolutions of the studied imagery, no significant differences were observed between RapidEye and Sentinel-2B imagery in obtaining the wetland areas, differently of the Landsat 8 image, which showed a classification accuracy a little lower than the others, which may be related to its lower spatial resolution. Using multivariate statistics, three groups were formed with two of them very close to each other (RapidEye and Sentinel-2B), corroborating the conclusion obtained by the kappa index and the overall accuracy. Analyzing the slope and altitude classes, all imagery classified wetlands into flat and low-altitude regions. It is recommended that the Sentinel-2B imagery are used by governments and research agencies for wetland-related policies and research, since this image is distributed free of charge and has a temporal resolution of only 5 days, against payed access of RapidEye.

TI  - SAT-Hadoop-Processor: A Distributed Remote Sensing Big Data Processing Software for Earth Observation Applications
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, several environmental applications take advantage of remote sensing techniques. A considerable volume of this remote sensing data occurs in near real-time. Such data are diverse and are provided with high velocity and variety, their pre-processing requires large computing capacities, and a fast execution time is critical. This paper proposes a new distributed software for remote sensing data pre-processing and ingestion using cloud computing technology, specifically OpenStack. The developed software discarded 86% of the unneeded daily files and removed around 20% of the erroneous and inaccurate datasets. The parallel processing optimized the total execution time by 90%. Finally, the software efficiently processed and integrated data into the Hadoop storage system, notably the HDFS, HBase, and Hive.

TI  - Improving Remote Sensing Multiple Classification by Data and Ensemble Selection
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, margin theory is exploited to design better ensemble classifiers for remote sensing data. A semi-supervised version of the ensemble margin is at the core of this work. Some major challenges in ensemble learning are investigated using this paradigm in the difficult context of land cover classification: selecting the most informative instances to form an appropriate training set, and selecting the best ensemble members. The main contribution of this work lies in the explicit use of the ensemble margin as a decision method to select training data and base classifiers in an ensemble learning framework. The selection of training data is achieved through an innovative iterative guided bagging algorithm exploiting low-margin instances. The overall classification accuracy is improved by up to 3%, with more dramatic improvement in per-class accuracy (up to 12%). The selection of ensemble base classifiers is achieved by an ordering-based ensemble-selection algorithm relying on an original margin-based criterion that also targets low-margin instances. This method reduces the complexity (ensemble size under 30) but maintains performance.

TI  - Satellite-Based Sea Surface Salinity Designed for Ocean and Climate Studies
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) is an increasingly used Essential Ocean and Climate Variable. The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), Aquarius, and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite missions all provide SSS measurements, with very different instrumental features leading to specific measurement characteristics. The Climate Change Initiative Salinity project (CCI + SSS) aims to produce a SSS Climate Data Record (CDR) that addresses well-established user needs based on those satellite measurements. To generate a homogeneous CDR, instrumental differences are carefully adjusted based on in-depth analysis of the measurements themselves, together with some limited use of independent reference data. An optimal interpolation in the time domain without temporal relaxation to reference data or spatial smoothing is applied. This allows preserving the original datasets variability. SSS CCI fields are well suited for monitoring weekly to interannual signals, at spatial scales ranging from 50 km to the basin scale. They display large year-to-year seasonal variations over the 2010-2019 decade, sometimes by more than +/- 0.4 over large regions. The robust standard deviation of the monthly CCI SSS minus in situ Argo salinities is 0.15 globally, while it is at least 0.20 with individual satellite SSS fields. r(2) is 0.97, similar or better than with original datasets. The correlation with independent ship thermosalinographs SSS further highlights the CCI data set excellent performance, especially near land areas. During the SMOS-Aquarius period, when the representativity uncertainties are the largest, r(2) is 0.84 with CCI while it is 0.48 with the Aquarius original data set. SSS CCI data are freely available and will be updated and extended as more satellite data become available.

TI  - Landsat 8 Data as a Source of High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature Maps in the Baltic Sea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea surface temperature (SST) is a key hydrological variable which can be monitored via satellite. One source of thermal data with a spatial resolution high enough to study sub-mesoscale processes in coastal waters may be the Landsat mission. The Thermal Infrared Sensor on board Landsat 8 collects data in two bands, which allows for the use of the well-known nonlinear split-window formula to estimate SST (NLSST) using top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) brightness temperature. To calibrate its coefficients a significant number of matchup points are required, representing a wide range of atmospheric conditions. In this study over 1200 granules of satellite data and 12 time series of in situ measurements from buoys and platforms operating in the Baltic Sea over a period of more than 6 years were used to select matchup points, derive NLSST coefficients and evaluate the results. To filter out pixels contaminated by clouds, ice or land influences, the IdePix algorithm was used with Quality Assessment Band and additional test of the adjacent pixels. Various combinations of flags were tested. The results show that the NLSST coefficients derived previously for coastal areas, characterised by a more humid atmosphere, might overestimate low SST values. Formulas derived for the Baltic Sea produced biases close to 0 & DEG;C and RMSEs in the range of 0.49-0.52 & DEG;C.

TI  - Investigating El Nino Southern Oscillation as the main driver of forest fire in Kalimantan
T2  - GEOGRAFIA-MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF SOCIETY & SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Strong El Nino events have been identified as major factors contributing to the forest fire in Indonesia. This is due to El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability has a distinct connection with tropical precipitation, mainly in Indonesia. El Nino years are typically drier, while La Nina events generally increase precipitation in Indonesia. Although very strong El Nino events have been connected with massive forest fires, fire continue to occur during the other phases of ENSO: La Nina and normal. Here, the research reports a time series of monthly counted fires in Kalimantan between the period 2001-2020 from MODIS fire hotspot and MODIS Burned Area products. The region is divided into three categories, Primary Intact Forest, Primary Degraded Forest and Outside Forest/ Deforested area. This categorization validates the location of the fire. Our results show that in general wildfires in Kalimantan follow a similar temporal pattern with Oceanic Nino Index (ONI), with several anomalies. If ONI is high, wildfires are more intense and vice versa. The wildfire appears almost every month and increases drastically in June-October of El Nino years. However, the proportion of wildfires in Primary Intact Forest are tiny and insignificant. The primary intact forest fire only appears in July-October and have a different pattern with wildfires in general. In conclusion, wildfires are highly correlated with El Nino but limited in primary intact forests. The fires dominantly appear in the deforested area, about 80%. The rest 20% are in degraded forest and only less than 1% in primary intact forest.

TI  - Simbu Viruses' Infection of Livestock in Israel-A Transient Climatic Land
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
M3  - Review
AB  - Important lessons have been learned by the Israeli veterinary community regarding Simbu serogroup viruses infections. This serogroup of viruses might cause the births of neonatal malformation in susceptible ruminant's populations. Until 2012, only Akabane virus was connected with the births of malformed ruminants in Israel. However, serological and genomic detection tests, coupled with viral isolations, revealed that more than a single Simbu serogroup serotype could be present concurrently in the same farm or even in the same animal. From 2012 to date, Aino, Shuni, Shamunda, Satuperi, Peaton, Schmallenberg, and Sango viruses have been found in Israel either by serological or genomic investigation. Israel is located in the Eastern Mediterranean Basin, a terrestrial and climatic bridge between the three old continents. The Eastern Mediterranean shores benefit from both the tropical/subtropical and the continental climatic conditions. Therefore, the Eastern Mediterranean basin might serve as an optimal investigatory compound for several arboviral diseases, acting as a sentinel. This review summarizes updated information related to the presence of Simbu serogroup viruses in Israel.

T2  - SANTE PUBLIQUE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: This research examines the dialectical relationships between the precautionary principle, the logic of prevention and prudential dynamics, based on accounts of the experiences of academics in nearly fifteen countries around the world.Aim of the study: The study examines the contradictory relationships generated by the perceptions of risk and urgency between the injunctions to act in accordance with the rules prescribed by the health authorities and the dynamics of self-training allowing the singular and prudent integration of rules for the maintenance of individual and collective life in a pandemic situation.Results: Two levels of results are characterized: concerning the method, the survey system potentially constitutes a monitoring system enabling the production of "flash surveys" giving access to the state of the epidemic situation from local relays in different countries around the world. With regard to the relationship to knowledge, the results also tend to underline the importance of in-depth educational work to develop a "culture of prudential action" in a pandemic situation.Conclusion: The narrative survey implemented in the form of a "flash survey" could be duplicated in 2021 and be perpetuated in the form of a "sentinel watch" system, by questioning the concepts and actions at work in the various countries, particularly with a view to developing educational strategies to raise awareness of ecological risks and to develop knowledge of action bringing together the scales of the socialized individual and the world, through the articulation of prevention, education and ethical aims in public health

TI  - Remotely Sensed Land Surface Temperature Can Be Used to Estimate Ecosystem Respiration in Intact and Disturbed Northern Peatlands
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST) enables global modeling and monitoring of CO2 fluxes from peatlands. We aimed to provide the first overview of the potential for using LST to monitor ecosystem respiration (R-eco) in disturbed (drained and extracted) peatlands. We used chamber-measured data (2017-2020) from five disturbed and two intact northern peatlands and LST data from Landsat 7, 8, and MODIS missions. First, we studied the strength of the relationships between fluxes and their in situ drivers (i.e., thermal and moisture conditions). Second, we examined the association between LST and in situ temperatures. Third, we compared chamber-measured R-eco with the modeled R-eco driven by in situ measured water table depth and (a) in situ measured surface temperature and (b) remotely sensed MODIS LST data. In situ temperatures were a stronger driver of CO2 fluxes in disturbed sites (repeated measures correlation rmR = 0.8-0.9) than in intact ones (rmR = 0.5-0.8). LST had a higher association with in situ measured temperatures in disturbed sites (mean rmR = 0.79 for MODIS) and weaker in the intact (hummocks and hollows) peatlands (mean rmR = 0.38 for Landsat and 0.48 for MODIS). R-eco models driven by MODIS LST and in situ surface temperature yielded similar accuracy: R-2 was 0.27, 0.66, and 0.67 and 0.29, 0.70, and 0.66 for intact and for drained and extracted sites, respectively. Overall, these findings suggest the applicability of LST as a proxy of the thermal regime in R-eco models, particularly for disturbed peatlands.

TI  - Technical Workflow Development for Integrating Drone Surveys and Entomological Sampling to Characterise Aquatic Larval Habitats of <i>Anopheles funestus</i> in Agricultural Landscapes in Cote d'Ivoire
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-use practices such as agriculture can impact mosquito vector breeding ecology, resulting in changes in disease transmission. The typical breeding habitats of Africa's second most important malaria vector Anopheles funestus are large, semipermanent water bodies, which make them potential candidates for targeted larval source management. This is a technical workflow for the integration of drone surveys and mosquito larval sampling, designed for a case study aiming to characterise An. funestus breeding sites near two villages in an agricultural setting in Cote d'Ivoire. Using satellite remote sensing data, we developed an environmentally and spatially representative sampling frame and conducted paired mosquito larvae and drone mapping surveys from June to August 2021. To categorise the drone imagery, we also developed a land cover classification scheme with classes relative to An. funestus breeding ecology. We sampled 189 potential breeding habitats, of which 119 (63%) were positive for the Anopheles genus and nine (4.8%) were positive for An. funestus. We mapped 30.42 km(2) of the region of interest including all water bodies which were sampled for larvae. These data can be used to inform targeted vector control efforts, although its generalisability over a large region is limited by the fine-scale nature of this study area. This paper develops protocols for integrating drone surveys and statistically rigorous entomological sampling, which can be adjusted to collect data on vector breeding habitats in other ecological contexts. Further research using data collected in this study can enable the development of deep-learning algorithms for identifying An. funestus breeding habitats across rural agricultural landscapes in Cote d'Ivoire and the analysis of risk factors for these sites.

T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Novel prediction methods using artificial intelligence have been developed to improve the identification, discovery, and utilization of new types of mineral resources at new depths or using new technologies. However, most artificial intelligence methods require large training data sets that are often unavailable for mineralization prediction models, leading to inaccuracies. To address this issue, we developed a semi-supervised machine-learning method to identify metallogenic anomalies using the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise method and autoencoder. The outputs of this method show irregularity in distributions inferred from geological, geochemical, and hyperspectral remote sensing data that match known mineralization locations. We focus on the Daqiao mining area of Gansu Province in China to show that the model predictions are highly consistent with known deposits of the Yinmahe and Daqiao gold mines, and two new prospecting areas have been highlighted for further field confirmation. The accuracy of this semi-supervised learning method was verified by an interdisciplinary intelligent analysis, showing that this method could have wide-reaching applications for improving regional geological surveys.Plain Language Summary Mineral resources are irreplaceable and necessary for modernization. Novel prediction methods using artificial intelligence have been developed to improve the prediction of mineral resources. However, the training data sets are still a big problem for the artificial intelligence methods used in this application. To solve this issue, we developed a semi-supervised machine-learning method to identify metallogenic anomalies using the DBSCAN and autoencoder. The accuracy of this method was verified by an interdisciplinary intelligent analysis, showing that this method could have wide-reaching applications for improving regional geological surveys.

TI  - Pseudo-Invariant Feature-Based Linear Regression Model (PIF-LRM): An Effective Normalization Method to Evaluate Urbanization Impacts on Land Surface Temperature Changes
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Landsat land surface temperature (LST) product is widely used to understand the impact of urbanization on surface temperature changes. However, directly comparing multi-temporal Landsat LST is challenging, as the observed LST might be strongly affected by climatic factors. This study validated the utility of the pseudo-invariant feature-based linear regression model (PIF-LRM) in normalizing multi-temporal Landsat LST to highlight the urbanization impact on temperature changes, based on five Landsat LST images during 2000-2018 in Changsha, China. Results showed that LST of PIFs between the reference and the target images was highly correlated, indicating high applicability of the PIF-LRM to relatively normalize LST. The PIF-LRM effectively removed the temporal variation of LST caused by climate factors and highlighted the impacts of urbanization caused land use and land cover changes. The PIF-LRM normalized LST showed stronger correlations with the time series of normalized difference of vegetation index (NDVI) than the observed LST and the LST normalized by the commonly used mean method (subtracting LST by the average, respectively for each image). The PIF-LRM uncovered the spatially heterogeneous responses of LST to urban expansion. For example, LST decreased in the urban center (the already developed regions) and increased in the urbanizing regions. PIF-LRM is highly recommended to normalize multi-temporal Landsat LST to understand the impact of urbanization on surface temperature changes from a temporal point of view.

TI  - Tick-borne zoonotic agents infecting horses from an urban area in Midwestern Brazil: epidemiological and hematological features
T2  - TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The emergence of tick-borne diseases has been reported as a serious problem in public health worldwide and many aspects of its epidemiology and effects on the health of its hosts are unclear. We aimed to perform an epidemiological study of tick-borne zoonotic Rickettsia, Borrelia, and Anaplasmataceae in horses from Midwestern Brazil. We also evaluated whether Borrelia spp. and Anaplasmataceae may be associated with hematological disorders in the sampled animals. Blood and serum samples as well as ticks were collected from 262 horses. Serum samples were used to perform serological tests, and hematological analyses were made using whole blood. Furthermore, DNA extracted from whole blood and ticks was used for molecular tests. Campo Grande is enzootic for tick-borne studied bacteria, since we found an overall exposure of 59.9% of the sampled horses, 28.7% of them presented co-exposure. Seropositivity rates of 20.6% for Borrelia spp., 25.6% for Rickettsia spp., and 31.6% for Anaplasmataceae were found in the sampled horses. Considering both molecular and serological tests for Borrelia spp., the infection rate was 48.0% (126/262). None of the tested horses showed molecular positivity for Anaplasma phagocytophilum. The horses sampled displayed 7.2% of parasitism by ixodid ticks in single and coinfestations. We did not find DNA of any studied bacteria in the sampled ticks. Positive horses for Borrelia spp. and Anaplasmataceae agents displayed leukopenia, monocytopenia, and lymphopenia. Together, our results suggest that horses may play a role as sentinel host for zoonotic bacteria and Borrelia spp. and Anaplasmataceae agents can impair the health of horses.

TI  - The impact of economic inequality on conspiracy beliefs
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous literature highlights the crucial role of economic inequality in triggering a range of negative societal outcomes. However, the relationship between economic inequality and the proliferation of conspiracy beliefs remains unexplored. Here, we explore the endorsement of conspiracy beliefs as an outcome of objective countrylevel (Study 1a, 1b, 1c), perceived (Study 2), and manipulated economic inequality (Studies 3a, 3b, 4a, 4b). In the correlational studies, both objective and perceived economic inequality were associated with greater conspiracy beliefs. In the experiments, participants in the high (compared to the low) inequality condition were more likely to endorse conspiratorial narratives. This effect was fully mediated by anomie (Studies 3a, 3b) suggesting that inequality enhances the perception that society is breaking down (anomie), which in turn increases conspiratorial thinking, possibly in an attempt to regain some sense of order and control. Furthermore, the link between economic inequality and conspiracy beliefs was stronger when participants endorsed a conspiracy worldview (Studies 4a, 4b). Moreover, conspiracy beliefs mediated the effect of the economic inequality manipulation on willingness to engage in collective action aimed at addressing economic inequality. The results show that economic inequality and conspiracy beliefs go hand in hand: economic inequality can cause conspiratorial thinking and conspiracy beliefs can motivate collective action against economic inequality.

TI  - Evapotranspiration Changes over the European Alps: Consistency of Trends and Their Drivers between the MOD16 and SSEBop Algorithms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Alps, understanding how climate change is affecting evapotranspiration (ET) is relevant due to possible implications on water availability for large lowland areas of Europe. Here, changes in ET were studied based on 20 years of MODIS data. MOD16 and operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) products were compared with eddy-covariance data and analyzed for trend detection. The two products showed a similar relationship with ground observations, with RMSE between 0.69 and 2 mm day(-1), and a correlation coefficient between 0.6 and 0.83. A regression with the potential drivers of ET showed that, for climate variables, ground data were coherent with MOD16 at grassland sites, where r(2) was 0.12 for potential ET, 0.17 for precipitation, and 0.57 for air temperature, whereas ground data agreed with SSEBop at forest sites, with an r(2) of 0.46 for precipitation, no correlation with temperature, and negative correlation with potential ET. Interestingly, ground-based correlation corresponded to SSEBop for leaf area index (LAI), while it matched with MOD16 for land surface temperature (LST). Through the trend analysis, both MOD16 and SSEBop revealed positive trends in the south-west, and negative trends in the south and north-east. Moreover, in summer, positive trends prevailed at high elevations for grasslands and forests, while negative trends dominated at low elevations for croplands and grasslands. However, the Alpine area share with positive ET trends was 16.6% for MOD16 and 3.9% for SSEBop, while the share with negative trends was 1.2% for MOD16 and 15.3% for SSEBop. A regression between trends in ET and in climate variables, LST, and LAI indicated consistency, especially between ET, temperature, and LAI increase, but low correlation. Overall, the discrepancies in the trends, and the fact that none of the two products outperformed the other when compared to ground data, suggest that, in the Alps, SSEBop and MOD16 might not be accurate enough to be a robust basis to study ET changes.

TI  - Soil Mesofauna Responses to Fire Severity in a Sclerophyllous Forest in Central Chile
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires may have severe impacts on the aboveground biodiversity and soil chemical and biological properties. Edaphic organisms are highly sensitive to disturbances and are typically used to measure the magnitude of these events. Overall, little is known about the responses of these organisms to fires differing in their severity levels. This study aimed to assess the effect of fire severity on the soil mesofauna community diversity and structure in a site located in a Mediterranean zone of central Chile. In postfire conditions, we use spectral indexes from satellite images to map fire severity at four levels (non-damage (ND), low damage (L), medium damage (M), high damage (H)). Soil samples were collected at each severity level, and the mesofauna abundance was quantified. Although the metrics describing species diversity and dominance were similar among fire severity levels, the abundance and composition of the mesofauna were specifically altered at the high severity level. The edaphic mesofauna can be considered suitable bioindicators to evaluate the postfire ecosystem recovery, especially in the areas highly damaged by fire.

TI  - Novel Methods in the Surveillance of Influenza-Like Illness in Germany Using Data From a Symptom Assessment App (Ada): Observational Case Study
T2  - JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Participatory epidemiology is an emerging field harnessing consumer data entries of symptoms. The free app Ada allows users to enter the symptoms they are experiencing and applies a probabilistic reasoning model to provide a list of possible causes for these symptoms. Objective: The objective of our study is to explore the potential contribution of Ada data to syndromic surveillance by comparing symptoms of influenza-like illness (ILI) entered by Ada users in Germany with data from a national population-based reporting Methods: We extracted data for all assessments performed by Ada users in Germany over 3 seasons (2017/18, 2018/19, and 2019/20) and identified those with ILI (report of fever with cough or sore throat). The weekly proportion of assessments in which ILI was reported was calculated (overall and stratified by age group), standardized for the German population, and compared with trends in ILI rates reported by GrippeWeb using time series graphs, scatterplots, and Pearson correlation coefficient. Results: In total, 2.1 million Ada assessments (for any symptoms) were included. Within seasons and across age groups, the Ada data broadly replicated trends in estimated weekly ILI rates when compared with GrippeWeb data (Pearson correlation-2017-18: r=0.86, 95% CI 0.76-0.92; P<.001; 2018-19: r=0.90, 95% CI 0.84-0.94; P<.001; 2019-20: r=0.64, 95% CI 0.44-0.78; P<.001). However, there were differences in the exact timing and nature of the epidemic curves between years. Conclusions: With careful interpretation, Ada data could contribute to identifying broad ILI trends in countries without existing population-based monitoring systems or to the syndromic surveillance of symptoms not covered by existing systems.

TI  - North to South Variations in the Suspended Sediment Transport Budget within Large Siberian River Deltas Revealed by Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents detailed suspended sediment budget for the four Siberian river deltas, representing contrasting conditions between Northern and Southern environments. Two of the studied rivers empty their water and sediments into the marine located in the permafrost zone in the Arctic region (Lena and Kolyma), and the other two (Selenga and Upper Angara) flow into Lake Baikal located in the steppe and forest-steppe zone of Southern Siberia. For the first time, these poorly monitored areas are analyzed in terms of the long-term and seasonal changes of spatial patterns of suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) over distributaries systems. Remote sensing reflectance is derived from continuous time series of Landsat images and calibrated with the onsite field measurements of SSC. Seasonal variability of suspended sediment changes over deltas was captured for the period from 1989 to 2020. We identify significant variability in the sedimentation processes between different deltas, which is explained by particularities of deltas networks and geomorphology and the existence of specific drivers-continuous permafrost impact in the North and abundant aquatic vegetation and wetland-dominated areas in the South. The study emphasizes that differences exist between Northern and Southern deltas regarding suspended sediments transport conditions. Mostly retention of suspended sediment is observed for Southern deltas due to sediment storage at submerged banks and marshlands located in the backwater zone of the delta during high discharges. In the Northern (arctic) deltas due to permafrost impacts (melting of the permafrost), the absence of sub-aquatic banks and river to ocean interactions of suspended sediment transport is mostly increased downwards, predominantly under higher discharges and along main distributary channels. These results shine light on the geochemical functions of the deltas and patterns of sequestering various metals bound to river sediments.

TI  - Improving Hourly Precipitation Estimates for Flash Flood Modeling in Data-Scarce Andean-Amazon Basins: An Integrative Framework Based on Machine Learning and Multiple Remotely Sensed Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of spatiotemporal precipitation dynamics is crucial for flash flood forecasting; however, it is still a challenge in Andean-Amazon sub-basins due to the lack of suitable rain gauge networks. This study proposes a framework to improve hourly precipitation estimates by integrating multiple satellite-based precipitation and soil-moisture products using random forest modeling and bias correction techniques. The proposed framework is also used to force the GR4H model in three Andean-Amazon sub-basins that suffer frequent flash flood events: upper Napo River Basin (NRB), Jatunyacu River Basin (JRB), and Tena River Basin (TRB). Overall, precipitation estimates derived from the framework (BC-RFP) showed a high ability to reproduce the intensity, distribution, and occurrence of hourly events. In fact, the BC-RFP model improved the detection ability between 43% and 88%, reducing the estimation error between 72% and 93%, compared to the original satellite-based precipitation products (i.e., IMERG-E/L, GSMAP, and PERSIANN). Likewise, simulations of flash flood events by coupling the GR4H model with BC-RFP presented satisfactory performances (KGE* between 0.56 and 0.94). The BC-RFP model not only contributes to the implementation of future flood forecast systems but also provides relevant insights to several water-related research fields and hence to integrated water resources management of the Andean-Amazon region.

TI  - Identifying Urban Functional Areas in China's Changchun City from Sentinel-2 Images and Social Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban functional area is critical to an understanding of the complex urban system, resource allocation, and management. However, due to urban surveys' focus on geographic objects and the mixture of urban space, it is difficult to obtain such information. The function of a place is determined by the activities that take place there. This study employed mobile phone signaling data to extract temporal features of human activities through discrete Fourier transform (DFT). Combined with the features extracted from the point of interest (POI) data and Sentinel images, the urban functional areas of Changchun City were identified using a random forest (RF) model. The results indicate that integrating features derived from remote sensing and social sensing data can effectively improve the identification accuracy and that features derived from dynamic mobile phone signaling have a higher identification accuracy than those derived from POI data. The human activity characteristics on weekends are more distinguishable for different functional areas than those on weekdays. The identified urban functional layout of Changchun is consistent with the actual situation. The residential functional area has the highest proportion, accounting for 33.51%, and is mainly distributed in the central area, while the industrial functional area and green-space are distributed around.

TI  - Exploring the Applicability and Scaling Effects of Satellite-Observed Spring and Autumn Phenology in Complex Terrain Regions Using Four Different Spatial Resolution Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The information on land surface phenology (LSP) was extracted from remote sensing data in many studies. However, few studies have evaluated the impacts of satellite products with different spatial resolutions on LSP extraction over regions with a heterogeneous topography. To bridge this knowledge gap, this study took the Loess Plateau as an example region and employed four types of satellite data with different spatial resolutions (250, 500, and 1000 m MODIS NDVI during the period 2001-2020 and ~10 km GIMMS3g during the period 1982-2015) to investigate the LSP changes that took place. We used the correlation coefficient (r) and root mean square error (RMSE) to evaluate the performances of various satellite products and further analyzed the applicability of the four satellite products. Our results showed that the MODIS-based start of the growing season (SOS) and end of the growing season (EOS) were highly correlated with the ground-observed data with r values of 0.82 and 0.79, respectively (p < 0.01), while the GIMMS3g-based phenology signal performed badly (r < 0.50 and p > 0.05). Spatially, the LSP that was derived from the MODIS products produced more reasonable spatial distributions. The inter-annual averaged MODIS SOS and EOS presented overall advanced and delayed trends during the period 2001-2020, respectively. More than two-thirds of the SOS advances and EOS delays occurred in grasslands, which determined the overall phenological changes across the entire Loess Plateau. However, both inter-annual trends of SOS and EOS derived from the GIMMS3g data were opposite to those seen in the MODIS results. There were no significant differences among the three MODIS datasets (250, 500, and 1000 m) with regard to a bias lower than 2 days, RMSE lower than 1 day, and correlation coefficient greater than 0.95 (p < 0.01). Furthermore, it was found that the phenology that was derived from the data with a 1000 m spatial resolution in the heterogeneous topography regions was feasible. Yet, in forest ecosystems and areas with an accumulated temperature & GE;10 & DEG;C, the differences in phenological phase between the MODIS products could be amplified.

TI  - Landsat-Based Monitoring of the Heat Effects of Urbanization Directions and Types in Hangzhou City from 2000 to 2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization has produced serious heat effects worldwide. However, the literature lacks a detailed study on heat effects based on the directions and types of urban expansion. In this work, a typical city with an extremely hot summer climate, Hangzhou, was selected as a case study to determine the relationships between the urban heat-effect dynamics and spatiotemporal patterns of impervious surface expansion. Based on long-term Landsat imagery, this study characterized the spatiotemporal patterns of urban expansion and normalized surface temperatures in Hangzhou City from 2000 to 2020 using object-based backdating classification and a generalized single-channel algorithm with the help of a land-use transfer matrix, expansion index, and spatial centroids. Relevant policies, industries, and traffic networks were discussed to help explain urban expansion and thermal environment changes. The results demonstrated that in 2020, the area of impervious surfaces covered 1139.29 km(2). The majority of the gains were in farmland, water, and forests, and the annual growth rate was 32.12 km(2)/year beginning in 2000. During the expansion of impervious surfaces, the city warmed at a slower rate, and more thermal contributions came from sub-urban areas. The southeast-oriented expansion of impervious surfaces was the key reason for the spatiotemporal dynamics of the urban heat effects. The dominant urban edge expansion intensified the local heat effects. This research provides a Landsat-based methodology for better understanding the heat effects of urban expansion.

TI  - Evaluation of MODIS, MISR, and VIIRS daily level-3 aerosol optical depth products over land
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of eight aerosol optical depth (AOD) products from the latest MODIS C6.1 DT, DB and DTB, MISR V23, and VIIRS V1 DB dataset against the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) measurements on global scale during 2012 to 2019. The latest MODIS DB products are found to be superior over DT in most cases. MODIS DTB products generally have a better performance than either DT or DB. VIIRS shows the best overall performance on global and regional scale while MISR has a systematic underestimation in moderate and high AOD conditions. Median AOD bias shows distinct regional dependence with the biggest divergence between satellite AOD products appearing in Asia. All these AOD products tend to have better performance in high latitude region and poorer performance in the tropics likely due to the complex aerosol condition and common high cloud cover in the tropics. Time series stability evaluation shows a distinct temporal pattern of statistics, in which the observation number and median AOD bias tend to be high in summer while low in winter and correlation R has a reversing trend. Among these products, VIIRS V1 DB has the highest time series stability of bias. Influence of aerosol loading, particle size, land use, elevation, and precipitable water and temperature on AOD retrievals is broadly consistent between products. High aerosol loading, small particle size, bright surface, high altitude, and high precipitable water and temperature tend to decrease the retrieval accuracy, e.g. lower expected error (EE) within ratio and larger median bias. The latest AOD products need to be furthermore improved under extreme conditions like very fine aerosols, elevated terrain and high precipitable water and temperature.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Directly establishing the relationship between satellite data and PM2.5 concentration through deep learning methods for PM2.5 concentration estimation is an important means for estimating regional PM2.5 concentration. However, due to the lack of consideration of uncertainty in deep learning methods, methods based on deep learning have certain overfitting problems in the process of PM2.5 estimation. In response to this problem, this paper designs a deep Bayesian PM2.5 estimation model that takes into account multiple scales. The model uses a Bayesian neural network to describe key parameters a priori, provide regularization effects to the neural network, perform posterior inference through parameters, and take into account the characteristics of data uncertainty, which is used to alleviate the problem of model overfitting and to improve the generalization ability of the model. In addition, different-scale Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data and ERA5 reanalysis data were used as input to the model to strengthen the model's perception of different-scale features of the atmosphere, as well as to further enhance the model's PM2.5 estimation accuracy and generalization ability. Experiments with Anhui Province as the research area showed that the R-2 of this method on the independent test set was 0.78, which was higher than that of the DNN, random forest, and BNN models that do not consider the impact of the surrounding environment; moreover, the RMSE was 19.45 mu g & BULL;m(-3), which was also lower than the three compared models. In the experiment of different seasons in 2019, compared with the other three models, the estimation accuracy was significantly reduced; however, the R-2 of the model in this paper could still reach 0.66 or more. Thus, the model in this paper has a higher accuracy and better generalization ability.

TI  - Deep carbonate reservoir characterisation using multi-seismic attributes viamachine learning with physical constraints
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Seismic characterisation of deep carbonate reservoirs is of considerable interest for reservoir distribution prediction, reservoir quality evaluation and reservoir structure delineation. However, it is challenging to use the traditional methodology to predict a deep-buried carbonate reservoir because of the highly nonlinear mapping relationship between heterogeneous reservoir features and seismic responses. We propose a machine-learning-based method (random forest) with physical constraints to enhance deep carbonate reservoir prediction performance from multi- seismic attributes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on a real data application in the deep carbonate reservoir of Tarim Basin, Western China. We first perform feature selection on multi-seismic attributes, then four kinds of physical constraint (continuity, boundary, spatial and category constraint) transferred from domain knowledge are imposed on the process of model building. Using the physical constraints, the F1 score of reservoir quality and reservoir type can be significantly improved and the combination of the effective physical constraints gives the best prediction of performance. We also apply the proposed strategy on 2D seismic data to predict the spatial distribution of reservoir quality and type. The seismic prediction results provide a reasonable description of the strong heterogeneity of the reservoir, offering insights into sweet spot detection and reservoir development.

TI  - InSAR Monitoring of Arctic Landfast Sea Ice Deformation Using L-Band ALOS-2, C-Band Radarsat-2 and Sentinel-1
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Arctic amplification is accelerating changes in sea ice regimes in the Canadian Arctic with later freeze-up and earlier melt events, adversely affecting Arctic wildlife and communities that depend on the stability of sea ice conditions. To monitor both the rate and impact of such change, there is a need to accurately measure sea ice deformation, an important component for understanding ice motion and polar climate. The objective of this study is to determine the spatial-temporal pattern of deformation over landfast ice in the Arctic using time series SAR imagery. We present Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) monitoring of Arctic landfast sea ice deformation using C-band Radarsat-2, Sentinel-1 and L-band ALOS-2 in this paper. The small baseline subset (SBAS) approach was explored to process time series observations for retrieval of temporal deformation changes along a line-of-sight direction (LOS) over the winter. It was found that temporal and spatial patterns of deformation observed from different sensors were generally consistent. Horizontal and vertical deformations were also retrieved by a multi-dimensional SBAS technique using both ascending and descending Sentinel-1 observations. Results showed a horizontal deformation in the range of -95-85 cm, and vertical deformation in the range of -41-63 cm in Cambridge Bay, Nunavut, Canada during February-April 2019. High coherence over ice from C-band was maintained over a shorter time interval of acquisitions than L-band due to temporal decorrelation.

TI  - Fractal Characteristic Analysis of Urban Land-Cover Spatial Patterns with Spatiotemporal Remote Sensing Images in Shenzhen City (1988-2015)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the urban land-cover spatial patterns is of particular significance for sustainable development planning. Due to the nonlinear characteristics related to the spatial pattern for land cover, it is essential to provide a new analysis method to analyze them across remote sensing imagery. This paper is devoted to exploring the fractals and fractal dimension properties of land-cover spatial patterns in Shenzhen city, China. Land-cover information was extracted using a supervised classification method with ArcGIS technology from cloud-free Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI imagery, covering 1988-2015. The box-counting method and the least squares regression method are combined to estimate fractal dimensions of the land-cover spatial pattern. The information entropy was used to verify our fractal dimension results. The results show the fractal dimension changes for each land cover type from 1988 to 2015: (1) the land-cover spatial form of Shenzhen city has a clear fractal structure, but fractal dimension values vary in different land cover types; (2) the fractal dimension of build-up land increases and reaches a stable value, while grassland and cultivated land decrease; The fractal structure of grassland and bare land showed a bifractals trend increasing year by year; (3) the information entropy dimension growth is approaching its maximum capacity before 2011. We integrated the information entropy index and fractal dimension to analyze the complexity in land-cover spatial evolution from space-filling, space balance, and space complexity. It can be concluded that driven by policies, the land-cover spatial form in Shenzhen experienced a process from a hierarchical spatial structure with a low evolution intensity to a higher evolution intensity with multiscale differential development. The fractal dimension has been becoming better through self-organization, and its land resources are reaching the growth limits.

TI  - ACADEMICIAN NODARI SIMONIA - THE LAST MARXIST
T2  - MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - The author traces and analyzes the career and activity of Academician Nodari Aleksandrovich Simoniya (1932-2019), a prominent orientalist and expert in international relations who headed the Institute of World Economy and International Relations of the Russian Academy of Sciences in 2000-2006. The article reveals the formation of the general worldview and academic views of N. Simonia, assesses his contribution to the study of the East after the collapse of the colonial system and the formation of young independent states. The author acquaints the reader with the views of the Academician on the European, Asian and Russian revolutions, with his approach to understanding the processes of contemporary world development, explains his civil position, both under the Soviet regime and in post-Soviet Russia. N. Simonia combined a detailed knowledge of realities in the Eastern regions he studied - primarily Southeast Asia - with a deep theoretical approach to the study of complex processes in the East after the end of World War II Over time, the interests of the Academician went beyond the East, to which he devoted several decades of research. At the turn of the 1990s-2000s, his attention was attracted by the problems of global world development, as well as the development of post-Soviet Russia. All the works of N. Simonia - he published 18 books and dozens of articles in Russian and foreign academic journals - were written by him, as he himself admitted, on the basis of the Marxist methodology. But Simonia's Marxism had nothing in common with vulgar ideas in Bolsheviks' teachings of Marx and their "theory of Marxism-Leninism". At the same time, the Academician criticized not only Stalin and Lenin, but also Marx himself, who succeeded only in deep analysis of contemporary pre-monopoly capitalism. N. Simonia criticized the Soviet model of socialism as well, believing that there has never been any real socialism in the USSR. He was equally critical of the "liberal" turn of the Russian intellectual elite after 1991, blaming its radical faction, which influenced President Boris Yeltsin, for instilling in Russia a model of the "worst", as he wrote, "the most parasitic version of bureaucratic capitalism". For Simonia, the latter was associated with Indonesia under Sukarno. But even there, not to mention Japan and South Korea, the business elite has never been antipatriotic, as it happened in modern Russia. In his opinion, the Russian model of capitalism turned out to be unlike either the Western or the Eastern model, and the modernization, which Russia urgently needs, is inseparable from genuine democratization, but should not represent an imitation of democracy, as is the case.

TI  - Quantifying the Contribution of LUCC to Surface Energy Budget: A Case Study of Four Typical Cities in the Yellow River Basin in China
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - With social changes and economic development, human activities inevitably lead to significant changes in land use types. Land use and land cover change (LUCC) leads to a series of changes in energy balance and surface temperature, which has an impact on the regional climate. In this study, MODIS remote sensing data were used to quantify the results of the biological and geophysical effects caused by LUCC in four typical cities in the Yellow River Basin of China: Jinan, Zhengzhou, Lanzhou and Xining. The results showed the following: (1) The latent heat flux and the net radiation of the four cities were both increasing on the whole. The latent heat flux of water and forest was higher, which played a key role in energy consumption on the ground. The net radiation value of the old urban and urban expansion areas was higher, while that of the forest was lower, which indicated that human activities increased the input of surface energy. (2) The differences between latent heat flux and net radiation in areas greatly affected by human activities were much smaller than those in natural areas such as forest and grassland. This indicted that human activities increased the warming trend. In addition, most of the differences between latent heat flux and net radiation in the four cities showed a downward trend. (3) Different cities have different regulating factors for land surface temperature (LST). In Jinan and Zhengzhou, the regulation of LST by net radiation was more obvious, while in Lanzhou and Xining, the regulation of LST by latent heat flux was more pronounced. By comparing LUCC and the forced balance between energy intake and consumption in four typical cities along the Yellow River Basin, this study emphasizes the difference of energy budgets under different land use types, which has important reference value for judging the spatial difference of urban thermal environments.

TI  - Indocyanine Green-Loaded PLGA Nanoparticles Conjugated with Hyaluronic Acid Improve Target Specificity in Cervical Cancer Tumors
T2  - YONSEI MEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Indocyanine green (ICG) is a promising agent for intraoperative visualization of tumor tissues and sentinel lymph nodes in early-stage gynecological cancer. However, it has some limitations, including a short half-life and poor solubility in aqueous solutions. This study aimed to enhance the efficacy of near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging by overcoming the shortcomings of ICG using a nano-drug delivery system and improve target specificity in cervical cancer. Materials and Methods: ICG and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) conjugated with polyethylenimine (PEI) were assembled to enhance stability. Hyaluronic acid (HA) was coated on PEI-PLGA-ICG nanoparticles to target CD44-positive cancer cells. The manufactured HA-ICG-PLGA nanoparticles (HINPs) were evaluated in vitro and in vivo on cervical cancer cells (SiHa; CD44+) and human dermal cells (ccd986sk; CD44-), respectively, using NIR imaging to compare intracellular uptake and to quantify the fluorescence intensities of cells and tumors. Results: HINPs were confirmed to have a mean size of 200 nm and a zeta-potential of 33 mV using dynamic light scattering. The stability of the HINPs was confirmed at pH 5.0-8.0. Cytotoxicity assays, intracellular uptake assays, and cervical cancer xenograft models revealed that, compared to free ICG, the HINPs had significantly higher internalization by cervical cancer cells than normal cells (p<0.001) and significantly higher accumulation in tumors (p<0.001) via CD44 receptor-mediated endocytosis. Conclusion: This study demonstrated the successful application of HINPs as nanocarriers for delivering ICG to CD44-positive cervical cancer, with improved efficacy in NIR fluorescence imaging.

TI  - Near-Surface Air Temperature Retrieval Using a Deep Neural Network from Satellite Observations over South Korea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Air temperature (Ta), defined as the temperature 2 m above the land's surface, is one of the most important factors for environment and climate studies. Ta can be measured by obtaining the land surface temperature (LST) which can be retrieved with the 11- and 12-mu m bands from satellite imagery over a large area, and LST is highly correlated with Ta. To measure the Ta in a broad area, we studied a Ta retrieval method through Deep Neural Network (DNN) using in-situ data and satellite data of South Korea from 2014 to 2017. To retrieve accurate Ta, we selected proper input variables and conditions of a DNN model. As a result, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Normalized Difference Water Index, and 11- and 12-mu m band data were applied to the DNN model as input variables. And we also selected proper condition of the DNN model with test various conditions of the model. In validation result in the DNN model, the best accuracy of the retrieved Ta showed an correlation coefficient value of 0.98 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.19 K. And then we additional 3 analysis to validate accuracy which are spatial representativeness, seasonal analysis and time series analysis. We tested the spatial representativeness of the retrieved Ta. Results for window sizes less than 132 x 132 showed high accuracy, with a correlation coefficient of over 0.97 and a RMSE of 1.96 K and a bias of -0.00856 K. And in seasonal analysis, the spring season showed the lowest accuracy, 2.82 K RMSE value, other seasons showed high accuracy under 2K RMSE value. We also analyzed a time series of six the Automated Synoptic Observing System (ASOS) points (i.e., locations) using data obtained from 2018 to 2019; all of the individual correlation coefficient values were over 0.97 and the RMSE values were under 2.41 K. With these analysis, we confirm accuracy of the DNN model was higher than previous studies. And we thought the retrieved Ta can be used in other studies or climate model to conduct urban problems like urban heat islands and to analyze effects of arctic oscillation.

TI  - Pure and Mixed Desmoplastic Melanomas: A Retrospective Clinicopathologic Comparison of 33 Cases
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF DERMATOPATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Pure and mixed desmoplastic melanomas (DMs) may have different natural histories and behaviors. Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of patients diagnosed with DM at our institution between January 1997 and April 2019. A total of 33 unique DMs were identified and subsequently analyzed based on the histologic type (pure vs. mixed). Results: The majority (57.6%) of our cases were classified as pure histology. Patients with pure DMs were more likely to be men (P = 0.035) and be older than 65 years (P = 0.019) compared with patients with mixed DMs. Patients with mixed DM were more likely to have mitoses present (P = 0.001) compared with patients with pure DM. There were no differences in ulceration, perineural invasion, vascular invasion, or survival between patients with pure and mixed histologic subtypes. In addition, no differences in sentinel lymph node biopsy, radiation, or chemotherapy were noted between the 2 histologic subtypes. Immunohistochemistry showed that 27.3% of the pure DMs stained with Melan-A and HMB45 were positive for these immunomarkers. Conclusions: Pure and mixed variants of DM were found to have similar clinicopathologic characteristics. Patients with the mixed histologic subtype were more likely to have mitoses, but no difference in the therapeutic management or patient survival was seen between the 2 subtypes.

TI  - Ship Detection in Sentinel 2 Multi-Spectral Images with Self-Supervised Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Automatic ship detection provides an essential function towards maritime domain awareness for security or economic monitoring purposes. This work presents an approach for training a deep learning ship detector in Sentinel-2 multi-spectral images with few labeled examples. We design a network architecture for detecting ships with a backbone that can be pre-trained separately. By using self supervised learning, an emerging unsupervised training procedure, we learn good features on Sentinel-2 images, without requiring labeling, to initialize our network's backbone. The full network is then fine-tuned to learn to detect ships in challenging settings. We evaluated this approach versus pre-training on ImageNet and versus a classical image processing pipeline. We examined the impact of variations in the self-supervised learning step and we show that in the few-shot learning setting self-supervised pre-training achieves better results than ImageNet pre-training. When enough training data are available, our self-supervised approach is as good as ImageNet pre-training. We conclude that a better design of the self-supervised task and bigger non-annotated dataset sizes can lead to surpassing ImageNet pre-training performance without any annotation costs.

TI  - Exploiting Sentinel-5P TROPOMI and Ground Sensor Data for the Detection of Volcanic SO<sub>2</sub> Plumes and Activity in 2018-2021 at Stromboli, Italy
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sulfur dioxide (SO2) degassing at Strombolian volcanoes is directly associated with magmatic activity, thus its monitoring can inform about the style and intensity of eruptions. The Stromboli volcano in southern Italy is used as a test case to demonstrate that the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) onboard the Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor (Sentinel-5P) satellite has the suitable spatial resolution and sensitivity to carry out local-scale SO2 monitoring of relatively small-size, nearly point-wise volcanic sources, and distinguish periods of different activity intensity. The entire dataset consisting of TROPOMI Level 2 SO2 geophysical products from UV sensor data collected over Stromboli from 6 May 2018 to 31 May 2021 is processed with purposely adapted Python scripts. A methodological workflow is developed to encompass the extraction of total SO2 Vertical Column Density (VCD) at given coordinates (including conditional VCD for three different hypothetical peaks at 0-1, 7 and 15 km), as well as filtering by quality in compliance with the Sentinel-5P Validation Team's recommendations. The comparison of total SO2 VCD time series for the main crater and across different averaging windows (3 x 3, 5 x 5 and 4 x 2) proves the correctness of the adopted spatial sampling criterion, and practical recommendations are proposed for further implementation in similar volcanic environments. An approach for detecting SO2 VCD peaks at the volcano is trialed, and the detections are compared with the level of SO2 flux measured at ground-based instrumentation. SO2 time series analysis is complemented with information provided by contextual Sentinel-2 multispectral (in the visible, near and short-wave infrared) and Suomi NPP VIIRS observations. The aim is to correctly interpret SO2 total VCD peaks when they either (i) coincide with medium to very high SO2 emissions as measured in situ and known from volcanological observatory bulletins, or (ii) occur outside periods of significant emissions despite signs of activity visible in Sentinel-2 data. Finally, SO2 VCD peaks in the time series are further investigated through daily time lapses during the paroxysms in July-August 2019, major explosions in August 2020 and a more recent period of activity in May 2021. Hourly wind records from ECMWF Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) data are used to identify local wind direction and SO2 plume drift during the time lapses. The proposed analysis approach is successful in showing the SO2 degassing associated with these events, and warning whenever the SO2 VCD at Stromboli may be overestimated due to clustering with the plume of the Mount Etna volcano.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Sampling in Robot-Assisted Staging of Endometrial Cancer
T2  - SOUTHERN MEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Sentinel lymph node (SLN) sampling in endometrial cancer staging has become an acceptable standard. Indocyanine green dye injected into the cervix and detected by near-infrared light is technically simple and sensitive. We aimed to evaluate SLN sampling in robot-assisted surgical staging of endometrial cancer at a university-affiliated teaching hospital. Methods A retrospective chart review, from January 2016 to December 2017, of patients who underwent robot-assisted surgical staging with cervical injection of indocyanine green dye detected by near-infrared light. The map rate, sensitivity, false negatives, and negative predictive value were calculated. Results A total of 105 charts were reviewed; 79 patients met inclusion criteria. The mean age was 65 (range 38-93) and the mean body mass index was 33.3 (range 16-49). Most patients (72.2%) had stage I disease and grade 1 or 2 histology (77.1%). Eight (10.1%) patients had lymph node metastasis. Seventy-two (91.1%) patients had positive mapping to at least 1 SLN. Sixty-two (78.5%) patients had bilateral mapping. Forty-four patients had concurrent pelvic +/- para-aortic lymph node dissection and were included in the sensitivity analysis. Five of 44 cases had LN metastasis. The sensitivity was 80%, and the negative predictive value of SLN sampling was 97.5%. Conclusions SLN mapping and sampling at a university-affiliated teaching hospital have comparable map rate, sensitivity, and negative predictive value as demonstrated in multiple trials. The technique has the potential to standardize endometrial cancer staging across different practice settings.

TI  - Autonomous Learning Interactive Features for Hyperspectral Remotely Sensed Data
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - In the field of remote sensing, most of the feature indexes are obtained based on expert knowledge or domain analysis. With the rapid development of machine learning and artificial intelligence, this method is time-consuming and lacks flexibility, and the indexes obtained cannot be applied to all areas. In order to not rely on expert knowledge and find the effective feature index with regard to a certain material automatically, this paper proposes a data-driven method to learn interactive features for hyperspectral remotely sensed data based on a sparse multiclass logistic regression model. The key point explicitly expresses the interaction relationship between original features as new features by multiplication or division operation in the logistic regression. Through the strong constraint of the L1 norm, the learned features are sparse. The coefficient value of the corresponding features after sparse represents the basis for judging the importance of the features, and the optimal interactive features among the original features. This expression is inspired by the phenomenon that usually the famous indexes we used in remote sensing, like NDVI, NDWI, are the ratio between different spectral bands, and also in statistical regression, the relationship between features is captured by feature value multiplication. Experiments were conducted on three hyperspectral data sets of Pavia Center, Washington DC Mall, and Pavia University. The results for binary classification show that the method can extract the NDVI and NDWI autonomously, and a new type of metal index is proposed in the Pavia University data set. This framework is more flexible and creative than the traditional method based on laboratory research to obtain the key feature and feature interaction index for hyperspectral remotely sensed data.

TI  - Influences of the Great Whirl on surface chlorophyll <i>a</i> concentration off the Somali Coast in 2017
T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The general features of the Great Whirl (GW) off the Somali Coast in 2017 and its influences on chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration were studied by using satellite data and model outputs. Results show that GW, which initiated at 7 degrees N, 53 degrees E on June 13, had a lifetime of 153 d with an average amplitude of 16 cm and an average radius of 205 km. After the formation of GW, the concentration of Chl a in the interior of GW showed a downward trend throughout its life cycle, except in early July and mid-October. In early July, the Chl a blooms in the interior of GW were attributed to the combined effect of three processes. They are eddy horizontal transportation, the deepening of the mixed layer caused by the monsoon and eddy pumping, and the upward transportation of nutrients caused by eddy-induced Ekman pumping. In October, the Chl a blooms were probably due to the weakening of GW. During the period, water exchange occurred more frequently across the eddy, thus phytoplanktons were imported into the interior of GW.

TI  - Engineering-Geological Analysis of a Subaerial Landslide in Taan Fiord, Alaska
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On 17 October 2015, a large-scale subaerial landslide occurred in Taan Fiord, Alaska, which released about 50 Mm(3) of rock. This entered the water body and triggered a tsunami with a runup of up to 193 m. This paper aims to simulate the possible formation of a weak layer in this mountainous slope until collapse, and to analyze the possible triggering factors of this landslide event from a geotechnical engineering perspective so that a deeper understanding of this large landslide event can be gained. We analyzed different remote-sensing datasets to characterize the evolution of the coastal landslide process. Based on the acquired remote-sensing data, Digital Elevation Models were derived, on which we employed a 2D limit equilibrium method in this study to calculate the safety factor and compare the location of the associated sliding surface with the most probable actual location at which this landslide occurred. The calculation results reflect the development process of this slope collapse. In this case study, past earthquakes, rainfall before this landslide event, and glacial melting at the toe may have influenced the stability of this slope. The glacial retreat is likely to be the most significant direct triggering factor for this slope failure. This research work illustrates the applicability of multi-temporal remote sensing data of slope morphology to constrain preliminary slope stability analyses, aiming to investigate large-scale landslide processes. This interdisciplinary approach confirms the effectiveness of the combination of aerial data acquisition and traditional slope stability analyses. This case study also demonstrates the significance of a climate change for landslide hazard assessment, and that the interaction of natural hazards in terms of multi-hazards cannot be ignored.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variation Analysis of the Fine-Scale Heat Wave Risk along the Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Railway in Indonesia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - As a highly important meteorological hazard, heat waves notably impact human health and socioeconomics, and accurate heat wave risk identification and assessment are effective ways to address this issue. The current spatial scale of heat wave risk assessment is relatively coarse, hardly meeting fine-scale heat wave risk assessment requirements. Therefore, based on multi-source fine-scale remote sensing data and socioeconomic data, this paper evaluates the heat wave risk along the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway, obtains the spatial distribution of heat wave risk in 2005, 2014 and 2019, and analyzes spatiotemporal risk variations over the past 15 years. The results show that most high-risk areas were affected by high-temperature hazards. Over time, the hazard, exposure, vulnerability and risk levels increased by 25.82%, 3.31%, 14.82% and 6.97%, respectively, from 2005-2019. Spatially, the higher risk in the northwest is mainly distributed in Jakarta. Additionally, a comparative analysis was conducted on the risk results, and the results showed that the 100-m scale showed more spatial differences than the kilometer scale. The research results in this paper can provide scientific advice on heat wave risk prevention considering the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway construction and regional economic and social development.

TI  - Optimization of Landsat Chl-<i>a</i> Retrieval Algorithms in Freshwater Lakes through Classification of Optical Water Types
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The application of remote sensing data to empirical models of inland surface water chlorophyll-a concentrations (chl-a) has been in development since the launch of the Landsat 4 satellite series in 1982. However, establishing an empirical model using a chl-a retrieval algorithm is difficult due to the spatial heterogeneity of inland lake water properties. Classification of optical water types (OWTs; i.e., differentially observed water spectra due to differences in water properties) has grown in favour in recent years over traditional non-turbid vs. turbid classifications. This study examined whether top-of-atmosphere reflectance observations in visible to near-infrared bands from Landsat 4, 5, 7, and 8 sensors can be used to identify unique OWTs using a guided unsupervised classification approach in which OWTs are defined through both remotely sensed reflectance and surface water chemistry data taken from samples in North American and Swedish lakes. Linear regressions of algorithms (Landsat reflectance bands, band ratios, products, or combinations) to lake surface water chl-a were built for each OWT. The performances of chl-a retrieval algorithms within each OWT were compared to those of global chl-a algorithms to test the effectiveness of OWT classification. Seven unique OWTs were identified and then fit into four categories with varying degrees of brightness as follows: turbid lakes with a low chl-a:turbidity ratio; turbid lakes with a mixture of high chl-a and turbidity measurements; oligotrophic or mesotrophic lakes with a mixture of low chl-a and turbidity measurements; and eutrophic lakes with a high chl-a:turbidity ratio. With one exception (r(2) = 0.26, p = 0.08), the best performing algorithm in each OWT showed improvement (r(2) = 0.69-0.91, p < 0.05), compared with the best performing algorithm for all lakes combined (r(2) = 0.52, p < 0.05). Landsat reflectance can be used to extract OWTs in inland lakes to provide improved prediction of chl-a over large extents and long time series, giving researchers an opportunity to study the trophic states of unmonitored lakes.

TI  - Linking land system changes (1980-2017) with the trophic status of an urban wetland: Implications for wetland management
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The knowledge on urban ecosystem dynamics is being increasingly felt due to unprecedented symptoms arising out of urbanization. This study is aimed to assess land use-land cover changes (LULCCs) around a wetland ecosystem using high spatial resolution CORONA and Google Basemap satellite imageries. The imageries were processed by digitizing land cover features at 1:3000 scale in ArcGIS 10.1. The imageries were classified into nine classes, and an estimation of accuracy was performed utilizing the Kappa coefficient and error matrices. The overall accuracy obtained was 94% for the 2017 dataset. The key findings indicated a loss of 23% in the wetland area from 1980 to 2017. While in the vicinity, a significant increase in green spaces (706.2%) and roads (89.4%) was observed. Morphometric analysis revealed that the wetland has lost a surface area of 10.2 ha from 1980 to 2017. The maximum length (L-max) of the wetland was reduced by 722 m while the maximum width (W-max) decreased by 78 m. Bathymetric analysis revealed that the wetland is shallow with a depth ranging from 10 to 174 cm. The Carlson's Trophic State Index (TSI) of wetland ranging from 74 to 87 indicates hyper-eutrophic waters. Overall, the loss of wetland area, together with the reduction in morphometric features, low depth, and higher trophic status speak of anthropogenic pressures that are compromising the ecological integrity of this wetland. Therefore, landscape planning and governance are of pivotal importance for the conservation and management of wetland ecosystems in this region.

TI  - Landscape Transformations, Morphometry, and Trophic Status of Anchar Wetland in Kashmir Himalaya: Implications for Urban Wetland Management
T2  - WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examined the current trophic state based on integrated analysis of land use land cover changes (LULCCs), morphometry, bathymetry, and water quality of a semi-urban wetland. The analysis of satellite data indicated that the wetland has lost an area of similar to 93 ha from 1980 to 2017. During the same period, the urban area within the wetland increased from 0.04 to 13.5%. The natural area of the wetland was lost significantly because of land conversion practices largely related to encroachments, settlements, and unplanned developmental activities. The land cover changes assessed in the immediate vicinity of wetland indicated an increase in the built-up (223%) and roads (95%). Morphometric analysis revealed that the maximum length of the wetland decreased by 775 m, while width showed an insignificant decrease. The bathymetric analysis revealed that the depth of the wetland varied from 25 to 246 cm, with a mean depth of 101.6 cm. The Carlson's trophic state index (TSI) ranged between 71 and 80.4, indicating the hyper-eutrophic nature of the wetland. Comparison of water quality data of a wetland with the previous studies indicated a decrease of 29 cm in the maximum depth from 1980 to 2018. While NO3--N increased from 300 mu g L-1 in 1980 to 367 mu g L-1 in 2018, total phosphorus (TP) increased from 300 mu g L-1 in 1980 to 923 mu g L-1 in 2018, thereby indicating continuous nutrient enrichment of the wetland. Based on the data analysis, immediate policy interventions are required to safeguard and/or reclaim this culturally and ecologically important wetland in the Kashmir region.

TI  - Investigation of Orbital Decay and Global Modeling of the Planet WASP-43 b
T2  - ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - WASP-43 b is one of the most important candidates for detecting an orbital decay. We investigate pieces of evidence for this expectation as variations in its transit timings, based on the ground and space observations. The data set includes the transit observations at the TuBITAK National Observatory of Turkey and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). We present a global model of the system, based on the most precise photometry from space, ground, and archival radial velocity data. Using the homogenized data set and modeled light curves, we measure the mid-transit times for WASP-43 b. Our analysis agrees with a linear ephemeris for which we refine the light elements for future observations of the system. However, there is a negative difference between the transit timings derived from TESS data in two sectors (9 and 35) and a hint of an orbital period decrease in the entire data set. Both findings are statistically insignificant due to the short baseline of observations, which prevents us from drawing firm conclusions about the orbital decay of this ultra-short-period planet. However, assuming the effect of this decrease of the period in the planet's orbit, we derive a lower limit for the reduced tidal quality factor as Q*' > (4.01 +/- 1.15) x 10(5) from the best-fitting quadratic function. Finally, we calculate a probable rotational period for this system as 7.52 days from the out-of-transit flux variation in the TESS light curves due to spot modulation.

TI  - Bluetongue Virus Infections in Cattle Herds of Manabi Province of Ecuador
T2  - PATHOGENS
M3  - Article
AB  - Bluetongue (BT) is a viral disease transmitted by Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) to domestic and wild ruminants. Infections in cattle are mainly subclinical, but severe necrotic and hemorrhagic illness and death may occur depending on the strain of the virus and other factors; cattle act as a reservoir for the virus. Although the Ecuadorian coast has climatic conditions that favor the presence of the vector, there are few serologic or virologic BTV studies available. Manabi is a coastal province in which livestock farming is mostly implemented in the northern part. We conducted two studies to assess, for the first time, the presence of active BTV infections in Manabi province. We collected 430 serum samples from 38 randomly selected farms between March and July 2019 to perform BTV competitive ELISA. In addition, six seropositive farms were selected to place eight sentinel BTV-naive calves. All these calves were blood sampled and the presence of BTV RNA and antibodies was tested for by RT-PCR and competitive ELISA, respectively, once a week for 6-8 weeks until seroconversion was evidenced. A high individual seroprevalence (99%) was obtained, and all investigated farms had BTV seropositive animals. All sentinel calves became BTV viremic and seroconverted. The first viremia appeared after 2-5 weeks from arrival at the farm; they seroconverted 1-3 weeks later. We demonstrate for the first time that there is a high level of BTV circulation north of Manabi, with active infections on these farms. Integrated control strategies such as hygienic measures on farms to reduce midge populations would be advisable for the owners as mitigation measures.

AB  - Introduction: Adverse drug reactions (ADR) are considered a serious public health problem, being responsible for an increase in morbidity and mortality and health costs. Objective: To know the occurrence profile and to describe the characteristics of the cases of ADR notified in a sentinel hospital in Minas Gerais. Method: Observational, descriptive and cross-sectional study, which used as a source the spreadsheet of suspected ADR reports from the hospital's risk management from January 2015 to December 2019. Results: 255 notifications were analyzed, the majority coming from active search (69.4%), involving 269 medications and 328 episodes of ADR. The sector with the highest number of notifications was the Medical Clinic (43.9%). The age range of the most affected patients was between 19-59 years (54.5%), predominantly male (50.6%) and white (54.1%). Most of the ADR were manifested through disorders in the integumentary system (36.3%), with mild severity (63.9%), mainly due to the use of systemic anti-infectives (44.6%). Conclusions: It is concluded that the notifications of ADR are recurrent in the hospital and their knowledge allows to outline their clinical profile, helping to prevent them and contributing to greater patient safety.

TI  - Improved Classification Models to Distinguish Natural from Anthropic Oil Slicks in the Gulf of Mexico: Seasonality and Radarsat-2 Beam Mode Effects under a Machine Learning Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Distinguishing between natural and anthropic oil slicks is a challenging task, especially in the Gulf of Mexico, where these events can be simultaneously observed and recognized as seeps or spills. In this study, a powerful data analysis provided by machine learning (ML) methods was employed to develop, test, and implement a classification model (CM) to distinguish an oil slick source (OSS) as natural or anthropic. A robust database containing 4916 validated oil samples, detected using synthetic aperture radar (SAR), was employed for this task. Six ML algorithms were evaluated, including artificial neural networks (ANN), random forest (RF), decision trees (DT), naive Bayes (NB), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and logistic regression (LR). Using RF, the global CM achieved a maximum accuracy value of 73.15. An innovative approach evaluated how external factors, such as seasonality, satellite configurations, and the synergy between them, limit or improve OSS predictions. To accomplish this, specific classification models (SCMs) were derived from the global ones (CMs), tuning the best algorithms and parameters according to different scenarios. Median accuracies revealed winter and spring to be the best seasons and ScanSAR Narrow B (SCNB) as the best beam mode. The maximum median accuracy to distinguish seeps from spills was achieved in winter using SCNB (83.05). Among the tested algorithms, RF was the most robust, with a better performance in 81% of the investigated scenarios. The accuracy increment provided by the well-fitted models may minimize the confusion between seeps and spills. This represents a concrete contribution to reducing economic and geologic risks derived from exploration activities in offshore areas. Additionally, from an operational standpoint, specific models support specialists to select the best SAR products and seasons for new acquisitions, as well as to optimize performances according to the available data.

TI  - Evil is not rooted in establishment. The Question of Evil in Ismaili Shiism
T2  - ORIENS
M3  - Article
AB  - As is the case with other Shi'i traditions, Ismailism developed a dualistic worldview ruled by the opposition between good and evil, light and darkness. However, it is a rather moderate form of dualism, as the principle of evil is not coexistent with the Creator or has not been created by Him. Evil only appears at a lower level of the cosmic hierarchy. This doctrine has been elaborated in four different ways in the history of Ismailism. We first meet a gnostic thesis where evil is the result of a rebellion in the intelligible world; second, there is a Neoplatonic thesis where evil and imperfection are caused by the process of emanation itself; and third, we distinguish a philosophical thesis where the generation of evil by "second intention" belongs to the rule of divine providence. Finally, Tayyibi authors in the 12th century made a synthesis of the three positions.

TI  - Accuracy of Copernicus Altimeter Water Level Data in Italian Rivers Accounting for Narrow River Sections
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Information about water level is essential for hydrological monitoring and flood/drought risk assessment. In a large part of Italian river network, in situ instruments for measuring water level are rare or lacking. Here we consider the satellite measurements of water level retrieved by Copernicus altimetric missions (Sentinel 3A, Sentinel 3B, Jason 2/3), and compare these with in situ data, from 19 gauging stations in Italy with a river section in the range of [50, 555] m. The results highlight the potentiality of altimetric satellite measurements for water level retrieval in a case study of Italian rivers. By comparing synchronous satellite and in situ water level difference (i.e., difference between two successive measurements in time of satellite data compared to the difference of two successive measurements in time of in situ data), we found a median value of Pearson correlation of 0.79 and 0.37 m of RMSE. Then, from water level differences, we extracted the satellite water level values with two different procedures: (1) assuming as the initial water level of the satellite measurements the first joint measurement (satellite-in situ data) and (2) calibrating the initial water level, minimizing the mean absolute error metric. The results show the feasibility of using satellite data for water level retrieval in an operative and automatic perspective.

TI  - First Results on Wake Detection in SAR Images by Deep Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) represents a powerful source of data for enhancing maritime domain awareness (MDA). Wakes generated by traveling vessels hold a crucial role in MDA since they can be exploited both for ship route and velocity estimation and as a marker of ship presence. Even if deep learning (DL) has led to an impressive performance boost on a variety of computer vision tasks, its usage for automatic target recognition (ATR) in SAR images to support MDA is still limited to the detection of ships rather than ship wakes. A dataset is presented in this paper and several state-of-the-art object detectors based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are tested with different backbones. The dataset, including more than 250 wake chips, is realized by visually inspecting Sentinel-1 images over highly trafficked maritime sites. Extensive experiments are shown to characterize CNNs for the wake detection task. For the first time, a deep-learning approach is implemented to specifically detect ship wakes without any a-priori knowledge or cuing about the location of the vessel that generated the wake. No annotated dataset was available to train deep-learning detectors on this task, which is instead presented in this paper. Moreover, the benchmarks achieved for different detectors point out promising features and weak points of the relevant approaches. Thus, the work also aims at stimulating more research in this promising, but still under-investigated, field.

TI  - Surviving a natural disaster as a semiotic reformation of the self and worldview
T2  - SEMIOTICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Theoretically, this study is framed within the semiotic tradition of communication theory, which theorizes communication as the intersubjective mediation by signs. Methodologically, this study is guided by Peirce's semiotic ideas, especially his writing about the commens and commind, or the sign and the object, and the power of a community (constitutive of the self as researcher and the self as one with participants) as the final interpretant performing the process of sensemaking. Results showed how the survivors of a natural calamity symbolically interacted with such calamity, and how this led to a reformation of the way they view themselves and the world. The survivors' symbolic images captured in narratives, in sketches and drawings, and in poetry helped them to reframe their sense of self and their worldview by believing in common sense and intuition, and by valuing the power of courage, initiative, preparedness, hope, and resilience. An unfortunate irony emerged in their symbolic interaction with the disaster such that their sinning and self-inflicted blame made them think they were worthy of punishment. Nonetheless, this unfortunate irony will change if the survivors continue to reflect on their civic roles, interrogate their environmental and political contexts, and expand their awareness and social consciousness. As these unfold, the survivors will be able to accomplish empowerment, emancipation, and an independent mind.

TI  - Evolution of Deep-Seated Gravitational Slope Deformations in Relation with Uplift and Fluvial Capture Processes in Central Eastern Sardinia (Italy)
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Connections between Plio-Pleistocenic tectonic activity and geomorphological evolution were studied in the Pardu Valley and Quirra Valley (Ogliastra, East Sardinia). The intensive Quaternary tectonic activity in Sardinia linked to the opening of the Tyrrhenian Basin is known. In Eastern Sardinia, it manifests with an uplift that is recorded by geomorphological indicators, such as deep-seated gravitational slope deformation, fluvial captures, engraved valleys, waterfalls, and heterogeneous water drainage. The Pardu River flows from the NW toward the SE and then abruptly changes direction toward the NE. At this point, a capture elbow adjacent to the current head of the Quirra River is well developed. The Quirra River, in its upstream part, flows at altitudes approximately 200 m higher than the Pardu River. It also shows an oversized and over-flooded valley with respect to the catchment area upstream. This setting indicates that the Pardu River, which previously flowed south along the Quirra River, was captured by the Pelau River. We analyzed long-term landslides with lateral spreading and sackung characteristics, which involve giant carbonate blocks and underlying foliated metamorphites in both valleys. The use of LiDAR, high-resolution uncrewed aerial vehicle digital photogrammetry (UAV-DP), and geological, structural, and geomorphological surveys enabled a depth morphometric analysis and the creation of interpretative 3D models of DGSDs. Space-borne interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data using ERS and Sentinel-1 satellites identified downslope movement of up to 20 mm per year in both Pardu Valley flanks. Multi-source and multi-scale data showed that the state of activity of the DGSDs is closely linked to the geomorphological evolution of the catchment areas of the Rio Pardu and Rio Quirra. The intense post-capture erosion acted in the Rio Pardu Valley, giving it morphometric characteristics that were favorable to the current evolution of the DGSDs, while the Rio Quirra Valley presents paleo-DGSDs that have been fossilized by pre-capture terraced alluvial deposits.

TI  - Impact of Monovalent Rotavirus Vaccine on Rotavirus Hospitalizations among Children Younger Than 5 Years of Age in the Ouest and Artibonite Departments, Haiti, 2013 to 2019
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rotavirus is responsible for 26% of diarrheal deaths in Latin America and the Caribbean. Haiti introduced the monovalent rotavirus vaccine in April 2014. The objective of this analysis is to describe the impact of the rotavirus vaccine on hospitalizations among Haitian children younger than 5 years old during the first 5 years after introduction. This analysis includes all children with diarrhea who were enrolled as part of a sentinel surveillance system at two hospitals from May 2013 to April 2019. We compare the proportion of rotavirus-positive specimens in each post-vaccine introduction year to the pre-vaccine period. To account for the potential dilution of the proportion of rotavirus-positive specimens from a waning cholera outbreak, we also analyzed annual trends in the absolute number of positive stools, fit a two-component finite mixture model to the negative specimens, and fit a negative binomial time series model to the pre-vaccine rotavirus-positive specimens to predict the number of rotavirus diarrhea hospital admissions in the absence of rotavirus vaccination. The overall percentage of rotavirus-positive specimens declined by 22% the first year after introduction, increased by 17% the second year, and declined by 33% to 50% the subsequent 3 years. All sensitivity analyses confirmed an overall decline. We observed a clear annual rotavirus seasonality before and after vaccine introduction, with the greatest activity in December through April, and a biennial pattern, with high sharp peaks and flatter longer periods of increased rotavirus activity in alternating years, consistent with suboptimal vaccination coverage. Overall, our study shows evidence that the introduction of the rotavirus vaccine reduced the burden of severe rotavirus diarrhea.

TI  - Unsupervised Classification of Crop Growth Stages with Scattering Parameters from Dual-Pol Sentinel-1 SAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global crop mapping and monitoring requires high-resolution spatio-temporal information. In this regard, dual polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors provide high temporal and high spatial resolutions with large swath width. Generally, crop phenological development studies utilized SAR backscatter intensity-based descriptors. However, these descriptors are derived either from the covariance matrix elements or from the eigendecomposition. Therefore, this approach fails to utilize the complete polarization information of the scattered wave. In this study, we propose a target characterization parameter, theta(xP) that utilizes the 2D Barakat degree of polarization and the elements of the covariance matrix. We also propose an unsupervised clustering scheme using theta(xP) and the scattering entropy, HxP. We utilize time-series Sentinel-1 data of canola and wheat fields over a Canadian test site to show the sensitivity of theta(xp) to the development of crop morphology at different phenological stages. During the initial growth stages, theta(xP) values are low due to the low vegetation density. In contrast, at advanced phenological stages, we observe decreased values of theta(xP) due to the appearance of complex canopy structure. Similarly, the effectiveness of the unsupervised HxP/theta(xP) clustering plane is also evident from the temporal clustering plots. This innovative clustering framework is beneficial for the operational use of Sentinel-1 SAR data for agricultural applications.

TI  - TWIST-GAN: TowardsWavelet Transform and Transferred GAN for Spatio-Temporal Single Image Super Resolution
T2  - ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Single Image Super-resolution (SISR) produces high-resolution imageswith fine spatial resolutions from a remotely sensed image with low spatial resolution. Recently, deep learning and generative adversarial networks (GANs) have made breakthroughs for the challenging task of single image super-resolution (SISR). However, the generated image still suffers from undesirable artifacts such as the absence of texture-feature representation and high-frequency information. We propose a frequency domain-based spatio-temporal remote sensing single image super-resolution technique to reconstruct the HR image combined with generative adversarial networks (GANs) on various frequency bands (TWIST-GAN). We have introduced a new method incorporating Wavelet Transform (WT) characteristics and transferred generative adversarial network. The LR image has been split into various frequency bands by using the WT, whereas the transfer generative adversarial network predicts high-frequency components via a proposed architecture. Finally, the inverse transfer of wavelets produces a reconstructed image with super-resolution. The model is first trained on an external DIV2 K dataset and validated with the UC Merced Landsat remote sensing dataset and Set14 with each image size of 256 x 256. Following that, transferred GANs are used to process spatio-temporal remote sensing images in order to minimize computation cost differences and improve texture information. The findings are compared qualitatively and qualitatively with the current state-of-art approaches. In addition, we saved about 43% of the GPU memory during training and accelerated the execution of our simplified version by eliminating batch normalization layers.

TI  - Environmental Strain on Beach Environments Retrieved and Monitored by Spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental effects and climate change are lately representing an increasing strain on coastal areas, whose topography strongly depends on these conditions. However, the processes by which weather and environmental phenomena influence the highly variable beach morphology are still unknown. Continuous monitoring of the beach environment is necessary to implement protection strategies. This paper presents the results of an innovative study performed on a coastal area using satellite remote sensing data with the aim of understanding how environmental phenomena affect beaches. Two years of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) Sentinel-1 images are used over a test area in Noordwijk, the Netherlands. At the same time as the SAR acquisitions, information on tidal and weather conditions are collected and integrated from nearby meteorological stations. Dedicated codes are implemented in order to understand the relationship between the SAR amplitude and the considered phenomena: wind, precipitation, and tidal conditions. Surface roughness is taken into account. The results indicate a strong correlation between the amplitude and the wind. No particular correlation or trend could be noticed in the relationship with precipitation. The analysis of the amplitude also shows a decreasing trend moving from the dry area of the beach towards the sea and the correlation coefficient between the amplitude and the tide level gets negative with the increase of the water content.

TI  - Land Surface Temperature Retrieval Using High-Resolution Vertical Profiles Simulated by WRF Model
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - This work gives a first insight into the potential of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to provide high-resolution vertical profiles for land surface temperature (LST) retrieval from thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing. WRF numerical simulations were conducted to downscale NCEP Climate Forecast System Version 2 (CFSv2) reanalysis profiles, using two nested grids with horizontal resolutions of 12 km (G12) and 3 km (G03). We investigated the utility of these profiles for the atmospheric correction of TIR data and LST estimation, using the moderate resolution atmospheric transmission (MODTRAN) model and the Landsat 8 TIRS10 band. The accuracy evaluation was performed using 27 clear-sky cases over a radiosonde station in Southern Brazil. We included in the comparative analysis NASA's Atmospheric Correction Parameter Calculator (ACPC) web-tool and profiles obtained directly from the NCEP CFSv2 reanalysis. The atmospheric parameters from ACPC, followed by those from CFSv2, were in better agreement with parameters calculated using in situ radiosondes. When applied into the radiative transfer equation (RTE) to retrieve LST, the best results (RMSE) were, in descending order: CFSv2 (0.55 K), ACPC (0.56 K), WRF G12 (0.79 K), and WRF G03 (0.82 K). Our findings suggest that there is no special need to increase the horizontal resolution of reanalysis profiles aiming at RTE-based LST retrieval. However, the WRF results were still satisfactory and promising, encouraging further assessments. We endorse the use of the well-known ACPC and recommend the NCEP CFSv2 profiles for TIR atmospheric correction and LST single-channel retrieval.

TI  - TiO<sub>2</sub>-Zeolite Metal Composites for Photocatalytic Degradation of Organic Pollutants in Water
T2  - CATALYSTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Immobilization of photocatalysts in porous materials is an approach to significantly minimize the hazards of manipulation and recovery of nanoparticles. Inorganic materials, such as zeolites, are proposed as promising materials for photocatalyst immobilization mainly due to their photochemical stability. In this work, a green synthesis method is proposed to combine TiO2-based photocatalysts with commercial ZY zeolite. Moreover, a preliminary analysis of their performance as photocatalysts for the abatement of organic pollutants in waters was performed. Our results show that the physical mixture of TiO2 and zeolite maintains photocatalytic activity. Meanwhile, composites fabricated by doping TiO2-zeolite Y materials with silver and palladium nanoparticles do not contribute to improving the photocatalytic activity beyond that of TiO2.

TI  - Corrosion Behavior of Chromium Coated Zy-4 Cladding under CANDU Primary Circuit Conditions
T2  - COATINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - The manuscript is focused on corrosion behavior of a Cr coating under CANada Deuterium Uranium(CANDU) primary circuit conditions. The Cr coating is obtained via the thermionic vacuum arc procedure on Zircaloy -4 cladding. The surface coating characterization was performed using metallographic analysis and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with an energy dispersive spectra detector (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) investigations. The thickness of the Cr coating determined from SEM images is around 500 nm layers After the autoclaving period, the thickness of the samples increased in time slowly. The kinetic of oxidation established a logarithmic oxidation law. The corrosion tests for various autoclaving periods of time include electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and potentiodynamic tests, permitting computing porosity and efficiency of protection. All surface investigations sustain electrochemical results and promote the Cr coating on Zircaloy-4 alloy autoclaved for 3024 h as the best corrosion resistance based on decrease in corrosion current density values simultaneously with the increase of the time spent in autoclave. A slow increase of Vickers micro hardness was observed as a function of the autoclaved period as well. The value reached for 3024 h being 219 Kgf/mm(2) compared with 210 Kgf/mm(2) value before autoclaving.

TI  - Characterizing Leaf Nutrients ofWetland Plants and Agricultural Crops with Nonparametric Approach Using Sentinel-2 Imagery Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In arid environments of the world, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, floodplain wetlands are a valuable agricultural resource. However, the water reticulation role by wetlands and crop production can negatively impact wetland plants. Knowledge on the foliar biochemical elements of wetland plants enhances understanding of the impacts of agricultural practices in wetlands. This study thus used Sentinel-2 multispectral data to predict seasonal variations in the concentrations of nine foliar biochemical elements in plant leaves of key floodplain wetland vegetation types and crops in the uMfolozi floodplain system (UFS). Nutrient concentrations in different floodplain plant species were estimated using Sentinel-2 multispectral data derived vegetation indices in concert with the random forest regression. The results showed a mean R-2 of 0.87 and 0.86 for the dry winter and wet summer seasons, respectively. However, copper, sulphur, and magnesium were poorly correlated (R-2 <= 0.5) with vegetation indices during the summer season. The average % relative root mean square errors (RMSE's) for seasonal nutrient estimation accuracies for crops and wetland vegetation were 15.2 % and 26.8%, respectively. There was a significant difference in nutrient concentrations between the two plant types, (R-2 = 0.94 (crops), R-2 = 0.84 (vegetation). The red-edge position 1 (REP1) and the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) were the best nutrient predictors. These results demonstrate the usefulness of Sentinel-2 imagery and random forests regression in predicting seasonal, nutrient concentrations as well as the accumulation of chemicals in wetland vegetation and crops.

M3  - Article
AB  - This work, in its general objective, is based on promoting discussions about Onomastics (specifically Toponymy) and the teaching of the Portuguese language, mainly regarding etymological, semantic and morphological aspects, trying to promote, through the concepts and procedures of toponymic research, the intersection between lexicon, history, culture and teaching. It is, therefore, a lexical (onomastic-toponymic), historical-cultural, and pedagogical study. This research is based on the following guiding question: how can the study of place names contribute to the expansion of the range of linguistic, etymological, geohistorical and sociocultural information in the pedagogical practice of teaching Portuguese in Basic Education? The methodological procedures of the research will be based on the methodological principles of bibliographic research, and the qualitative approach will be adopted as the appropriate heuristic treatment to theoretically and methodologically construct the meanings that the present study is about.. The study allowed visualizing, essentially, the toponymic study as an extensive source, as living spaces of history, culture and identity, since the studies of place names express an effective appropriation of space by cultural groups and, in this way, it is possible to become aware of the worldview of certain peoples and the many stories involved in the choice of names.

Data can be processed, combined and analyzed in such a way that can contribute to suggest a protocol of action to help recover devastated areas. The objective of this paper is to describe methods to evaluate the surface burned in a forest fire. Combining the information recorded by the visible and infrared sensors of the Landsat 8 satellite, we can estimate the temperature of the surface after the wildfire. Finally, by comparing images recorded before and after the fire, we can estimate the surface burned.

TI  - Mitigating Atmospheric Effects in InSAR Stacking Based on Ensemble Forecasting with a Numerical Weather Prediction Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technique is widely utilized to measure ground-surface displacement. One of the main limitations of the measurements is the atmospheric phase delay effects. For satellites with shorter wavelengths, the atmospheric delay mainly consists of the tropospheric delay influenced by temperature, pressure, and water vapor. Tropospheric delay can be calculated using numerical weather prediction (NWP) model at the same moment as synthetic aperture radar (SAR) acquisition. Scientific researchers mainly use ensemble forecasting to produce better forecasts and analyze the uncertainties caused by physic parameterizations. In this study, we simulated the relevant meteorological parameters using the ensemble scheme of the stochastic physic perturbation tendency (SPPT) based on the weather research forecasting (WRF) model, which is one of the most broadly used NWP models. We selected an area in Foshan, Guangdong Province, in the southeast of China, and calculated the corresponding atmospheric delay. InSAR images were computed through data from the Sentinel-1A satellite and mitigated by the ensemble mean of the WRF-SPPT results. The WRF-SPPT method improves the mitigating effect more than WRF simulation without ensemble forecasting. The atmospherically corrected InSAR phases were used in the stacking process to estimate the linear deformation rate in the experimental area. The root mean square errors (RMSE) of the deformation rate without correction, with WRF-only correction, and with WRF-SPPT correction were calculated, indicating that ensemble forecasting can significantly reduce the atmospheric delay in stacking. In addition, the ensemble forecasting based on a combination of initial uncertainties and stochastic physic perturbation tendencies showed better correction performance compared with the ensemble forecasting generated by a set of perturbed initial conditions without considering the model's uncertainties.

TI  - Dead Fuel Moisture Content (DFMC) Estimation Using MODIS and Meteorological Data: The Case of Greece
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The frequent occurrence of large and high-intensity wildfires in the Mediterranean region poses a major threat to people and the environment. In this context, the estimation of dead fine fuel moisture content (DFMC) has become an integrated part of wildfire management since it provides valuable information for the flammability status of the vegetation. This study investigates the effectiveness of a physically based fuel moisture model in estimating DFMC during severe fire events in Greece. Our analysis considers two approaches, the satellite-based (MODIS DFMC model) and the weather station-based (AWSs DFMC model) approach, using a fuel moisture model which is based on the relationship between the fuel moisture of the fine fuels and the water vapor pressure deficit (D). During the analysis we used weather station data and MODIS satellite data from fourteen wildfires in Greece. Due to the lack of field measurements, the models' performance was assessed only in the case of the satellite data by using weather observations obtained from the network of automated weather stations operated by the National Observatory of Athens (NOA). Results show that, in general, the satellite-based model achieved satisfactory accuracy in estimating the spatial distribution of the DFMC during the examined fire events. More specifically, the validation of the satellite-derived DFMC against the weather-station based DFMC indicated that, in all cases examined, the MODIS DFMC model tended to underestimate DFMC, with MBE ranging from -0.3% to -7.3%. Moreover, in all of the cases examined, apart from one (Sartis' fire case, MAE: 8.2%), the MAE of the MODIS DFMC model was less than 2.2%. The remaining numerical results align with the existing literature, except for the MAE case of 8.2%. The good performance of the satellite based DFMC model indicates that the estimation of DFMC is feasible at various spatial scales in Greece. Presently, the main drawback of this approach is the occurrence of data gaps in the MODIS satellite imagery. The examination and comparison of the two approaches, regarding their operational use, indicates that the weather station-based approach meets the requirements for operational DFMC mapping to a higher degree compared to the satellite-based approach.

TI  - A New Lightweight Convolutional Neural Network for Multi-Scale Land Surface Water Extraction from GaoFen-1D Satellite Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping land surface water automatically and accurately is closely related to human activity, biological reproduction, and the ecological environment. High spatial resolution remote sensing image (HSRRSI) data provide extensive details for land surface water and gives reliable data support for the accurate extraction of land surface water information. The convolutional neural network (CNN), widely applied in semantic segmentation, provides an automatic extraction method in land surface water information. This paper proposes a new lightweight CNN named Lightweight Multi-Scale Land Surface Water Extraction Network (LMSWENet) to extract the land surface water information based on GaoFen-1D satellite data of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. To verify the superiority of LMSWENet, we compared the efficiency and water extraction accuracy with four mainstream CNNs (DeeplabV3+, FCN, PSPNet, and UNet) using quantitative comparison and visual comparison. Furthermore, we used LMSWENet to extract land surface water information of Wuhan on a large scale and produced the land surface water map of Wuhan for 2020 (LSWMWH-2020) with 2m spatial resolution. Random and equidistant validation points verified the mapping accuracy of LSWMWH-2020. The results are summarized as follows: (1) Compared with the other four CNNs, LMSWENet has a lightweight structure, significantly reducing the algorithm complexity and training time. (2) LMSWENet has a good performance in extracting various types of water bodies and suppressing noises because it introduces channel and spatial attention mechanisms and combines features from multiple scales. The result of land surface water extraction demonstrates that the performance of LMSWENet exceeds that of the other four CNNs. (3) LMSWENet can meet the requirement of high-precision mapping on a large scale. LSWMWH-2020 can clearly show the significant lakes, river networks, and small ponds in Wuhan with high mapping accuracy.

TI  - Estimating Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) over Rice-Wheat-Rotation Croplands by Using the Random Forest Model and Eddy Covariance Measurements: Upscaling and Comparison with the MODIS Product
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite advances in remote sensing-based gross primary productivity (GPP) modeling, the calibration of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) GPP product (GPP(MOD)) is less well understood over rice-wheat-rotation cropland. To improve the performance of GPP(MOD), a random forest (RF) machine learning model was constructed and employed over the rice-wheat double-cropping fields of eastern China. The RF-derived GPP (GPP(RF)) agreed well with the eddy covariance (EC)-derived GPP (GPP(EC)), with a coefficient of determination of 0.99 and a root-mean-square error of 0.42 g C m(-2) d(-1). Therefore, it was deemed reliable to upscale GPP(EC) to regional scales through the RF model. The upscaled cumulative seasonal GPP(RF) was higher for rice (924 g C m(-2)) than that for wheat (532 g C m(-2)). By comparing GPP(MOD) and GPP(EC), we found that GPP(MOD) performed well during the crop rotation periods but underestimated GPP during the rice/wheat active growth seasons. Furthermore, GPP(MOD) was calibrated by GPP(RF), and the error range of GPP(MOD) (GPP(RF) minus GPP(MOD)) was found to be 2.5-3.25 g C m(-2) d(-1) for rice and 0.75-1.25 g C m(-2) d(-1) for wheat. Our findings suggest that RF-based GPP products have the potential to be applied in accurately evaluating MODIS-based agroecosystem carbon cycles at regional or even global scales.

TI  - Comparison of Traditional Method and Triple Collocation Analysis for Evaluation of Multiple Gridded Precipitation Products across Germany
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaluating the accuracy of precipitation products is essential for many applications. The traditional method for evaluation is to calculate error metrics of products with gauge measurements that are considered as ground truth. The multiplicative triple collocation (MTC) method has been demonstrated powerful in error quantification of precipitation products when ground truth is not known. This study applied MTC to evaluate five precipitation products in Germany: two raw satellite-based products (CMORPH and PERSIANN), one reanalysis product (ERA-Interim), one soil moisture-based product (SM2RAIN-ASCAT), and one gauge-based product (REGNIE). Evaluation was performed at the 0.5 degrees daily spatial-temporal scales. MTC involves a log transformation of data, necessitating dealing with zero values in daily precipitation. Effects of 12 different strategies for dealing with zero values on MTC results were investigated. Seven different triplet combinations were tested to evaluate the stability of MTC. Results showed that different strategies for replacing zero values had considerable effects on MTC-derived error metrics, particularly for root-mean-square error (RMSE). MTC with different triplet combinations generated different error metrics for individual products. The MTC-derived correlation coefficient (CC) was more reliable than RMSE. It is more appropriate to use MTC to compare the relative accuracy of different precipitation products. Based on CC with unknown truth, MTC with different triplet combinations produced the same ranking of products as the traditional method. A comparison of results from MTC and the classic TC with additive error model showed the potential limitation of MTC in arid areas or dry time periods with a large ratio of zero daily precipitation.

TI  - Demarcation of Coastal Dune Morphology and Dune Patterns using Geospatial Models: A Case Study from Manapad Coastal Stretch, Tamil Nadu, South India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal sand dunes are the dynamic depositional landform which are formed near the coast, due to aeolian activity. Coastal sand dune acts as a natural barrier against coastal erosion hence its periodic monitoring is essential. Modification of this landform due to anthropogenic activities was observed in the coastal stretch towards the south of Tamil Nadu, even though these dune ecosystems were meant to be conserved and preserved in the coastal zone regulation notification. Present study, focuses on finding key techniques required to demarcate the morphological parameters such as ridge line, crest portion, toe, dune orientation, and its pattern from the open source ALOS World 3D (AW3D) DEM for periodic monitoring of coastal dune ecosystems. Topographic models such as hill shading, slope, aspect, curvature, and hybrid techniques were performed. The outcomes obtained from topographic models were validated with spatial profiling and field survey. From the study it is observed that, hybrid techniques particularly slope overlaid on hill shade, slope, gaussian stretched hill shade image, and spatial profiling are the key techniques to bring out the morphological variations and the parabolic dune patterns, which were hitherto not reported in earlier literatures. Gaussian stretched hill shade image enhanced the micro landforms which were difficult to extract from normal hill shading. The slope image of the study is found to be more informative in exhibiting the minor dunes and patterns compared to shaded relief image. The ridge portion of the dune, crest and limb portion and coastal plains were differentiated based on the slope value ranges. The hybrid image formed by overlaying slope and curvature data on hill-shaded image is more informative in providing most of the parabolic patterns formed by micro and meso scale dunes. Spatial profile could be used as an additional tool to validate the information's derived from topographic models, wherever there is limitation in field accessibility.

TI  - Automatic Detection of Subsidence Troughs in SAR Interferograms Using Mathematical Morphology
T2  - ENERGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, an automatic algorithm for the detection of subsidence areas in SAR interferograms is proposed. It is based on the analysis of spatial distribution of the interferogram phase, and its coherence and entropy. The developed method was tested for differential interferograms generated on the basis of Sentinel-1 SAR images covering mining areas in South Poland. The obtained results were compared with those achieved using a method based on circular Gabor filters. Performed analysis revealed that the detection rate for the proposed method varied from 34% to 83%. It is an improved method based on Gabor filters that achieved a detection rate from 30% to 53%.

TI  - Integration of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Data with the G-SMOTE Technique for Boosting Land Cover Classification Accuracy
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The importance of Land Cover (LC) classification is recognized by an increasing number of scholars who employ LC information in various applications (i.e., address global climate change and achieve sustainable development). However, studying the roles of balancing data, image integration, and performance of different machine learning algorithms in various landscapes has not received as much attention from scientists. Therefore, the present study investigates the performance of three frequently used Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, including Extreme Learning Machines (ELM), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) in LC mapping at six different landscapes. Moreover, the Geometric Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (G-SMOTE) was adopted to deal with the class imbalance problem. In this work, the time-series of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data were integrated to improve LC mapping accuracy, taking advantage of both data. Moreover, Support Vector Machine-Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) was implemented to distinguish the most informative features. Based on the results, the RF integrated with G-SMOTE showed the best result for four landscapes (coastal, cropland, desert, and semi-arid). SVM integrated with G-SMOTE had the highest accuracy in the remaining two landscapes (plain and mountain). Applied ML algorithms showed good performances in various landscapes, ranging Overall Accuracy (OA) from 85% to 93% for RF, 83% to 94% for SVM, and 84% to 92% for ELM. The outcomes exhibit that although applying G-SMOTE may slightly decrease OA values, it generally boosts the results of LC classification accuracies in various landscapes, particularly for minority classes.

TI  - Monitoring Rainfed Alfalfa Growth in Semiarid Agrosystems Using Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the utility of Sentinel-2 images in the monitoring of the fractional vegetation cover (FVC) of rainfed alfalfa in semiarid areas such as that of Bardenas Reales in Spain. FVC was sampled in situ using 1 m(2) surfaces at 172 points inside 18 alfalfa fields from late spring to early summer in 2017 and 2018. Different vegetation indices derived from a series of Sentinel-2 images were calculated and were then correlated with the FVC measurements at the pixel and parcel levels using different types of equations. The results indicate that the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and FVC were highly correlated at the parcel level (R-2 = 0.712), whereas the correlation at the pixel level remained moderate across each of the years studied. Based on the findings, another 29 alfalfa plots (28 rainfed; 1 irrigated) were remotely monitored operationally for 3 years (2017-2019), revealing that location and weather conditions were strong determinants of alfalfa growth in Bardenas Reales. The results of this study indicate that Sentinel-2 imagery is a suitable tool for monitoring rainfed alfalfa pastures in semiarid areas, thus increasing the potential success of pasture management.

TI  - Assessment of Agricultural Water Requirements for Semi-Arid Areas: A Case Study of the Boufakrane River Watershed (Morocco)
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - This work was undertaken to develop a low-cost but reliable assessment method for agricultural water requirements in semi-arid locations based on remote sensing data/techniques. In semi-arid locations, water resources are often limited, and long-term water consumption may exceed the natural replenishment rates of groundwater reservoirs. Sustainable land management in these locations must include tools that facilitate assessment of the impact of potential future land use changes. Agricultural practices in the Boufakrane River watershed (Morocco) were used as a case study application. Land use practices were mapped at the thematic resolution of individual crops, using a total of 13 images generated from the Sentinel-2 satellites. Using a supervised classification scheme, crop types were identified as cereals, other crops followed by cereals, vegetables, olive trees, and fruit trees. Two classifiers were used, namely Support vector machine (SVM) and Random forest (RF). A validation of the classified parcels showed a high overall accuracy of 89.76% for SVM and 84.03% for RF. Results showed that cereal is the most represented species, covering 8870.43 ha and representing 52.42% of the total area, followed by olive trees with 4323.18 ha and a coverage rate of 25%. Vegetables and other crops followed by cereals cover 1530.06 ha and 1661.45 ha, respectively, representing 9.4% and 9.8% of the total area. In the last rank, fruit trees occupy only 3.67% of the total area, with 621.06 ha. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) free software was used to overlay satellite data images with those of climate for agricultural water resources management in the region. This process facilitated estimations of irrigation water requirements for all crop types, taking into account total potential evapotranspiration, effective rainfall, and irrigation water requirements. Results showed that olive trees, fruit trees, and other crops followed by cereals are the most water demanding, with irrigation requirements exceeding 500 mm. The irrigation requirements of cereals and vegetables are lower than those of other classes, with amounts of 300 mm and 150 mm, respectively.

TI  - Assessing the Vertical Displacement of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam during Its Filling Using DInSAR Technology and Its Potential Acute Consequences on the Downstream Countries
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), formerly known as the Millennium Dam, is currently under construction and has been filling at a fast rate without sufficient known analysis on possible impacts on the body of the structure. The filling of GERD not only has an impact on the Blue Nile Basin hydrology, water storage and flow but also poses massive risks in case of collapse. Rosaries Dam located in Sudan at only 116 km downstream of GERD, along with the 20 million Sudanese benefiting from that dam, would be seriously threatened in case of the collapse of GERD. In this study, through the analysis of Sentinal-1 satellite imagery, we show concerning deformation patterns associated with different sections of the GERD's Main Dam (structure RCC Dam type) and the Saddle Dam (Embankment Dam type). We processed 109 descending mode scenes from Sentinel-1 SAR imagery, from December 2016 to July 2021, using the Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry technique to demonstrate the deformation trends of both-the GERD's Main and Saddle Dams. The time series generated from the analysis clearly indicates different displacement trends at various sections of the GERD as well as the Saddle Dam. Results of the multi-temporal data analysis on and around the project area show inconsistent subsidence at the extremities of the GERD Main Dam, especially the west side of the dam where we recorded varying displacements in the range of 10 mm to 90 mm at the crest of the dam. We conducted the current analysis after masking the images with a coherence value of 0.9 and hence, the subsequent results are extremely reliable and accurate. Further decomposition of the subsiding rate has revealed higher vertical displacement over the west side of the GERD's Main Dam as compared to the east side. The local geological structures consisting of weak zones under the GERD's accompanying Saddle Dam adds further instability to its structure. We identified seven critical nodes on the Saddle Dam that match the tectonic faults lying underneath it, and which display a varying degree of vertical displacements. In fact, the nodes located next to each other displayed varying displacement trends: one or more nodes displayed subsidence since 2017 while the other node in the same section displayed uplift. The geological weak zones underneath and the weight of the Saddle Dam itself may somewhat explain this inconsistency and the non-uniform vertical displacements. For the most affected cells, we observed a total displacement value of ~90 mm during the whole study period (~20 mm/year) for the Main Dam while the value of the total displacement for the Saddle dam is ~380 mm during the same period (~85 mm/year). Analysis through CoastSat tool also suggested a non-uniformity in trends of surface water-edge at the two extremities of the Main Dam.

TI  - Assessment of Water Quality in Lake Qaroun Using Ground-Based Remote Sensing Data and Artificial Neural Networks
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring and managing water quality parameters (WQPs) in water bodies (e.g., lakes) on a large scale using sampling-point techniques is tedious, laborious, and not highly representative. Hyperspectral and data-driven technology have provided a potentially valuable tool for the precise measurement of WQPs. Therefore, the objective of this work was to integrate WQPs, derived spectral reflectance indices (published spectral reflectance indices (PSRIs)), newly two-band spectral reflectance indices (NSRIs-2b) and newly three-band spectral indices (NSRIs-3b), and artificial neural networks (ANNs) for estimating WQPs in Lake Qaroun. Shipboard cruises were conducted to collect surface water samples at 16 different sites throughout Lake Qaroun throughout a two-year study (2018 and 2019). Different WQPs, such as total nitrogen (TN), ammonium (NH4+), orthophosphate (PO43-), and chemical oxygen demand (COD), were evaluated for aquatic use. The results showed that the highest determination coefficients were recorded with the NSRIs-3b, followed by the NSRIs-2b, and then followed by the PSRIs, which produced lower R-2 with all tested WQPs. The majority of NSRIs-3bs demonstrated strong significant relationships with three WQPs (TN, NH4+, and PO43-) with (R-2 = 0.70 to 0.77), and a moderate relationship with COD (R-2 = 0.52 to 0.64). The SRIs integrated with ANNs would be an efficient tool for estimating the investigated four WQPs in both calibration and validation datasets with acceptable accuracy. For examples, the five features of the SRIs involved in this model are of great significance for predicting TN. Its outputs showed high R-2 values of 0.92 and 0.84 for calibration and validation, respectively. The ANN-PO43-VI-17 was the highest accuracy model for predicting PO43- with R-2 = 0.98 and 0.89 for calibration and validation, respectively. In conclusion, this research study demonstrated that NSRIs-3b, alongside a combined approach of ANNs models and SRIs, would be an effective tool for assessing WQPs of Lake Qaroun.

TI  - Magnetometer-Guided Sentinel Lymph Node Dissection in Prostate Cancer: Rate of Lymph Node Involvement Compared with Radioisotope Marking
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary: Pelvic lymph node dissection is recommended in prostate cancer according to the patients' individual risk for nodal metastases. Targeted removal of sentinel lymph nodes increases the number of detected lymph node metastases in patients with prostate cancer. We previously established magnetometer-guided sentinel lymph node dissection in patients with prostate cancer to overcome logistical and technical disadvantages associated with the standard radioisotope-guided technique. This retrospective study compared the magnetometer-guided and standard techniques in terms of their ability to detect lymph node metastases. Using the magnetometer-guided technique, more sentinel lymph nodes were detected per patient. The detected rates of lymph node involvement matched the predictions in both techniques equally well. Our findings confirm the reliability of magnetometer-guided sentinel lymph node dissection and highlight the importance of the sentinel technique for detecting lymph node metastases in prostate cancer.Sentinel pelvic lymph node dissection (sPLND) enables the targeted removal of lymph nodes (LNs) bearing the highest metastasis risk. In prostate cancer (PCa), sPLND alone or combined with extended PLND (ePLND) reveals more LN metastases along with detecting sentinel LNs (SLNs) outside the conventional ePLND template. To overcome the disadvantages of radioisotope-guided sPLND in PCa treatment, magnetometer-guided sPLND applying superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles as a tracer was established. This retrospective study compared the nodal staging ability between magnetometer- and radioisotope-guided sPLNDs. We analyzed data of PCa patients undergoing radical prostatectomy and magnetometer- (848 patients, 2015-2021) or radioisotope-guided (2092 patients, 2006-2015) sPLND. To reduce heterogeneity among cohorts, we performed propensity score matching and compared data considering sentinel nomogram-based probabilities for LN involvement (LNI). Magnetometer- and radioisotope-guided sPLNDs had SLN detection rates of 98.12% and 98.09%, respectively; the former detected more SLNs per patient. The LNI rates matched nomogram-based predictions in both techniques equally well. Approximately 7% of LN metastases were detected outside the conventional ePLND template. Thus, we confirmed the reliability of magnetometer-guided sPLND in nodal staging, with results comparable with or better than radioisotope-guided sPLND. Our findings highlight the importance of the sentinel technique for detecting LN metastases in PCa.

TI  - Crop Mapping with Combined Use of European and Chinese Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural landscapes are characterized by diversity and complexity, which makes crop mapping at a regional scale a top priority for different purposes such as administrative decisions and farming management. Project 32194 of the Dragon 4 Program was implemented to meet the requirements of crop mapping, with the specific objective to develop suitable approaches for precise crop mapping with combined uses of European and Chinese high- and medium-resolution satellite images. Two sub-projects were involved in the project. The first was to focus on the use of time series high-resolution satellite data, including Sentinel-2 (S2, European satellite data) and Gaofen-1 (GF-1, Chinese satellite data), due to their similar spectral bands for Earth observation, while the second was to focus on medium-resolution data sources, i.e., the European Project for On-Board Autonomy-Vegetation (PROBA-V) and Chinese Fengyun-3 Medium Resolution Spectral Imager (FY-3 MERSI) satellite data, also due to their similar spectral channels. The approach of the European Space Agency (ESA) Sent2Agri project for crop mapping was adapted in the first sub-project and applied to the Yellow River irrigated district (YERID) of Ningxia in northwest China in order to assess its ability to accurately identify crop types in China. The goal of the second sub-project was to explore the potential of both European and Chinese medium-resolution satellite data for crop assessment in a large area. Methods to handle the data and retrieve the required information for the precise crop mapping were developed in the study, including the adaptation of the ESA approach to GF-1 data and the application of algorithms for classification. A scheme for the validation of the crop mapping was developed in the study. The results of implementing the scheme to the YERID in Ningxia indicated that the overall accuracies of crop mapping with S2 and GF-1 can be high, up to 94-97%, and the mapping had an accuracy of 88% with the PROBA-V and FY3B-MERSI data. The very high accuracy suggests the possibility of precise crop mapping with the combined use of time series high- and medium-resolution satellite data when suitable approaches are chosen to handle the data for the classification of crop types.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Metastasis on Clinically Negative Patients: Preliminary Results of a Machine Learning Model Based on Histopathological Features
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The reported incidence of node metastasis at sentinel lymph node biopsy is generally low, so that the majority of women underwent unnecessary invasive axilla surgery. Although the sentinel lymph node biopsy is time consuming and expensive, it is still the intra-operative exam with the highest performance, but sometimes surgery is achieved without a clear diagnosis and also with possible serious complications. In this work, we developed a machine learning model to predict the sentinel lymph nodes positivity in clinically negative patients. Breast cancer clinical and immunohistochemical features of 907 patients characterized by a clinically negative lymph node status were collected. We trained different machine learning algorithms on the retrospective collected data and selected an optimal subset of features through a sequential forward procedure. We found comparable performances for different classification algorithms: on a hold-out training set, the logistics regression classifier with seven features, i.e., tumor diameter, age, histologic type, grading, multiplicity, in situ component and Her2-neu status reached an AUC value of 71.5% and showed a better trade-off between sensitivity and specificity (69.4 and 66.9%, respectively) compared to other two classifiers. On the hold-out test set, the performance dropped by five percentage points in terms of accuracy. Overall, the histological characteristics alone did not allow us to develop a support tool suitable for actual clinical application, but it showed the maximum informative power contained in the same for the resolution of the clinical problem. The proposed study represents a starting point for future development of predictive models to obtain the probability for lymph node metastases by using histopathological features combined with other features of a different nature.

TI  - Flood Risk Mapping by Remote Sensing Data and Random Forest Technique
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Detecting effective parameters in flood occurrence is one of the most important issues that has drawn more attention in recent years. Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographical Information System (GIS) are two efficient ways to spatially predict Flood Risk Mapping (FRM). In this study, a web-based platform called the Google Earth Engine (GEE) (Google Company, Mountain View, CA, USA) was used to obtain flood risk indices for the Galikesh River basin, Northern Iran. With the aid of Landsat 8 satellite imagery and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation Model (DEM), 11 risk indices (Elevation (El), Slope (Sl), Slope Aspect (SA), Land Use (LU), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), River Distance (RD), Waterway and River Density (WRD), Soil Texture (ST]), and Maximum One-Day Precipitation (M1DP)) were provided. In the next step, all of these indices were imported into ArcMap 10.8 (Esri, West Redlands, CA, USA) software for index normalization and to better visualize the graphical output. Afterward, an intelligent learning machine (Random Forest (RF)), which is a robust data mining technique, was used to compute the importance degree of each index and to obtain the flood hazard map. According to the results, the indices of WRD, RD, M1DP, and El accounted for about 68.27 percent of the total flood risk. Among these indices, the WRD index containing about 23.8 percent of the total risk has the greatest impact on floods. According to FRM mapping, about 21 and 18 percent of the total areas stood at the higher and highest risk areas, respectively.

TI  - Assessing Potential Climatic and Human Pressures in Indonesian Coastal Ecosystems Using a Spatial Data-Driven Approach
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems are key for successful global climate change mitigation; however, they are one of the most threatened ecosystems on Earth. Thus, this study mapped the climatic and human pressures on the blue carbon ecosystems in Indonesia using multi-source spatial datasets. Data on moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) ocean color standard mapped images, VIIRS (visible, infrared imaging radiometer suite) boat detection (VBD), global artificial impervious area (GAIA), MODIS surface reflectance (MOD09GA), MODIS land surface temperature (MOD11A2), and MODIS vegetation indices (MOD13A2) were combined using remote sensing and spatial analysis techniques to identify potential stresses. La Nina and El Nino phenomena caused sea surface temperature deviations to reach -0.5 to +1.2 & DEG;C. In contrast, chlorophyll-a deviations reached 22,121 to +0.5 mg m(-3). Regarding fishing activities, most areas were under exploitation and relatively sustained. Concerning land activities, mangrove deforestation occurred in 560.69 km(2) of the area during 2007-2016, as confirmed by a decrease of 84.9% in risk-screening environmental indicators. Overall, the potential pressures on Indonesia's blue carbon ecosystems are varied geographically. The framework of this study can be efficiently adopted to support coastal and small islands zonation planning, conservation prioritization, and marine fisheries enhancement.

TI  - Machine learning data-driven approaches for land use/cover mapping and trend analysis using Google Earth Engine
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - With the recent advances in earth observation technologies, the increasing availability of data from more and more different satellite sensors as well as progress in semi-automated and automated classification techniques enable the (semi-) automated remote monitoring and analysis of large areas. Online platforms such as Google Earth Engine (GEE) bring data-driven techniques to the desktops of researchers while changing workflows and making excessive data downloads redundant. We present a study that utilizes machine learning algorithms on the GEE cloud computing platform for land use/land cover (LULC) mapping and change detection analysis using a Landsat satellite image time series. We applied different machine learning techniques to data from an environmentally sensitive area in Northern Iran. We tested their efficiency for LULC mapping and change detection analysis using the support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF) and classification and regression tree (CART). We obtained LULC maps for the years 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2020. Training data was collected from field operations and historical datasets, and the respective LULC maps were validated using ground control points. In addition, we validated the reliability of the results through a spatial uncertainty analysis using Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST). The resulting accuracies of the classification outcomes varied significantly. SVM performed best with accuracies of 90.25%, 91.84%, 89.02%, 93.35% and 95.65% for 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2020, respectively. The spatial uncertainty analysis also validated the efficiency of SVM compared to RF and CART. The results confirm the potential of machine learning techniques for time series LULC mapping on the GEE platform while lowering the barriers to analyzing large amounts of satellite data. The results are also critical for decision-makers and authorities for analyzing the LULC changes and developing the respective environmental protection and polices in Northern Iran.

TI  - Habitat Mapping for Ecosystem-Based Management of Deep-Sea Mining
T2  - MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOCIETY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial considerations are important at multiple stages in the development of a deep-sea mining (DSM) project, from resource definition, to identification of preservation and management zones within a contract area, to planning of suitable ecological strata for baseline studies and impact assessment, to mine planning and adaptive management. Large investments are made to collect remote sensing data early in exploration to support geological resource studies, but environmental considerations are often instigated at later stages of exploration and can become disconnected from spatial frameworks. We outline a process of harmonizing the environmental and geological aspects of DSM project development by incorporating a habitat approach early in the development cycle. This habitat approach supports ecosystem-based management, which is a central requirement of environmental assessments. Geostatistical techniques are described that are used alongside a hierarchical classification scheme to describe and map geoforms and substrates. This foundational habitat model can form the basis of spatially explicit ecosystem models and can inform sampling design and spatial planning at critical junctures of a project development, ensuring that sampling campaigns are connected by an ecosystem logic early in the cycle. We provide an example application from the NORI-D polymetallic nodule exploration contract area in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone.

TI  - Cross-Border Urban Change Detection and Growth Assessment for Mexican-USA Twin Cities
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing applications of change detection are increasingly in demand for many areas of land use and urbanization, and disaster risk reduction. The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and the New Urban Agenda by the United Nations call for risk monitoring. This study maps and assesses the urban area changes of 23 Mexican-USA border cities with a remote sensing-based approach. A literature study on existing studies on hazard mapping and social vulnerability in those cities reveals a need for further studies on urban growth. Using a multi-modal combination of aerial, declassified (CORONA, GAMBIT, HEXAGON programs), and recent (Sentinel-2) satellite imagery, this study expands existing land cover change assessments by capturing urban growth back to the 1940s. A Geographic Information System and census data assessment results reveal that massive urban growth has occurred on both sides of the national border. On the Mexican side, population and area growth exceeds the US cities in many cases. In addition, flood hazard exposure has grown along with growing city sizes, despite structural river training. These findings indicate a need for more risk monitoring that includes remote sensing data. It has socio-economic implications, too, as the social vulnerability on Mexican and US sides differ. This study calls for the maintenance and expansion of open data repositories to enable such transboundary risk comparisons. Common vulnerability variable sets could be helpful to enable better comparisons as well as comparable flood zonation mapping techniques. To enable risk monitoring, basic data such as urban boundaries should be mapped per decade and provided on open data platforms in GIS formats and not just in map viewers.

TI  - Integration of Sentinel 1 and Sentinel 2 Satellite Images for Crop Mapping
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop identification is key to global food security. Due to the large scale of crop estimation, the science of remote sensing was able to do well in this field. The purpose of this study is to study the shortcomings and strengths of combined radar data and optical images to identify the type of crops in Tarom region (Iran). For this purpose, Sentinel 1 and Sentinel 2 images were used to create a map in the study area. The Sentinel 1 data came from Google Earth Engine's (GEE) Level-1 Ground Range Detected (GRD) Interferometric Wide Swath (IW) product. Sentinel 1 radar observations were projected onto a standard 10-m grid in GRD output. The Sen2Cor method was used to mask for clouds and cloud shadows, and the Sentinel 2 Level-1C data was sourced from the Copernicus Open Access Hub. To estimate the purpose of classification, stochastic forest classification method was used to predict classification accuracy. Using seven types of crops, the classification map of the 2020 growth season in Tarom was prepared using 10-day Sentinel 2 smooth mosaic NDVI and 12-day Sentinel 1 back mosaic. Kappa coefficient of 0.75 and a maximum accuracy of 85% were reported in this study. To achieve maximum classification accuracy, it is recommended to use a combination of radar and optical data, as this combination increases the chances of examining the details compared to the single-sensor classification method and achieves more reliable information.

TI  - Quantitative Evaluation of the Soil Signal Effect on the Correlation between Sentinel-1 Cross Ratio and Snow Depth
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), as an efficient Earth observation technology, can be used as a complementary means of observation for snow depth (SD) and can address the spatial heterogeneity of mountain snow. However, there is still uncertainty in the SD retrieval algorithm based on SAR data, due to soil surface scattering. The aim of this study is to quantify the impact of soil signals on the SD retrieval method based on the cross-ratio (CR) of high-spatial resolution SAR images. Utilizing ascending Sentinel-1 observation data during the period from November 2016 to March 2020 and a CR method based on VH- and VV-polarization, we quantitatively analyzed the CR variability characteristics of rock and soil areas within typical thick snow study areas in the Northern Hemisphere from temporal and spatial perspectives. The correlation analysis demonstrated that the CR signal in rock areas at a daily timescale shows a strong correlation (mean value > 0.60) with snow depth. Furthermore, the soil areas are more influenced by freeze-thaw cycles, such that the monthly CR changes showed no or negative trend during the snow accumulation period. This study highlights the complexity of the physical mechanisms of snow scattering during winter processes and the influencing factors that cause uncertainty in the SD retrieval, which help to promote the development of high-spatial resolution C-band data for snow characterization applications.

TI  - Estimation of Infiltration Volumes and Rates in Seasonally Water-Filled Topographic Depressions Based on Remote-Sensing Time Series
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In semi-arid ecoregions of temperate zones, focused snowmelt water infiltration in topographic depressions is a key, but imperfectly understood, groundwater recharge mechanism. Routine monitoring is precluded by the abundance of depressions. We have used remote-sensing data to construct mass balances and estimate volumes of temporary ponds in the Tambov area of Russia. First, small water bodies were automatically recognized in each of a time series of high-resolution Planet Labs images taken in April and May 2021 by object-oriented supervised classification. A training set of water pixels defined in one of the latest images using a small unmanned aerial vehicle enabled high-confidence predictions of water pixels in the earlier images (Cohen's & UKappa; = 0.99). A digital elevation model was used to estimate the ponds' water volumes, which decreased with time following a negative exponential equation. The power of the exponent did not systematically depend on the pond size. With adjustment for estimates of daily Penman evaporation, function-based interpolation of the water bodies' areas and volumes allowed calculation of daily infiltration into the depression beds. The infiltration was maximal (5-40 mm/day) at onset of spring and decreased with time during the study period. Use of the spatially variable infiltration rates improved steady-state shallow groundwater simulations.

T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Catholic schools. has articulated There are concerns that the curriculum of Catholic schools has been increasingly dominated by pressures to conform to a programme of education legitimised by an intrusive secular state and designated as a 'national curriculum'. Accordingly, the curriculum of Catholic maintained schools is regulated within a standardised framework that is directed by government. Contentiously, it has been asserted that, as a result, the curriculum in Catholic schools in England has effectively been 'de-Catholicised'. This claim has been contested. For example, it is maintained that the matter is more nuanced than this and the situation cannot be interpreted in such an unequivocal way. However, it might well be asked: what should a Catholic curriculum look like? In the face of this question, leaders in Catholic schools are encouraged to consider renewing and restoring a distinctive curriculum by permeating it systematically with the principles of Catholic social teaching. Ultimately, the writer argues, the curriculum of Catholic schools should provide students with an understanding of the teachings of Jesus Christ.

TI  - Evaluation of Satellite Imagery for Monitoring Pacific Walruses at a Large Coastal Haulout
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pacific walruses (Odobenus rosmarus divergens) are using coastal haulouts in the Chukchi Sea more often and in larger numbers to rest between foraging bouts in late summer and autumn in recent years, because climate warming has reduced availability of sea ice that historically had provided resting platforms near their preferred benthic feeding grounds. With greater numbers of walruses hauling out in large aggregations, new opportunities are presented for monitoring the population. Here we evaluate different types of satellite imagery for detecting and delineating the peripheries of walrus aggregations at a commonly used haulout near Point Lay, Alaska, in 2018-2020. We evaluated optical and radar imagery ranging in pixel resolutions from 40 m to ~1 m: specifically, optical imagery from Landsat, Sentinel-2, Planet Labs, and DigitalGlobe, and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery from Sentinel-1 and TerraSAR-X. Three observers independently examined satellite images to detect walrus aggregations and digitized their peripheries using visual interpretation. We compared interpretations between observers and to high-resolution (~2 cm) ortho-corrected imagery collected by a small unoccupied aerial system (UAS). Roughly two-thirds of the time, clouds precluded clear optical views of the study area from satellite. SAR was unaffected by clouds (and darkness) and provided unambiguous signatures of walrus aggregations at the Point Lay haulout. Among imagery types with 4-10 m resolution, observers unanimously agreed on all detections of walruses, and attained an average 65% overlap (sd 12.0, n 100) in their delineations of aggregation boundaries. For imagery with ~1 m resolution, overlap agreement was higher (mean 85%, sd 3.0, n 11). We found that optical satellite sensors with moderate resolution and high revisitation rates, such as PlanetScope and Sentinel-2, demonstrated robust and repeatable qualities for monitoring walrus haulouts, but temporal gaps between observations due to clouds were common. SAR imagery also demonstrated robust capabilities for monitoring the Point Lay haulout, but more research is needed to evaluate SAR at haulouts with more complex local terrain and beach substrates.

T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Review
AB  - Rapid urban growth poses increasing challenges, but also opportunities, for urban and peri-urban agriculture (UPA). This systematic review explores the nexus between UPA and urban growth through a meta-analysis of research on UPA in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. We reviewed 92 empirical articles, reporting on 83 cities, by applying a framework focused on interactions between urban growth, agricultural production factors, and urban food markets. Results show that the most reported challenges facing UPA are agricultural land conversion and peripheralization. Yet, a number of studies indicate spatial expansion and intensification of UPA due to increasing and changing food demand. Urban growth-related dynamics in the availability of water, organic fertilizer, and labour can further foster or constrain UPA. Consequently, farmers respond and adapt to urban growth in multiple ways. These findings indicate a complex, multi-dimensional challenge for planners and policy makers seeking to manage UPA in rapidly urbanizing landscapes. Yet, our meta-analysis shows that few studies holistically address spatiotemporal dynamics, intra-urban variations, and complex multi-dimensional inter linkages of UPA under urban growth. To overcome these limitations and chart a new framework for future research, we reconceptualize the spatiotemporal dynamics of UPA under urban growth as a wheel of urban growth related UPA dynamics. To apply this framework, we call for further mixed-methods research linking multi temporal, remotely sensed data to longitudinal qualitative and quantitative fieldwork data, in order to better understand and critically assess the multifaceted and dynamic socio-spatial changes of UPA in cities across the Global South.

TI  - Ethics in Classical Hindu Philosophy: Provinces of Consequence, Agency, and Value in the Bhagavad Gita and Other Epic and Sastric Texts
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The idea of a univocal property of 'goodness' is not clearly found in classical Sanskrit sources; instead, a common ethical strategy was to clarify the ontological nature of the self or world in such a way that ethical implications naturally flow from the adjustment in our thinking. This article gives a synoptic reading of sources that treat features of ethics-dispositions, agents, causal systems of effect, and even values themselves-as emergent phenomena grounded in complex, shifting, porous configurations. One conclusion of this was that what 'goodness' entails varies according to the scope and context of our concern. Firstly, we examine how the Bhagavad Gita fashions a utilitarianism that assumes no universal intrinsically valuable goal or Good, but aims only to sustain the world as a prerequisite for choice. Recognising that this pushes problems of identifying the Good onto the individual; secondly, we look at accounts of malleable personhood in the Caraka Samhita and Book 12 of the Mahabharata. Finally, the aesthetic theory of the Na?ya Sastra hints at a context-constituted conception of value itself, reminding us that evaluative emotions are themselves complex, curate-able, and can expand beyond egoism to encompass interpersonal concerns. Together these sources show aspects of an ethical worldview for which each case is a nexus in a larger ethical fabric. Each tries to pry us away from our most personal concerns, so we can reach beyond the ego to do what is of value for a wider province of which we are a part.

TI  - A Satellite-Based Method for National Winter Wheat Yield Estimating in China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based models have tremendous potential for monitoring crop production because satellite data can provide temporally and spatially continuous crop growth information at large scale. This study used a satellite-based vegetation production model (i.e., eddy covariance light use efficiency, EC-LUE) to estimate national winter wheat gross primary production, and then combined this model with the harvest index (ratio of aboveground biomass to yield) to convert the estimated winter wheat production to yield. Specifically, considering the spatial differences of the harvest index, we used a cross-validation method to invert the harvest index of winter wheat among counties, municipalities and provinces. Using the field-surveyed and statistical yield data, we evaluated the model performance, and found the model could explain more than 50% of the spatial variations of the yield both in field-surveyed regions and most administrative units. Overall, the mean absolute percentage errors of the yield are less than 20% in most counties, municipalities and provinces, and the mean absolute percentage errors for the production of winter wheat at the national scale is 4.06%. This study demonstrates that a satellite-based model is an alternative method for crop yield estimation on a larger scale.

TI  - Landsat TM/OLI-Based Ecological and Environmental Quality Survey of Yellow River Basin, Inner Mongolia Section
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring and maintenance of the Inner Mongolia section of the Yellow River Basin is of great significance to the safety and development of China's Yellow River Economic Belt and to the protection of the Yellow River ecology. In this study, we calculated diagnostic values from a total of 520 Landsat OLI/TM remote sensing images of the Yellow River Basin of Inner Mongolia from 2001 to 2020. Using the RSEI and the GEE Cloud Computing Jigsaw, we analyzed the spatial and temporal distribution of diagnostic values representative of the basin's ecological status. Further, Mantel and Pearson correlations were used to analyze the significance of environmental factors in affecting the ecological quality of cities along the Yellow River within the study area. The results indicated that the overall mean of RSEI values rose at first and then fell. The RSEI grade to land area ratio was calculated to be highest in 2015 (excellent) and worst in 2001. From 2001 to 2020, ecological quality monitoring process of main cities in the Inner Mongolia region of the Yellow River Basin. Hohhot, Baotou, and Linhe all have an RSEI score greater than 0.5, considered average. However, Dongsheng had its best score (0.60, good) in 2005, which then declined and increased to an average rating in 2020. The RSEI value for Wuhai reached excellent in 2010 but then became poor in 2020, dropping to 0.28. The analysis of ecological quality in the city shows that the greenness index (NDVI) carried the most significant impact on the ecological environment, followed by the humidity index (Wet), the dryness index (NDBSI), the temperature index (Lst), land use, and then regional gross product (RGP). The significance of this study is to provide a real-time, accurate, and rapid understanding of trends in the spatial and temporal distribution of ecological and environmental quality along the Yellow River, thereby providing a theoretical basis and technical support for ecological and environmental protection and high-quality development of the Yellow River Basin.

TI  - Analyzing Sea Surface Wind Distribution Characteristics of Tropical Cyclone Based on Sentinel-1 SAR Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) cross-polarization signal remains sensitive to sea surface wind speed with high signal-to-noise ratio under tropical cyclone (TC) conditions. It has the capability of observing TC intensity and size information over the ocean with large coverage and high spatial resolution. In this paper, TC wind distribution characteristics were studied based on SAR images. We collected 41 Sentinel-1A/B cross-polarization images covering TC eye, which were acquired between 2016 and 2020. For each case, sea surface wind speeds were retrieved by the modified MS1A model in a spatial resolution of 1 km. After deriving the value and location of maximum wind speed, wind fields were simulated symmetrically within a 200 km radius. Two new methodologies were proposed to calculate the decay index and the symmetry index based on the retrieved and simulated wind fields. Characteristics of the two indices were analyzed with respect to maximum wind. In addition, the maximum and averaged wind speeds of the right, back and left side of the motion direction were compared with TC intensity and storm motion speed. Statistical results indicate that right-side wind speed is the strongest for maximum and average, the wind difference between the left and right side is dependent on storm motion speed.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Distribution of Total Suspended Matter Concentration in Changdang Lake Based on In Situ Hyperspectral Data and Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The concentration of total suspended matter (TSM) is an important parameter for evaluating lake water quality. We determined in situ hyperspectral data and TSM concentration data for Changdang Lake, China, to establish a TSM concentration inversion model. The model was applied using 60 Sentinel-2 images acquired from 2016 to 2021 to determine the temporal and spatial distribution of TSM concentration. Remote sensing images were also utilized to monitor the effect of ecological dredging in Changdang Lake. The following results were obtained: (1) Compared with four existing models, the TSM concentration inversion model established in this study exhibited higher accuracy and was suitable for Changdang Lake. (2) TSM concentrations obtained for the period 2016-2021 were higher in spring and summer, and lower in autumn and winter. (3) The dredging process influenced a small area of the surrounding water body, resulting in higher TSM concentrations. However, a subsequent reduction in TSM concentrations indicated that the ecological dredging project might improve the water quality of Changdang Lake to a considerable extent. Therefore, it was inferred that the use of Sentinel-2 images was effective for the long-term monitoring of water quality changes in small and medium-sized lakes.

TI  - An Updated Review of the Invasive <i>Aedes albopictus</i> in the Americas; Geographical Distribution, Host Feeding Patterns, Arbovirus Infection, and the Potential for Vertical Transmission of Dengue Virus
T2  - INSECTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple Summary Currently, the Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus Skuse is present on all continents except Antarctica. Efficiency as a vector of Ae. albopictus is different by geographic region. In areas where Aedes aegypti is absent, the Asian mosquito is the main vector of arboviruses such as dengue, Zika, and chikungunya. In the Americas, Ae. albopictus occupies the same ecological niches as Ae. aegypti. It is difficult to incriminate the Asian mosquito as the cause of autochthonous arbovirus outbreaks. However, evidence suggests that Ae. albopictus is very effective in transmitting endemic arboviruses (such as dengue) both horizontal and vertical transmission. Aedes albopictus could be useful as a sentinel species to monitor dengue virus in interepidemic periods. Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus is a mosquito native to Southeast Asia. Currently, it has a wide distribution in America, where natural infection with arboviruses of medical and veterinary importance has been reported. In spite of their importance in the transmission of endemic arbovirus, the basic information of parameters affecting their vectorial capacity is poorly investigated. The aim of the work was to update the distribution range of Ae. albopictus in the Americas, review the blood-feeding patterns, and compare the minimum infection rate (MIR) of the Dengue virus (DENV) between studies of vertical and horizontal transmission. The current distribution of Ae. albopictus encompasses 21 countries in the Americas. An extensive review has been conducted for the blood-feeding patterns of Ae. albopictus. The results suggest that the mosquito is capable of feeding on 16 species of mammals and five species of avian. Humans, dogs, and rats are the most common hosts. Eight arboviruses with the potential to infect humans and animals have been isolated in Ae. albopictus. In the United States of America (USA), Eastern equine encephalitis virus, Keystone virus, La Crosse Virus, West Nile virus, and Cache Valley virus were isolated in the Asian mosquito. In Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, and Costa Rica, DENV (all serotypes) has been frequently identified in field-caught Ae. albopictus. Overall, the estimated MIR in Ae. albopictus infected with DENV is similar between horizontal (10.95) and vertical transmission (8.28). However, in vertical transmission, there is a difference in the MIR values if the DENV is identified from larvae or adults (males and females emerged from a collection of eggs or larvae). MIR estimated from larvae is 14.04 and MIR estimated in adults is 4.04. In conclusion, it has to be highlighted that Ae. albopictus is an invasive mosquito with wide phenotypic plasticity to adapt to broad and new areas, it is highly efficient to transmit the DENV horizontally and vertically, it can participate in the inter-endemic transmission of the dengue disease, and it can spread zoonotic arboviruses across forest and urban settings.

TI  - A Remote Sensing Approach for Surface Urban Heat Island Modeling in a Tropical Colombian City Using Regression Analysis and Machine Learning Algorithms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Surface Urban Heat Islands (SUHI) phenomenon has adverse environmental consequences on human activities, biophysical and ecological systems. In this study, Land Surface Temperature (LST) from Landsat and Sentinel-2 satellites is used to investigate the contribution of potential factors that generate the SUHI phenomenon. We employ Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) techniques to model the main temporal and spatial SUHI patterns of Cartago, Colombia, for the period 2001-2020. We test and evaluate the performance of three different emissivity models to retrieve LST. The fractional vegetation cover model using Sentinel-2 data provides the best results with R-2 = 0.78, while the ASTER Global Emissivity Dataset v3 and the land surface emissivity model provide R-2 = 0.27 and R-2 = 0.26, respectively. Our SUHI model reveals that the factors with the highest impact are the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and the Normalized Difference Build-up Index (NDBI). Furthermore, we incorporate a weighted Naive Bayes Machine Learning (NBML) algorithm to identify areas prone to extreme temperatures that can be used to define and apply normative actions to mitigate the negative consequences of SUHI. Our NBML approach demonstrates the suitability of the new SUHI model with uncertainty within 95%, against the 88% given by the Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach.

TI  - Gulf of St. Lawrence (4RST) Greenland Halibut Stock Status in 2020: Commercial Fishery and Research Survey Data.
T2  - Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat Research Document
M3  - Article
AB  - The Gulf of St. Lawrence Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) stock (NAFO Divisions 4RST) is assessed and managed on a two-year cycle. The indicators used for this assessment are taken from fishery statistical data, sampling of commercial catches and research surveys. This document presents the data, techniques, analyses and results used in a peer review meeting held on February 23 and 24, 2021 via the Zoom platform (virtual meeting). The directed Greenland halibut fishery developed in the late 1970s. Since the closure of the mobile gear fishery in 1993, this fishery has been carried out almost exclusively with gillnets. Fishing effort is deployed in three main sectors: the western Gulf of St. Lawrence, the area north of Anticosti Island and Esquiman Channel. During the 2000-2020 period, the proportion of the fishing effort deployed in each of these three sectors was 67%, 6% and 24% respectively. The total allowable catch (TAC) remained fixed at 4,500 t between the management years 2004-2005 and 2017-2018. Landings have declined since the 2011-2012 season. In 2018, following a full assessment of the stock status in an interim year, the TAC was reduced at 3,750 t for the 2018-2019 fishing season. The TAC was further reduced for the 2020-2021 fishing season to 2,250 t and preliminary landings totaled 1,330 t. From 2019 to 2020, the commercial fishing performance indices were stable for the western Gulf and Esquiman sectors, while it was increasing in the north Anticosti sector. The indices of the three sectors are below the average of their respective series. According to scientific surveys by DFO and mobile sentinel program, the abundance and biomass indices of Greenland halibut generally showed a downward trajectory from the end of the 2000s to 2019. These indices increased slightly between 2019 and 2020 to levels well below the peaks of the 2000s. This increase is caused by the arrival of the strong 2018 cohort. The Gulf of St. Lawrence is undergoing major changes: deep waters are warming and becoming depleted of oxygen. These changes can lead to habitat degradation, decreased growth, increased natural mortality and can negatively affect the productivity of Greenland halibut. In addition, changes in the structure of the community (high abundance of redfish and low abundance of shrimp) can modify the interactions of competition for food resources or for habitat. Current environmental conditions and climate projections suggest that the situation is likely to worsen.

TI  - Sentinel seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in Gauteng Province, South Africa, August- October 2020
T2  - SAMJ SOUTH AFRICAN MEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Estimates of prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity (seroprevalence) for tracking the COVID-19 epidemic are lacking for most African countries. Objectives. To determine the prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in a sentinel cohort of patient samples received for routine testing at tertiary laboratories in Johannesburg, South Africa. Methods. This sentinel study was conducted using remnant serum samples received at three National Health Laboratory Service laboratories in the City of Johannesburg (CoJ) district. Collection was from 1 August to 31 October 2020. We extracted accompanying laboratory results for glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), creatinine, HIV, viral load and CD4 T-cell count. An anti-SARS-CoV-2 targeting the nucleocapsid (N) protein of the coronavirus with higher affinity for IgM and IgG antibodies was used. We reported crude as well as population-weighted and test-adjusted seroprevalence. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine whether age, sex, HIV and diabetic status were associated with increased risk for seropositivity. Results. A total of 6 477 samples were analysed, the majority (n=5 290) from the CoJ region. After excluding samples with no age or sex stated, the model population-weighted and test-adjusted seroprevalence for the CoJ (n=4 393) was 27.0% (95% confidence interval (CI) 25.4 -28.6). Seroprevalence was highest in those aged 45 -49 years (29.8%; 95% CI 25.5 -35.0) and in those from the most densely populated areas of the CoJ. Risk for seropositivity was highest in those aged 18 -49 years (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.52; 95% CI 1.13 -2.13; p=0.0005) and in samples from diabetics (aOR 1.36; 95% CI 1.13 -1.63; p=0.001). Conclusions. Our study conducted between the first and second waves of the pandemic shows high levels of current infection among patients attending public health facilities in Gauteng Province.

TI  - Effects of Cadmium Sulfate on the Brown Garden Snail <i>Cornu aspersum</i>: Implications for DNA Methylation
T2  - TOXICS
M3  - Article
AB  - An extensive literature exists regarding the cellular, physiological, and genetic effects of cadmium (Cd)-A highly toxic, but commonly used trace metal in modern industry. However, limited data are available on its epigenetic effects, especially for terrestrial sentinel invertebrates. We determined Cd retention, total DNA methylation, and the methylation status of 5 & PRIME; end of the Cd-MT gene in the hepatopancreas of the brown garden snail, Cornu aspersum, fed Cd sulfate for four weeks. Bodyweight changes and survival were also measured. Hepatopancreas cadmium increased in a dose-dependent manner from the third-lowest dose onward, with very large amounts being found for the highest treatment group. However, no mortalities occurred, irrespective of dietary Cd dose. We identified significant genome-wide hypermethylation in specimens given the highest dose, which overlapped with a significant bodyweight decrease. The Cd-MT gene showed an unmethylated 5 & PRIME; end of the Cd-MT gene and this status was not affected by cadmium exposure. Hepatopancreas DNA methylation is as sensitive as bodyweight to non-lethal concentrations of dietary Cd given as cadmium sulfate but less responsive than tissue accumulation. Such an exposure event, by contrast, does not affect the methylation status of the Cd-MT gene 5 & PRIME; end.

TI  - Variability of Bio-Optical Characteristics of Surface Water Layer during Transatlantic Transect in 2019-2020
T2  - OCEANOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Areas with different values of the bio-optical characteristics of the surface water layer and different temperature and salinity distributions obtained during a Transatlantic transect in winter 2019/2020 are studied. In the region of Canary Upwelling and the equator, the temperature decrease zones correspond to peaks of fluorescence intensity of chlorophyll and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM). The fluorescence intensities concurrently varied in the both channels. In the surface water of the tropical and subtropical Atlantic, low values of the chlorophyll and CDOM fluorescence intensities and the attenuation and absorption coefficients, which are characteristic of oligotrophic waters, were recorded. These distributions mostly agree well with the NOAA web service, created in late 2019 and providing interpolated satellite maps of chlorophyll a concentration. En route to La Plata Bay, a series of fronts were recorded, as well as a strong negative correlation between the CDOM fluorescence intensity and salinity (rho = -0.97), caused by river runoff. In contrast to a similar negative correlation studied earlier in the Kara Sea, CDOM photodegradation under the action of high-intensity sunlight was observed.

TI  - Diagnostic Value of Intraoperative Frozen Section in Breast-Conserving Surgery: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Context: According to previous studies, using the frozen section procedure during breast surgery reduces the rate of error and the need for re-surgery. We aimed at performing a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis to provide reliable evidence on the diagnostic value of frozen section procedures in breast-conserving surgery (BCS).Data Sources: A thorough search was performed in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases for human diagnostic studies that used the frozen section in BCS. Meta-analyses were done to find the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), positive likelihood ratio (PLR), and negative likelihood ratio (NLR).Study Selection: Human diagnostic studies used the frozen section in breast-conserving surgery and studies that reported the sensitivity and specificity of the frozen section in BCS or contained data that could be calculated the desired parameters were selected for this meta-analysis.Data Extraction: Assessment of studies quality was done and data was extracted from included papers. Then, the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool was used to assess the quality of included papers.Results: Thirty-five papers were entered into our study. The meta-analysis indicated the high sensitivity (83.47, 95%CI 79.61 - 87.32) and specificity (99.29, 95%CI 98.89 - 99.68) for the frozen section in BCS, which resulted in an accuracy of 93.77 (95%CI 92.45 - 95.10). We also found a significant PPV (93.26, 95%CI 91.25 - 95.27), NPV (92.17, 95%CI 90.22 - 94.11), PLR (7.99, 95%CI 6.01 - 9.96), and NLR (0.18, 95%CI 0.14 - 0.23).Conclusions: The findings showed that intraoperative frozen section analysis has high sensitivity and specificity for evaluating lumpectomy margins in patients with early-stage breast cancer and significantly reduces the need for re-operation. Accordingly, re-operation costs are not imposed on the patient and reduce the anxiety of the patients.

TI  - Investigating the Spread of Coronavirus Disease via Edge-AI and Air Pollution Correlation
T2  - ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTERNET TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious viral disease affecting millions of people worldwide in 2020. Several studies have shown that COVID-19 results in a severe acute respiratory syndrome and may lead to death. In past research, a greater number of respiratory diseases has been caused by exposure to air pollution for long periods of time. This article investigates the spread of COVID-19 as a result of air pollution by applying linear regression in machine learning method based edge computing. The analysis in this investigation have been based on the death rates caused by COVID-19 as well as the region of death rates based on hazardous air pollution using data retrieved from the Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite. The results obtained in the investigation prove that the mortality rate due to the spread of COVID-19 is 77% higher in areas with polluted air. This investigation also proves that COVID-19 severely affected 68% of the individuals who had been exposed to polluted air.

TI  - Tracking the behavior of rocky coastal cliffs in northwestern Spain
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Rocky coastal regions are often inaccessible due to steep slopes and high relief. Remotely sensed data can, therefore, be useful, but they often have low spatial and temporal resolution and, in the case of airborne LiDAR, if not publically available, are costly to obtain. This paper reports on the use of high-resolution images from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and Structure-from-Motion (SfM) photogrammetric techniques, supplemented by a series of orthophotos and aerial LiDAR, to examine changes in rocky coastal cliffs from 2002 to 2018. The study was conducted over an 800 m-long, orthogneiss-dominated coastal section in northwestern Galicia, Spain. Cliff changes are due, primarily, to rockfalls, resulting from weathering and wave undercutting, which cause talus deposits to accumulate at the cliff foot. These deposits provide temporary protection to the cliff from wave action, until destabilized and removed by wave erosion and shallow landslides. Cliff recession rates are affected by changing conditions within a cycle and are dependent, in part, on when a survey is conducted. The data suggest that rates of cliff recession are increasing in this region and that the plan shape of the coast, which consists of headlands and bays, is continuing to evolve. Most coastal landslides in this region help to transport and dispose of talus fallen from the cliff. In contrast to landslides that remove intact materials from the cliff face, and are, therefore, primary erosional mechanisms, talus landslides are triggered by wave erosion and probably simultaneously, by storm wave spray and splash, rather than by heavy rainfall.

TI  - Patched Local Lunar Gravity Solutions Using GRAIL Data
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a method to determine local gravity fields for the Moon using Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) data. We express gravity as gridded gravity anomalies on a sphere, and we estimate adjustments to a background global start model expressed in spherical harmonics. We processed GRAIL Ka-band range-rate data with a short-arc approach, using only data over the area of interest. We determine our gravity solutions using neighbor smoothing constraints. We divided the entire Moon into 12 regions and 2 polar caps, with a resolution of 0.15 degrees x 0.15 degrees (which is equivalent to degree and order 1199 in spherical harmonics), and determined the optimal smoothing parameter for each area by comparing localized correlations between gravity and topography for each solution set. Our selected areas share nodes with surrounding areas and they are overlapping. To mitigate boundary effects, we patch the solutions together by symmetrically omitting the boundary parts of overlapping solutions. Our new solution has been iterated, and it has improved correlations with topography when compared to a fully iterated global model. Our method requires fewer resources, and can easily handle regionally varying resolution or constraints. The smooth model describes small-scale features clearly, and can be used in local studies of the structure of the lunar crust.

TI  - Underground Environments, Worldviews, and Sustainable Stewardship
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Review
AB  - This paper examines an aspect of a value-based approach to underground built heritage (UBH). A key tool for the manager of any built heritage today is the mapping of its manifold values for different audiences, to inform their management strategy. This paper first reviews an important paradigm shift that has occurred in the humanities and in cultural heritage management, leading to the recognition of the centrality of the worldviews and lived experience of the different members that make up communities. Drawing on a selection of examples from the literature, it then demonstrates how many UBH sites across a wide spectrum of cultures acquired cosmological and cultic value and significance in a way that is qualitatively different to most built heritage sites above ground. The spectrum of challenges that this poses to the UBH site manager is then outlined by reviewing literature on a selection of UBH examples, from prehistoric archaeological sites to living religious sites. Some key guiding principles are proposed for the management of these different scenarios. Culturally sensitive management that respects the existing value systems of local communities is indispensable wherever such communities are present. Decision-makers need to be keenly aware of these value systems and need to recognize, empower, and complement existing traditional systems of stewardship.

TI  - Does Coal Mining Have Effects on Land Use Changes in a Coal Resource-Based City? Evidence from Huaibei City on the North China Plain
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuous coal mining results in dramatic regional land use change, and significantly influences the sustainable development of coal resource-based cities. Present studies pay little attention to the characteristics and regularities of land use change in coal resource-based cities, caused by underground coal mining in high groundwater areas. Based on the Landsat remote sensing images of 1999, 2000, 2010, and 2018 of Huaibei City, a typical coal resource-based city of a high ground water area on the North China Plain, this paper applies the dynamic degree and transition matrix of land use to analyze the land use change characteristics, and identify the regularity between land use type and coal mining production in this coal resource-based city. Results show that the land use change in the research area presents an overall characteristic of a constant increase in water area, urban construction land, and rural settlement land, and a continuous decrease in cultivated land. Cultivated land is converted into a water area, urban construction land, and rural settlement land, and rural settlement land and cultivated land are converted bidirectionally. The land use change in this coal resource-based city demonstrates significant reliance on coal resources, and coal mining is significantly related to the area of cultivated land, water area, and rural settlement land, which demonstrates that continuous large-scale coal mining results in damage to cultivated land, a decrease in rural settlement land, and an increase in water area. The research result contributes to the sustainable land use of coal resource-based cities.

TI  - Use of Slaughterhouses as Sentinel Points for Genomic Surveillance of Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus in Southern Vietnam
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The genetic diversity of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) poses a challenge to the successful control of the disease, and it is important to identify the emergence of different strains in endemic settings. The objective of this study was to evaluate the sampling of clinically healthy livestock at slaughterhouses as a strategy for genomic FMDV surveillance. Serum samples (n = 11,875) and oropharyngeal fluid (OPF) samples (n = 5045) were collected from clinically healthy cattle and buffalo on farms in eight provinces in southern and northern Vietnam (2015-2019) to characterize viral diversity. Outbreak sequences were collected between 2009 and 2019. In two slaughterhouses in southern Vietnam, 1200 serum and OPF samples were collected from clinically healthy cattle and buffalo (2017 to 2019) as a pilot study on the use of slaughterhouses as sentinel points in surveillance. FMDV VP1 sequences were analyzed using discriminant principal component analysis and time-scaled phylodynamic trees. Six of seven serotype-O and -A clusters circulating in southern Vietnam between 2017-2019 were detected at least once in slaughterhouses, sometimes pre-dating outbreak sequences associated with the same cluster by 4-6 months. Routine sampling at slaughterhouses may provide a timely and efficient strategy for genomic surveillance to identify circulating and emerging FMDV strains.

TI  - Soft Data in Hydrologic Modeling: Prediction of Ecologically Relevant Flows with Alternate Land Use/Land Cover Data
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Watershed-scale hydrological models have become important tools to understand, assess, and predict the impacts of natural and anthropogenic-driven activities on water resources. However, model predictions are associated with uncertainties stemming from sources such as model input data. As an important input to most watershed models, land use/cover (LULC) data can affect hydrological predictions and influence the interpretation of modeling results. In addition, it has been shown that the use of soft data will further ensure the quality of modeling results to be closer to watershed behavior. In this study, the ecologically relevant flows (ERFs) are the primary soft data to be considered as a part of the modeling processes. This study aims to evaluate the impacts of LULC input data on the hydrological responses of the rapidly urbanizing Upper Cahaba River watershed (UCRW) located in Alabama, USA. Two sources of LULC data, i.e., National Land Cover Database (NLCD) and Digitized Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) images, were used as input in the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model for the years 1992 and 2011 using meteorological data from 1988 to 2013. The model was calibrated at the watershed outlet against daily streamflow from 1988 to 1993 using the 1992 LULC data and validated for the 2008-2013 period using the 2011 LULC datasets. The results show that the models achieved similar performances with both LULC datasets during the calibration and validation periods according to commonly used statistical rating metrics such as Nash Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE), coefficient of determination (R-2), and model percent bias (PBIAS). However, LULC input information had substantial impacts on simulated ERFs such as mean monthly streamflow, maximum and minimum flows of different durations, and low flow regimes. This study demonstrates that watershed models based on different sources of LULC and applied under different LULC temporal conditions can achieve equally good performances in predicting streamflow. However, substantial differences might exist in predicted hydrological regimes and ERF metrics depending on the sources of LULC data and the LULC year considered. Our results reveal that LULC data can significantly impact the simulated flow regimes of the UCRW with underlaying influences on the predicted biotic and abiotic structures of aquatic and riparian habitats.

TI  - Learning a Transform Base for the Multi- to Hyperspectral Sensor Network with K-SVD
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - A promising low-cost solution for monitoring spectral information, e.g., on agricultural fields, is that of wireless sensor networks. In contrast to remote sensing, these can achieve more continuous monitoring due to their long-term deployment and are less impacted by the atmosphere, making them a promising solution for the calibration of satellite data. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach for processing data from such a network. Hyperspectral sensors were found to be too complex for such a network. While previous work considered fusing the data from different multispectral sensors in order to derive hyperspectral data, we shift the assessment of the hyperspectral modeling in a separate preprocessing step based on machine learning. We then use the learned data as additional input while using identical multispectral sensors, further reducing the complexity of the sensors. Despite requiring careful parametrization, the approach delivers hyperspectral data of similar and in some cases even better quality.

TI  - Estimation of Above-Ground Mangrove Biomass Using Landsat-8 Data- Derived Vegetation Indices: A Case Study in Quang Ninh Province, Vietnam
T2  - FOREST AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to map the status of mangrove forests over the coasts of Hai Ha District and Mong Cai City in Quang Ninh Province by using 2019 Landsat-8 imagery. It then developed the AGB estimation model of mangrove forests based on the AGB estimation-derived plots inventory and vegetation indices-derived from Landsat-8 data. As results, there were five land covers identified, including mangrove forests, other vegetation, wetlands, built-up, and water, with the overall accuracy assessments of 80.0% and Kappa coefficient of 0.74. The total extent of mangrove forests was estimated at 4291.2 ha. The best AGB estimation model that was selected to estimate the AGB and AGC of mangrove forests for the whole coasts of Hai Ha District and Mong Cai City is AGB= 30.38 + 911.95*SAVI (R-2=0.924, P-Value <0.001). The model validation assessment has confirmed that the selected AGB model can be applied to Hai Ha and Mong Cai coasts with the mean difference between AGB observed and AGB predicted at 16.0 %. This satisfactory AGB model also suggests a good potential for AGB and AGC mapping, which offer the carbon trading market in the study site. As the AGB model selected, the total AGB and AGC of mangrove forests were estimated at about 14,600,000 tons and 6,868,076 tons with a range of from 94.0 - 432.0 tons ha(-1), from 44.2 - 203.02 tons ha(-1), respectively. It also suggests that the newly-developed AGB model of mangrove forests can be used to estimate AGC stocks and carbon sequestration of mangrove forests for C-PFES in over the coasts of Hai Ha District and Mong Cai City, which is a very importantly financial source for mangrove forest managers, in particular for local mangrove protectors.

TI  - Remote Sensing-Based Estimation of Advanced Perennial Grass Biomass Yields for Bioenergy
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - A sustainable bioeconomy would require growing high-yielding bioenergy crops on marginal agricultural areas with minimal inputs. To determine the cost competitiveness and environmental sustainability of such production systems, reliably estimating biomass yield is critical. However, because marginal areas are often small and spread across the landscape, yield estimation using traditional approaches is costly and time-consuming. This paper demonstrates the (1) initial investigation of optical remote sensing for predicting perennial bioenergy grass yields at harvest using a linear regression model with the green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI) derived from Sentinel-2 imagery and (2) evaluation of the model's performance using data from five U.S. Midwest field sites. The linear regression model using midsummer GNDVI predicted yields at harvest with R-2 as high as 0.879 and a mean absolute error and root mean squared error as low as 0.539 Mg/ha and 0.616 Mg/ha, respectively, except for the establishment year. Perennial bioenergy grass yields may be predicted 152 days before the harvest date on average, except for the establishment year. The green spectral band showed a greater contribution for predicting yields than the red band, which is indicative of increased chlorophyll content during the early growing season. Although additional testing is warranted, this study showed a great promise for a remote sensing approach for forecasting perennial bioenergy grass yields to support critical economic and logistical decisions of bioeconomy stakeholders.

TI  - Robust GMTI Scheme for Highly Squinted Hypersonic Vehicle-Borne Multichannel SAR in Dive Mode
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - While there are recent researches on hypersonic vehicle-borne multichannel synthetic aperture radar in ground moving target indication (HSV-MC-SAR/GMTI), this article, which specifically explores a robust GMTI scheme for the highly squinted HSV-MC-SAR in dive mode, is novel. First, an improved equivalent range model (IERM) for stationary targets and GMTs is explored, which enjoys a concise expression and therefore offers the potential to simplify the GMTI process. Then, based on the proposed model, a robust GMTI scheme is derived in detail, paying particular attention to Doppler ambiguity arising from the high-speed and high-resolution wide-swath. Furthermore, it retrieves the accurate two-dimensional speeds of GMTs and realizes the satisfactory performance of clutter rejection and GMT imaging, generating the matched beamforming and enhancing the GMT energy. Finally, it applies the inverse projection to revise the geometry shift induced by the vertical speed. Simulation examples are used to verify the proposed GMTI scheme.

TI  - Arctic sea ice concentration retrieval using the DT-ASI algorithm based on FY-3B/MWRI data
T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea ice concentration (SIC) is one of the most important indicators when monitoring climate changes in the polar region. With the development of the Chinese satellite technology, the FengYun (FY) series has been applied to retrieve the sea ice parameters in the polar region. In this paper, to improve the SIC retrieval accuracy from the passive microwave (PM) data of the Microwave Radiation Imager (MWRI) aboard on the FengYun-3B (FY-3B) Satellite, the dynamic tie-point (DT) Arctic Radiation and Turbulence Interaction Study (ARTIST) Sea Ice (ASI) (DT-ASI) SIC retrieval algorithm is applied and obtained Arctic SIC data for nearly 10 a (from November 18, 2010 to August 19, 2019). Also, by applying a land spillover correction scheme, the erroneous sea ice along coastlines in melt season is removed. The results of FY-3B/DT-ASI are obviously improved compared to that of FY-3B/NT2 (NASA-Team2) in both SIC and sea ice extent (SIE), and are highly consistent with the results of similar products of AMSR2 (Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2)/ASI and AMSR2/DT-ASI. Compared with the annual average SIC of FY-3B/NT2, our result is reduced by 2.31%. The annual average SIE difference between the two FY-3Bs is 1.65x10(6) km(2), of which the DT-ASI algorithm contributes 87.9% and the land spillover method contributes 12.1%. We further select 58 MODIS (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) cloud-free samples in the Arctic region and use the tie-point method to retrieve SIC to verify the accuracy of these SIC products. The root mean square difference (RMSD) and mean absolute difference (MAD) of the FY-3B/DT-ASI and MODIS results are 17.2% and 12.7%, which is close to those of two AMSR2 products with 6.25 km resolution and decreased 8% and 7.2% compared with FY-3B/NT2. Further, FY-3B/DT-ASI has the most significant improvement where the SIC is lower than 60%. A high-quality SIC product can be obtained by using the DT-ASI algorithm and our work will be beneficial to promote the application of FengYun Satellite.

TI  - Fractal-Based Retrieval and Potential Driving Factors of Lake Ice Fractures of Chagan Lake, Northeast China Using Landsat Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A thorough understanding of the freshwater ice process received considerable critical attention due to increasing winter recreations and ice engineering. The development of the lake ice process of Chagan Lake was monitored using MODIS and Landsat images over eight consecutive snow seasons from October 2013 to April 2021. We derived the lake ice phenology from an eight-day time series of lake water skin temperature (LWST) provided by MODIS, including freeze-up date, break-up date, and ice cover duration. We discovered a large-scale fracture extending from northwest to southeast that repeatedly appeared on Landsat images since 1986. A novel fractal-based auto-extraction is proposed to extract the length and angle of these fractures. We also carried out a field campaign and an ice ridge was found at the southernmost part of what we observed from the images. Moreover, we explained the fracturing development by thermal changes, wind in lake, and underlying flow. Results show that the lake ice fracture is nearly perpendicular to the dominant wind direction in the cold season, which indicates the crucial role of wind on lake ice fracturing.

TI  - Bulk Processing of Multi-Temporal Modis Data, Statistical Analyses and Machine Learning Algorithms to Understand Climate Variables in the Indian Himalayan Region
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies relating to trends of vegetation, snowfall and temperature in the north-western Himalayan region of India are generally focused on specific areas. Therefore, a proper understanding of regional changes in climate parameters over large time periods is generally absent, which increases the complexity of making appropriate conclusions related to climate change-induced effects in the Himalayan region. This study provides a broad overview of changes in patterns of vegetation, snow covers and temperature in Uttarakhand state of India through bulk processing of remotely sensed Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, meteorological records and simulated global climate data. Additionally, regression using machine learning algorithms such as Support Vectors and Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) network is carried out to check the possibility of predicting these environmental variables. Results from 17 years of data show an increasing trend of snow-covered areas during pre-monsoon and decreasing vegetation covers during monsoon since 2001. Solar radiation and cloud cover largely control the lapse rate variations. Mean MODIS-derived land surface temperature (LST) observations are in close agreement with global climate data. Future studies focused on climate trends and environmental parameters in Uttarakhand could fairly rely upon the remotely sensed measurements and simulated climate data for the region.

TI  - Modeling of Forest Ecosystem Degradation Due to Anthropogenic Stress: The Case of Rohingya Influx into the Cox's Bazar-Teknaf Peninsula of Bangladesh
T2  - ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Overdependence and cumulative anthropogenic stresses have caused world forests to decrease at an unprecedented rate, especially in Southeast Asia. The Cox's Bazar-Teknaf Peninsula of Bangladesh is not an exception and follows the global deforestation trend. Despite being one of the country's richest forest ecosystems with multiple wildlife sanctuaries, reserve forests, and influential wildlife habitats, the peninsula is now providing shelter for nearly one million Rohingya refugees. With the global deforestation trend coupled with excessive anthropogenic stresses from the Rohingya population, the forests in the peninsula are continuously deteriorating in terms of quality and integrity. In response to deforestation, the government invested in conservation efforts through afforestation and restoration programs, although the peninsula faced a refugee crisis in August 2017. The impact of this sudden increase in population on the forest ecosystem is large and has raised questions and contradictions between the government's conservation efforts and the humanitarian response. Relocation of the refugees seems to be a lengthy process and the forest ecosystem integrity needs to be preserved; therefore, the degree of stresses, level of impacts, and pattern of deforestation are crucial information for forest conservation and protection strategies. However, there are a lack of quantitative analyses on how the forest ecosystem is deteriorating and what future results would be in both space and time. In this study, the impact of the sudden humanitarian crisis (i.e., Rohingya refugees) as anthropogenic stress in Cox's Bazar-Teknaf peninsula has been spatiotemporally modeled and assessed using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and other collateral data. Using the density and accessibility of the Rohingya population along with the land cover and other physiographic data, a multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) technique was applied through the Markov cellular automata technique to model the forest vegetation status. The impact of deforestation differs in cost due to variability of the forest vegetation covers. The study, therefore, developed and adopted three indices for assessment of the forest ecosystem based on the variability and weight of the forest cover loss. The spatial severity of impact (SSI) index revealed that out of 5415 ha of total degraded forest lands, 650 ha area would have the highest cost from 2017 to 2027. In the case of the ecosystem integrity (EI) index, a rapid decline in ecosystem integrity in the peninsula was observed as the integrity value fell to 1190 ha (2019) from 1340 ha (2017). The integrity is expected to further decline to 740 ha by 2027, if the stress persists in a similar fashion. Finally, the findings of ecosystem integrity depletion (EID) elucidated areas of 540 and 544 hectares that had a severe EID score of (-5) between 2017 and 2019 and 2017 and 2027, respectively. The displacement and refugee crisis is a recurrent world event that, in many cases, compromises the integrity and quality of natural space. Therefore, the findings of this study are expected to have significant global and regional implications to help managers and policymakers of forest ecosystems make decisions that have minimal or no impact to facilitate humanitarian response.

TI  - Intercrypt sentinel macrophages tune antibacterial NF-κB responses in gut epithelial cells via TNF
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) NF-kappa B signaling regulates the balance between mucosal homeostasis and inflammation. It is not fully understood which signals tune this balance and how bacterial exposure elicits the process. Pure LPS induces epithelial NF-kappa B activation in vivo. However, we found that in mice, IECs do not respond directly to LPS. Instead, tissue-resident lamina propria intercrypt macrophages sense LPS via TLR4 and rapidly secrete TNF to elicit epithelial NF-kappa B signaling in their immediate neighborhood. This response pattern is relevant also during oral enteropathogen infection. The macrophage-TNF-IEC axis avoids responses to luminal microbiota LPS but enables crypt- or tissue-scale epithelial NF-kappa B responses in proportion to the microbial threat. Thereby, intercrypt macrophages fulfill important sentinel functions as first responders to Gram-negative microbes breaching the epithelial barrier. The tunability of this crypt response allows the induction of defense mechanisms at an appropriate scale according to the localization and intensity of microbial triggers.

TI  - Change detection and urban expansion of Port Sudan, Red Sea, using remote sensing and GIS
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - During the last two decades, Port Sudan City has witnessed major environmental stresses resulting from urban expansion and port extensions. This research aims at analysing land water changes (LWCs), land use land cover (LULC) changes and urban expansion of Port Sudan using remote sensing and GIS. For that purpose, an integrated remote sensing and GIS approach was designed to analyse two Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) and an Operational Land Imager (OLI) Landsat images covering the period from 1999 to 2018. LWCs were detected using mathematical remote sensing and GIS-based procedures, while LULC changes were analysed through a post-classification comparison (PCC) approach using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier for classification. Major detected LWCs include landfill activities in the port area and north lagoon of Kilo Tamanya, and dredging activities in Khor Mog. Areas gained by landfill may have improved the port and transport functions but buried coral reefs and caused environmental problems as well. Furthermore, the urban areas were twice doubled, which was mostly rapid and uncontrolled, adding more pressure to the already stressed services and administrative sectors. Threats to the agricultural and mangrove areas were also analysed. The agricultural and mangrove areas were decreased by 40% each, which has been shown to have negative impacts on society, food security and biodiversity. Sadly, the lost agricultural lands were changed into bare soil, slums and other industrial uses. In contrast, mesquite forests were naturally increased by 74%. Mesquites have a major role in combating desertification and providing energy for domestic use. The driving forces and constraints of the urban expansion were highlighted. The change information provided by the applied approach will support decision-makers in adopting integrated and compatible land and coast management planning in the studied coastal city.

TI  - Deep Convolutional Neural Network Framework for Subpixel Mapping
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Subpixel mapping (SPM) is an effective way to solve the mixed pixel problem, which is a ubiquitous phenomenon in remotely sensed imagery, by characterizing subpixel distribution within the mixed pixels. In fact, the majority of the classical and state-of-the-art SPM algorithms can be viewed as a convolution process, but these methods rely heavily on fixed and handcrafted kernels that are insufficient in characterizing a geographically realistic distribution image. In addition, the traditional SPM approach is based on the prerequisite of abundance images derived from spectral unmixing (SU), during which process uncertainty inherently exists and is propagated to the SPM. In this article, a kernel-learnable convolutional neural network (CNN) framework for subpixel mapping (SPMCNN-F) is proposed. In SPMCNN-F, the kernel is learnable during the training stage based on the given training sample pairs of low- and high-resolution patches for learning a geographically realistic prior, instead of fixed priors. The end-to-end mapping structure enables direct subpixel information extraction from the original coarse image, avoiding the uncertainty propagation from the SU. In the experiments undertaken in this study, two state-of-the-art super-resolution networks were selected as application demonstrations of the proposed SPMCNN-F method. In experiment part, three hyperspectral image data sets were adopted, two in a synthetic coarse image approach and one in a real coarse image approach, for the validation. Additionally, a new data set with pairs of Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat images were adopted in a real coarse image approach, for further validation of SPMCNN-F in large-scale area. The restored fine distribution images obtained in all the experiments showed a perceptually better reconstruction quality, both qualitatively and quantitatively, confirming the superiority of the proposed SPM framework.

TI  - Modeling the Relationships between the Height and Spectrum of Submerged Tufa Barrage Using UAV-Derived Geometric Bathymetry and Digital Orthoimages
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tufa barrages play an important role in fluviatile tufa ecosystems and sedimentary records. Quantifying the height of tufa barrage is significant for understanding the evolution and development of the Holocene tufa barrage systems. However, for submerged tufa barrages, there is no low-cost non-contact method to retrieve barrage height. Generally, it is difficult to recognize small tufa barrages by means of remotely sensed satellite data, but the combination of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and Structure-from-Motion (SfM) photogrammetry makes it possible. In this study, we used a fixed-wing UAV and a consumer-grade camera to acquire images of the submerged tufa barrage in Lying Dragon Lake, Jiuzhaigou National Nature Reserve, China, and estimated the height of the tufa barrage through UAV-based photogrammetric bathymetry. On this foundation, the relationship between barrage height and its spectrum was established through band ratio analysis using UAV-derived geometric bathymetry and digital orthoimages, which provided an alternative strategy to characterize the height of submerged tufa barrages. However, the spectral characteristics of submerged tufa barrages will oscillate with changes in the environmental conditions. In future research, we will consider using a dedicated aquatic multispectral camera to improve the experimentation.

TI  - Estimation of Turbulent Heat Fluxes and Gross Primary Productivity by Assimilating Land Surface Temperature and Leaf Area Index
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, land surface temperature (LST) and leaf area index (LAI) observations are merged with a coupled two-source surface energy budget-vegetation dynamic model (TSEB-VDM) via a variational data assimilation (VDA) system to predict turbulent heat fluxes and gross primary productivity (GPP). The TSEB and VDM are coupled by relating photosynthesis in the VDM to transpiration in the TSEB equation. Unknown parameters of the VDA approach are the neutral bulk heat transfer coefficient (C-HN), evaporative fractions for soil and canopy (EFS and EFC), and specific leaf area (c(g)). The VDA approach is evaluated at six AmeriFlux sites with distinct vegetative and climatic characteristics. The modeled sensible (H) and latent (LE) heat fluxes, and GPP agree well with the corresponding eddy covariance measurements in different environmental conditions. The six-site average root mean square error (RMSE) of estimated daily H, LE, and GPP is 42.2 W m(-2), 51.5 W m(-2), and 1.8 gC m(-2) d(-1), respectively. The outcomes show that the developed VDA approach is able to exploit the implicit information in the sequences of LST and LAI measurements to estimate H, LE, and GPP. Our findings also indicate that the estimates of the H and LE are more sensitive to uncertainties in LST measurements, while the GPP retrievals are more affected by uncertainties in the LAI observations.

TI  - Automatic Interferogram Selection for SBAS-InSAR Based on Deep Convolutional Neural Networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The small baseline subset of spaceborne interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SBAS-InSAR) technology has become a classical method for monitoring slow deformations through time series analysis with an accuracy in the centimeter or even millimeter range. Thereby, the selection of high-quality interferograms calculated is one of the key operations for the method, since it mainly determines the credibility of the deformation information. Especially in the era of big data, the demand for an automatic and effective selection method of high-quality interferograms in SBAS-InSAR technology is growing. In this paper, a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) for automatichigh-quality interferogram selection is proposed that provides more efficient image feature extraction capabilities and a better classification performance. Therefore, the ResNet50 (a kind of DCNN) is used to identify and delete interferograms that are severely contaminated. According to simulation experiments and calculated Sentinel-1A data of Shenzhen, China, the proposed approach can significantly separate interferograms affected by turbulences in the atmosphere and by the decorrelation phase. The remarkable performance of the DCNN method is validated by the analysis of the standard deviation of interferograms and the local deformation information compared with the traditional selection method. It is concluded that DCNN algorithms can automatically select high quality interferogram for the SBAS-InSAR method and thus have a significant impact on the precision of surface deformation monitoring.

TI  - MODIS Aerosol Optical Thickness Product Algorithm Verification and Analysis
T2  - AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - A Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical thickness inversion algorithm has been rapidly developed in recent years, forming various representative aerosol optical thickness remote sensing products. Typical inversion algorithms include Dark Target, Dark Target-Deep Blue (DTB), and the high-spatial-resolution aerosol retrieval algorithm based on a priori land surface (HARLS). Both DTB and HARLS can realise aerosol optical depth inversion over land worldwide, but their accuracy and space-time adaptability vary. In this study, 80 Aerosol Robotic Network data worldwide were selected as the evaluation basis to quantitatively analyse and verify the adaptability and accuracy of different aerosol inversion algorithms on various underlying surfaces. The results indicate that the DTB algorithm has a higher inversion accuracy in vegetation area, whereas HARLS algorithm performs better in urban area; the HARLS and DTB algorithm accuracies in desert area type were found to be similar. The results provide a basis for selecting appropriate aerosol optical thickness remote sensing products for different applications.

TI  - A large invasive consumer reduces coastal ecosystem resilience by disabling positive species interactions
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive species could have cascading effects on ecosystem functioning. Here the authors use experimental and remote sensing data and modelling to show that an invasive mammal causes loss of facilitative interactions between sessile ecosystem engineers in salt marshes, and lower ecosystem resilience to disturbance.Invasive consumers can cause extensive ecological damage to native communities but effects on ecosystem resilience are less understood. Here, we use drone surveys, manipulative experiments, and mathematical models to show how feral hogs reduce resilience in southeastern US salt marshes by dismantling an essential marsh cordgrass-ribbed mussel mutualism. Mussels usually double plant growth and enhance marsh resilience to extreme drought but, when hogs invade, switch from being essential for plant survival to a liability; hogs selectively forage in mussel-rich areas leading to a 50% reduction in plant biomass and slower post-drought recovery rate. Hogs increase habitat fragmentation across landscapes by maintaining large, disturbed areas through trampling of cordgrass during targeted mussel consumption. Experiments and climate-disturbance recovery models show trampling alone slows marsh recovery by 3x while focused mussel predation creates marshes that may never recover from large-scale disturbances without hog eradication. Our work highlights that an invasive consumer can reshape ecosystems not just via competition and predation, but by disrupting key, positive species interactions that underlie resilience to climatic disturbances.

TI  - Land Use and Land Cover Changes in the Diversity and Life Zone for Uncontacted Indigenous People: Deforestation Hotspots in the Yasuni Biosphere Reserve, Ecuadorian Amazon
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover change (LULC) is an essential component for the monitoring environmental change and managing natural resources in areas of high natural and cultural biodiversity, such as the Amazon biome. This study was conducted in in the northern Amazon of Ecuador, specifically in the Diversity and Life Zone (DLZ) of the Yasuni Biosphere Reserve (YBR). The general aim was to investigate the territorial dynamics of land use/land cover changes to support policies for environmental and sociocultural protection in the DLZ. Specific objectives included (i) mapping LULC spatial and temporal dynamics in the DLZ in the period from 1999 to 2018, (ii) identifying sensitive LULC hotspots within the DLZ, and (iii) defining the possible policy implications for sustainable land use in the DLZ. Multitemporal satellite imagery from the Landsat series was used to map changes in LULC, which were divided into three-time stages (1999-2009, 2009-2018, 1999-2018). We adopted open-access Landsat images downloaded from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The processes for assessing LULC in the DLZ included (1) data collection and analysis, (2) data processing for remote sensing, (3) thematic land cover, and (4) homogenization and vectorization of images. The results showed that in the period 1999-2018, most of the uses and land cover were transformed into pastures in the DLZ. Therefore, it is important to improve territorial planning, to avoid conflicts between indigenous populations, migrant settlers, and uncontacted indigenous populations that live in the DLZ, within the YBR.

TI  - Application of a Convolutional Neural Network for the Detection of Sea Ice Leads
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite accounting for a small fraction of the surface area in the Arctic, long and narrow sea ice fractures, known as "leads ", play a critical role in the energy flux between the ocean and atmosphere. As the volume of sea ice in the Arctic has declined over the past few decades, it is increasingly important to monitor the corresponding changes in sea ice leads. A novel approach has been developed using artificial intelligence (AI) to detect sea ice leads using satellite thermal infrared window data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). In this new approach, a particular type of convolutional neural network, a U-Net, replaces a series of conventional image processing tests from our legacy algorithm. Results show the new approach has a high detection accuracy with F1 Scores on the order of 0.7. Compared to the legacy algorithm, the new algorithm shows improvement, with more true positives, fewer false positives, fewer false negatives, and better agreement between satellite instruments.

TI  - Selective Enhancement of the Cell-Permeabilizing Activity of Adenylate Cyclase Toxin Does Not Increase Virulence of <i>Bordetella pertussis</i>
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The whooping cough agent, Bordetella pertussis, secretes an adenylate cyclase toxin-hemolysin (CyaA, ACT, or AC-Hly) that catalyzes the conversion of intracellular ATP to cAMP and through its signaling annihilates the bactericidal activities of host sentinel phagocytes. In parallel, CyaA permeabilizes host cells by the formation of cation-selective membrane pores that account for the hemolytic activity of CyaA. The pore-forming activity contributes to the overall cytotoxic effect of CyaA in vitro, and it has previously been proposed to synergize with the cAMP-elevating activity in conferring full virulence on B. pertussis in the mouse model of pneumonic infection. CyaA primarily targets myeloid phagocytes through binding of their complement receptor 3 (CR3, integrin alpha(M)beta(2), or CD11b/CD18). However, with a reduced efficacy, the toxin can promiscuously penetrate and permeabilize the cell membrane of a variety of non-myeloid cells that lack CR3 on the cell surface, including airway epithelial cells or erythrocytes, and detectably intoxicates them by cAMP. Here, we used CyaA variants with strongly and selectively enhanced or reduced pore-forming activity that, at the same time, exhibited a full capacity to elevate cAMP concentrations in both CR3-expressing and CR3-non-expressing target cells. Using B. pertussis mutants secreting such CyaA variants, we show that a selective enhancement of the cell-permeabilizing activity of CyaA does not increase the overall virulence and lethality of pneumonic B. pertussis infection of mice any further. In turn, a reduction of the cell-permeabilizing activity of CyaA did not reduce B. pertussis virulence any importantly. These results suggest that the phagocyte-paralyzing cAMP-elevating capacity of CyaA prevails over the cell-permeabilizing activity of CyaA that appears to play an auxiliary role in the biological activity of the CyaA toxin in the course of B. pertussis infections in vivo.

TI  - Land Suitability Assessment for Pulse (Green Gram) Production through Remote Sensing, GIS and Multicriteria Analysis in the Coastal Region of Bangladesh
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The agricultural potential of Bangladesh's coastal region has been threatened by the impact of climate change. Pulse crops with high nutritional value and low production costs such as green gram constitute an important component of a healthy and accessible diet for the country. In order to optimize the production of this important staple, this research aims to promote climate-smart agriculture by optimizing the identification of the appropriate land. The objective of this research is to investigate, estimate, and identify the suitable land areas for green gram production based on the topography, climate, and soil characteristics in the coastal region of Bangladesh. The methodology of the study included a Geographic Information System (GIS) and the Multicriteria Decision-Making approach: the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). Datasets were collected and prepared using Landsat 8 imagery, the Center for Hydrometeorology and Remote Sensing (CHRS) data portal and the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Council. All the datasets were processed into raster images and then reclassified into four classes: Highly Suitable (S1), Moderately Suitable (S2), Marginally Suitable (S3), and Not Suitable. Then, the AHP results were applied to produce a final green gram suitability map with four classes of suitability. The results of the study found that 12% of the coastal area (344,619.5 ha) is highly suitable for green gram production, while the majority of the land area (82.3% of the area) shows moderately suitable (S2) land. The sensitivity analysis results show that 3.3%, 63.4%, 28.0%, and 1.2% of the study area are S1, S2, S3, and NS, respectively. It is also found that the highly suitable land area belongs mostly to the southeastern part of the country. The result of this study can be utilized by policymakers to adopt a proper green gram production strategy, providing special agricultural incentive policies in the highly suitable area as a provision for the increased food production of the country.

TI  - National-Scale Cropland Mapping Based on Phenological Metrics, Environmental Covariates, and Machine Learning on Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Many challenges prevail in cropland mapping over large areas, including dealing with massive volumes of datasets and computing capabilities. Accordingly, new opportunities have been opened at a breakneck pace with the launch of new satellites, the continuous improvements in data retrieval technology, and the upsurge of cloud computing solutions such as Google Earth Engine (GEE). Therefore, the present work is an attempt to automate the extraction of multi-year (2016-2020) cropland phenological metrics on GEE and use them as inputs with environmental covariates in a trained machine-learning model to generate high-resolution cropland and crop field-probabilities maps in Morocco. The comparison of our phenological retrievals against the MODIS phenology product shows very close agreement, implying that the suggested approach accurately captures crop phenology dynamics, which allows better cropland classification. The entire country is mapped using a large volume of reference samples collected and labelled with a visual interpretation of high-resolution imagery on Collect-Earth-Online, an online platform for systematically collecting geospatial data. The cropland classification product for the nominal year 2019-2020 showed an overall accuracy of 97.86% with a Kappa of 0.95. When compared to Morocco's utilized agricultural land (SAU) areas, the cropland probabilities maps demonstrated the ability to accurately estimate sub-national SAU areas with an R-value of 0.9. Furthermore, analyzing cropland dynamics reveals a dramatic decrease in the 2019-2020 season by 2% since the 2018-2019 season and by 5% between 2016 and 2020, which is partly driven by climate conditions, but even more so by the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that impacted the planting and managing of crops due to government measures taken at the national level, like complete lockdown. Such a result proves how much these methods and associated maps are critical for scientific studies and decision-making related to food security and agriculture.

TI  - CDUNet: Cloud Detection UNet for Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud detection is a key step in the preprocessing of optical satellite remote sensing images. In the existing literature, cloud detection methods are roughly divided into threshold methods and deep-learning methods. Most of the traditional threshold methods are based on the spectral characteristics of clouds, so it is easy to lose the spatial location information in the high-reflection area, resulting in misclassification. Besides, due to the lack of generalization, the traditional deep-learning network also easily loses the details and spatial information if it is directly applied to cloud detection. In order to solve these problems, we propose a deep-learning model, Cloud Detection UNet (CDUNet), for cloud detection. The characteristics of the network are that it can refine the division boundary of the cloud layer and capture its spatial position information. In the proposed model, we introduced a High-frequency Feature Extractor (HFE) and a Multiscale Convolution (MSC) to refine the cloud boundary and predict fragmented clouds. Moreover, in order to improve the accuracy of thin cloud detection, the Spatial Prior Self-Attention (SPSA) mechanism was introduced to establish the cloud spatial position information. Additionally, a dual-attention mechanism is proposed to reduce the proportion of redundant information in the model and improve the overall performance of the model. The experimental results showed that our model can cope with complex cloud cover scenes and has excellent performance on cloud datasets and SPARCS datasets. Its segmentation accuracy is better than the existing methods, which is of great significance for cloud-detection-related work.

TI  - Machine-Learning Characterization of Tectonic, Hydrological and Anthropogenic Sources of Active Ground Deformation in California
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Tectonic, hydrological and industrial processes coexist in the dynamic natural environments. However, our knowledge of ground deformation associated with tectonic, hydrological and anthropogenic processes and their interactions remains limited. California represents a natural laboratory that hosts the San Andreas fault system, Central Valley and other aquifer systems, and extensive human extraction of natural resources. The attendant multi-scale ground deformation that has been mapped using Copernicus Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)-satellite constellation from four ascending and five descending tracks during 2015-2019. We consider the secular horizontal surface velocities and strain rates, constrained from GNSS measurements and tectonic models, as proxies for tectonic processes, and seasonal displacement amplitudes from interferometric SAR (InSAR) time series as proxies for hydrological processes. We synergize 23 types of multidisciplinary datasets, including ground deformation, sedimentary basins, precipitation, soil moisture, topography, and hydrocarbon production fields, using a machine learning algorithm-random forest, and we succeed in predicting 86%-95% of the representative data sets. High strain rates along the SAF system mainly occur in areas with a low-to-moderate vegetation fraction (similar to 0.3), suggesting a correlation of rough/high-relief coastal range morphology and topography with the active faulting, seasonal and orographic rainfall, and vegetation growth. Linear discontinuities in the long-term, seasonal amplitude and phase of the surface displacement fields coincide with some fault strands, the boundary zone between the sediment-fill Central Valley and bedrock-dominated Sierra Nevada, and the margins of the inelastically deforming aquifer in the San Joaquin Valley, suggesting groundwater flow interruptions, contrasting elastic properties, and heterogeneous hydrological units.

TI  - Analysis of the Spatial and Temporal Changes of NDVI and Its Driving Factors in the Wei and Jing River Basins
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to explore the long-term vegetation cover change and its driving factors in the typical watershed of the Yellow River Basin. This research was based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE), a remote sensing cloud platform, and used the Landsat surface reflectance datasets and the Pearson correlation method to analyze the vegetation conditions in the areas above Xianyang on the Wei River and above Zhangjiashan on the Jing River. Random forest and decision tree models were used to analyze the effects of various climatic factors (precipitation, temperature, soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and drought index) on NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index). Then, based on the residual analysis method, the effects of human activities on NDVI were explored. The results showed that: (1) From 1987 to 2018, the NDVI of the two watersheds showed an increasing trend; in particular, after 2008, the average increase rate of NDVI in the growing season (April to September) increased from 0.0032/a and 0.003/a in the base period (1987-2008) to 0.0172/a and 0.01/a in the measurement period (2008-2018), for the Wei and Jing basins, respectively. In addition, the NDVI significantly increased from 21.78% and 31.32% in the baseline period (1987-2008) to 83.76% and 92.40% in the measurement period (2008-2018), respectively. (2) The random forest and classification and regression tree model (CART) can assess the contribution and sensitivity of various climate factors to NDVI. Precipitation, soil moisture, and temperature were found to be the three main factors that affect the NDVI of the study area, and their contributions were 37.05%, 26.42%, and 15.72%, respectively. The changes in precipitation and soil moisture in the entire Jing River Basin and the upper and middle reaches of the Wei River above Xianyang caused significant changes in NDVI. Furthermore, changes in precipitation and temperature led to significant changes in NDVI in the lower reaches of the Wei River. (3) The impact of human activities in the Wei and Jing basins on NDVI has gradually changed from negative to positive, which is mainly due to the implementation of soil and water conservation measures. The proportions of areas with positive effects of human activities were 80.88% and 81.95%, of which the proportions of areas with significant positive effects were 11.63% and 7.76%, respectively. These are mainly distributed in the upper reaches of the Wei River and the western and eastern regions of the Jing River. These areas are the key areas where soil and water conservation measures have been implemented in recent years, and the corresponding land use has transformed from cultivated land to forest and grassland. The negative effects accounted for 1.66% and 0.10% of the area, respectively, and were mainly caused by urban expansion and coal mining.

TI  - Temporal and Spatial Variation of NDVI and Its Driving Factors in Qinling Mountain
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Qinling Mountains is the north-south boundary of China's geography; the vegetation changes are of great significance to the survival of wildlife and the protection of species habitats. Based on Landsat products in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, Pearson's correlation coefficient method, and classification and regression models, this study analyzed the changes in NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) in the Qinling Mountains in the past 38 years and the sensitivity of its driving factors. Finally, residual analysis method and accumulate slope change rate are used to identify the impact of human activities and climate change on NDVI. The research results show the following: (1) The NDVI value in most areas of Qinling Mountains is at a medium-to-high level, and 99.76% of the areas correspond to an increasing trend of NDVI, and the significantly increased area accounts for more than 20%. (2) From 1981 to 2019, the NDVI of the Qinling Mountains increased from 0.63 to 0.78, showing an overall upward trend, and it increased significantly after 2006. (3) Sensitivity analysis results show that the western high-altitude area of Qinling Mountain area dominated by grassland is mainly affected by precipitation. The central and southeastern parts of the Qinling Mountains are significantly affected by temperature, and they are mainly distributed in areas dominated by forest. (4) The contribution rates of climate change and human activities to NDVI are 36.04% and 63.96%, respectively. Among them, the positive impact of human activities on the NDVI of the Qinling Mountains accounted for 99.85% of the area. The area with significant positive effect accounted for 36.49%. The significant negative effect area accounts for only 0.006%, mainly distributed in urban areas and coal mining areas.

TI  - Remotely sensed assessment of increasing chronic and episodic drought effects on a Costa Rican tropical dry forest
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical dry forests (TDFs) have experienced pronounced droughts and increased temperatures for the last century. To assess whether these climatic shifts have influenced dry forest vegetation and ecosystem functioning, we integrated ground observations from a Costa Rican long-term forest dynamics monitoring plot with remotely sensed measures of forest productivity and canopy functioning from a diverse set of satellite data. Previously reported long-term climate data (1921-1997) show a reduction in annual rainfall, but since 1980 there has been no directional change in mean annual precipitation. However, the 2015 El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-induced drought was unprecedented. Temperatures have increased by 1.1 degrees C since 1931. However, the Landsat wet season (1987-2017) Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) (canopy greenness) and the dry season (1985-2017) fraction of non-photosynthetic canopy cover all indicate that TDFs have become more deciduous but also more productive during the wet season. These changes are consistent with a shift in the functional composition observed in the long-term plot as more drought-deciduous tree species have increased in abundance. Nonetheless, more continuous 16-d MODIS (the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) measures of the EVI over the past 17 yr (2001-2017) showed no change in the total annual forest productivity. Further, while the 2015 ENSO event temporarily reduced forest EVI, it did not cause a longer-term impact on forest productivity. Instead, high spatial resolution Worldview-2 satellite imagery showed that forest phenology shifted in the subsequent years even though the region returned to normal precipitation. Our results indicate that while the species composition of TDFs may be sensitive to the long-term trend of gradually increasing temperatures and aridity, the annual forest functioning has so far been resilient to long-term drying and a large episodic extreme drought event. This study demonstrates the feasibility of synthesizing satellite images of different characteristics to study the vegetation dynamics of a long-term forest dynamics plot. Our synoptically sensed results show that the longer-term changing climate has been and is currently shifting the ecological functioning, and also provide a baseline to assess the impacts of an extreme drought year on TDFs.

TI  - Embodying the psychological attitude: types of consciousness in the transformation of culture
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - It is time to reclaim C.G. Jung's vision of psychology as the foundational science upon which all sciences and institutions would be based, and as the discipline, theory, and practice necessary for fostering humanity's overall psychocultural development. Jung identified eight distinct 'types' of consciousness through which humankind engages its emerging psychological attitude. Jung's view of psychological development as hingeing on the differentiation of function-attitudes provides the means for understanding not only ourselves and each other, but our society as well. This paper offers an example of such an analysis by focusing on the current conflict within American political culture. The goal is as lofty as it is necessary: the operationalization of Jung's vision of psychology as the powerful influencer of human cultural evolution that it has the potential to be. The immediate goal is to instigate the first step toward this vision of Jung's 'complex psychology' by stimulating conversations among Jungians about how they can foster that vision, leading them towards taking up roles as 'citizen therapists', actively involved in their communities in cultivating greater empathy and the withdrawal of projections in the interest of furthering 'collective consciousness'.

TI  - Estimating District-Level Electricity Consumption Using Remotely Sensed Data in Eastern Economic Corridor, Thailand
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The intensive industrial development in special economic zones, such as Thailand's Eastern Economic Corridor, increases energy consumption, leading to an imbalance of energy supply and a challenge for energy management. Electricity consumption at a local level is crucial for utility planners to manage and invest in the electrical grid. With this study, we propose an electricity consumption estimation model at the district level using machine learning with publicly available statistical data and built-up area (BU), area of lit (AL), and sum of light intensity (SL) data extracted from Landsat 8 and Suomi NPP satellite nighttime light images. The models created from three machine learning algorithms, which included Multiple Linear Regression (MR), Decision Tree (DT), and Support Vector Regression (SVR), were compared. The results show that (1) electricity consumption is highly correlated with SL, AL, and BU; and (2) the DT model demonstrated a better performance in predicting local electricity consumption when compared to MR and SVR with the lowest error rate and highest R-2. The local government in developing countries with limited data and financial resources can adopt the proposed approach to benefit from utilizing commonly available remote sensing and statistical data with simple machine learning models such as DT (regression method) for sustainable electricity management.

T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - (1) Background: Like many other countries, Poland is obliged to report forest area to the Climate Convention (UNFCCC Kyoto Protocol) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO/UN). Differences between national and international forest definitions lead to differences between actual and reported forest area. Remote sensing is a useful tool for estimating forest area for reporting purposes. One of the most important parts of the estimation is the choice of a basal area to calculate the percentage of vegetation cover. (2) Methods: Height, crown projection area, and minimum complex area were used to classify the area with forest vegetation. Percentage canopy cover was determined using three different methods based on segmentation polygons, triangular grid and canopy height model pixels. The accuracy of the above methods was verified by manual vectorization performed on a selected set of test plots in the Milicz study area according to the international definitions. The differences were examined using three statistical metrics. (3) Conclusions: This paper compares for the first time methods for determining the area for which canopy cover is calculated (using data from (ALS) and discusses the differences between them in the context of accuracy (the correspondence between the results and the reference data) and the complexity of the process (time and effort required to perform the analysis). This is important in the context of reporting, estimating carbon stocks and biodiversity to mitigate the effects of climate change. Method 2 proved to be the most accurate method, Method 1 was found to be the worst option. Accuracy was better in the case of the Kyoto Protocol definition.

TI  - Remote sensing applications for the assessment of the geomorphic response of fluvial systems to the Holocene Climate Changes
T2  - RENDICONTI ONLINE SOCIETA GEOLOGICA ITALIANA
M3  - Article
AB  - During the Holocene, the Tigris-Euphrates river system (Lower Mesopotamian Plain) was characterized by a complex morphodynamic due to climatic fluctuations, shoreline shifting, and human activities. Within a wide and barren floodplain with low elevation ranges, a remote sensing multi-sensor approach is suitable to identify the main geomorphological features and associated geomorphic processes. Optical and multispectral imagery (TerraColor and Landsat 8) are adopted for the preliminary visual inspection and the computation of multispectral indices (NDVI and Clay Ratio), as well as for the supervised classification. The topographic analysis of the micro-relief is integrated reclassifying two DEMs (AW30D30 and GDEM2) to highlight the peculiar configuration of the drainage system, which channels are several meters above the surrounding floodplain. This approach allows the investigation of the study area through large and medium scale, identifying active and abandoned channels, discerning between active and abandoned avulsion processes and distinguishing crevasse channels, levees, and deposits. In like manner, human features are recognized, allowing the evaluation of humanenvironmental interactions.

TI  - Improving Unadjusted and Adjusted Mortality With an Early Warning Sepsis System in the Emergency Department and Inpatient Wards.
T2  - Federal practitioner : for the health care professionals of the VA, DoD, and PHS
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mortality reduction has been a major focus of improvement for health care systems. Although several studies have noted improved sepsis-related mortality with the use of electronic health record (EHR) systems, there are no known published early warning sepsis systems using the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) EHR system.METHODS: The Malcom Randall Veterans Affairs Medical Center (MRVAMC), a large academic 1a VHA facility within the North Florida/South Georgia Veterans Health System (NF/SGVHS), was identified as having opportunities for improvement related to inpatient mortality outcomes. Sepsis was discovered as the primary contributor to inpatient mortality for MRVAMC's acute level of care (LOC). Education along with implementation of an early warning sepsis system (EWSS) was subsequently integrated in the VHA EHR known as the Veterans Information Systems and Technology Architecture/ Computerized Patient Record System (VistA/CPRS) at NF/SGVHS, which applied a combination of informatics solutions within a Lean Six Sigma quality improvement framework.RESULTS: At MRVAMC, there was an observed decrease in the number of inpatient deaths for the acute LOC from a high of 48 in fiscal year (FY) 2017, quarter 3 to a low of 27 in FY 2019, quarter 4. This resulted in as large of an improvement as a 44% reduction in unadjusted mortality with education and implementation of an EWSS from FYs 2017 to 2019. Additionally, the MRVAMC acute LOC risk-adjusted mortality (standardized mortality ratio) improved from > 1.0 to < 1.0, demonstrating fewer inpatient mortalities than predicted from FYs 2017 to 2019.CONCLUSIONS: Education along with the possible implementation of an EWSS within the VHA EHR was associated with improvement in unadjusted and adjusted inpatient mortality at MRVAMC. This may be an effective approach for patients with sepsis.

TI  - The Effect of Using Cinemagraph Pictures in Social Platforms and Mobile Applications in the Development of Peace Concepts
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The study aims at exploring the effect of using Cinemagraphs in social platforms (Twitter) and mobile applications (WhatsApp) in the development of peace concepts among samples of volunteer youth clubs (VYC) at the University of Hail (UOH) in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The number of sample students is 182 (males and females), they are divided into 6 experimental groups representing 3 paths: Humanities, Engineering, and Healthcare. Each path is divided into 2 groups: one for males and another for females. The study was applied during the first term of the academic year 20192020. In general, the results reveal that there is a correlation between gender (M/F) and academic specialization paths (Humanities, Engineering, and Healthcare) in developing Peace Concepts (PCs) when using Social Mobile Applications (SMA) or Social Media Platforms (SMP). Likewise, a great effect is attributed to the academic specialization paths using Cinemagraph Technology (CGT) in developing PCs for VYC at UOH. However, there is no direct link between gender (M/F) and using CGT in the development of PCs among VYC at UOH.

TI  - Sentinel-2 Recognition of Uncovered and Plastic Covered Agricultural Soil
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Medium resolution satellite data, such as Sentinel-2 of the Copernicus programme, offer great new opportunities for the agricultural sector, and provide insights on soil surface characteristics and their management. Soil monitoring requires a high-quality dataset of uncovered and plastic covered agricultural soil. We developed a methodology to identify uncovered soil pixels in agricultural parcels during seedbed preparation and considered the impacts of clouds and shadows, vegetation cover, and artificial covers, such as those of greenhouses and plastic mulch films. We preserved the spatial and temporal integrity of parcels in the process and analysed spectral anomalies and their sources. The approach is based on freely available tools, namely Google Earth Engine and R Programming packages. We tested the methodology on the northern region of Belgium, which is characterised by small, fragmented parcels. We selected a period between mid-April to end-May, when active agricultural management practices leave the soil bare in preparation for the main cropping season. The spectral angle mapper was used to identify soil covered by non-plastic greenhouses or temporary soil covers, such as plastic mulch films. The effect of underlying soil on temporary covers was considered. The retrogressive plastic greenhouse index was used for detecting plastic greenhouses. The result was a high quality dataset of potential bare uncovered agricultural soil that allows further soil surface characterisation. This offered an improved understanding of the use of artificial covers, their spatial distribution, and their corresponding crops during the considered period. Artificial covers occurred most frequently in maize parcels. The approach resulted in precision values exceeding 0.9 for the detection of temporary covers and non-plastic greenhouses and a sensitivity value exceeding 0.95 for non-plastic and plastic greenhouses.

TI  - Investigation of Sentinel-1-derived land subsidence using wavelet tools and triple exponential smoothing algorithm in Lagos, Nigeria
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Lagos has a history of long-term groundwater abstraction that is often compounded by the rising indiscriminate siting of private borehole and water well. This has resulted in various forms of environmental degradation, including land subsidence. Prediction of the temporal evolution of land subsidence is central to successful land subsidence management. In this study, a triple exponential smoothing algorithm was applied to predict the future trend of land subsidence in Lagos. Land subsidence time series was computed with SBAS-InSAR technique with Sentinel-1 acquisitions from 2015 to 2019. Besides, Matlab wavelet tool was implemented to investigate the periodicity within land displacement signal components and to understand the relationship between the observed land subsidence, and groundwater level change and that of soil moisture. Results show that land subsidence in the LOS direction varied approximately between - 94 and 15 mm/year. According to the wavelet-based analysis result, land subsidence in Lagos is partly influenced by both groundwater-level fluctuations and soil moisture variability. Evaluation of the proposed model indicates good accuracy, with the highest residual of approximately 8%. We then used the model to predict land subsidence between the years 2020 and 2023. The result showed that by the end of 2023 the maximum subsidence would reach 958 mm, which is approximately a 23% increase.

TI  - Review on Active and Passive Remote Sensing Techniques for Road Extraction
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Digital maps of road networks are a vital part of digital cities and intelligent transportation. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review on road extraction based on various remote sensing data sources, including high-resolution images, hyperspectral images, synthetic aperture radar images, and light detection and ranging. This review is divided into three parts. Part 1 provides an overview of the existing data acquisition techniques for road extraction, including data acquisition methods, typical sensors, application status, and prospects. Part 2 underlines the main road extraction methods based on four data sources. In this section, road extraction methods based on different data sources are described and analysed in detail. Part 3 presents the combined application of multisource data for road extraction. Evidently, different data acquisition techniques have unique advantages, and the combination of multiple sources can improve the accuracy of road extraction. The main aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive reference for research on existing road extraction technologies.

TI  - Surging dynamics of South Rimo Glacier, Eastern Karakoram
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Describing the dynamic characteristics of glacier surge events is a precursor to being able to understand their driving mechanisms. Here, a comprehensive suite of surface velocities and surface elevation changes for the surging South Rimo Glacier (SRG), situated in the East Karakoram region, are obtained by offset-tracking from Sentinal-1A and geodetic method from TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X and Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System. The surge of SRG initiated in the summer of 2018, and the rapid and dramatic increase in surface velocities reached a peak (similar to 12 m d(-1)) in August 2019. By the summer of 2020, the surface velocity of SRG had returned to its pre-surge level. We interpret that the evolution of the latest SRG surge was probably triggered by changes in subglacial thermal conditions, and was ultimately accelerated by hydrological processes. Based on historical analysis, a surge return period of similar to 25-30 years prevails at SRG. Spatiotemporal analyses of surface velocities and elevation changes such as these can provide useful information about surge mechanisms and their controls.

TI  - Improved Bi-Angle Aerosol Optical Depth Retrieval Algorithm from AHI Data Based on Particle Swarm Optimization
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) aboard the Himawari-8, a new generation of geostationary meteorological satellite, has high-frequency observation, which allows it to effectively capture atmospheric variations. In this paper, we have proposed an Improved Bi-angle Aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieval Algorithm (IBAA) from AHI data. The algorithm ignores the aerosol effect at 2.3 mu m and assumes that the aerosol optical depth does not change within one hour. According to the property that the reflectivity ratio K of two observations at 2.3 mu m does not change with wavelength, we constructed the equation for two observations of AHI 0.47 mu m band. Then Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) was used to solve the nonlinear equation. The algorithm was applied to the AHI observations over the Chinese mainland (80 & DEG;-135 & DEG;E, 15 & DEG;-60 & DEG;N) between April and June 2019 and hourly AOD at 0.47 mu m was retrieved. We validated IBAA AOD against the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sites observation, including surrounding regions as well as the Chinese mainland, and compared it with the AHI L3 V030 hourly AOD product. Validation with AERONET of 2079 matching points shows a correlation coefficient R = 0.82, root-mean-square error RMSE = 0.27, and more than 62% AOD retrieval results within the expected error of & PLUSMN;(0.05 + 0.2 x AOD(AERONET)). Although IBAA does not perform very well in the case of coarse-particle aerosols, the comparison and validation demonstrate it can estimate AHI AOD with good accuracy and wide coverage over land on the whole.

TI  - USA Crop Yield Estimation with MODIS NDVI: Are Remotely Sensed Models Better than Simple Trend Analyses?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop yield forecasting is performed monthly during the growing season by the United States Department of Agriculture's National Agricultural Statistics Service. The underpinnings are long-established probability surveys reliant on farmers' feedback in parallel with biophysical measurements. Over the last decade though, satellite imagery from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) has been used to corroborate the survey information. This is facilitated through the Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies/Global Agricultural Monitoring system, which provides open access to pertinent real-time normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data. Hence, two relatively straightforward MODIS-based modeling methods are employed operationally. The first model constitutes mid-season timing based on the maximum peak NDVI value, while the second is reflective of late-season timing by integrating accumulated NDVI over a threshold value. Corn model results nationally show the peak NDVI method provides a R-2 of 0.88 and a coefficient of variation (CV) of 3.5%. The accumulated method, using an optimally derived 0.58 NDVI threshold, improves the performance to 0.93 and 2.7%, respectively. Both these models outperform simple trend analysis, which is 0.48 and 7.4%, correspondingly. For soybeans the R-2 results of the peak NDVI model are 0.62, and 0.73 for the accumulated using a 0.56 threshold. CVs are 6.8% and 5.7%, respectively. Spring wheat's R-2 performance with the accumulated NDVI model is 0.60 but just 0.40 with peak NDVI. The soybean and spring wheat models perform similarly to trend analysis. Winter wheat and upland cotton show poor model performance, regardless of method. Ultimately, corn yield forecasting derived from MODIS imagery is robust, and there are circumstances when forecasts for soybeans and spring wheat have merit too.

TI  - Modeling Vegetation Water Stress over the Forest from Space: Temperature Vegetation Water Stress Index (TVWSI)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The conventional Land Surface Temperature (LST)-Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) trapezoid model has been widely used to retrieve vegetation water stress. However, it has two inherent limitations: (1) its complex and computationally intensive parameterization for multi-temporal observations and (2) deficiency in canopy water content information. We tested the hypothesis that an improved water stress index could be constructed by the representation of canopy water content information to the LST-NDVI trapezoid model. Therefore, this study proposes a new index that combines three indicators associated with vegetation water stress: canopy temperature through LST, canopy water content through Surface Water Content Index (SWCI), and canopy fractional cover through NDVI in one temporally transferrable index. Firstly, a new optical space of SWCI-NDVI was conceptualized based on the linear physical relationship between shortwave infrared (SWIR) and soil moisture. Secondly, the SWCI-NDVI feature space was parameterized, and an index d(SWCI, NDVI) was computed based on the distribution of the observations in the SWCI-NDVI spectral space. Finally, standardized LST (LST/long term mean of LST) was combined to d(SWCI, NDVI) to give a new water stress index, Temperature Vegetation Water Stress Index (TVWSI). The modeled soil moisture from the Australian Water Resource Assessment-Landscape (AWRA-L) and Soil Water Fraction (SWF) from four FLUXNET sites across Victoria and New South Wales were used to evaluate TVWSI. The index TVWSI exhibited a high correlation with AWRA-L soil moisture (R-2 of 0.71 with p < 0.001) and the ground-based SWF (R-2 of 0.25-0.51 with p < 0.001). TVWSI predicted soil moisture more accurately with RMSE of 21.82 mm (AWRA-L) and 0.02-0.04 (SWF) compared to the RMSE ranging 28.98-36.68 mm (AWRA-L) and 0.03-0.05 (SWF) were obtained for some widely used water stress indices. The TVWSI could also be a useful input parameter for other environmental models.

M3  - Article
AB  - The events of the dust aerosol transport to the water and coastal areas of the Caspian Sea during 2008-2010 are analyzed. This aerosol type is shown to be an additional source of biogenic elements in the surface layer of the sea. The comparative analysis of the optical characteristics of the northern, middle, and southern parts of the Caspian Sea, which significantly differ in hydrometeorological conditions and, hence, in the contribution of various factors which determine the possibility of anomalous cyanobacterial blooming, has been carried out. The effect of dust aerosol on the bloom of cyanobacteria is maximal in the southern part of the region under study. The results of the study of algal bloom anomalies in the Caspian Sea region are presented.

AB  - Time series of vegetation indices can be utilized to capture crop phenology information, and have been widely used in land cover and crop classification, phenological feature extraction, and planting structure monitoring. This is of great significance for guiding agricultural production and formulating agricultural policies. According to the characteristics of the GF-6 satellite's newly-added red edge bands, wide field view and high-frequency imaging, the time series of vegetation indices about multi-temporal GF-6 WFV data are used for the study of land cover and crop classification. In this study, eight time steps of GF-6 WFV data were selected from March to October 2019 in Hengshui City. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series and 10 different red edge spectral indices time series were constructed. Then, based on principal component analysis (PCA), using two feature selection and evaluation methods, stepwise discriminant analysis (SDA) and random forest (RF), the red edge vegetation index of normalized difference red edge (NDRE) was selected. Seven different lengths of NDVI, NDRE and NDVI & NDRE time series were reconstructed by the Savizky-Golay (S-G) smoothing algorithm. Finally, an RF classification algorithm was used to analyze the influence of time series length and red edge indices features on land cover and crop classification, and the planting structure and distribution of crops in the study area were obtained. The results show that: (1) Compared with the NDRE red edge time series, the NDVI time series is more conducive to the improvement of the overall classification accuracy of crops, and NDRE can assist NDVI in improving the crop classification accuracy; (2) With the shortening of NDVI and NDRE time series, the accuracy of crop classification is gradually decreased, and the decline is gradually accelerated; and (3) Through the combination of the NDVI and NDRE time series, the accuracy of crop classification with different time series lengths can be improved compared with the single NDVI time series, which is conducive to improving the classification accuracy and timeliness of crops. This study has fully tapped the application potential of the new red edge bands of GF-6 WFV time series data, which can provide references for crop identification and classification of time series data such as NDVI and red edge vegetation index of different lengths. At the same time, it promotes the application of optical satellite data with red edge bands in the field of agricultural remote sensing.

TI  - To Evaluate the Role of Positron Emission Tomography-Computerized Tomography in Initial Staging of Carcinoma Breast
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHARMACY AND BIOALLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Breast cancer is the most common cancer in urban and second common in rural Indian women. In India, in spite of the best treatment available being given to the patients they lose their lives because of paucity of diagnostic aids and lack of an organized breast cancer screening program. Early detection, accurate staging, and initiation of appropriate therapy are the key factors for improving the treatment outcome and prognosis of the disease for the patients. Traditional staging methods include clinical examination, blood tests, chest X-ray, ultrasound of the abdomen, and/or skeletal survey. As these tests lack sensitivity and specificity, these are being scaled down. The hybrid positron emission tomography-computerized tomography (PET-CT) is a unique tool in the field of imaging modalities that combines the effectiveness of PET and CT. This study was undertaken to assess the efficacy and accuracy of PET-CT as a single-session staging modality in the very initial stage itself and if it can replace the conventional means of staging. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in the Radiotherapy department at GGS Medical College and Hospital Faridkot from March 2014 to October 2015. 52 patients with newly diagnosed and histopathologically proven carcinoma breast were staged by conventional modalities (clinical examination, blood tests, X-ray chest, mammography, ultrasonography abdomen, skeletal survey) and by 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F FDG) PET/CT. PET-CT images were used for the detection, localization, staging of tumors and detection, evaluation, and diagnosis of metastatic lesions, disease burden and organ function along with treatment planning and planning therapeutic procedures. Following the completion of initial study, the results of 18F FDG PET-CT staging in comparison with conventional staging method were assessed. Along with this, the accuracy, changes in staging of cases of carcinoma breast and cost-effectiveness of 18F-FDG PET-CT were also studied. Results: All the pathologic entities identified by conventional imaging were also perceived with 18F-FDG PET/CT. Therefore, we recommend the use of PET/CT as an important imaging modality for initial diagnosis of carcinoma breast.

TI  - Spectral Indexing of MODIS-Image Pixels to Reveal the Variability in the Phytopigment Composition in the Sea under the Influence of Mesoscale Water Dynamics
T2  - OCEANOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A method is proposed for visualizing the inconstancy of the phytopigment composition in the water layer of the formation of backscattered solar radiation recorded by the MODIS multispectral ocean color scanner. The method relies on the fact that each pixel of the MODIS raster image of the investigated water area is assigned a wavelength reflectance minimum (WRM) index. The latter is equal to the sum of the wavelengths of minimums in the spectrum of a pixel or index 100 if they are absent. Such minimums are possible only in the presence of phytoplankton as the only carrier of plant pigments in the open sea. Pixel attributes of a MODIS raster image of the surface of water, like pixel coordinates and standard medium definitions, serve as WRM estimates. This makes it possible to visualize the variability of manifestations of the spectral diversity of phytoplankton against the background of the variability of the given medium properties. The effectiveness of the method is tested using the example of MODIS images of a spiral-eddy structure in the Caspian Sea and mesoscale variability of the bio-optical characteristics of waters over the continental slope in the Southwest Atlantic. The spectral indexing of the pixels of MODIS images of the water surface makes it possible to reveal some forms of variability of phytopigments of the aquatic environment that are inaccessible to the standard methods of ocean-color data processing.

TI  - Evaluation of Nine Operational Models in Forecasting Different Types of Synoptic Dust Events in the Middle East
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates four types of synoptic dust events in the Middle East region, including cyclonic, pre-frontal, post-frontal and Shamal dust storms. For each of these types, three intense and pervasive dust events are analyzed from a synoptic meteorological and numerical simulation perspective. The performance of 9 operational dust models in forecasting these dust events in the Middle East is qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated against Terra-MODIS observations and AERONET measurements during the dust events. The comparison of model AOD outputs with Terra-MODIS retrievals reveals that despite the significant discrepancies, all models have a relatively acceptable performance in forecasting the AOD patterns in the Middle East. The models enable to represent the high AODs along the dust plumes, although they underestimate them, especially for cyclonic dust storms. In general, the outputs of the NASA-GEOS and DREAM8-MACC models present greater similarity with the satellite and AERONET observations in most of the cases, also exhibiting the highest correlation coefficient, although it is difficult to introduce a single model as the best for all cases. Model AOD predictions over the AERONET stations showed that DREAM8-MACC exhibited the highest R-2 of 0.78, followed by NASA_GEOS model (R-2 = 0.74), which both initially use MODIS data assimilation. Although the outputs of all models correspond to valid time more than 24 h after the initial time, the effect of data assimilation on increasing the accuracy is important. The different dust emission schemes, soil and vegetation mapping, initial and boundary meteorological conditions and spatial resolution between the models, are the main factors influencing the differences in forecasting the dust AODs in the Middle East.

TI  - FLOMPY: An Open-Source Toolbox for Floodwater Mapping Using Sentinel-1 Intensity Time Series
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - A new automatic, free and open-source python toolbox for the mapping of floodwater is presented. The output of the toolbox is a binary mask of floodwater at a user-specified time point within geographical boundaries. It exploits the high spatial (10m) and temporal (6 days per orbit over Europe) resolution of Sentinel-1 GRD intensity time series and is based on four processing steps. In the first step, a selection of Sentinel-1 images related to pre-flood (baseline) state and flood state is performed. In the second step, the preprocessing of the selected images is performed in order to create a co-registered stack with all the pre-flood and flood images. In the third step, a statistical temporal analysis is performed and a t-score map that represents the changes due to a flood event is calculated. Finally, in the fourth step, a classification procedure based on the t-score map is performed to extract the final flood map. A thorough analysis based on several flood events is presented to demonstrate the main benefits, limitations and the potential of the proposed methodology. The validation was performed using Copernicus Emergency Management Service (EMS) products. In all case studies, overall accuracies were higher than 0.95 with Kappa scores higher than 0.76. We believe that the end-user community can benefit by exploiting the flood maps of the proposed methodological pipeline by using the provided open-source toolbox.

TI  - Deep/Transfer Learning with Feature Space Ensemble Networks (FeatSpaceEnsNets) and Average Ensemble Networks (AvgEnsNets) for Change Detection Using DInSAR Sentinel-1 and Optical Sentinel-2 Satellite Data Fusion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR), coherence, phase, and displacement are derived from processing SAR images to monitor geological phenomena and urban change. Previously, Sentinel-1 SAR data combined with Sentinel-2 optical imagery has improved classification accuracy in various domains. However, the fusing of Sentinel-1 DInSAR processed imagery with Sentinel-2 optical imagery has not been thoroughly investigated. Thus, we explored this fusion in urban change detection by creating a verified balanced binary classification dataset comprising 1440 blobs. Machine learning models using feature descriptors and non-deep learning classifiers, including a two-layer convolutional neural network (ConvNet2), were used as baselines. Transfer learning by feature extraction (TLFE) using various pre-trained models, deep learning from random initialization, and transfer learning by fine-tuning (TLFT) were all evaluated. We introduce a feature space ensemble family (FeatSpaceEnsNet), an average ensemble family (AvgEnsNet), and a hybrid ensemble family (HybridEnsNet) of TLFE neural networks. The FeatSpaceEnsNets combine TLFE features directly in the feature space using logistic regression. AvgEnsNets combine TLFEs at the decision level by aggregation. HybridEnsNets are a combination of FeatSpaceEnsNets and AvgEnsNets. Several FeatSpaceEnsNets, AvgEnsNets, and HybridEnsNets, comprising a heterogeneous mixture of different depth and architecture models, are defined and evaluated. We show that, in general, TLFE outperforms both TLFT and classic deep learning for the small dataset used and that larger ensembles of TLFE models do not always improve accuracy. The best performing ensemble is an AvgEnsNet (84.862%) comprised of a ResNet50, ResNeXt50, and EfficientNet B4. This was matched by a similarly composed FeatSpaceEnsNet with an F1 score of 0.001 and variance of 0.266 less. The best performing HybridEnsNet had an accuracy of 84.775%. All of the ensembles evaluated outperform the best performing single model, ResNet50 with TLFE (83.751%), except for AvgEnsNet 3, AvgEnsNet 6, and FeatSpaceEnsNet 5. Five of the seven similarly composed FeatSpaceEnsNets outperform the corresponding AvgEnsNet.

TI  - Surveillance for Common Arboviruses in Whole Blood of Malaria-Free Ill Returned Canadian Travelers to the Americas
T2  - CURRENT INFECTIOUS DISEASE REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of Review The Zika virus outbreak in the Americas prompted enhanced global surveillance due to the recognition of adverse neurological outcomes, including Guillain-Barre Syndrome, a novel but devastating congenital syndrome. Symptomatic Zika virus infection is clinically indistinguishable from other arboviral infections of the Americas such as chikungunya, dengue, and the more recently emerging Mayaro virus. Recent Findings We conducted laboratory surveillance for such arboviruses in ill returned travelers to the Americas between November 2015 and May 2016 by examining whole blood, malaria-negative specimens with noted travel history to the Americas by real-time and end-point PCR for the following targets: chikungunya (CHIKV), flaviviruses (Pan-Flavi), dengue virus types 1-4 (DEN1, DEN2, DEN3, DEN4), and Zika virus (ZIKV). End-point PCR was performed to detect Mayaro virus (MAYV). 1294 malaria-negative specimens were evaluated for compatible travel history. Of 224 enrolled specimens, 124 (55%) were from returned travelers to the Caribbean, while 66 (29.5%) were from Central America, and 34 (15.2%) from South America. Arboviral pathogens detected included: dengue (n = 3, 1.3%), Zika virus (n = 2, 0.9%), and unspecified flavivirus (n = 2, 0.9%). No cases of chikungunya or Mayaro were detected in the cohort. Common arboviruses circulating in the Americas were detected in over 3% of whole-blood malaria-free specimens from ill returned travelers, supporting the notion that during this time period, Zika virus was as commonly imported as dengue from this geographic region. Surveillance for other flaviviruses and alphaviruses including Mayaro virus is warranted to detect sentinel events, and inform priorities for diagnostic testing capacity.

TI  - Error Characteristics of Pan-Arctic Digital Elevation Models and Elevation Derivatives in Northern Sweden
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Many biochemical processes and dynamics are strongly controlled by terrain topography, making digital elevation models (DEM) a fundamental dataset for a range of applications. This study investigates the quality of four pan-Arctic DEMs (Arctic DEM, ASTER DEM, ALOS DEM and Copernicus DEM) within the Kalix River watershed in northern Sweden, with the aim of informing users about the quality when comparing these DEMs. The quality assessment focuses on both the vertical accuracy of the DEMs and their abilities to model two fundamental elevation derivatives, including topographic wetness index (TWI) and landform classification. Our results show that the vertical accuracy is relatively high for Arctic DEM, ALOS and Copernicus and in our study area was slightly better than those reported in official validation results. Vertical errors are mainly caused by tree cover characteristics and terrain slope. On the other hand, the high vertical accuracy does not translate directly into high quality elevation derivatives, such as TWI and landform classes, as shown by the large errors in TWI and landform classification for all four candidate DEMs. Copernicus produced elevation derivatives with results most similar to those from the reference DEM, but the errors are still relatively high, with large underestimation of TWI in land cover classes with a high likelihood of being wet. Overall, the Copernicus DEM produced the most accurate elevation derivatives, followed by slightly lower accuracies from Arctic DEM and ALOS, and the least accurate being ASTER.

TI  - Representative benthic habitat mapping on Lovina coral reefs in Northern Bali, Indonesia.
T2  - Biodiversitas
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite optical imagery datasets integrated with in situ measurements are widely used to derive the spatial distribution of various benthic habitats in coral reef ecosystems. In this study, an approach to estimate spatial coverage of those habitats based on observation derived from Sentinel-2 optical imagery and a field survey, is presented. This study focused on the Lovina coral reef ecosystem of Northern Bali, Indonesia to support deployment of artificial reefs within the Indonesian Coral Reef Garden (ICRG) programme. Three specific locations were explored: Temukus, Tukad Mungga, and Baktiseraga waters. Spatial benthic habitat coverages of these three waters was estimated based on supervised classification techniques using 10m bands of Sentinel-2 imagery and the medium scale approach (MSA) transect method of in situ measurement. The study indicates that total coverage of benthic habitat is 61.34 ha, 25.17 ha, and 27.88 ha for Temukus, Tukad Mungga, and Baktiseraga waters, respectively. The dominant benthic habitat of those three waters consists of sand, seagrass, coral, rubble, reef slope and intertidal zone. The coral reef coverage is 29.48 ha ( 48%) for Temukus covered by genus Acropora, Isopora, Porites, Montipora, Pocillopora. The coverage for Tukad Mungga is 8.69 ha (35%) covered by genus Acropora, Montipora, Favia, Psammocora, Porites, and the coverage for Baktiseraga is 11.37 ha (41%) covered by genus Montipora sp, Goniastrea, Pavona, Platygyra, Pocillopora, Porites, Acropora, Leptoseris, Acropora, Pocillopora, Fungia. The results are expected to be suitable as supporting data in restoring coral reef ecosystems in the northern part of Bali, especially in Buleleng District.

TI  - The influence of El Nino Southern Oscillation on urban heat island formation at tropical city: Case of Kuching City, Sarawak
T2  - GEOGRAFIA-MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF SOCIETY & SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - El-Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is an opposing natural climate phenomenon in which the El Nino event causes droughts and the La Nina event causes floods. Literature studies stated there is still a lack of studies on the application of remote sensing in studying the effect of ENSO on Urban Heat Island (UHI) distribution patterns. The effect of UHI amplifies temperature, especially during El Nino. The objective of this study is to examine the influence of ENSO on UHI formation in tropical cities on a local scale. This study uses MODIS data and Landsat satellite data from 1988 to 2019. This study uses a combination of both data to investigate the influence of ENSO on UHI formation. The data must undergo pre-processing before the digital number is converted to Land Surface Temperature (LST). This study found that La Nina and El Nino events influenced the pattern of UHI variation. The strength of El Nino and La Nina differences influenced the value of LST and the total UHI area with a temperature of 30 degrees C. The result discovered that during the El Nino event, the maximum, minimum and mean temperature values of LST were higher than during the La Nina event and the total of the area hot spots that have temperatures above 30 degrees C is higher during El Nino than during La Nina. The result of the study is very important to the community, local governments, and urban planners because remote sensing provides spatial information that represents the hot spot and cold spot.

TI  - Estimating Crop Biophysical Parameters Using Machine Learning Algorithms and Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global food security is critical to eliminating hunger and malnutrition. In the changing climate, farmers in developing countries must adopt technologies and farming practices such as precision agriculture (PA). PA-based approaches enable farmers to cope with frequent and intensified droughts and heatwaves, optimising yields, increasing efficiencies, and reducing operational costs. Biophysical parameters such as Leaf Area Index (LAI), Leaf Chlorophyll Content (LCab), and Canopy Chlorophyll Content (CCC) are essential for characterising field-level spatial variability and thus are necessary for enabling variable rate application technologies, precision irrigation, and crop monitoring. Moreover, robust machine learning algorithms offer prospects for improving the estimation of biophysical parameters due to their capability to deal with non-linear data, small samples, and noisy variables. This study compared the predictive performance of sparse Partial Least Squares (sPLS), Random Forest (RF), and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) for estimating LAI, LCab, and CCC with Sentinel-2 imagery in Bothaville, South Africa and identified, using variable importance measures, the most influential bands for estimating crop biophysical parameters. The results showed that RF was superior in estimating all three biophysical parameters, followed by GBM which was better in estimating LAI and CCC, but not LCab, where sPLS was relatively better. Since all biophysical parameters could be achieved with RF, it can be considered a good contender for operationalisation. Overall, the findings in this study are significant for future biophysical product development using RF to reduce reliance on many algorithms for specific parameters, thus facilitating the rapid extraction of actionable information to support PA and crop monitoring activities.

TI  - Modelling Permafrost Distribution in Western Himalaya Using Remote Sensing and Field Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The presence and extent of permafrost in the Himalaya, which is a vital component of the cryosphere, remains severely under-researched with its future climatic-driven trajectory only partly understood and the future consequences on high-altitude ecosystem tentatively sketched out. Previous studies and available permafrost maps for the Himalaya relied primarily upon the modelled meteorological inputs to further model the likelihood of permafrost. Here, as a maiden attempt, we have quantified the distribution of permafrost at 30 m grid-resolution in the Western Himalaya using observations from multisource satellite datasets for estimating input parameters, namely temperature, potential incoming solar radiation (PISR), slope, aspect and land use, and cover. The results have been compared to previous studies and have been validated through field investigations and geomorphological proxies associated with permafrost presence. A large part of the study area is barren land (similar to 69%) due to its extremely resistive climate condition with similar to 62% of the total area having a mean annual air temperature of (MAAT) <1 degrees C. There is a high interannual variability indicated by varying standard deviation (1-3 degrees C) associated with MAAT with low standard deviation in southern part of the study area indicating low variations in areas with high temperatures and vice-versa. The majority of the study area is northerly (similar to 36%) and southerly (similar to 38%) oriented, receiving PISR between 1 and 2.5 MW/m(2). The analysis of permafrost distribution using biennial mean air temperature (BMAT) for 2002-04 to 2018-20 suggests that the similar to 25% of the total study area has continuous permafrost, similar to 35% has discontinuous permafrost, similar to 1.5% has sporadic permafrost, and similar to 39% has no permafrost presence. The temporal analysis of permafrost distribution indicates a significant decrease in the permafrost cover in general and discontinuous permafrost in particular, from 2002-04 to 2018-20, with a loss of around 3% for the total area (similar to 8340.48 km(2)). The present study will serve as an analogue for future permafrost studies to help understand the permafrost dynamics associated with the effects of the recent abrupt rise in temperature and change in precipitation pattern in the region.

TI  - A Meta-Analysis on Harmful Algal Bloom (HAB) Detection and Monitoring: A Remote Sensing Perspective
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Algae serves as a food source for a wide range of aquatic species; however, a high concentration of inorganic nutrients under favorable conditions can result in the development of harmful algal blooms (HABs). Many studies have addressed HAB detection and monitoring; however, no global scale meta-analysis has specifically explored remote sensing-based HAB monitoring. Therefore, this manuscript elucidates and visualizes spatiotemporal trends in HAB detection and monitoring using remote sensing methods and discusses future insights through a meta-analysis of 420 journal articles. The results indicate an increase in the quantity of published articles which have facilitated the analysis of sensors, software, and HAB proxy estimation methods. The comparison across multiple studies highlighted the need for a standardized reporting method for HAB proxy estimation. Research gaps include: (1) atmospheric correction methods, particularly for turbid waters, (2) the use of analytical-based models, (3) the application of machine learning algorithms, (4) the generation of harmonized virtual constellation and data fusion for increased spatial and temporal resolutions, and (5) the use of cloud-computing platforms for large scale HAB detection and monitoring. The planned hyperspectral satellites will aid in filling these gaps to some extent. Overall, this review provides a snapshot of spatiotemporal trends in HAB monitoring to assist in decision making for future studies.

TI  - Monitoring and Analyzing Yield Gap in Africa through Soil Attribute Best Management Using Remote Sensing Approaches: A Review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Africa has the largest population growth rate in the world and an agricultural system characterized by the predominance of smallholder farmers. Improving food security in Africa will require a good understanding of farming systems yields as well as reducing yield gaps (i.e., the difference between potential yield and actual farmer yield). To this end, crop yield gap practices in African countries need to be understood to fill this gap while decreasing the environmental impacts of agricultural systems. For instance, the variability of yields has been demonstrated to be strongly controlled by soil fertilizer use, irrigation management, soil attribute, and the climate. Consequently, the quantitative assessment and mapping information of soil attributes such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), soil organic carbon (SOC), moisture content (MC), and soil texture (i.e., clay, sand and silt contents) on the ground are essential to potentially reducing the yield gap. However, to assess, measure, and monitor these soil yield-related parameters in the field, there is a need for rapid, accurate, and inexpensive methods. Recent advances in remote sensing technologies and high computational performances offer a unique opportunity to implement cost-effective spatiotemporal methods for estimating crop yield with important levels of scalability. However, researchers and scientists in Africa are not taking advantage of the opportunity of increasingly available geospatial remote sensing technologies and data for yield studies. The objectives of this report are to (i) conduct a review of scientific literature on the current status of African yield gap analysis research and their variation in regard to soil properties management by using remote sensing techniques; (ii) review and describe optimal yield practices in Africa; and (iii) identify gaps and limitations to higher yields in African smallholder farms and propose possible improvements. Our literature reviewed 80 publications and covered a period of 22 years (1998-2020) over many selected African countries with a potential yield improvement. Our results found that (i) the number of agriculture yield-focused remote sensing studies has gradually increased, with the largest proportion of studies published during the last 15 years; (ii) most studies were conducted exclusively using multispectral Landsat and Sentinel sensors; and (iii) over the past decade, hyperspectral imagery has contributed to a better understanding of yield gap analysis compared to multispectral imagery; (iv) soil nutrients (i.e., NPK) are not the main factor influencing the studied crop productivity in Africa, whereas clay, SOC, and soil pH were the most examined soil properties in prior papers.

TI  - Surgical Treatment of Intercostal Brachial Nerve Pain after Mastectomy and Axillary Dissection
T2  - PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY-GLOBAL OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Postmastectomy chronic pain describes chronic pain in the anterior aspect of the thorax, axilla, and/or upper half of the arm present after surgical treatment of breast cancer and persistent for more than 3 months. The most common cause of this syndrome is damage to the intercostal brachial nerve. Current methods of treatment include medications, physical therapy, and peripheral nerve blocks. The literature lacks data regarding surgical interventions for intercostal brachial nerve pain in the postmastectomy and axillary dissection breast cancer patient. We discuss a case of a 47-year-old woman with left breast cancer status post-nipple-sparing mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy complicated by refractory dysesthesias in the intercostal brachial nerve distribution. Axillary exploration demonstrated a surgical clip with an associated neuroma of a branch of the intercostal brachial nerve. Excision and repair resulted in immediate pain relief in the postoperative period. We propose a comprehensive treatment algorithm to address postmastectomy pain attributed to intercostal brachial nerve pathology.

TI  - An Implementation of Open Source-Based Software as a Service (SaaS) to Produce TOA and TOC Reflectance of High-Resolution KOMPSAT-3/3A Satellite Image
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The majority of cloud applications are created or delivered to provide users with access to system resources or prebuilt processing algorithms for efficient data storage, management, and production. The number of cases linking cloud computing to the use of global observation satellite data continues to rise, owing to the benefits of cloud computing. This study aims to develop a cloud software as a service (SaaS) that yields reflectance products in high-resolution Korea Multi-Purpose Satellite (KOMPSAT)-3/3A satellite images. The SaaS model was designed as three subsystems: a Calibration Processing System (CPS), a Request System for CPS supporting RESTful application programming interface (API), and a Web Interface Application System. Open-source components, libraries, and frameworks were used in this study's SaaS, including an OpenStack for infrastructure as a service. An absolute atmospheric correction scheme based on a Second Simulation of a Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6S) radiative transfer code with atmospheric variable inputs was used to generate the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) and top-of-canopy (TOC) reflectance products. The SaaS implemented in this study provides users with the absolute atmospheric calibration functionality to apply their KOMPSAT-3/3A satellite image set through a web browser and obtain output directly from this service. According to experiments to check the total performance time for images, bundled with four bands of red, green, blue, and near-infrared, it took approximately 4.88 min on average for the execution time to obtain all reflectance results since satellite images were registered into the SaaS. The SaaS model proposed and implemented in this study can be used as a reference model for the production system to generate reflectance products from other optical sensor images. In the future, SaaS, which offers professional analysis functions based on open source, is expected to grow and expand into new application fields for public users and communities.

TI  - Comparison of PM<sub>2.5</sub> in Seoul, Korea Estimated from the Various Ground-Based and Satellite AOD
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on multiple linear regression (MLR) models, we estimated the PM2.5 at Seoul using a number of aerosol optical depth (AOD) values obtained from ground-based and satellite remote sensing observations. To construct the MLR model, we consider various parameters related to the ambient meteorology and air quality. In general, all AOD values resulted in the high quality of PM2.5 estimation through the MLR method: mostly correlation coefficients >similar to 0.8. Among various polar-orbit satellite AODs, AOD values from the MODIS measurement contribute to better PM2.5 estimation. We also found that the quality of estimated PM2.5 shows some seasonal variation; the estimated PM2.5 values consistently have the highest correlation with in situ PM2.5 in autumn, but are not well established in winter, probably due to the difficulty of AOD retrieval in the winter condition. MLR modeling using spectral AOD values from the ground-based measurements revealed that the accuracy of PM2.5 estimation does not depend on the selected wavelength. Although all AOD values used in this study resulted in a reasonable accuracy range of PM2.5 estimation, our analyses of the difference in estimated PM2.5 reveal the importance of utilizing the proper AOD for the best quality of PM2.5 estimation.

TI  - Modelling of Vegetation Dynamics from Satellite Time Series to Determine Proglacial Primary Succession in the Course of Global Warming-A Case Study in the Upper Martell Valley (Eastern Italian Alps)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based long-term observations of vegetation cover development in combination with recent in-situ observations provide a basis to better understand the spatio-temporal changes of vegetation patterns, their sensitivity to climate drivers and thus climatic impact on proglacial landscape development. In this study we combined field investigations in the glacier forelands of Furkele-, Zufall- and Langenferner (Ortles-Cevedale group/Eastern Italian Alps) with four different Vegetation Indices (VI) from Landsat scenes in order to test the suitability for modelling an area-wide vegetation cover map by using a Bayesian beta regression model (RStan). Since the model with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as predictor showed the best results, it was used to calculate a vegetation cover time series (1986-2019). The alteration of the proglacial areas since the end of the Little Ice Age (LIA) was analyzed from digital elevation models based on Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data and areal images, orthophotos, historical maps and field mapping campaigns. Our results show that a massive glacier retreat with an area loss of 8.1 km(2) (56.9%; LIA-2019) resulted in a constant enlargement of the glacier forelands, which has a statistically significant impact on the degree of vegetation cover. The area covered by vegetation increased from 0.25 km(2) (5.6%) in 1986 to 0.90 km(2) (11.2%) in 2019 with a significant acceleration of the mean annual changing rate. As patterns of both densification processes and plant colonization at higher elevations can be reflected by the model results, we consider in-situ observations combined with NDVI time series to be powerful tools for monitoring vegetation cover changes in alpine proglacial areas.

TI  - Thirty Years of Land Use/Land Cover Changes and Their Impact on Urban Climate: A Study of Kano Metropolis, Nigeria
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urban expansion and the alteration of global land use/land cover (LULC) patterns have contributed substantially to the modification of urban climate, due to variations in Land Surface Temperature (LST). In this study, the LULC change dynamics of Kano metropolis, Nigeria, were analysed over the last three decades, i.e., 1990-2020, using multispectral satellite data to understand the impact of urbanization on LST in the study area. The Maximum Likelihood classification method and the Mono-window algorithm were utilised in classifying land uses and retrieving LST data. Spectral indices comprising the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) were also computed. A linear regression analysis was employed in order to examine the correlation between land surface temperature and the various spectral indices. The results indicate significant LULC changes and urban expansion of 152.55 sq. km from 1991 to 2020. During the study period, the city's barren land and water bodies declined by approximately 172.58 sq. km and 26.55 sq. km, respectively, while vegetation increased slightly by 46.58 sq. km. Further analysis showed a negative correlation between NDVI and LST with a Pearson determination coefficient (R-2) of 0.6145, 0.5644, 0.5402, and 0.5184 in 1991, 2000, 2010, and 2020 respectively. NDBI correlated positively with LST, having an R-2 of 0.4132 in 1991, 0.3965 in 2000, 0.3907 in 2010, and 0.3300 in 2020. The findings of this study provide critical climatic data useful to policy- and decision-makers in optimizing land use and mitigating the impact of urban heat through sustainable urban development.

TI  - Spatio-temporal Analysis of Shoreline Positional Change of Ondo State Coastline Using Remote Sensing and GIS: A Case Study of Ilaje Coastline at Ondo State in Nigeria
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Shoreline changes have been a major environmental concern to coastal geomorphologists, engineers' as well coastal ecologists as a result increased alteration in the ecological system of many coasts of the world. It is causing major coastal structure damage and requires harbour dredging. The current study aimed at integrating remote sensing, geographical information system, and statistical methods to monitor and quantify spatio-temporal shoreline dynamics along Ilaje Local Government, Ondo State, Nigeria over 31 years (1986-2017). Four multi-temporal and spectral Landsat satellite images were used to examine the shoreline changes for a long-term period (1986-2017), besides three short-term time intervals. Images were classified using supervised classification to map the land use land cover changes in the study area. Integrating the Digital Shoreline Analysis System version 4.3 tool within ArcGIS facilitated the quantification of shoreline changes via the End-Point Rate and Net Shoreline Movement statistical techniques. The study revealed a coastal length of about 80 km with both accretion and erosion processes actively shown along the coastline. About 40 km of the coastline was found to be accreting with an average of + 1.08 m/year followed by 35.4 km of coastal erosion with an average of - 1.40 m/year and 4.6 km of the coast more or less appears stable. The overall shoreline changes fall within high accretion (> + 1 to <= + 2) to high erosion (< - 1 to >= - 2) of shoreline classification. The results show significant erosion, which could impact high economic, social, and environmental costs. The study provides baseline information on shoreline dynamism in the coastline areas of Ilaje Ondo State which will serve as a veritable data for the sustainable control of coastal erosion in the study area and other shoreline with similar characteristics.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Changes of Methane Content in the Atmosphere for Selected Countries and Regions with High Methane Emission from Rice Cultivation
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Irrigated and flooded rice is associated with methane (CH4) emissions. CH4 is one of the most important anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHG) in the atmosphere. Nowadays, mapping CH4 content at a global scale is possible using satellite sensors. Sample of such a sensor is TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) placed on the Sentinel-5 Precursor (Sentinel-5P) satellite board. In this study, the evaluation of spatial-temporal changes in CH4 content in the atmosphere for selected countries and regions with high CH4 emissions from rice cultivation in 2019-2021 was performed. Visual evaluation of the spatial variability on CH4 content for the total study period indicates higher CH4 content for almost all areas with high rice concentration. This was confirmed by positive correlations between CH4 content in the atmosphere and estimated GHG emissions from croplands analyzed separately for each studied country/region. In addition, seasonal changes in CH4 content in the atmosphere were observed. The lowest CH4 content was observed at the beginning of the year (for the first quarter of the year) and the highest for the third quarter of the year. Moreover, a long-term increase in CH4 was noticed. Regression analysis revealed that the mean increase in CH4 content in most of the studied regions/countries was about 15 ppb per year. CH4 content evaluated with the use of satellite data from Sentinel-5P is a reliable data source and can be used for the analysis of temporal changes at various spatial scales, including regions and countries.

TI  - Chronic Oil Pollution from Vessels and Its Role in Background Pollution in the Southeastern Baltic Sea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The results of long-term satellite monitoring of oil pollution of the sea surface in the southeastern Baltic Sea (SEB) are discussed in this paper. From June 2004 to December 2020, in total, 2780 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images from different satellites were received and analyzed. There were 788 oil spills detected in the study area. The oil spills were concentrated along the main shipping routes in the SEB. The volume of the detected oil spills was estimated. The average size of the spill was about 2 km(2) or 0.8 m(3). Seasonal variability of oil pollution shows a decrease in the number of oil detections in the autumn-winter period, which is associated with the prevalence of unfavorable wind conditions that limit the use of SAR technology for oil spill detection and navigation for small ships. In situ measurements show that seasonal variation in the concentration of oil products in seawater is characterized by a maximum in April and a minimum in July. Since 2007, a decrease in oil detections has been observed for the entire Baltic Sea, including the study area. The interannual variability also shows a decrease in the concentration of oil products in the water column. In the southeastern Baltic Sea, the volume of oil products released yearly to the sea surface from ships does not exceed 0.1% of the average instantaneous presence of oil products in the water column.

TI  - Share of Discontinuities in the Ozone Concentration Data from Three Reanalyses
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ozone is a very important trace gas in the stratosphere and, thus, we need to know its time evolution over the globe. However, ground-based measurements are rare, especially in the Southern Hemisphere, and while satellite observations provide broader spatial coverage generally, they are not available everywhere. On the other hand, reanalysis data have regular spatial and temporal structure, which is beneficial for trend analysis, but temporal discontinuities might exist in the data. These discontinuities may influence the results of trend studies. The aim of this paper is to detect discontinuities in ozone data of the following reanalyses: MERRA-2, ERA-5 and JRA-55 with the help of the Pettitt, the Buishand, and the Standard Normal Homogeneity tests above the 500 hPa level. The share of discontinuities varies from 30% to 70% and they are strongly layer dependent. The share of discontinuities is the lowest for JRA-55. Differences between reanalyses were found to be larger than differences between homogeneity tests within one reanalysis. Another aim of this paper is to test the ability of homogeneity tests to detect the discontinuities in 2004 and 2015, when changes in versions of satellite data took place. We showed the discontinuities in 2004 are better detected than those in 2015.

TI  - The European bison (<i>Bison bonasus</i>) as an indicatory species for the circulation of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) in natural foci in Poland
T2  - TICKS AND TICK-BORNE DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is one of the most common zoonotic diseases in Europe transmitted by Ixodidae vectors. While small mammals such as bank voles and ticks constitute the main reservoirs for virus transmission, large sylvatic species act as a food source for ticks. Cervids such as roe deer and red deer are considered sentinel species for TBE in natural foci. In addition, an increase of the population size and density of large wild mammals in an area corresponds to an increase in the tick burden and may potentially increase the prevalence of TBE virus (TBEV) in ticks and tick hosts and further exposure risk in humans. Humans are considered accidental hosts. The prevalence of TBE relies on interactions between host, vector and environment. The present study examines the exposure of the largest European herbivore, the European bison (Bison bonasus) to TBEV infection. Assessed using the IMMUNOZYM FSME ELISA (PROGEN), the overall TBEV seroprevalence was 62.7% in the 335 European bison that were studied. ELISA results were confirmed by the gold-standard virus neutralization test (VNT) with 98.7% sensitivity and thus giving a true prevalence of 63.5%. TBEV seroprevalence was significantly correlated to the origin, age group, sex, population type (free living/captive) and sanitary status (healthy/selectively eliminated/found dead/killed in accident) of the European bison in the univariable analysis. The highest seroprevalences were observed in the three largest north-eastern wild populations (Bialowieska, Borecka and Knyszynska forests), which corresponded with the highest incidence of human cases reported in the country. The risk of TBEV seropositivity increased with age and was higher in female and free-ranging European bison. Additionally, to the epidemiological investigation, the continuous detection of TBEV antibodies was studied by repetitive testing of animals over the course of 34 months. Two of six seropositive animals remained seropositive throughout the study. The presence of antibodies was followed throughout the study in seropositive European bison and for at least a year in animals that seroconverted during the observation period.

TI  - Suitable Land-Use and Land-Cover Allocation Scenarios to Minimize Sediment and Nutrient Loads into Kwan Phayao, Upper Ing Watershed, Thailand
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Human activity and land-use changes have affected the water quality of Kwan Phayao, Upper Ing watershed, due to the associated high sediment load and eutrophication. This study aims to identify suitable LULC allocation scenarios for minimizing sediment and nutrient export into the lake. For this purpose, the LULC status and change were first assessed, based on classified LULC data in 2009 and 2019 from Landsat images, using the SVM algorithm. Later, the land requirements of three scenarios between 2020 and 2029 were estimated, based on their characteristics, and applied to predict LULC change using the CLUE-S model. Then, actual LULC data in 2019 and predicted LULC data under three scenarios between 2020 and 2029 were used to estimate sediment and nutrient export using the SDR and NDR models. Finally, the ecosystem service change index identified a suitable LULC allocation for minimizing sediment or/and nutrient export. According to the results, LULC status and change indicated perennial trees and orchards, para rubber, and rangeland increased, while forest land and paddy fields decreased. The land requirements of the three scenarios provided reasonable results, as expected, particularly Scenario II, which adopts linear programming to calculate the land requirements for maximizing ecosystem service values. For sediment and nutrient export estimation under the predicted LULC for the three scenarios, Scenario II led to the lowest yield of sediment and nutrient exports, and provided the lowest average ESCI value among the three scenarios. Thus, the LULC allocation under Scenario II was chosen as suitable for minimizing sediment or/and nutrient export into Kwan Phayao. These results can serve as crucial information to minimize sediment and nutrient loads for land-use planners, land managers, and decision makers.

TI  - Postmastectomy radiotherapy: a review
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of review We review the role of postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) in the management of patients with early breast cancer. Recent findings PMRT in patients with 4 or more involved axillary lymph nodes is the current standard of care but the indications for PMRT in patients with 1-3 involved nodes remain controversial. The Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group meta-analysis of randomised trials of PMRT provides the most comprehensive level 1 evidence base. However, its applicability in contemporary practice in the context of recent multidisciplinary advances in surgery, radiation therapy and systemic therapy remains challenging. The lack of consensus on the indications for PMRT in patients with 1-3 positive nodes underpins the variations in the national and international guidelines on PMRT. We emphasise the need for contemporary randomised trial data, and the potential to refine patient selection for PMRT using novel biomarkers of recurrence and radiosensitivity.

TI  - High-Throughput CRISPR Screens To Dissect Macrophage-<i>Shigella</i> Interactions
T2  - MBIO
M3  - Article
AB  - Shigellosis causes most diarrheal deaths worldwide, particularly affecting children. Shigella invades and replicates in the epithelium of the large intestine, eliciting inflammation and tissue destruction. To understand how Shigella rewires macrophages prior to epithelium invasion, we performed genome-wide and focused secondary CRISPR knockout and CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screens in Shigella flexneri-infected human monocytic THP-1 cells. Knockdown of the Toll-like receptor 1/2 signaling pathway significantly reduced proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine production, enhanced host cell survival, and controlled intracellular pathogen growth. Knockdown of the enzymatic component of the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex enhanced THP-1 cell survival. Small-molecule inhibitors blocking key components of these pathways had similar effects; these were validated with human monocyte-derived macrophages, which closely mimic the in vivo physiological state of macrophages postinfection. High-throughput CRISPR screens can elucidate how S. flexneri triggers inflammation and redirects host pyruvate catabolism for energy acquisition before killing macrophages, pointing to new shigellosis therapies.IMPORTANCE Treatment for shigellosis is becoming increasingly difficult as resistance to antibiotics becomes more prevalent. One way to prevent this significant public health problem from developing into a full-blown crisis is to approach shigellosis intervention from the point of view of the host. So far, little is known about the specific biological pathways that might be modulated in macrophages, sentinel cells of the innate immune system, to strengthen the response to Shigella infection. In this work, we conducted CRISPR screens to comprehensively decipher the complexity of macrophage-Shigella interactions and to discover new potential therapeutic interventions against Shigella flexneri infection. Our work highlights systematic genetic perturbation strategies to provide direct causal evidence showing how intracellular pathogens manipulate innate immune cells.

TI  - Comparison of Low-Cost Commercial Unpiloted Digital Aerial Photogrammetry to Airborne Laser Scanning across Multiple Forest Types in California, USA
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Science-based forest management requires quantitative estimation of forest attributes traditionally collected via sampled field plots in a forest inventory program. Three-dimensional (3D) remotely sensed data such as Light Detection and Ranging (lidar), are increasingly utilized to supplement and even replace field-based forest inventories. However, lidar remains cost prohibitive for smaller areas and repeat measurements, often limiting its use to single acquisitions of large contiguous areas. Recent advancements in unpiloted aerial systems (UAS), digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP) and high precision global positioning systems (HPGPS) have the potential to provide low-cost time and place flexible 3D data to support forest inventory and monitoring. The primary objective of this study was to assess the ability of low-cost commercial off the shelf UAS DAP and HPGPS to create accurate 3D data and predictions of key forest attributes, as compared to both lidar and field observations, in a wide range of forest conditions in California, USA. A secondary objective was to assess the accuracy of nadir vs. off-nadir UAS DAP, to determine if oblique imagery provides more accurate 3D data and forest attribute predictions. UAS DAP digital terrain models (DTMs) were comparable to lidar DTMS across most sites and nadir vs. off-nadir imagery collection (R-2 = 0.74-0.99), although model accuracy using off-nadir imagery was very low in mature Douglas-fir forest (R-2 = 0.17) due to high canopy density occluding the ground from the image sensor. Surface and canopy height models were shown to have less agreement to lidar (R-2 = 0.17-0.69), with off-nadir imagery surface models at high canopy density sites having the lowest agreement with lidar. UAS DAP models predicted key forest metrics with varying accuracy compared to field data (R-2 = 0.53-0.85), and were comparable to predictions made using lidar. Although lidar provided more accurate estimates of forest attributes across a range of forest conditions, this study shows that UAS DAP models, when combined with low-cost HPGPS, can accurately predict key forest attributes across a range of forest types, canopies densities, and structural conditions.

TI  - The Many Faces of Evangelicalism: Identifying Subgroups Using Latent Class Analysis
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGION AND SPIRITUALITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The current study used latent class analysis to identify subgroups of collegiate Christian evangelicals and to compare them on a range of cross-sectional and longitudinal indicators of personal attitudes and campus climate. Items from the Interfaith Diversity Experiences and Attitudes Longitudinal Survey (IDEALS) formed the basis of this study. We identified 3 subgroups who differed in terms of their appreciation of outside groups, knowledge of other groups, and ratings of campus climate. Our results provide insight into the evangelical experience in higher education and provide additional support for the argument that "evangelical" should be viewed as a heterogeneous population.

TI  - Automated Training Data Generation from Spectral Indexes for Mapping Surface Water Extent with Sentinel-2 Satellite Imagery at 10 m and 20 m Resolutions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents an automated methodology to generate training data for surface water mapping from a single Sentinel-2 granule at 10 m (4 band, VIS/NIR) or 20 m (9 band, VIS/NIR/SWIR) resolution without the need for ancillary training data layers. The 20 m method incorporates an ensemble of three spectral indexes with optimal band thresholds, whereas the 10 m method achieves similar results using fewer bands and a single spectral index. A spectrally balanced and randomly generated set of training data based on the index values and optimal thresholds is used to fit machine learning classifiers. Statistical validation compares the 20 m ensemble-only method to the 20 m ensemble method with a random forest classifier. Results show the 20 m ensemble-only method had an overall accuracy of 89.5% (& PLUSMN;1.7%), whereas the ensemble method combined with the random forest classifier performed better, with a ~4.8% higher overall accuracy: 20 m method (94.3% (& PLUSMN;1.3%)) with optimal spectral index and SWIR thresholds of -0.03 and 800, respectively, and 10 m method (93.4% (& PLUSMN;1.5%)) with optimal spectral index and NIR thresholds of -0.01 and 800, respectively. Comparison of other supervised classifiers trained automatically with the framework typically resulted in less than 1% accuracy improvement compared with the random forest, suggesting that training data quality is more important than classifier type. This straightforward framework enables accurate surface water classification across diverse geographies, making it ideal for development into a decision support tool for water resource managers.

TI  - Satellite Image Processing for the Coarse-Scale Investigation of Sandy Coastal Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, satellite imagery has shown its potential to support the sustainable management of land, water, and natural resources. In particular, it can provide key information about the properties and behavior of sandy beaches and the surrounding vegetation, improving the ecomorphological understanding and modeling of coastal dynamics. Although satellite image processing usually demands high memory and computational resources, free online platforms such as Google Earth Engine (GEE) have recently enabled their users to leverage cloud-based tools and handle big satellite data. In this technical note, we describe an algorithm to classify the coastal land cover and retrieve relevant information from Sentinel-2 and Landsat image collections at specific times or in a multitemporal way: the extent of the beach and vegetation strips, the statistics of the grass cover, and the position of the shoreline and the vegetation-sand interface. Furthermore, we validate the algorithm through both quantitative and qualitative methods, demonstrating the goodness of the derived classification (accuracy of approximately 90%) and showing some examples about the use of the algorithm's output to study coastal physical and ecological dynamics. Finally, we discuss the algorithm's limitations and potentialities in light of its scaling for global analyses.

TI  - Radio Frequency Interference Detection and Localization in Sentinel-1 Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The C-band Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images are affected by radio frequency interference (RFI), and this article proposes an RFI detection and localization method for these images. First, a detailed analysis of RFI based on the generation mechanism is provided, which shows that RFI in the ground range detected (GRD) products differs from common backscattering not only in frequency spectrums but also in radiometric characteristics. Then, an RFI index (RFII) is proposed for RFI detection, which takes full advantage of unique RFI characteristics in dual-polarization GRD images. Finally, both detection results in ascending and descending passes are used to locate the ground RFI sources, assuming that the presence of RFI is persistent. Theoretical analyses show that the location area is a diamond of approximately 88.76 km(2). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performs quite well on Sentinel-1 GRD data. It provides a convenient and tractable tool for assessing Sentinel-1 data quality as well as for monitoring RFI. Thus, Sentinel-1 measurements can be used to monitor C-band RFI, which is an important task of electromagnetic spectrum management.

TI  - Assessment of potential variability of cadmium and copper trace metals using hindcast estimates
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Trace metals are vital to primary productivity and play an essential role as main components in regulating oceanic biogeochemical cycles. Dissolved and particulate trace metals within the water column may vary due to primary production, temperature, and nutrient changes, factors that may also vary spatially and temporally. Furthermore, assessment of trace metals mainly relies on in situ observation, and so wide-area investigation of trace-metal concentration may be challenging and subject to technical constraints. A specific approach is therefore necessary that combines biogeochemical proxies, satellite data, and trace-metal linear correlation. This study aims to assess the potential spatio-temporal variability of sea surface cadmium (Cd) and copper (Cu) concentrations in Indonesian seas and surrounding areas. The correlations of Cd and Cu concentrations with primary production and nutrient data were used to convert hindcast satellite data into estimates of the metals' concentrations. The potential variability of trace metals can be determined by overlaying both data. Indonesia's Fisheries Management Areas (FMAs) were used for data clustering and analysis. The results show that Cd and Cu trace metals have similar distribution patterns throughout the year. However, dissolved Cu has a more diverse coverage area than dissolved Cd, including within the Halmahera, Seram, and Maluku Seas (FMAs 716 and 717), the Makassar Strait (FMA 717), and the Java-Sumatra upwelling area (FMA 573). Both Cd and Cu concentrations in the Java-Sumatra upwelling region follow the periodic upwelling pattern. Overall, both Cd and Cu show a declining trend in concentration from 2012 to 2019. It is estimated that dissolved Cd concentration declined from 1500-2000 pmol/kg in 2012 to 1000-1500 pmol/kg in 2019 for all locations. Dissolved Cu concentration decreased from 30-35 nmol/kg in 2012 to 25-30 nmol/kg in 2019. Estimated dissolved Cd and Cu follow the linear functions of silicate (SiO4), nitrate (NO3), and primary productivity. The fluctuation of anthropogenic activities and global warming are likely to indirectly impact the decline in metal concentrations by affecting nutrients and primary productivity.

TI  - A Machine Learning Based Downscaling Approach to Produce High Spatio-Temporal Resolution Land Surface Temperature of the Antarctic Dry Valleys from MODIS Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To monitor environmental and biological processes, Land Surface Temperature (LST) is a central variable, which is highly variable in space and time. This particularly applies to the Antarctic Dry Valleys, which host an ecosystem highly adapted to the extreme conditions in this cold desert. To predict possible climate induced changes on the Dry Valley ecosystem, high spatial and temporal resolution environmental variables are needed. Thus we enhanced the spatial resolution of the MODIS satellite LST product that is sensed sub-daily at a 1 km spatial resolution to a 30 m spatial resolution. We employed machine learning models that are trained using Landsat 8 thermal infrared data from 2013 to 2019 as a reference to predict LST at 30 m resolution. For the downscaling procedure, terrain derived variables and information on the soil type as well as the solar insolation were used as potential predictors in addition to MODIS LST. The trained model can be applied to all available MODIS scenes from 1999 onward to develop a 30 m resolution LST product of the Antarctic Dry Valleys. A spatio-temporal validation revealed an R2 of 0.78 and a RMSE of 3.32 & LCIRC;C. The downscaled LST will provide a valuable surface climate data set for various research applications, such as species distribution modeling, climate model evaluation, and the basis for the development of further relevant environmental information such as the surface moisture distribution.

TI  - Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithms in Automatic Identification and Extraction of Water Boundaries
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring open water bodies accurately is important for assessing the role of ecosystem services in the context of human survival and climate change. There are many methods available for water body extraction based on remote sensing images, such as the normalized difference water index (NDWI), modified NDWI (MNDWI), and machine learning algorithms. Based on Landsat-8 remote sensing images, this study focuses on the effects of six machine learning algorithms and three threshold methods used to extract water bodies, evaluates the transfer performance of models applied to remote sensing images in different periods, and compares the differences among these models. The results are as follows. (1) Various algorithms require different numbers of samples to reach their optimal consequence. The logistic regression algorithm requires a minimum of 110 samples. As the number of samples increases, the order of the optimal model is support vector machine, neural network, random forest, decision tree, and XGBoost. (2) The accuracy evaluation performance of each machine learning on the test set cannot represent the local area performance. (3) When these models are directly applied to remote sensing images in different periods, the AUC indicators of each machine learning algorithm for three regions all show a significant decline, with a decrease range of 0.33-66.52%, and the differences among the different algorithm performances in the three areas are obvious. Generally, the decision tree algorithm has good transfer performance among the machine learning algorithms with area under curve (AUC) indexes of 0.790, 0.518, and 0.697 in the three areas, respectively, and the average value is 0.668. The Otsu threshold algorithm is the optimal among threshold methods, with AUC indexes of 0.970, 0.617, and 0.908 in the three regions respectively and an average AUC of 0.832.

TI  - Attention Enhanced U-Net for Building Extraction from Farmland Based on Google and WorldView-2 Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution remote sensing images contain abundant building information and provide an important data source for extracting buildings, which is of great significance to farmland preservation. However, the types of ground features in farmland are complex, the buildings are scattered and may be obscured by clouds or vegetation, leading to problems such as a low extraction accuracy in the existing methods. In response to the above problems, this paper proposes a method of attention-enhanced U-Net for building extraction from farmland, based on Google and WorldView-2 remote sensing images. First, a Resnet unit is adopted as the infrastructure of the U-Net network encoding part, then the spatial and channel attention mechanism module is introduced between the Resnet unit and the maximum pool and the multi-scale fusion module is added to improve the U-Net network. Second, the buildings found on WorldView-2 and Google images are extracted through farmland boundary constraints. Third, boundary optimization and fusion processing are carried out for the building extraction results on the WorldView-2 and Google images. Fourth, a case experiment is performed. The method in this paper is compared with semantic segmentation models, such as FCN8, U-Net, Attention_UNet, and DeepLabv3+. The experimental results indicate that this method attains a higher accuracy and better effect in terms of building extraction within farmland; the accuracy is 97.47%, the F1 score is 85.61%, the recall rate (Recall) is 93.02%, and the intersection of union (IoU) value is 74.85%. Hence, buildings within farming areas can be effectively extracted, which is conducive to the preservation of farmland.

TI  - Assessment of Urban Ecological Quality and Spatial Heterogeneity Based on Remote Sensing: A Case Study of the Rapid Urbanization of Wuhan City
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization significantly affects the productivity of the terrestrial ecosystem and the foundation of regional ecosystem services, thereby detrimentally influencing the ecological environment and urban ecological security. The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) also require accurate and timely assessments of where people live in order to develop, implement and monitor sustainable development policies. Sustainable development also emphasizes the process of protecting the ecological environment for future generations while maintaining the current needs of mankind. We propose a comprehensive evaluation method for urban ecological quality (UEQ) using Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI/TIRS images to extract remote sensing information representing four ecological elements, namely humidity, greenness, heat and dryness. An improved comprehensive remote sensing ecological index (IRSEI) evaluation model is constructed by combining the entropy weight method and principal component analysis. This modeling is applied to the city of Wuhan, China, from 1995 to 2020. Spatial autocorrelation analysis was conducted on the geographic clusters of the IRSEI. The results show that (1) from 1995 to 2015, the mean IRSEI of Wuhan city decreased from 0.60 to 0.47, indicating that environmental deterioration overwhelmed improvements; (2) the global Moran's I for IRSEI ranged from 0.535 to 0.592 from 1995 to 2020, indicating significant heterogeneity in its spatial distribution, highlighting that high and low clusters gradually developed at the edge of the city and at the city center, respectively; (3) the high clusters are mainly distributed in the Huangpi and Jiangxia districts, and the low clusters at the city center, which exhibits a dense population and intense human activity. This paper uses remote sensing index methods to evaluate UEQ as a scientific theoretical basis for the improvement of UEQ, the control of UEQ and the formulation of urban sustainable development strategies in the future. Our results show that the UEQ method is a low-cost, feasible and simple technique that can be used for territorial spatial control and spatiotemporal urban sustainable development.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Fusion of One-Pair Image Based on Enhanced Super-Resolution Network
T2  - LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to high-quality earth observation requires spatiotemporal continuous high-resolution remote sensing images, the research on spatiotemporal fusion is widely carried out and focused on Landsat and MODIS satellites. At present, the method of spatiotemporal fusion using convolutional neural networks has been proposed, but the network is shallow, so the fusion performance is limited. Aiming at the most widely used one-pair image spatiotemporal fusion, a new spatiotemporal fusion method based on deep neural network is established. Firstly, the basic network framework consists of two cascaded upsamplers with quadruple magnification to approximate the spatial difference and sensor difference between Landsat and MODIS satellites. Then, the residual error between the reconstructed image and the real image is learned by the convolutional neural network to make the reconstructed image closer to the real image. Moreover, the time prediction is carried out by highpass moduation strategy. Finally, the proposed method is tested on different Landsat and MODIS satellite images and compared with many spatiotemporal fusion algorithms. The experimental results show that, compared with the existing fusion algorithms, the reconstruction effect of the proposed method is better and the processing speed is faster.

TI  - A cloud-based toolbox for the versatile environmental annotation of biodiversity data
T2  - PLOS BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A vast range of research applications in biodiversity sciences requires integrating primary species, genetic, or ecosystem data with other environmental data. This integration requires a consideration of the spatial and temporal scale appropriate for the data and processes in question. But a versatile and scale flexible environmental annotation of biodiversity data remains constrained by technical hurdles. Existing tools have streamlined the intersection of occurrence records with gridded environmental data but have remained limited in their ability to address a range of spatial and temporal grains, especially for large datasets. We present the Spatiotemporal Observation Annotation Tool (STOAT), a cloud-based toolbox for flexible biodiversity-environment annotations. STOAT is optimized for large biodiversity datasets and allows user-specified spatial and temporal resolution and buffering in support of environmental characterizations that account for the uncertainty and scale of data and of relevant processes. The tool offers these services for a growing set of near global, remotely sensed, or modeled environmental data, including Landsat, MODIS, EarthEnv, and CHELSA. STOAT includes a user-friendly, web-based dashboard that provides tools for annotation task management and result visualization, linked to Map of Life, and a dedicated R package (rstoat) for programmatic access. We demonstrate STOAT functionality with several examples that illustrate phenological variation and spatial and temporal scale dependence of environmental characteristics of birds at a continental scale. We expect STOAT to facilitate broader exploration and assessment of the scale dependence of observations and processes in ecology.

TI  - APPLICATION OF RANDOM FOREST IN IDENTIFYING WINTER WHEAT USING LANDSAT8 IMAGERY
T2  - ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA
M3  - Article
AB  - Mastering accurate spatial planting and distribution status of the crops is significantly important for the nation to guide the agricultural production and formulate agricultural policies from a macro perspective. In this paper, the Landsat-8 OLI satellite images were taken as the data sources. And as for the nine crop types within the study area, such as the wheat, rice, and other crops, three classification methods of the random forest classification (RFC), the support vector machine (SVM), and the maximum likelihood classification (MLC) were applied in extracting the planting area of winter wheat in Wushi County of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. It can be seen from the results that, general classification accuracy of MLC, SVM, and RFC are respectively 80.58%, 87.95%, and 95.96%, while their Kappa coefficients are respectively 0.61, 0.76, and 0.86. The RFC method shows higher classification accuracy that those of MLC and SVM methods. The principal component analysis (PCA) was carried out on the original 7-band image to extract the first 4 principal components and calculate the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), wide dynamic range vegetation index (WDRVI), and normalized difference water index (NDWI). Meanwhile, the 6 additional auxiliary feature bands were superimposed on the original 7-band images to carry out reclassification, through which, the general accuracy of MLC increased by 3 percent while its Kappa coefficient increased by 0.06; the SVM general accuracy increased by 3.02 percent while its Kappa coefficient increased by 0.13; and the general accuracy of the RFC increased by 0.85 percent while its Kappa coefficient increased by 0.02. This indicates that, the adding of auxiliary information can improve the crop classification and identification ability and accuracy. Based on the comprehensive evaluation, the classification method of random forest is proved to have better performance in winter wheat identification.

TI  - A modified first-order vegetation model for soil moisture retrieval in wheat fields using Sentinel-1 data
T2  - DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is an important factor affecting crop growth. In our work, the aim of this paper is to retrieve volumetric soil moisture in wheat fields using Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. In order to eliminate the effect of wheat cover, we used a first-order vegetation model and improved the model. Then the support vector regression technique was used to retrieve soil moisture and validate the performance using experimental data. Three experimental campaigns were conducted in the Hebi, Northeastern Henan in different periods of wheat growth in 2019, with simultaneous satellite overpass. Compared with the water cloud model, the retrieved soil moisture given by the modified first-order vegetation model agreed better with field measurements, the R2 and root mean square error value of this modified first-order vegetation model was (0.847, 0.015), (0.901, 0.016) and (0.936, 0.014) for the three experiments respectively. The results show that the modified first-order vegetation model based on the Sentinel-1 SAR data satisfied the requirement of soil moisture retrieval in the study region.

TI  - Prediction of Regional Forest Soil Nutrients Based on Gaofen-1 Remote Sensing Data
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The study on the spatial distribution of forest soil nutrients is important not only as a reference for understanding the factors affecting soil variability, but also for the rational use of soil resources and the establishment of a virtuous cycle of forest ecosystems. The rapid development of remote sensing satellites provides an excellent opportunity to improve the accuracy of forest soil prediction models. This study aimed to explore the utility of the Gaofen-1 (GF-1) satellite in the forest soil mapping model in Luoding City, Yunfu City, Guangdong Province, Southeast China. We used 1000 m resolution coarse-resolution soil map to represent the overall regional soil nutrient status, 12.5 m resolution terrain-hydrology variables to reflect the detailed spatial distribution of soil nutrients, and 8 m resolution remote sensing variables to reflect the surface vegetation status to build terrain-hydrology artificial neural network (ANN) models and full variable ANNs, respectively. The prediction objects were alkali-hydro-nitrogen (AN), available phosphorus (AP), available potassium (AK), and organic matter (OM) at five soil depths (0-20, 20-40, 40-60, 60-80, and 80-100 cm). The results showed that the full-variable ANN accuracy at five soil depths was better than the terrain-hydrology ANNs, indicating that remote sensing variables reflecting vegetation status can improve the prediction of forest soil nutrients. The remote sensing variables had different effectiveness for different soil nutrients and different depths. In upper soil layers (0-20 and 20-40 cm), remote sensing variables were more useful for AN, AP, and OM, and were between 10%-14% (R-2), and less effective for AK at only 8% and 6% (R-2). In deep soil layers (40-60, 60-80, and 80-100 cm), the improvement of all soil nutrient models was not significant, between 3 and 6% (R-2). RMSE and ROA & PLUSMN; 5% also decreased with the depth of soil. Remote sensing ANNs (coarse resolution soil maps + remote sensing variables) further demonstrated that the predictive power of remote sensing data decreases with soil depth. Compared to terrain-hydrological variables, remote sensing variables perform better at 0-20 cm, but the predictive power decreased rapidly with depth. In conclusion, the results of the study showed that the integration of remote sensing with coarse-resolution soil maps and terrain-hydrology variables could strongly improve upper forest soil (0-40 cm) nutrients prediction and NDVI, green band, and forest types were the best remote sensing predictors. In addition, the study area is rich in AN and OM, while AP and AK are scarce. Therefore, to improve forest health, attention should be paid to monitoring and managing AN, AP, AK, and OM levels.

TI  - A Method for Deriving Relative Humidity From MODIS Data Under All-Sky Conditions
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Relative humidity (RH) is one of the key variables for understanding the water, energy, and carbon exchange between the Earth and the atmosphere. Traditional methods for deriving RH from remotely sensed data usually require ground meteorological observations or are limited to clear-sky conditions, thereby making it a significant challenge to obtain spatially complete RH under all-sky conditions, especially over the regions with sparse meteorological instruments for observation. To this end, a new approach for deriving all-sky RH entirely based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data was proposed in the present study. Two key assumptions in the approach under cloudy conditions are that the actual water vapor is linearly related to the total precipitable water vapor (PWV) and that air temperature is linearly related to land surface temperature (LST). Results from a total of 30 AmeriFlux stations proved the aforementioned assumptions based on MODIS data collected over a study period of three years from 2009 to 2011. For different aridity conditions, RH retrieval revealed reasonable accuracy with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of approximately 15.3% over an arid and semiarid region, whereas a comparable RMSE of 17.0% was obtained over a humid area. Further results also indicated that the aforementioned linear relationships were generally temporally stable, thereby indicating that the proposed method can be used to obtain all-sky RH at a regional or global scale entirely based on MOD06_L2-derived LST and MOD05_L2-derived PWV data given that the assumed linear relationships can be easily determined by historical MOD07_L2-derived atmospheric profiles.

TI  - Accurate Refraction Correction-Assisted Bathymetric Inversion Using ICESat-2 and Multispectral Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Shallow-water depth information is essential for ship navigation and fishery farming. However, the accurate acquisition of shallow-water depth has been a challenge for marine mapping. Combining Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) bathymetry data with multispectral data, satellite-derived bathymetry is a promising solution through which to obtain bathymetric information quickly and accurately. This study proposes a photon refraction correction method considering sea-surface undulations to address errors in the underwater photons obtained by the ICESat-2. First, the instantaneous sea surface and beam emission angle are integrated to determine the sea-surface incidence angle. Next, the distance of photon propagation in water is determined using sea-surface undulation and Snell's law. Finally, position correction is performed through geometric relationships. The corrected photons were combined with the multispectral data for bathymetric inversion, and a bathymetric map of the Yongle Atoll area was obtained. A bathymetric chart was created using the corrected photons and the multispectral data in the Yongle Atoll. Comparing the results of different refraction correction methods with the data measured shows that the refraction correction method proposed in this paper can effectively correct bathymetry errors: the root mean square error is 1.48 m and the R2 is 0.86.

TI  - Decoupling the Effect of Climate and Land-Use Changes on Carbon Sequestration of Vegetation in Mideast Hunan Province, China
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization and global climate change are two important global environmental phenomena in the 21st century. Human activities and climate changes usually increase the uncertainties of the ecosystem functions and structures and can greatly affect regional landscape patterns and the carbon cycle. Consequently, it is critical to understand how various climate and land-use changes influence the carbon dynamics at a regional scale. In this study, we quantitatively analyzed the spatial and temporal changes of net primary productivity (NPP) and the effects of climate factors and human disturbance factors (i.e., land-use changes) on the "Chang-Zhu-Tan " (CZT) urban agglomeration region from 2000 to 2015. The Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model was combined with spatially explicit land-use maps, monthly climate data, and MODIS NDVI images to simulate the carbon dynamics in the CZT area. Based on our six different scenarios, we also analyzed the relative roles of climate change and land-use change in total production. Our results indicated that the annual NPP of the study area maintained an upward trend by 7.31 gC & BULL;m(-2)& BULL;yr(-1) between 2000 and 2015. At the same time, the average annual NPP was 628.99 gC & BULL;m(-2) in the CZT area. We also found that the NPP was lower in the middle of the north region than in others. In addition, land-use changes could contribute to a positive effect on the total production in the study area by 3.42 T gC. Meanwhile, the effect of climate changes on the total production amounted to -1.44 T gC in the same region and period. Temperature and precipitation had negative effects on carbon sequestration from 2000 to 2015. As forest land constituted over 62.60% of the total land use from 2000 to 2015, the negative effect of carbon sequestration caused by urbanization could be ignored in the CZT area. Although climate and land-use changes had simultaneously positive and negative effects during the period 2000-2015, prioritizing the protection of existing forest land could contribute to increasing carbon sequestration and storage at the regional scale. Our study assists in understanding the impact of climate changes and land-use changes on carbon sequestration while providing a scientific basis for the rational and effective protection of the ecological environment in mid-east Hunan Province, China.

TI  - The Potential of Moonlight Remote Sensing: A Systematic Assessment with Multi-Source Nightlight Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - One recent trend in optical remote sensing is to increase observation frequencies. However, there are still challenges on the night side when sunlight is not available. Due to their powerful capabilities in low-light sensing, nightlight satellite sensors have been deployed to capture nightscapes of Earth from space, observing anthropomorphic and natural activities at night. To date, the mainstream of nightlight remote sensing applications has mainly focused on artificial lights, especially within cities or self-luminous bodies, such as fisheries, oil, offshore rigs, etc. Observations taken under moonlight are often discarded or corrected to reduce lunar effects. Some researchers have discussed the possibility of using moonlight as a useful illuminating source at night for the detection of nocturnal features on Earth, but no quantitative analysis has been reported so far. This study aims to systematically evaluate the potential of moonlight remote sensing with mono-spectral Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite/Day-Night-Band (VIIRS/DNB) imagery and multi-spectral photos taken by astronauts from the International Space Station (ISS), as well as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) night-time imagery. Using the VIIRS/DNB, ISS and UAV moonlight images, the possibilities of the moonlight remote sensing were first discussed. Then, the VIIRS/DNB, ISS, UAV images were classified over different non-self-lighting land surfaces to explore the potential of moonlight remote sensing. The overall accuracies (OA) and kappa coefficients are 79.80% and 0.45, 87.16% and 0.77, 91.49% and 0.85, respectively, indicating a capability to characterize land surface that is very similar to daytime remote sensing. Finally, the characteristics of current moonlight remote sensing are discussed in terms of bands, spatial resolutions, and sensors. The results confirm that moonlight remote sensing has huge potential for Earth observation, which will be of great importance to significantly increase the temporal coverage of optical remote sensing during the whole diurnal cycle. Based on these discussions, we further examined requirements for next-generation nightlight remote sensing satellite sensors.

TI  - Penetration Depth Inversion in Hyperarid Desert From L-Band InSAR Data Based on a Coherence Scattering Model
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The potential of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) for subsurface height estimation has long been recognized; however, this method is greatly limited by the data sources and the various errors encountered in a highly dynamic environment such as a desert. In this letter, a coherence scattering model based on the volume coherence and imaging geometry of the InSAR acquisitions is proposed to retrieve the penetration depth of the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) signal in a hyperarid desert area. The proposed method includes two main parts: 1) the dielectric constant of the study area is first derived by employing an empirical model with the L-band SAR data, and then, the results are used to calibrate the vertical effective wavenumber after the refraction process and 2) together with the extracted volume coherence from the SAR data, the scattering model is employed to retrieve the penetration depth. The application scope of the vertical effective wavenumber in the volume and temporal decorrelation effect of the model is also discussed in this letter. The method was tested with the Advanced Land Observing Satellite-1 (ALOS-1) Phased Array-type L-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) data from a desert area in southeast Libya. The results show that the average penetration depth of the L-band SAR in the study area is 2.98 m, and the standard deviation is 1.06 m.

In the operational system, the MWRI geolocation accuracy reaches 1 pixel, and there still exists room for improvement. In this article, we improve upon the coastline inflection point method (CIM) and propose to assign the accurate correspondence by employing a nonrigid point set registration method. First, the method identifies a set of latent variables to recognize outliers and then applies nonparametric geometric constraints to the correspondence as a priori distribution. Second, the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation is applied by the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to obtain correct inliers. The comparison with other methods demonstrates that the proposed method can provide more accurate estimation of geolocation bias. In addition, the pixel error and changes in spacecraft attitude with the long-term geolocation data in FY-3C MWRI before and after correction were analyzed during the period from April 1 to August 30, 2018. The results have shown that the geolocation errors are reduced from [0.50, 0.60] pixels to [0.20, 0.33] pixels in the along- and cross-track directions after the attitude correction. In addition, the reduction of the standard deviation shows that the geolocation quality of MWRI is improved.

TI  - Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 Observations for Harmful Algae Blooms in a Small Eutrophic Lake
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Widespread harmful cyanobacterial bloom is one of the most pressing concerns in lakes and reservoirs, resulting in a lot of negative ecological consequences and threatening public health. Ocean color instruments with low spatial resolution have been used to monitor cyanobacterial bloom in large lakes; however, they cannot be applied to small water bodies well. Here, the Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) onboard Sentinel-2A and -2B and the Operational Landsat Imager (OLI) onboard Landsat-8 were employed to assemble the virtual constellation and to track spatial and seasonal variations in floating algae blooms from 2016 to 2020 in a small eutrophic plateau lake: Lake Xingyun in China. The floating algae index (FAI) was calculated using Rayleigh-corrected reflectance in the red, near-infrared, and short-wave infrared bands. The MSI-derived FAI had a similar pattern to the OLI-derived FAI, with a mean absolute percentage error of 19.98% and unbiased percentage difference of 17.05%. Then, an FAI threshold, 0.0693, was determined using bimodal histograms of FAI images for floating algae extraction. The floating algae had a higher occurrence in the northern region than the southern region in this lake, whilst the occurrence of floating algae in summer and autumn was higher than that in spring and winter. Such a spatial and seasonal pattern was related to the variability in air temperature, wind speed and direction, and nutrients. The climatological annual mean occurrence of floating algae from 2016 to 2020 in Lake Xingyun exhibited a significant decrease, which was related to decreases in nutrients, resulting from efficient ecological restoration by the local government. This research highlighted the application of OLI-MSI virtual constellation on monitoring floating algae in a small lake, providing a practical and theoretical reference to monitor aquatic environments in small water bodies.

TI  - Temporal effects of climate on vegetation trigger the response biases of vegetation to human activities
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantitatively distinguishing the effects of human activities and climate change on vegetation change is crucial for planning scientific vegetation management measures. Previous studies have employed the residual trend method (RESTREND) and remote sensing data to address this issue. However, the mathematical relationships between climate and remote sensing vegetation index under RESTREND are variable and not comprehensively described due to temporal effects of climate on vegetation. Using Tibetan Plateau (TP), this study investigated how the temporal effects of climate on vegetation trigger response biases of vegetation to human activities under four temporal effects (no temporal effect [No], temporal lag effect [Lag], temporal accumulation effect [Acc], and both temporal lag and temporal accumulation effects [Lagacc]). The results revealed the following. (1) The mean explanation degrees of climatic factors to vegetation growth over entire TP under No, Lag, Acc, and Lagacc effects were 0.41 +/- 0.02, 0.42 +/- 0.02, 0.44 +/- 0.02, and 0.47 +/- 0.02, respectively. Therefore, the Lagacc effect is the best temporal effect for establishing the vegetation-climate relationships. (2) Under the Lagacc effect, the temperature exhibited 1.60 +/- 0.13 months lag and 4.56 +/- 0.28 months accumulation on vegetation growth over entire the TP, whereas the precipitation exhibited 1.57 +/- 0.16 months lag and 4.99 +/- 0.31 months accumulation. Furthermore, the grids affected by the combined temporal lag and temporal accumulation effects of climatic factors accounted for 43.42-45.78% of the total grids. These indicated the temporal effects of climate on vegetation, and vegetation growth was largely affected by the combined temporal effects of climatic factors. (3) Under the Lagacc effect, 11.6% of the region experienced significant residual increase, and the slope of the residual was 22.2 x 10(-4), which was primarily distributed in the north and southeast of the TP. However, the area and slope of significant residual decrease were 1.3% and 24.0 x 10(-4), respectively, which were primarily distributed in the center of the TP. Furthermore, the average contributions of human activities on vegetation growth in the regions of residual significant increase and decrease were 54.5% and 55.5%, respectively. Therefore, the Lagacc effect exhibited the smallest influence area and the lowest influence degree for the contribution of human activities on vegetation growth. We thus suggest that the Lagacc effect should be fully considered when establishing the mathematical relationship between climatic factors and the vegetation index.

TI  - Analysis of Temporal and Spatial Characteristics of Urban Expansion in Xiaonan District from 1990 to 2020 Using Time Series Landsat Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development in the global economy and technology, urbanization has accelerated. It is important to characterize the urban expansion and determine its driving force. In this study, we used the Xiaonan District in Hubei Province, China, as an example to map and quantify the spatiotemporal dynamics of urban expansion from the two perspectives of built-up area and urban land in 1990-2020 by using remote sensing images. The location of rivers was found to be a primary limiting factor for spatial patterns and expansion of the built-up area. The transfer of the city center and the main direction of expansion generally corresponded well to the topography, policies, and development strategies. The built-up area expanded faster than the urban population in 1995-2020, which caused a waste in land resources. The results showed that the urban expansion first decreased and then increased during the research period. The increase in the proportion of the secondary industry was the main driving force of the urban expansion. Based on the characteristics of urban expansion in the past three decades, we conclude that the urban land of Xiaonan District will expand quickly in the future and will occupy vast agricultural land. The government must deploy control measures to balance the benefits and costs of urban expansion.

TI  - An Observational Study on the Local Climate Effect of the Shangyi Wind Farm in Hebei Province
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Zhangjiakou is an important wind power base in Hebei Province, China. The impact of its wind farms on the local climate is controversial. Based on long-term meteorological data from 1981 to 2018, we investigated the effects of the Shangyi Wind Farm (SWF) in Zhangjiakou on air temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, and precipitation using the anomaly or ratio method between the impacted weather station and the non-impacted background weather station. The influence of the SWF on land surface temperature (LST) and evapotranspiration (ET) using MODIS satellite data from 2003 to 2018 was also explored. The results showed that the SWF had an atmospheric warming effect at night especially in summer and autumn (up to 0.95 degrees C). The daytime air temperature changes were marginal, and their signs were varying depending on the season. The annual mean wind speed decreased by 6%, mainly noted in spring and winter (up to 14%). The precipitation and relative humidity were not affected by the SWF. There was no increase in LST in the SWF perhaps due to the increased vegetation coverage unrelated to the wind farms, which canceled out the wind farm-induced land surface warming and also resulted in an increase in ET. The results showed that the impact of wind farms on the local climate was significant, while their impact on the regional climate was slight.

TI  - An Investigation on Shenzhen Urban Green Space Changes and Their Effect on Local Eco-Environment in Recent Decades
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization and population growth impact enormous pressures on urban natural, economic and social environments. The quantitative analysis of urban green space (UGS) landscape dynamics and their impact on the urban eco-environment is of great significance for urban planning and eco-environment protection. Taking Shenzhen as an example, the UGS landscape changes and their impact on urban heat islands (UHI), surface wetness, air pollution and carbon storage were comprehensively investigated with Landsat and MODIS images. Results showed a large number of lands transferring from UGS to non-UGS from 1978 to 2018, especially for cropland. Built-up regions have adverse influences on eco-environment factors, and then they suffer high SUHI and AOD and low humidity and carbon storage. The growth of built-up areas not only enlarges the area of SUHI, but also enhances the intensity of heat islands. On the contrary, UGS patches have beneficial influences on all eco-environment factors and then enjoy a better eco-environment, including low SUHII, high surface wetness, high carbon storage and low AOD. It is expected that this study could provide scientific support for UGS plans and for conserving and sustainable urban development for developing cities.

TI  - Monitoring the Landscape Pattern and Characteristics of Non-Point Source Pollution in a Mountainous River Basin
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to assess the relationship between the landscape patterns and non-point source (NPS) pollution distribution in Qixia County, China. The sub-basin classification was conducted based on a digital elevation model and Landsat8 satellite images. Water samples were collected from each sub-basin, andtheir water quality during the wet and dry seasons was estimated. The correlation between the landscape indices and water pollution indicators was determined by Pearson analysis. The location-weighted landscape contrast index (LWLCI) was calculated based on the "source-sink " theory. Qixia was further divided into five sections based on the LWLCI score to illustrate the potential risk of NPS pollution. The results showed that the water quality in Qixia County was generally good. Cultivated land, orchards, construction areas, and unused land were positively correlated with the water pollution index and weredesignated as the "source " landscape categories, while forests, grasslands, and water bodies, which were negatively correlated with water pollution, were the "sink " landscapes; the LWCI was high in 36.94% of the study area. In these areas, measures such as increasing vegetation buffer zones are necessary to decrease the sediment and nutrient loads carried by precipitation.

TI  - Implementation of the Burned Area Component of the Copernicus Climate Change Service: From MODIS to OLCI Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents the burned area (BA) product of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) of the European Commission. This product, named C3SBA10, is based on the adaptation to Sentinel-3 OLCI images of a BA algorithm developed within the Fire Climate Change Initiative (FireCCI) project, which used MODIS data. We first reviewed the adaptation process and then analysed the results of both products for common years (2017-2019). Comparisons were performed using four different grid sizes (0.05 & DEG;, 0.10 & DEG;, 0.25 & DEG;, and 0.50 & DEG;). Annual correlations between the two products ranged from 0.94 to 0.99. Global BA estimates were found to be more similar when the two Sentinel-3 satellites were active (2019), as the temporal resolution was closer to that of the MODIS sensor. Global validation was performed using reference data derived from Landsat-8 images, following a stratified random sampling design. The C3SBA10 showed commission errors between 16 and 21% and omission errors from 48 to 50%, similar to those found in the FireCCI product. The temporal reporting accuracy was also validated using 19 million active fires. In total, 87% of the detections were made within 10 days after the fire by both products. The high consistency between both products ensures global BA data provision from 2001 to the present. The datasets are freely available through the Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS) repository.

TI  - Blind Fusion of Hyperspectral Multispectral Images Based on Matrix Factorization
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The fusion of low spatial resolution hyperspectral images and high spatial resolution multispectral images in the same scenario is important for the super-resolution of hyperspectral images. The spectral response function (SRF) and the point spread function (PSF) are two crucial prior pieces of information in fusion, and most of the current algorithms need to provide these two preliminary pieces of information in advance, even for semi-blind fusion algorithms at least the SRF. This causes limitations in the application of fusion algorithms. This paper aims to solve the dependence of the fusion method on the point spread function and proposes a method to estimate the spectral response function from the images involved in the fusion to achieve blind fusion. We conducted experiments on simulated datasets Pavia University, CAVE, and the remote sensing images acquired by two spectral cameras, Sentinel 2 and Hyperion. The experimental results show that our proposed SRF estimation method can improve the PSNR value by 5 dB on average compared with other state-of-the-art SRF estimation results. The proposed blind fusion method can improve the PSNR value of fusion results by 3-15 dB compared with other blind fusion methods.

TI  - Assessing the Impacts of Species Composition on the Accuracy of Mapping Chlorophyll Content in Heterogeneous Ecosystems
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll is an essential vegetation pigment influencing plant photosynthesis rate and growth conditions. Remote sensing images have been widely used for mapping vegetation chlorophyll content in different ecosystems (e.g., farmlands, forests, grasslands, and wetlands) for evaluating vegetation growth status and productivity of these ecosystems. Compared to farmlands and forests that are more homogeneous in terms of species composition, grasslands and wetlands are more heterogeneous with highly mixed species (e.g., various grass, forb, and shrub species). Different species contribute differently to the ecosystem services, thus, monitoring species-specific chlorophyll content is critical for better understanding their growth status, evaluating ecosystem functions, and supporting ecosystem management (e.g., control invasive species). However, previous studies in mapping chlorophyll content in heterogeneous ecosystems have rarely estimated species-specific chlorophyll content, which was partially due to the limited spatial resolution of remote sensing images commonly used in the past few decades for recognizing different species. In addition, many previous studies have used one universal model built with data of all species for mapping chlorophyll of the entire study area, which did not fully consider the impacts of species composition on the accuracy of chlorophyll estimation (i.e., establishing species-specific chlorophyll estimation models may generate higher accuracy). In this study, helicopter-acquired high-spatial resolution hyperspectral images were acquired for species classification and species-specific chlorophyll content estimation. Four estimation models, including a universal linear regression (LR) model (i.e., built with data of all species), species-specific LR models (i.e., built with data of each species, respectively), a universal random forest regression (RFR) model, and species-specific RFR models, were compared to determine their performance in mapping chlorophyll and to evaluate the impacts of species composition. The results show that species-specific models performed better than the universal models, especially for species with fewer samples in the dataset. The best performed species-specific models were then used to generate species-specific chlorophyll content maps using the species classification results. Impacts of species composition on the retrieval of chlorophyll content were further assessed to support future chlorophyll mapping in heterogeneous ecosystems and ecosystem management.

TI  - National and cultural elements in Russian children's discourse
T2  - AMAZONIA INVESTIGA
M3  - Article
AB  - The work is devoted to the topical problem of linguoculture. The subject of the research is cultural codes in children's discourse based on the materials of the living speech of Russian children on the site "Children Speak". For the research general scientific methods of analysis and generalization, descriptive and contextological methods, the method of linguoculturological and ontogenetic analysis are used. As a result, the linguocultural and linguosociological aspects of the formation of a child's linguistic personality are considered. At the same time, attention is focused on identifying the peculiarities of Russian children's discourse in the linguocultural aspect, studying the ethnocultural determinants of creating the linguistic personality of children. Based on the results of the analysis, it was concluded that the national culture is one of the decisive factors affecting the speech activity of children. In the process of mastering the native language, the child simultaneously acquires a special national mentality and creates a system of values that coincides with it, such as patriotism, the symbolic meaning of animal archetypes, attitude towards the family, etc. Moreover, under the influence of a child's linguistic personality, a certain deviation from the usual national worldview is also manifested in children's discourse.

T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate assessment of the spatial distribution of soil organic matter (SOM) is of great significance for regional sustainable development, especially in fertile black soil areas. The present study proposed a regional-scale high spatial resolution (30 m) SOM mapping method based on multitemporal synthetic images. The study area is located on the Songnen Plain of Northeast China. First, all available Landsat 8 surface reflectance (SR) data during the bare soil period (April and May) from 2014 to 2019 in the study area were screened in the Google Earth Engine (GEE), and the cloud mask was constructed. The median, average, maximum, and minimum values of the image set were synthesized according to single-year multimonth, multiyear single-month and multiyear multimonth time ranges, and the spectral index of the synthesized image was constructed. Second, the bands and spectral indices of different synthetic images were used as input to establish a random forest (RF) model of SOM prediction, and the accuracies of different spatial prediction models of SOM were compared to evaluate the optimal regional remote sensing prediction model of SOM. The following results were show. 1) The use of the spectral index combined with the image band as input had a greater improvement in the accuracy of SOM prediction than the use of only the image band. 2) Compared to the average, maximum and minimum synthesized images, the median synthesized image had higher accuracy in SOM prediction. 3) More years of synthesized images provided more robust SOM prediction results. 4) May was the best time window for SOM mapping on the Songnen Plain. This study presents a large-scale and high spatial resolution SOM mapping method that is suitable for black soil areas in Northeast China and extends the application of GEE in digital soil mapping.

TI  - Two-Decade Variability of Sea Surface Temperature and Chlorophyll-a in the Northern South China Sea as Revealed by Reconstructed Cloud-Free Satellite Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monthly sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration during 1997-2018 in the Northern South China Sea (NSCS) were gap-filled using the Data INterpolating Empirical Orthogonal Functions (DINEOFs) approach. Good accuracy of the reconstructed data was verified based on an independent cross-validation data set. Significant spatial heterogeneities and seasonal variations were observed in the cloud-free SST and Chl-a data. An apparent decreasing trend in SST was found along the coast of Guangdong, east of Hainan Island, and in the Taiwan Strait with an average decreasing rate amounting to 0.01 degrees C per year. Increase in SST was observed in Beibu Gulf and the deep offshore region in the NSCS at an average rate as high as 0.009 degrees C per year. An increasing trend in Chl-a was detected in the northern Beibu Gulf, near the mouth of the Pearl River estuary, and around Shantou with an average rate of 0.005 mg.m(-3) per year. EOF analysis of SST and Chl-a time series showed that the first three modes of both SST and Chl-a can explain most of their variances with accumulative contributions of 99.1% and 82.3%, respectively. The effects of surface net heat flux (NHF), Oceanic Nino Index (ONI), wind speed, and river flux on the first three modes of SST and Chl-a were quantitatively elucidated. Factors that affected the temporal and spatial variations of Chl-a and SST in the NSCS were qualitatively discussed, including El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), monsoon, upwelling, typhoon, internal waves, and Kuroshio intrusion.

TI  - Proposing a GEE-Based Spatiotemporally Adjusted Value Transfer Method to Assess Land-Use Changes and Their Impacts on Ecosystem Service Values in the Shenyang Metropolitan Area
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding land-use dynamics and their impacts on ecosystem service values (ESVs) is critical to conservation and environmental decision-making. This work used the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform and an adjusted value transfer method to investigate spatiotemporal ESV changes in the Shenyang Metropolitan Area (SMA), a National Reform Pilot Zone in northeast China. First, we obtained land-use classification maps for 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020 using a GEE-based Landsat dense stacking methodology. Then, we employed four spatiotemporal correction factors (net primary productivity, fractional vegetation cover, precipitation, and crop yield) in the value transfer method, and analyzed the ESV dynamics. The results showed that forest land and cropland were the two dominant land-use types, jointly occupying 75-89% of the total area. The built-up areas expanded rapidly from 2727 km(2) in 2000 to 3597 km(2) in 2020, while the cropland kept decreasing, and suffered the most area loss (-1305.09 km(2)). The ESV of the SMA rose substantially from 814.04 hundred million Chinese Yuan (hmCYN) in 2000 to 1546.82 hmCYN in 2005, then kept decreasing in 2005-2010 (-17.01%) and 2010-2015 (-10.75%), and finally increased to 1329.81 hmCYN in 2020. The ESVs of forest comprised most of the total ESVs, with the percentage ranging from 72.65% to 77.18%, followed by water bodies, ranging from 11.61% to 15.64%. The ESV changes for forest land and water bodies were the main drivers for the total ESV dynamics. Overall, this study illustrated the feasibility of combining the GEE platform and the spatiotemporal adjusted value transfer method into the ESV analysis. Additionally, the results could provide essential references to future environmental management policymaking in the SMA.

TI  - Using Time-Series Remote Sensing Images in Monitoring the Spatial-Temporal Dynamics of LULC in the Msimbazi Basin, Tanzania
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The basins containing rivers and wetlands are very significant to the surrounding dwellers in various ways, altogether aiming at boosting the economy for most developing countries. Unfortunately, the benefits are frequently overlooked and lead to basin mismanagement and degradation posed by increasing population. This study used population and satellite data to quantify the extent of land-use and land-cover changes along the Msimbazi valley between 1990 and 2019. Geographic information system and remote sensing techniques were used in the analysis and processing of remotely sensed images acquired in 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2019. The results reveal that the dominant area is built-up land that occupied 39.3% of the total in 1990 and gradually increased to 42.6% in 2000, 54.1% in 2010 and 65.5% in 2019. Moreover, forest and agriculture that in 1990 had been the second and third largest in size, respectively, had been decreasing throughout the entire period. The population increase had been threatening wetland vegetation during the initial 10 years (1990 to 2000); however, the wetland vegetation showed subsequent improvement after the implementation of some government initiatives. Other land cover, such as bush land and grassland, showed minority status with inconsistent changes in either increase or decrease. These findings imply that the Msimbazi Basin suffers much from uncoordinated human activities that consequently degrade its fertility. This degradation can be observed as well from the population distribution maps that show that a huge stress is being exerted along the riverine due to population growth and urbanization. The study also highlights that a lack of intensive management plans that are supported by clear legal commitments for optimal and sustainable resource utilization contributes to wetland deterioration.

TI  - Are fire refugia less predictable due to climate change?
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire refugia-unburnt habitat within a wildfire's perimeter-play a key role in wildlife persistence and recovery. While studies have shown that the location of refugia is influenced by local topographic factors, growing evidence points to extreme fire weather becoming the dominant factor driving high-severity wildfires that result in the location of fire refugia being less predictable. Between September 2019 and February 2020, a series of mega-fires in eastern Australia burned largely in broadleaf forest. We assessed burned and unburned areas of forest in eastern Australia using Sentinel-2 satellite data, aggregated monthly over the fire season to calculate a fire severity layer at a 20 m pixel resolution. We found that fires burned 5.7 x 10(6) ha(-1) of forest and woodland. The total percentage area of unburned forest within the wildfire footprint was approximately 10%. The majority (94%) of the unburnt forest and woodland patches within the fire perimeter occurred as patches <1 ha (n = 842 622 and 111 707 ha) with far fewer large unburnt patches (>100 ha) (n = 575 and 286 080 ha). Boosted regression tree analyses of the relationships between fire severity and potential explanatory variables revealed that 63%-78% of the variable importance in the models were climatic and weather-related factors. Fire weather index was the single most important variable for analyses, accounting for 40%-52% of modelled results. Our results reinforce mounting evidence that a shift is underway in the balance between deterministic and contingent factors in the occurrence of fire refugia with local topographic controls being increasingly overridden by severe fire weather conditions, and declining topographic effects as fire severity increases. Further studies are needed over a longer time frame, inclusive of prior forest management impacts, to confirm that the ability to predict fire refugia is permanently declining.

TI  - Improved Consistency of an Automated Multisatellite Method for Extracting Temporal Changes in Flood Extent
T2  - MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Malaysia is affected by floods almost every year. In this situation, high-frequency flood monitoring is crucial so that timely measures can be taken. However, the low revisit time of the satellites, as well as occlusion cast by clouds in optical images, limits the frequency of flood observation of the focused area. Therefore, this study proposes utilising multisatellite data from optical satellites such as Landsat 7, Landsat 8, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), as well as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images from Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS-2) and Sentinel-1, to increase observation of flood. The main objective was to utilize Otsu image segmentation over both optical and SAR satellite images to distinguish water and nonwater areas in each image separately. For this, modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) for the optical satellite and total dual-polarization backscatter for SAR satellite images were estimated. The focused area has been divided into Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) square-size grids of 30 pixels, and each satellite image was reprojected and resampled with a pixel size of 0.001 degrees to standardize the flood map resolution. The second objective was to assess the potential of image fusion for increasing the consistency of water area extraction. Two pairs of satellite images with the same observation period covering a flood event in September 2017 in Perlis, Malaysia, were processed using 2D wavelet transform. Lastly, the temporal changes of the integrated surface water extent were evaluated by comparing the output from both multisatellite and fused images with the observed water level data from the Department of Drainage and Irrigation. The results showed that the proposed model can be used to estimate flood duration as well as to estimate the flood-related losses, especially in ungauged or data-poor regions.

TI  - "Marvel vs. World"
T2  - JOURNAL OF WORLD LITERATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Following Eric Hayot's argument that modernity is a theory of the world as the "universal," this paper traces the "world concept" in Marvel Comics industry (MC) and its synergy with the film industry of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Speaking from the field of World Literature Studies, I show how superhero comics activate the "world concept" through the global dissemination of the infinitely stretchable Marvel Universe. My argument is that by operating in terms of a universe with moldable diegetic rules, the popular culture of MC and MCU does not merely reflect the current state of the world concept, but also affects its evolution and its spread. The universality of the modern worldview has come to be less concerned with the realist effect and more with increasing all-inclusiveness and infinite stretchability. The increased plasticity of the world concept puts a great pressure on world literary ecologies and increasingly expands and shapes what Beecroft called global literary ecology. What Marvel Comics has done in recent decades, especially through the interplay with the film industry, is to show how the expansion of the world concept entails that however large we imagine the world to be, it is always already too small.

AB  - Adenomyoepithelioma of the breast is a rare benign breast neoplasm. It is characterised by the proliferation of both epithelial and myoepithelial cells. Although it is benign, adenomyoepithelioma has a potential for recurrences and malignant transformations. Here, we report a case of a 69-year-old woman with a breast adenomyoepithelioma that had been resected twice before her admission to Mankweng Hospital. It was a fast-growing tumour involving the retro-areolar area and left inner quadrant of the breast. Applied treatment included wide-simple mastectomy with sentinel axillary lymph nodes biopsy.

TI  - Use of Sentinel-2 Data to Improve Multivariate Tree Species Composition in a Forest Resource Inventory
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerial-photo interpreted inventories of forest resources, including tree species composition, are valuable in forest resource management, but are expensive to create and can be relatively inaccurate. Because of differences among tree species in their spectral properties and seasonal phenologies, it might be possible to improve such forest resource inventory information (FRI) by using it in concert with multispectral satellite information from multiple time periods. We used Sentinel-2 information from nine spectral bands and 12 dates within a two-year period to model multivariate percent tree species composition in > 51,000 forest stands in the FRI of south-central Ontario, Canada. Accuracy of random forest (RF) and convolutional neural network (CNN) predictions were tested using species-specific basal area information from 155 0.25-ha field plots. Additionally, we created models using the Sentinel-2 information in concert with the field data and compared the accuracy of these models and the FRI-based models by use of basal areas from a second (13.7-ha) field data set. Based on average R-2 values across species in the two field data sets, the Sentinel-FRI models outperformed the FRI, showing 1.5- and 1.7-fold improvements relative to the FRI for RF and 2.1- and 2.2-fold improvements for CNN (mean R-2: 0.141-0.169 (FRI); 0.217-0.295 (RF); 0.307-0.352 (CNN)). Models created with the field data performed even better: improvements relative to the FRI were 2.1-fold for RF and 2.8-fold for CNN (mean R-2: 0.169 (FRI); 0.356 (RF); 0.469 (CNN)). As predicted, R-2 values between FRI- and field-trained predictions were higher than R-2 values with the FRI. Of the 21 tree species evaluated, 8 relatively rare species had poor models in all cases. Our multivariate approach allowed us to use more FRI stands in model creation than if we had been restricted to stands dominated by single species and allowed us to map species abundances at higher resolution. It might be possible to improve models further by use of tree stem maps and incorporation of the effects of canopy disturbances.

TI  - A New Look into Cancer-A Review on the Contribution of Vibrational Spectroscopy on Early Diagnosis and Surgery Guidance
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple Summary:& nbsp;Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, with the detection of the disease in its early stages, as well as a correct assessment of the tumour margins, being paramount for a successful recovery. While breast cancer is one of most common types of cancer, head and neck cancer is one of the types of cancer with a lower prognosis and poor aesthetic results. Vibrational spectroscopy detects molecular vibrations, being sensitive to different sample compositions, even when the difference was slight. The use of spectroscopy in biomedicine has been extensively explored, since it allows a broader assessment of the biochemical fingerprint of several diseases. This literature review covers the most recent advances in breast and head and neck cancer early diagnosis and intraoperative margin assessment, through Raman and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopies. The rising field of spectral histopathology was also approached. The authors aimed at expounding in a more concise and simple way the challenges faced by clinicians and how vibrational spectroscopy has evolved to respond to those needs for the two types of cancer with the highest potential for improvement regarding an early diagnosis, surgical margin assessment and histopathology.& nbsp;In 2020, approximately 10 million people died of cancer, rendering this disease the second leading cause of death worldwide. Detecting cancer in its early stages is paramount for patients' prognosis and survival. Hence, the scientific and medical communities are engaged in improving both therapeutic strategies and diagnostic methodologies, beyond prevention. Optical vibrational spectroscopy has been shown to be an ideal diagnostic method for early cancer diagnosis and surgical margins assessment, as a complement to histopathological analysis. Being highly sensitive, non-invasive and capable of real-time molecular imaging, Raman and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopies give information on the biochemical profile of the tissue under analysis, detecting the metabolic differences between healthy and cancerous portions of the same sample. This constitutes tremendous progress in the field, since the cancer-prompted morphological alterations often occur after the biochemical imbalances in the oncogenic process. Therefore, the early cancer-associated metabolic changes are unnoticed by the histopathologist. Additionally, Raman and FTIR spectroscopies significantly reduce the subjectivity linked to cancer diagnosis. This review focuses on breast and head and neck cancers, their clinical needs and the progress made to date using vibrational spectroscopy as a diagnostic technique prior to surgical intervention and intraoperative margin assessment.

TI  - Molecular Imaging in Primary Staging of Prostate Cancer Patients: Current Aspects and Future Trends
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple Summary: Accurate primary staging for determining the extent of prostate cancer is crucial for planning treatment in high-risk patients for distant metastases. Recurrence is still common after curative intent therapy, in spite of developments in the clinical nomograms for appropriate pre-treatment screening of patients for selective therapeutic approaches. This is partly due to suboptimal diagnostic performance of standard conventional imaging modalities such as computed tomography and bone scintigraphy. Molecular imaging by means of PET/CT and PET/MRI imaging using novel specific radiotracers might provide more precise staging of disease, allowing for better personalized treatments. This article reviews current developments and future trends for functional hybrid PET-targeted imaging in primary staging of prostate cancer.Accurate primary staging is the cornerstone in all malignancies. Different morphological imaging modalities are employed in the evaluation of prostate cancer (PCa). Regardless of all developments in imaging, invasive histopathologic evaluation is still the standard method for the detection and staging of the primary PCa. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) play crucial roles; however, functional imaging provides additional valuable information, and it is gaining ever-growing acceptance in the management of PCa. Targeted imaging with different radiotracers has remarkably evolved in the past two decades. [In-111]In-capromab pendetide scintigraphy was a new approach in the management of PCa. Afterwards, positron emission tomography (PET) tracers such as [C-11/F-18]choline and [C-11]acetate were developed. Nevertheless, none found a role in the primary staging. By introduction of the highly sensitive small molecule prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/CT, as well as recent developments in MRI and hybrid PET/MRI systems, non-invasive staging of PCa is being contemplated. Several studies investigated the role of these sophisticated modalities in the primary staging of PCa, showing promising results. Here, we recapitulate the role of targeted functional imaging. We briefly mention the most popular radiotracers, their diagnostic accuracy in the primary staging of PCa, and impact on patient management.

TI  - Toward a More Representative Monitoring of Land-Use and Land-Cover Dynamics: The Use of a Sample-Based Assessment through Augmented Visual Interpretation Using Open Foris Collect Earth
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-quality data for REDD+ monitoring, measurement, and reporting are critical for the continued success of REDD+ implementation and Results-Based Payments. Collect Earth is a free, user-friendly, and open-source software for land monitoring developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). The tool allows countries to undertake land monitoring easily and rapidly through a sample-based approach and generate Activity Data (data on the magnitude of human activity resulting in emissions or removals during a given period of time) through augmented visual interpretation with low costs. Under the Paris Agreement, countries will have to update the greenhouse gas inventories that they report to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change every two years through the Biennial Update Reports. One of the important benefits of using sample-based approaches such as the one proposed by Collect Earth is the possibility to achieve a detailed classification of the land-use sub-categories with high accuracy of the estimates for land-use changes occurring since 2000. However, most guidance documents developed for capacity building in developing countries for REDD+ reporting only advocate developing land-cover and land-cover change maps using remote sensing. As several countries already use Collect Earth and the sample-based methodology to report on REDD+, this commentary advocates for a more representative approach and a methodological debate on the potential of sample-based approaches using remote sensing, and when possible combined with ground truthing, to estimate Activity Data for REDD+ and countries' greenhouse gas inventories for the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use sector in general.

TI  - Coastal morphodynamic analysis in Buleleng Regency, Bali-Indonesia
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sediment as erosion product can affect shorelines, making sediment transport a key process to consider in coastal and shoreline management. Field surveys and secondary data can identify where suspended matters are distributed and deposited to analyze sediment uniformity factors: beach morphology and materials. This research set out to determine the Buleleng Regency's morphodynamic aspects based on the coastal landscape's physical characteristics and the processes acting upon each sediment cell. Field observations were conducted at five stations, from Tukad Gerokgak to Tukad Saba estuary. Jaelani's spectral transformation has been applied to analyze Total Suspended Solids using Sentinel 2A imagery. The laboratory test results of grain-size samples were processed on GRADISTAT, then the depositional environment and sediment transport direction were determined from average grain size, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. Shoreline change, an indicator of coastal morphodynamics, was mapped from Landsat images in 2000, 2008, and 2019 using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System. Statistical analysis on GRADISTAT provided details on depositional environment and sediment transport and deposition based on grain-size distribution. Results indicate poorly sorted medium grain size: gravel (stone) to coarse sand, making up the sediment population from Tukad Gerokgak to Tukad Saba. Generally, sediment is deposited toward coarse, even very coarse, grain on a strongly sloping beach, and there is a high likeliness of sediment accretion. Identified morphodynamic characteristics suggest that the coastal landscape needs structural mitigation to overcome the accelerating impact of human activities and physical processes.

TI  - Image classification of marine-terminating outlet glaciers in Greenland using deep learning methods
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - A wealth of research has focused on elucidating the key controls on mass loss from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets in response to climate forcing, specifically in relation to the drivers of marine-terminating outlet glacier change. The manual methods traditionally used to monitor change in satellite imagery of marine-terminating outlet glaciers are time-consuming and can be subjective, especially where melange exists at the terminus. Recent advances in deep learning applied to image processing have created a new frontier in the field of automated delineation of glacier calving fronts. However, there remains a paucity of research on the use of deep learning for pixel-level semantic image classification of outlet glacier environments. Here, we apply and test a two-phase deep learning approach based on a well-established convolutional neural network (CNN) for automated classification of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. The novel workflow, termed CNN-Supervised Classification (CSC) is adapted to produce multi-class outputs for unseen test imagery of glacial environments containing marine-terminating outlet glaciers in Greenland. Different CNN input parameters and training techniques are tested, with overall F1 scores for resulting classifications reaching up to 94 % for in-sample test data (Helheim Glacier) and 96 % for out-of-sample test data (Jakobshavn Isbrae and Store Glacier), establishing a state of the art in classification of marine-terminating glaciers in Greenland. Predicted calving fronts derived using optimal CSC input parameters have a mean deviation of 56.17 m (5.6 px) and median deviation of 24.7 m (2.5 px) from manually digitised fronts. This demonstrates the transferability and robustness of the deep learning workflow despite complex and seasonally variable imagery. Future research could focus on the integration of deep learning classification workflows with free cloud-based platforms, to efficiently classify imagery and produce datasets for a range of glacial applications without the need for substantial prior experience in coding or deep learning.

TI  - Predicting the Impact of Future Land Use and Climate Change on Potential Soil Erosion Risk in an Urban District of the Harare Metropolitan Province, Zimbabwe
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring urban area expansion through multispectral remotely sensed data and other geomatics techniques is fundamental for sustainable urban planning. Forecasting of future land use land cover (LULC) change for the years 2034 and 2050 was performed using the Cellular Automata Markov model for the current fast-growing Epworth district of the Harare Metropolitan Province, Zimbabwe. The stochastic CA-Markov modelling procedure validation yielded kappa statistics above 80%, ascertaining good agreement. The spatial distribution of the LULC classes CBD/Industrial area, water and irrigated croplands as projected for 2034 and 2050 show slight notable changes. For projected scenarios in 2034 and 2050, low-medium-density residential areas are predicted to increase from 11.1 km(2) to 12.3 km(2) between 2018 and 2050. Similarly, high-density residential areas are predicted to increase from 18.6 km(2) to 22.4 km(2) between 2018 and 2050. Assessment of the effects of future climate change on potential soil erosion risk for Epworth district were undertaken by applying the representative concentration pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) climate scenarios, and model ensemble averages from multiple general circulation models (GCMs) were used to derive the rainfall erosivity factor for the RUSLE model. Average soil loss rates for both climate scenarios, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, were predicted to be high in 2034 due to the large spatial area extent of croplands and disturbed green spaces exposed to soil erosion processes, therefore increasing potential soil erosion risk, with RCP4.5 having more impact than RCP8.5 due to a higher applied rainfall erosivity. For 2050, the predicted wide area average soil loss rates declined for both climate scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, following the predicted decline in rainfall erosivity and vulnerable areas that are erodible. Overall, high potential soil erosion risk was predicted along the flanks of the drainage network for both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate scenarios in 2050.

TI  - Aerosol Properties in Cloudy Environments from Remote Sensing Observations A Review of the Current State of Knowledge
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Review
AB  - Aerosol properties are fundamentally different near clouds than away from clouds. This paper reviews the current state of knowledge of aerosol properties in the near-low-cloud environment and quantitatively compares them with aerosols far from clouds, according to remote sensing observations. It interprets observations of aerosol properties from different sensors using satellite, aircraft, and ground-based observations. The correlation (and anticorrelation) between proximity to cloud and aerosol properties is discussed. Retrieval artifacts in the near-cloud environment are demonstrated and quantified for different sensor attributes and environmental conditions. Finally, the paper describes the possible corrections for near-cloud enhancement in remote sensing retrievals. This study is timely in view of science definition studies for NASA's Aerosol, Cloud, Convection and Precipitation (ACCP) mission, which will also seek to directly link aerosol properties to nearby clouds.

TI  - Optimal Grid-Based Filtering for Crop Phenology Estimation with Sentinel-1 SAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last decade, suboptimal Bayesian filtering (BF) techniques, such as Extended Kalman Filtering (EKF) and Particle Filtering (PF), have led to great interest for crop phenology monitoring with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. In this study, a novel approach, based on the Grid-Based Filter (GBF), is proposed to estimate crop phenology. Here, phenological scales, which consist of a finite number of discrete stages, represent the one-dimensional state space, and hence GBF provides the optimal phenology estimates. Accordingly, contrarily to literature studies based on EKF and PF, no constraints are imposed on the models and the statistical distributions involved. The prediction model is defined by the transition matrix, while Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is employed to define the observation model. The approach is applied on dense time series of dual-polarization Sentinel-1 (S1) SAR images, collected in four different years, to estimate the BBCH stages of rice crops. Results show that 0.94 & LE; R-2 & LE; 0.98, 5.37 & LE; RMSE & LE; 7.9 and 20 & LE; MAE & LE; 33.

TI  - Modeling the Spatial Distribution of Soil Nitrogen Content at Smallholder Maize Farms Using Machine Learning Regression and Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrogen is one of the key nutrients that indicate soil quality and an important component for plant development. Accurate knowledge and management of soil nitrogen is crucial for food security in rural communities, especially for smallholder maize farms. However, less research has been done on generating digital soil nitrogen maps for these farmers. This study examines the utility of Sentinel-2 satellite data and environmental variables to map soil nitrogen at smallholder maize farms. Three machine learning algorithms-random forest (RF), gradient boosting (GB), and extreme gradient boosting (XG) were investigated for this purpose. The findings indicate that the RF (R-2 = 0.90, RMSE = 0.0076%) model performs slightly better than the GB (R-2 = 0.88, RMSE = 0.0083%) and XG (R-2 = 0.89, RMSE = 0.0077%) models. Furthermore, the variable importance measure showed that the Sentinel-2 bands, particularly the red and red-edge bands, have a superior performance in comparison to the environmental variables and soil indices. The digital maps generated in this study show the high capability of Sentinel-2 satellite data to generate accurate nitrogen content maps with the application of machine learning. The developed framework can be implemented to map the spatial pattern of soil nitrogen. This will also contribute to soil fertility interventions and nitrogen fertilization management to improve food security in rural communities. This application contributes to Sustainable Development Goal number 2.

TI  - Machine Learning Simulation of Land Cover Impact on Surface Urban Heat Island Surrounding Park Areas
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban heat island effect has been studied extensively by many researchers around the world with the process of urbanization coming about as one of the major culprits of the increasing urban land surface temperatures. Over the past 20 years, the city of Dallas, Texas, has consistently been one of the fastest growing cities in the United States and has faced rapid urbanization and great amounts of urban sprawl, leading to an increase in built-up surface area. In this study, we utilize Landsat 8 satellite images, Geographic Information System (GIS) technologies, land use/land cover (LULC) data, and a state-of-the-art methodology combining machine learning algorithms (eXtreme Gradient Boosted models, or XGBoost) and a modern game theoretic-based approach (Shapley Additive exPlanation, or SHAP values) to investigate how different land use/land cover classifications impact the land surface temperature and park cooling effects in the city of Dallas. We conclude that green spaces, residential, and commercial/office spaces have the largest impacts on Land Surface Temperatures (LST) as well as the Park's Cooling Intensity (PCI). Additionally, we have found that the extent and direction of influence of these categories depends heavily on the surrounding area. By using SHAP values we can describe these interactions in greater detail than previous studies. These results will provide an important reference for future urban and park placement planning to minimize the urban heat island effect, especially in sprawling cities.

TI  - Are Remote Sensing Evapotranspiration Models Reliable Across South American Ecoregions?
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Many remote sensing-based evapotranspiration (RSBET) algorithms have been proposed in the past decades and evaluated using flux tower data, mainly over North America and Europe. Model evaluation across South America has been done locally or using only a single algorithm at a time. Here, we provide the first evaluation of multiple RSBET models, at a daily scale, across a wide variety of biomes, climate zones, and land uses in South America. We used meteorological data from 25 flux towers to force four RSBET models: Priestley-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory (PT-JPL), Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM), Penman-Monteith Mu model (PM-MOD), and Penman-Monteith Nagler model (PM-VI). ET was predicted satisfactorily by all four models, with correlations consistently higher (R2>0.6) for GLEAM and PT-JPL, and PM-MOD and PM-VI presenting overall better responses in terms of percent bias (-10<PBIAS<10%). As for PM-VI, this outcome is expected, given that the model requires calibration with local data. Model skill seems to be unrelated to land-use but instead presented some dependency on biome and climate, with the models producing the best results for wet to moderately wet environments. Our findings show the suitability of individual models for a number of combinations of land cover types, biomes, and climates. At the same time, no model outperformed the others for all conditions, which emphasizes the need for adapting individual algorithms to take into account intrinsic characteristics of climates and ecosystems in South America.

TI  - Concatenated Residual Attention UNet for Semantic Segmentation of Urban Green Space
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban green space is generally considered a significant component of the urban ecological environment system, which serves to improve the quality of the urban environment and provides various guarantees for the sustainable development of the city. Remote sensing provides an effective method for real-time mapping and monitoring of urban green space changes in a large area. However, with the continuous improvement of the spatial resolution of remote sensing images, traditional classification methods cannot accurately obtain the spectral and spatial information of urban green spaces. Due to complex urban background and numerous shadows, there are mixed classifications for the extraction of cultivated land, grassland and other ground features, implying that limitations exist in traditional methods. At present, deep learning methods have shown great potential to tackle this challenge. In this research, we proposed a novel model called Concatenated Residual Attention UNet (CRAUNet), which combines the residual structure and channel attention mechanism, and applied it to the data source composed of GaoFen-1 remote sensing images in the Shenzhen City. Firstly, the improved residual structure is used to make it retain more feature information of the original image during the feature extraction process, then the Convolutional Block Channel Attention (CBCA) module is applied to enhance the extraction of deep convolution features by strengthening the effective green space features and suppressing invalid features through the interdependence of modeling channels.-Finally, the high-resolution feature map is restored through upsampling operation by the decoder. The experimental results show that compared with other methods, CRAUNet achieves the best performance. Especially, our method is less susceptible to the noise and preserves more complete segmented edge details. The pixel accuracy (PA) and mean intersection over union (MIoU) of our approach have reached 97.34% and 94.77%, which shows great applicability in regional large-scale mapping.

TI  - A remote sensing framework to map potential toxic elements in agricultural soils in the humid tropics
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil contamination by potentially toxic elements (PTEs) is one of the greatest threats to environmental degradation. Knowing where PTEs accumulated in soil can mitigate their adverse effects on plants, animals, and human health. We evaluated the potential of using long-term remote sensing images that reveal the bare soils, to detect and map PTEs in agricultural fields. In this study, 360 soil samples were collected at the superficial layer (0-20 cm) in a 2574 km(2) agricultural area located in Sao Paulo State, Brazil. We tested the Soil Synthetic Image (SYSI) using Landsat TM/ETM/ETM+, Landsat OLI, and Sentinel 2 images. The three products have different spectral, temporal, and spatial resolutions. The time series multispectral images were used to reveal areas with bare soil and their spectra were used as predictors of soil chromium, iron, nickel, and zinc contents. We observed a strong linear relationship (-0.26 > r > -0.62) between the selected PTEs and the near infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands of Sentinel (ensemble of 4 years of data), Landsat TM (35 years data), and Landsat OLI (4 years data). The clearest discrimination of soil PTEs was obtained from SYSI using a long term Landsat 5 collection over 35 years. Satellite data could efficiently detect the contents of PTEs in soils due to their relation with soil attributes and parent materials. Therefore, distinct satellite sensors could map the PTEs on tropics and assist in understanding their spatial dynamics and environmental effects.

TI  - The Variability of Summer Atmospheric Water Cycle over the Tibetan Plateau and Its Response to the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tibetan Plateau (TP), atmosphere, and Indo-Pacific warm pool (IPWP) together constitute a regional land-atmosphere-ocean water vapor transport system. This study uses remote sensing data, reanalysis data, and observational data to explore the spatiotemporal variations of the summer atmospheric water cycle over the TP and its possible response to the air-sea interaction in the IPWP during the period 1958-2019. The results reveal that the atmospheric water cycle process over the TP presented an interannual and interdecadal strengthening trend. The climatic precipitation recycle ratio (PRR) over the TP was 18%, and the stronger the evapotranspiration, the higher the PRR. On the interdecadal scale, the change in evapotranspiration has a significant negative correlation with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) index. The variability of the water vapor transport (WVT) over the TP was controlled by the dynamic and thermal conditions inside the plateau and the external air-sea interaction processes of the IPWP. When the summer monsoon over the TP was strong, there was an anomalous cyclonic WVT, which increased the water vapor budget (WVB) over the TP. The central and eastern tropical Pacific, the maritime continent and the western Indian Ocean together constituted the triple Sea Surface Temperature (SST) anomaly, which enhanced the convective activity over the IPWP and induced a significant easterly wind anomaly in the middle and lower troposphere, and then generated pronounced easterly WVT anomalies from the tropical Pacific to the maritime continent and the Bay of Bengal. Affected by the air-sea changes in the IPWP, the combined effects of the upstream strengthening and the downstream weakening in the water vapor transport process, directly and indirectly, increased the water vapor transport and budget of TP.

TI  - Reconstruction of Three-Dimensional Temperature and Salinity Fields From Satellite Observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Observation of the ocean is crucial to the studies of ocean dynamics, climate change, and biogeochemical cycle. However, current oceanic observations are patently insufficient, because the in situ observations are of difficulty and high cost while the satellite remote-sensed measurements are mainly the sea surface data. To make up for the shortage of ocean interior data and make full use of the abundant satellite data, here we develop a data-driven deep learning model to estimate ocean subsurface and interior variables from satellite-observed sea surface data. Exclusively and simply using satellite data, three-dimensional ocean temperature and salinity fields are successfully reconstructed, which are at 26 level depths from 0 to 2,000 m. We further design a scheme to increase the horizontal resolution from 1 degrees to 1/4 degrees, which is higher than the Argo gridded data. Estimations from our model are accurate, reliable, and stable for a wide range of research areas and periods. Dynamic height fields that are derived from the estimated temperature and salinity, as well as the associated ocean geostrophic flows, are also calculated and analyzed, which indicates the potentials of our model for reconstructing the ocean circulation fields as well. This study enriches oceanic observations with respect to vertical dimension and horizontal resolution, which can largely make up for the paucity of the subsurface and deep ocean observation, both before and during Argo era. This work also provides some new foundations for and insights into geoscience and climate change fields.

TI  - Novel approach to observing system simulation experiments improves information gain of surface-atmosphere field measurements
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The observing system design of multidisciplinary field measurements involves a variety of considerations on logistics, safety, and science objectives. Typically, this is done based on investigator intuition and designs of prior field measurements. However, there is potential for considerable increases in efficiency, safety, and scientific success by integrating numerical simulations in the design process. Here, we present a novel numerical simulation-environmental response function (NS-ERF) approach to observing system simulation experiments that aids surface-atmosphere synthesis at the interface of mesoscale and microscale meteorology. In a case study we demonstrate application of the NS-ERF approach to optimize the Chequamegon Heterogeneous Ecosystem Energy-balance Study Enabled by a High-density Extensive Array of Detectors 2019 (CHEESEHEAD19).During CHEESEHEAD19 pre-field simulation experiments, we considered the placement of 20 eddy covariance flux towers, operations for 72 h of low-altitude flux aircraft measurements, and integration of various remote sensing data products. A 2 h high-resolution large eddy simulation created a cloud-free virtual atmosphere for surface and meteorological conditions characteristic of the field campaign domain and period. To explore two specific design hypotheses we super-sampled this virtual atmosphere as observed by 13 different yet simultaneous observing system designs consisting of virtual ground, airborne, and satellite observations. We then analyzed these virtual observations through ERFs to yield an optimal aircraft flight strategy for augmenting a stratified random flux tower network in combination with satellite retrievals.We demonstrate how the novel NS-ERF approach doubled CHEESEHEAD19's potential to explore energy balance closure and spatial patterning science objectives while substantially simplifying logistics. Owing to its modular extensibility, NS-ERF lends itself to optimizing observing system designs also for natural climate solutions, emission inventory validation, urban air quality, industry leak detection, and multi-species applications, among other use cases.

TI  - Relationships between the Spatio-Temporal Variation in Reflectance Data from the Sentinel-2 Satellite and Potato (<i>Solanum Tuberosum</i> L.) Yield and Stem Density
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) have been used to build models for predicting Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) yields at regional scales, but evidence of extension of such models to local field scale for practical use in precision agriculture is lacking. In this study, multispectral data from the Sentinel-2 satellite were used to interpolate continuous spectral signatures of potato canopies and generate vegetation indices and the red edge inflection point (REIP) to relate to marketable yield and stem density. The SITS data were collected from 94 sampling locations across five potato fields in England, United Kingdom. The sampling locations were georeferenced and the number of stems per square meter, as well as marketable yield, were determined at harvest. The first principal components of the temporal variation of each SITS wavelength were extracted and used to generate 54 vegetation indices to relate to the response variables. Marketable yield was negatively related to the overall seasonal reflectance (first principal component) at 559 nm with a beta coefficient of -0.53 (+/- 0.18 at p = 0.05). Seasonal reflectance at 703 nm had a positive significant relationship with Marketable yield. Marketable yield was modeled with a normalized root mean square error (nRMSE) of 0.16 and R-2 of 0.65. On the other hand, Stem density was significantly related to the Specific Leaf Area Vegetation Index (beta = 1.66 +/- 1.59) but the REIP's farthest position during the season was reached later in dense canopies (beta = 1.18 +/- 0.79) with a higher reflectance (beta = 3.43 +/- 1.9). This suggested that denser canopies took longer to reach their maximum chlorophyll intensity and the intensity was lower than in sparse canopies. Potato stem density was modeled with an nRMSE of 0.24 and R-2 of 0.51. These results reinforce the importance of SITS analysis as opposed to the use of single-instance intrinsic indices.

TI  - Synoptic Causes and Socio-Economic Consequences of a Severe Dust Storm in the Middle East
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Dust storms represent one of the most severe, if underrated, natural hazards in drylands. This study uses ground observational data from meteorological stations and airports (SYNOP and METARs), satellite observations (MODIS level-3 gridded atmosphere daily products and CALIPSO) and reanalysis data (ERA5) to analyze the synoptic meteorology of a severe Middle Eastern dust storm in April 2015. Details of related socio-economic impacts, gathered largely from news media reports, are also documented. This dust storm affected at least 14 countries in an area of 10 million km(2). The considerable impacts were felt across eight countries in health, transport, education, construction, leisure and energy production. Hospitals in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE experienced a surge in cases of respiratory complaints and ophthalmic emergencies, as well as vehicular trauma due to an increase in motor vehicle accidents. Airports in seven countries had to delay, divert and cancel flights during the dust storm. This paper is the first attempt to catalogue such dust storm impacts on multiple socio-economic sectors in multiple countries in any part of the world. This type of transboundary study of individual dust storm events is necessary to improve our understanding of their multiple impacts and so inform policymakers working on this emerging disaster risk management issue.

TI  - On the Connection between the 2008-2009 Activation of the Koryakskii Volcano and Deep Magmatic Processes
T2  - IZVESTIYA-PHYSICS OF THE SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The last activation of the Koryakskii volcano in 2008-2009 was accompanied by intense fumarolic and seismic activity. Volcanic activity peaked in March-April 2009 when ash plume rose to a height of 5.5 km and extended laterally over more than 600 km. To understand the dynamics of the volcanic processes and to forecast the further course of the events, it is relevant to establish whether the eruption was associated with a rise of magma to beneath the volcanic edifice or caused by fracturing of the volcano's basement and penetration of groundwater into a high temperature zone. Based on the analysis of the images from the Japanese satellite ALOS-1 using satellite radar interferometry methods, the slope displacements of the Koryakskii volcano during its last activation have been estimated for the first time. The displacements reach 25 cm and cannot be explained by the formation of a layer of volcanic ash deposits or by the slope processes. The most likely cause of the displacements should be recognized to be the intrusion of magmatic material into the volcano edifice with the formation of a fracture with its lower edge at a depth of 0.5 km above sea level, with a size of 1.0 and 2.4 km along the strike and dip, respectively, and with a dip angle from 45 degrees to 60 degrees. Therefore, the processes taking place beneath the volcano can be threatening to the nearby localities and infrastructure and require continuous monitoring.

TI  - Embolization of the internal maxillary artery via open retrograde superficial temporal artery approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel bleeds in head and neck cancer patients present as an ominous symptom often necessitating urgent endovascular embolization. However, this approach can be complicated in patients who have previously undergone head and neck cancer ablation and reconstruction, thus altering the standard arterial vascular supply. Herein we describe an innovative method of internal maxillary artery (IMA) access in a patient with a sentinel bleed who previously underwent proximal external carotid artery (ECA) rerouting for free flap reconstruction. The open retrograde superficial temporal artery approach for IMA embolization is minimally invasive and effective and should be considered for head and neck cancer patients at risk of hemorrhage from distal ECA branches without a proximal ECA embolization option.

TI  - Monitoring Metropolitan Growth Dynamics for Achieving Sustainable Urbanization (SDG 11.3) in Kolkata Metropolitan Area, India
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The mass accumulation of population in the larger cities of India has led to accelerated and unprecedented peripheral urban expansion over the last few decades. This rapid peripheral growth is characterized by an uncontrolled, low density, fragmented and haphazard patchwork of development popularly known as urban sprawl. The Kolkata Metropolitan Area (KMA) has been one of the fastest-growing metropolitan areas in India and is experiencing rampant suburbanization and peripheral expansion. Hence, understanding urban growth and its dynamics in these rapidly changing environments is critical for city planners and resource managers. Furthermore, understanding urban expansion and urban growth patterns are essential for achieving inclusive and sustainable urbanization as defined by the United Nations in the Sustainable Development Goals (e.g., SDGs, 11.3). The present research attempts to quantify and model the urban growth dynamics of large and diverse metropolitan areas with a distinct methodology considering the case of KMA. In the study, land use and land cover (LULC) maps of KMA were prepared for three different years (i.e., for 1996, 2006, and 2016) through the classification of Landsat imagery using a support vector machine (SVM) classification approach. Then, change detection analysis, landscape metrics, a concentric zone approach, and Shannon's entropy approach were applied for spatiotemporal assessment and quantification of urban growth in KMA. The achieved classification accuracies were found to be 89.75%, 92.00%, and 92.75%, with corresponding Kappa values of 0.879, 0.904, and 0.912 for 1996, 2006, and 2016, respectively. It is concluded that KMA has been experiencing typical urban sprawl. The peri-urban areas (i.e., KMA-rural) are growing rapidly, and are characterized by leapfrogging and fragmented built-up area development, compared to the central KMA (i.e., KMA-urban), which has become more compact in recent years.</p>

TI  - The Global Conductivity Structure of the Lunar Upper and Midmantle
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS
M3  - Article
AB  - Magnetic sounding is a powerful tool to explore the interior of planetary bodies through the electrical conductivity structure. The electrical conductivity structure of the lunar mantle has previously been derived from surface magnetic field measurements as part of the Apollo 12 mission and concurrent magnetometer data acquired from orbit through the Explorer 35 satellite. Here, we derive the first global conductivity structure of the upper and midmantle using only satellite magnetometer data collected by the recent Lunar Prospector and Kaguya Selene satellite missions. We show that the field in the geomagnetic tail exhibits a simple geometrical structure and can be well described by a single spherical harmonic of degree and order one. Employing this information about the inducing field geometry and assuming a potential representation of the field in the geomagnetic tail, we derive a frequency-dependent transfer function and invert it for a one-dimensional (1-D) electrical conductivity profile of the lunar upper and midmantle. Our global transfer function shows striking similarity with the local one obtained from joint analysis of Apollo 12 and Explorer 35 magnetometer data. This indicates the lack of local variations at the Apollo 12 landing site compared to the globally averaged upper to midmantle electrical conductivity structure.

TI  - The Utility of Sentinel-2 Spectral Data in Quantifying Above-Ground Carbon Stock in an Urban Reforested Landscape
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The transformation of the natural landscape into an impervious surface due to urbanization has often been considered an important driver of environmental change, affecting essential urban ecological processes and ecosystem services. Continuous forest degradation and deforestation due to urbanization have led to an increase in atmospheric carbon emissions, risks, and impacts associated with climate change within urban landscapes and beyond them. Hence, urban reforestation has become a reliable long-term alternative for carbon sink and climate change mitigation. However, there is an urgent need for spatially accurate and concise quantification of these forest carbon stocks in order to understand and effectively monitor the accumulation and progress on such ecosystem services. Hence, this study sought to examine the prospect of Sentinel-2 spectral data in quantifying carbon stock in a reforested urban landscape using the random forest ensemble. Results show that Sentinel-2 spectral data estimated reforested forest carbon stock to an RMSE between 0.378 and 0.466 t & BULL;ha(-1) and R-2 of 79.82 and 77.96% using calibration and validation datasets. Based on random forest variable selection and backward elimination approaches, the red-edge normalized difference vegetation index, enhanced vegetation index, modified simple ratio index, and normalized difference vegetation index were the best subset of predictor variables of carbon stock. These findings demonstrate the value and prospects of Sentinel-2 spectral data for predicting carbon stock in reforested urban landscapes. This information is critical for adopting informed management policies and plans for optimizing urban reforested landscapes carbon sequestration capacity and improving their climate change mitigation potential.

TI  - Sediment Transport Dynamism in the Confluence Area of Two Rivers Transporting Mainly Suspended Sediment Based on Sentinel-2 Satellite Images
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Downstream of the confluence of rivers, complex hydrological and morphological processes control the flow and sediment transport. This study aimed to analyze the spatio-temporal dynamics of suspended sediment in the confluence area of the Tisza and its main tributary Maros River using Sentinel-2 images and to reveal the correlation between the hydrological parameters and the mixing process through a relatively long period (2015-2021). The surficial suspended sediment dynamism was analyzed by applying K-means unsupervised classification algorithm on 143 images. The percentages of the Tisza (TW) and Maros (MW) waters and their mixture (MIX) were calculated and compared with the hydrological parameters in both rivers. The main results revealed that the areal, lateral, and longitudinal extensions of TW and MIX have a better correlation with the hydrological parameters than the MW. The Pearson correlation matrix revealed that the discharge ratio between the rivers controls the mixing process significantly. Altogether, 11 mixing patterns were identified in the confluence area throughout the studied period. The TW usually dominates the confluence in November and January, MW in June and July, and MIX in August and September. Predictive equations for the areal distribution of the three classes were derived to support future water sampling in the confluence area.

TI  - Changes in the Snow Cover Extent in Eurasia from Satellite Data in Relation to Hemispheric and Regional Temperature Changes
T2  - DOKLADY EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantitative estimates of the relationship between intra-annual and interannual changes in the snow cover extent in Eurasia and surface air temperature variations in the Northern Hemisphere have been obtained based on satellite and reanalysis data for the period of 1979-2020. The estimated snow cover extent sensitivity to the temperature changes in Eurasia for the last four decades (1980-2019) has been compared with that obtained for the last fifteen years (2005-2019). Seasonal features of the snow cover extent-temperature relationship have been noted, particularly during the formation of snow cover in autumn. Correlation and cross-wavelet analyses have made it possible to reveal a general considerable coherence and a negative correlation of snow cover extent and surface air temperature in Eurasia, not only in the annual cycle, but also in the interannual variability for most months. According to the average annual data for the period 2005-2019, an increase in the absolute value of the sensitivity parameter of the snow cover extent to the surface air temperature changes is noted in Eurasia, with a generally statistical insignificant negative correlation for the last four decades.

TI  - Attention to Fires: Multi-Channel Deep Learning Models for Wildfire Severity Prediction
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires are one of the natural hazards that the European Union is actively monitoring through the Copernicus EMS Earth observation program which continuously releases public information related to such catastrophic events. Such occurrences are the cause of both short- and long-term damages. Thus, to limit their impact and plan the restoration process, a rapid intervention by authorities is needed, which can be enhanced by the use of satellite imagery and automatic burned area delineation methodologies, accelerating the response and the decision-making processes. In this context, we analyze the burned area severity estimation problem by exploiting a state-of-the-art deep learning framework. Experimental results compare different model architectures and loss functions on a very large real-world Sentinel2 satellite dataset. Furthermore, a novel multi-channel attention-based analysis is presented to uncover the prediction behaviour and provide model interpretability. A perturbation mechanism is applied to an attention-based DS-UNet to evaluate the contribution of different domain-driven groups of channels to the severity estimation problem.

TI  - Relational hybridization of Third Sector of Social Action in the last decade. Between mobilization and neighborhood-community networks
T2  - CIRIEC-ESPANA REVISTA DE ECONOMIA PUBLICA SOCIAL Y COOPERATIVA
M3  - Article
AB  - The third sector of social action (hereinafter TSAS) is, from a theoretical perspective, an elusive and fluid concept, especially in the European sphere. Debates and consensus definitions have been numerous to build a measurable, shared, comprehensive and comparable concept. These efforts have yielded remarkable results in the development and analysis of the TSAS. Now, the dynamism of social reality in the last 10 years has produced innovative and alternative responses from civil society that have impacted on the shared worldview of the conceptual frameworks, functions and actions of the TSAS.The TSAS has been configured as a hybrid relational space that develops in dynamic tension between citizen mobilization, social entrepreneurship, the social economy and community support networks. This tension, which produces multiple meanings and perspectives for analysis, is only understandable from the analysis of the plural responses promoted by civil society.The purpose of this article is to analyze this process in the 10-year period between the Great Recession (2009-2012) and the Great Stop (2020) produced by Covid-19.We must understand this hybrid relationship from the intensification of the care pressure that both crises have meant for all social organizations. This tension has spun from the dynamism of social movements in the Great Recession and the rise of neighbourhood-community networks during the pandemic.

TI  - Affordable Use of Satellite Imagery in Agriculture and Development Projects: Assessing the Spatial Distribution of Invasive Weeds in the UNESCO-Protected Areas of Cuba
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The effective and regular remote monitoring of agricultural activity is not always possible in developing countries because the access to cloud-based geospatial analysis platforms or expensive high-resolution satellite images are not always available. Herein, using paid high-resolution satellite images first and then free medium-resolution satellite images, we aimed to develop a cost-free, affordable method for regularly mapping the spatial distribution of sicklebush (Dichrostachys cinerea), an archetypal allochthonous invasive plant in Cuba that is becoming impossible to control owing to its rapid growth in areas planted with sugar cane in the Trinidad-Valle de los Ingenios area (Cuba), a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Two types of images were used (WorldView-2 and Landsat-8); these were subjected to supervised classification, with accuracy values of 88.7% and 93.7%, respectively. Vegetation cover was first derived from the purchased WorldView-2 image, and this information was then used as the training field to obtain spectral signatures from the Landsat-8 free image so that Landsat images may be regularly used to monitor D. cinerea infestations. The results obtained in the spatial distribution map for sicklebush in the Landsat-8 images had an overall reliability of 93.7% and a Kappa coefficient reliability of 91.9%. These values indicate high confidence in the results, which suggests that sicklebush has invaded 52.7% of the total 46,807.26-ha area of the Trinidad-Valle de los Ingenios. This process proved extremely effective and demonstrated the benefits of using high-resolution spatial images from which information can be transferred to free satellite images with a larger pixel size.

TI  - Optimization of Rain Gauge Networks for Arid Regions Based on Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water depletion is a growing problem in the world's arid and semi-arid areas, where groundwater is the primary source of fresh water. Accurate climatic data must be obtained to protect municipal water budgets. Unfortunately, the majority of these arid regions have a sparsely distributed number of rain gauges, which reduces the reliability of the spatio-temporal fields generated. The current research proposes a series of measures to address the problem of data scarcity, in particular regarding in-situ measurements of precipitation. Once the issue of improving the network of ground precipitation measurements is settled, this may pave the way for much-needed hydrological research on topics such as the spatiotemporal distribution of precipitation, flash flood prevention, and soil erosion reduction. In this study, a k-means cluster analysis is used to determine new locations for the rain gauge network at the Eastern side of the Gulf of Suez in Sinai. The clustering procedure adopted is based on integrating a digital elevation model obtained from The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM 90 x 90 m) and Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) for four rainy events. This procedure enabled the determination of the potential centroids for three different cluster sizes (3, 6, and 9). Subsequently, each number was tested using the Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function (ECDF) in an effort to determine the optimal one. However, all the tested centroids exhibited gaps in covering the whole range of elevations and precipitation of the test site. The nine centroids with the five existing rain gauges were used as a basis to calculate the error kriging. This procedure enabled decreasing the error by increasing the number of the proposed gauges. The resulting points were tested again by ECDF and this confirmed the optimum of thirty-one suggested additional gauges in covering the whole range of elevations and precipitation records at the study site.

TI  - Monitoring and Forecasting of Urban Expansion Using Machine Learning-Based Techniques and Remotely Sensed Data: A Case Study of Gharbia Governorate, Egypt
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid population growth is the main driver of the accelerating urban sprawl into agricultural lands in Egypt. This is particularly obvious in governorates where there is no desert backyard (e.g., Gharbia) for urban expansion. This work presents an overview of machine learning-based and state-of-the-art remote sensing products and methodologies to address the issue of random urban expansion, which negatively impacts environmental sustainability. The study aims (1) to investigate the land-use/land-cover (LULC) changes over the past 27 years, and to simulate the future LULC dynamics over Gharbia; and (2) to produce an Urbanization Risk Map in order for the decision-makers to be informed of the districts with priority for sustainable planning. Time-series Landsat images were utilized to analyze the historical LULC change between 1991 and 2018, and to predict the LULC change by 2033 and 2048 based on a logistic regression-Markov chain model. The results show that there is a rapid urbanization trend corresponding to a diminution of the agricultural land. The agricultural sector represented 91.2% of the total land area in 1991, which was reduced to 83.7% in 2018. The built-up area exhibited a similar (but reversed) pattern. The results further reveal that the observed LULC dynamics will continue in a like manner in the future, confirming a remarkable urban sprawl over the agricultural land from 2018 to 2048. The cultivated land changes have a strong negative correlation with the built-up cover changes (the R-2 were 0.73 in 1991-2003, and 0.99 in 2003-2018, respectively). Based on the Fuzzy TOPSIS technique, Mahalla Kubra and Tanta are the districts which were most susceptible to the undesirable environmental and socioeconomic impacts of the persistent urbanization. Such an unplanned loss of the fertile agricultural lands of the Nile Delta could negatively influence the production of premium agricultural crops for the local market and export. This study is substantial for the understanding of future trends of LULC changes, and for the proposal of alternative policies to reduce urban sprawl on fertile agricultural lands.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Prediction and Mapping of Heavy Metals at Regional Scale Using Regression Methods and Landsat 7
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil contamination by heavy metals is of particular concern, due to the direct negative impact on crop yield, food quality and human health. Although the conventional approach to monitor heavy metals relies on field sampling and lab analysis, the proliferation in the use of portable spectrometers has reduced the cost and time of investigation. However, discrepancies in spectral data from different spectrometers increase the modeling time and undermine the model accuracy for spatial mapping. This study, therefore, took advantage of the readily accessible Landsat 7 data to predict and map the spatiotemporal distribution of ten heavy metals (i.e., Sb, Pb, Ni, Mn, Hg, Cu, Cr, Co, Cd and As) over a 640 km(2) area in Belgium. The Land Use/Cover Area Frame Survey (LUCAS) database of a region in north-eastern Belgium was used to retrieve variation in heavy metals concentrations over time and space, using the Landsat 7 imagery for four single dates in 2009, 2013, 2016 and 2020. Three regression methods, namely, partial least squares regression (PLSR), random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) were used to model and predict the heavy metal concentrations for 2009. By comparing these models unbiasedly, the best model was selected for predicting and mapping the heavy metal distributions for 2013, 2016 and 2020. RF turned out to be the optimal model for 2009 with a coefficient of determination of prediction (R-P(2)) and residual prediction deviation of prediction (RPDP) ranging from 0.62 to 0.92, and 1.23 to 2.79, respectively. The measured heavy metal distributions along the river floodplains, at the highlands and in the lowlands, were generally high, compared to their RF spatiotemporal predictions, which decreased over time. Increasing moisture contents in the floodplains adjacent to the river channels and the lowlands were the primary contributors to the reduction in the satellite reflectance spectra. However, topsoil erosion from rainfall, snowmelt as well as wind into the lowlands could have influenced the reduction in heavy metal spatiotemporal predicted values over time in the highlands. The spatiotemporal prediction maps produced for the heavy metals for the four different years revealed a good spatial similarity and consistency with the measured maps for 2009, which indicates their stability over the years.

TI  - Three Decades after: Landscape Dynamics in Different Colonisation Models Implemented in the Brazilian Legal Amazon
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Several colonisation projects were implemented in the Brazilian Legal Amazon in the 1970s and 1980s. Among these colonisation projects, the most prominent were those with the "fishbone " and "topographic " models. Within this scope, the settlements known as Anari and Machadinho stand out because they are contiguous areas with different models and structures of occupation and colonisation. The main objective of this work was to evaluate the dynamics of Land-Use and Land-Cover (LULC) in two different colonisation models, implanted in the State of Rondonia in the 1980s. The fishbone and topographic or Disorganised Multidirectional models were implemented in the Anari and Machadinho settlements, respectively. A 36-year time series of Landsat images (1984-2020) was used to evaluate the rates and trends in the LULC process in the different colonisation models. In the analysed models, a rapid loss of primary and secondary forests (anthropized areas) was observed, mainly due to the dynamics of its use, established by the Agriculture/Pasture relation with a heavy dependence on road construction. Understanding these two forms of occupation can help the future programs and guidelines of the Brazilian Legal Amazon and any tropical rainforest across the globe.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Staging with Indocyanine Green for Patients with Cervical Cancer: The Safety and Feasibility of Open Approach Using SPY-PHI Technique
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary: While several studies have been conducted on the safety and efficacy of sentinel lymph node technique during minimally invasive radical hysterectomy and indicated that using indocyanine green alone is a better tracer agent, there is now high unmet medical need and growing demand for more data about sentinel lymph node detection and the most suitable tracer in open surgery for cervical cancer, especially after the publishing of the of Laparoscopic Approach to Cervical Cancer (LACC) Trial data. The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility and safety of sentinel lymph nodes with indocyanine green in cervical cancer patients undergoing radical hysterectomy in open surgery and to compare the detection rates of this tracer in the open versus laparoscopic approaches.(1) Background: Sentinel lymph node staging (SLN) with indocyanine green (ICG) in cervical cancer is the standard of care in most national and international guidelines. However, the vast majority of relevant studies about the safety and feasibility of this method are conducted on minimally invasive surgery; (2) Methods: This study is a retrospective analysis of a retrospective collected database of 76 consecutive patients with cervical cancers, who were operated laparoscopically (50%), or laparotomy (50%). Sentinel nodes were defined as the ICG-positive pelvic nodes in the first and second echelons. False negative cases were defined as positive non-sentinel lymph nodes despite successful sentinel mapping or failed mapping bilaterally by per-patient assessment or unilaterally by pelvic sidewall assessment; (3) Results: Regardless of the approach (open or laparoscopic), the SLN technique achieved a total sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 94.7%, 98.6%, and 94.7%, respectively in the entire sample. The bilateral detection rate was as high as 93.4% with identical results in both approaches. The sensitivity and NPV for SNL in open surgery was found to be similar to minimal access surgery; (4) Conclusions: ICG and SPY-PHI technique is a reliable tool to detect sentinel lymph nodes in cervical cancer during laparotomy.

TI  - Evaluation of an enhanced pathological examination protocol for sentinel lymph nodes from patients with breast carcinoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Clinical trials have shown that many patients with breast cancer with limited sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastatic disease can safely avoid axillary lymph node dissection. Ultra-staging of initially negative SLNs may not confer additional clinical benefit. Despite this, protocols of 'enhanced pathological examination' (EPE) are still widely used. We evaluated the impact of our EPE protocol. If initial SLN H&Es are negative, we cut three additional H&E levels at 500 mu m intervals with two spare sections at each level, to allow for immunohistochemistry if necessary. Occult micrometastases or isolated tumour cells were identified, using this protocol, in 3.4%, resulting in change of N stage in 3%. 1% of patients had further axillary surgery based on these findings. Our SLN-EPE protocol provided additional information in a small number of cases and changed axillary management in a minority. It represented a significant workload for scientists and pathologists, and had time and cost implications. We concluded that emphasising careful gross examination along with judicious use of additional levels and immunohistochemistry may be more beneficial than our current protocol.

TI  - Shallow-Water Benthic Habitat Mapping Using Drone with Object Based Image Analyses
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial information on benthic habitats in Wangiwangi island waters, Wakatobi District, Indonesia was very limited in recent years. However, this area is one of the marine tourism destinations and one of the Indonesia's triangle coral reef regions with a very complex coral reef ecosystem. The drone technology that has rapidly developed in this decade, can be used to map benthic habitats in this area. This study aimed to map shallow-water benthic habitats using drone technology in the region of Wangiwangi island waters, Wakatobi District, Indonesia. The field data were collected using a 50 x 50 cm squared transect of 434 observation points in March-April 2017. The DJI Phantom 3 Pro drone with a spatial resolution of 5.2 x 5.2 cm was used to acquire aerial photographs. Image classifications were processed using object-based image analysis (OBIA) method with contextual editing classification at level 1 (reef level) with 200 segmentation scale and several segmentation scales at level 2 (benthic habitat). For level 2 classification, we found that the best algorithm to map benthic habitat was the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm with a segmentation scale of 50. Based on field observations, we produced 12 and 9 benthic habitat classes. Using the OBIA method with a segmentation value of 50 and the SVM algorithm, we obtained the overall accuracy of 77.4% and 81.1% for 12 and 9 object classes, respectively. This result improved overall accuracy up to 17% in mapping benthic habitats using Sentinel-2 satellite data within the similar region, similar classes, and similar method of classification analyses.

TI  - Temperature-Independent Cloud Phase Retrieval From Shortwave-Infrared Measurement of GCOM-C/SGLI With Comparison to CALIPSO
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The shortwave infrared (SWIR) channels commonly accommodated in satellite-borne passive sensors contain information on cloud thermodynamic phase as well as cloud optical thickness (COT) and cloud effective radius (CER). This study develops algorithms for simultaneous retrieval of COT, CER, and cloud thermodynamic phase to estimate the fractional probability of the cloud phase as an alternative to discrete discrimination into liquid and ice typical of operational cloud retrievals. Two algorithms were developed and applied to the SWIR channels centered at 1.05, 1.63, and 2.21 mu m of Second-generation Global Imager (SGLI). The first algorithm retrieves COT, CER, and ice COT fractions relative to the total COT, which is a continuous quantity representing the partitioning into liquid and ice phases. The second represents the cloud phase partitioning in the form of differences between radiances observed and simulated under the assumptions of either liquid or ice clouds when retrieving COT and CER. The cloud phases from these algorithms agreed quantitatively with each other, and were able to characterize the phase occurrence on a global scale. The two types of cloud phase characterization were further compared against CALIPSO to find that the zonal-mean occurrences of the cloud phase from the first algorithm were broadly consistent with those from CALIPSO, except for significantly smaller occurrences of supercooled water clouds in SGLI than in CALIPSO over middle-to-high latitude oceans. The cloud phase occurrences were also found to systematically vary with CER and cloud-top temperature on a global scale in a manner significantly different between SGLI and CALIPSO.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Analysis of Surface Urban Heat Island and Thermal Comfort Using Landsat Satellite Images between 1989 and 2019: A Case Study in Tehran
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping and monitoring the spatio-temporal variations of the Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) and thermal comfort of metropolitan areas are vital to obtaining the necessary information about the environmental conditions and promoting sustainable cities. As the most populated city of Iran, Tehran has experienced considerable population growth and Land Cover/Land Use (LULC) changes in the last decades, which resulted in several adverse environmental issues. In this study, 68 Landsat-5 and Landsat-8 images, collected from the Google Earth Engine (GEE), were employed to map and monitor the spatio-temporal variations of LULC, SUHI, and thermal comfort of Tehran between 1989 and 2019. In this regard, planar fitting and Gaussian Surface Model (GSM) approaches were employed to map SUHIs and derive the relevant statistical values. Likewise, the thermal comfort of the city was investigated by the Urban Thermal Field Variance Index (UTFVI). The results indicated that the SUHI intensities have generally increased throughout the city by an average value of about 2.02 & DEG;C in the past three decades. The most common reasons for this unfavorable increase were the loss of vegetation cover (i.e., 34.72%) and massive urban expansions (i.e., 53.33%). Additionally, the intra-annual investigations in 2019 revealed that summer and winter, with respectively 8.28 & DEG;C and 4.37 & DEG;C, had the highest and lowest SUHI magnitudes. Furthermore, the decadal UTFVI maps revealed notable thermal comfort degradation of Tehran, by which in 2019, approximately 52.35% of the city was identified as the region with the worst environmental condition, of which 59.94% was related to human residents. Additionally, the relationships between various air pollutants and SUHI intensities were appraised, suggesting positive relationships (i.e., ranging between 0.23 and 0.43) that can be used for establishing possible two-way mitigations strategies. This study provided analyses of spatio-temporal monitoring of SUHI and UTFVI throughout Tehran that urban managers and policymakers can consider for adaption and sustainable development.

TI  - The Lymphatic System in Breast Cancer: Anatomical and Molecular Approaches
T2  - MEDICINA-LITHUANIA
M3  - Review
AB  - Breast cancer is one of the most important causes of premature mortality among women and it is one of the most frequently diagnosed tumours worldwide. For this reason, routine screening for prevention and early diagnosis is important for the quality of life of patients. Breast cancer cells can enter blood and lymphatic capillaries, then metastasizing to the regional lymph nodes in the axilla and to both visceral and non-visceral sites. Rather than at the primary site, they seem to enter the systemic circulation mainly through the sentinel lymph node and the biopsy of this indicator can influence the axillary dissection during the surgical approach to the pathology. Furthermore, secondary lymphoedema is another important issue for women following breast cancer surgical treatment or radiotherapy. Considering these fundamental aspects, the present article aims to describe new methodological approaches to assess the anatomy of the lymphatic network in the axillary region, as well as the molecular and physiological control of lymphatic vessel function, in order to understand how the lymphatic system contributes to breast cancer disease. Due to their clinical implications, the understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing lymph node metastasis in breast cancer are also examined. Beyond the investigation of breast lymphatic networks and lymphatic molecular mechanisms, the discovery of new effective anti-lymphangiogenic drugs for future clinical settings appears essential to support any future development in the treatment of breast cancer.

TI  - Earth Observation Systems and Pasture Modeling: A Bibliometric Trend Analysis
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - An Earth observation system (EOS) is essential in monitoring and improving our understanding of how natural and managed agricultural landscapes change over time or respond to climate change and overgrazing. Such changes can be quantified using a pasture model (PM), a critical tool for monitoring changes in pastures driven by the growing population demands and climate change-related challenges and thus ensuring a sustainable food production system. This study used the bibliometric method to assess global scientific research trends in EOS and PM studies from 1979 to 2019. This study analyzed 399 published articles from the Scopus indexed database with the search term "Earth observation systems OR pasture model ". The annual growth rate of 19.76% suggests that the global research on EOS and PM has increased over time during the survey period. The average growth per article is n = 74, average total citations (ATC) = 2949 in the USA, is n = 37, ATC = 488, in China and is n = 22, ATC = 544 in Italy). These results show that the field of the study was inconsistent in terms of ATC per article during the study period. Furthermore, these results show three countries (USA, China, and Italy) ranked as the most productive countries by article publications and the Netherlands had the highest average total citations. This may suggest that these countries have strengthened research development on EOS and PM studies. However, developing counties such as Mexico, Thailand, Sri Lanka, and other African countries had a lower number of publications during the study period. Moreover, the results showed that Earth observation is fundamental in understanding PM dynamics to design targeted interventions and ensure food security. In general, the paper highlights various advances in EOS and PM studies and suggests the direction of future studies.

AB  - This paper presents the trends of landscape change in the marshes on the southern shore of Lake Balaton, a wetland profoundly transformed by human activities. The study does not only deal with alterations in the areal proportions of land use classes but also quantitatively analyses landscape pattern, comparing landscape metrics on different dates. Based on the findings, proposals for rehabilitation are made. Through the restoration of wetland habitats, the provision level of ecosystem services can be raised. Landscape change was investigated from 1783 to 2020. For this purpose, archive maps were digitized, CORINE land cover datasets corrected by Sentinel-2 imagery were employed and from the vector data, the proportions of land use classes were calculated. For landscape pattern perimeter, area, neighbourhood and diversity metrics were used, calculated by ArcGIS vLATE plugin. It was pointed out that in land cover, the share of wetlands considerably declined over the centuries but in recent decades somewhat expanded. In the 20th century, grasslands were the predominant land use class, but with the spread of other categories, land use has become more complex. Landscape metrics show an increased fragmentation of natural habitats, a higher number of patches and edge density, leading to higher landscape diversity. Rehabilitation proposals include the establishment of rainwater retention reservoirs, the conversion of arable land which cannot be cultivated profitably to close-to-natural classes (first of all, grasslands) and the plantation of gallery forests of native tree species along canals. In comparison with other regions, similar temporal trends and spatial distributions are observed. For instance, the internationally well-known transformation of the Donana wetland started later but was more intensive than in Hungary.

TI  - Mapping of Coral Reefs with Multispectral Satellites: A Review of Recent Papers
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Coral reefs are an essential source of marine biodiversity, but they are declining at an alarming rate under the combined effects of global change and human pressure. A precise mapping of coral reef habitat with high spatial and time resolutions has become a necessary step for monitoring their health and evolution. This mapping can be achieved remotely thanks to satellite imagery coupled with machine-learning algorithms. In this paper, we review the different satellites used in recent literature, as well as the most common and efficient machine-learning methods. To account for the recent explosion of published research on coral reel mapping, we especially focus on the papers published between 2018 and 2020. Our review study indicates that object-based methods provide more accurate results than pixel-based ones, and that the most accurate methods are Support Vector Machine and Random Forest. We emphasize that the satellites with the highest spatial resolution provide the best images for benthic habitat mapping. We also highlight that preprocessing steps (water column correction, sunglint removal, etc.) and additional inputs (bathymetry data, aerial photographs, etc.) can significantly improve the mapping accuracy.

TI  - The Distribution and Composition of Vector Abundance in Hanoi City, Vietnam: Association with Livestock Keeping and Flavivirus Detection
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Dengue virus and Japanese encephalitis virus are two common flaviviruses that are spread widely by Aedes and Culex mosquitoes. Livestock keeping is vital for cities; however, it can pose the risk of increasing the mosquito population. Our study explored how livestock keeping in and around a large city is associated with the presence of mosquitoes and the risk of them spreading flaviviruses. Methods: An entomological study was conducted in 6 districts with 233 households with livestock, and 280 households without livestock, in Hanoi city. BG-Sentinel traps and CDC light traps were used to collect mosquitoes close to animal farms and human habitats. Adult mosquitoes were counted, identified to species level, and grouped into 385 pools, which were screened for flaviviruses using a pan-flavivirus qPCR protocol and sequencing. Results: A total of 12,861 adult mosquitoes were collected at the 513 households, with 5 different genera collected, of which the Culex genus was the most abundant. Our study found that there was a positive association between livestock keeping and the size of the mosquito population-most predominantly between pig rearing and Culex species (p < 0.001). One pool of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, collected in a peri-urban district, was found to be positive for Japanese encephalitis virus. Conclusions: The risk of flavivirus transmission in urban areas of Hanoi city due to the spread of Culex and Aedes mosquitoes could be facilitated by livestock keeping.

TI  - Years of Life Lost (YLL) Due to Short-Term Exposure to Ambient Air Pollution in China: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - (1) Background: Years of life lost (YLL) as a surrogate of health is important for supporting ambient air pollution related policy decisions. However, there has been little comprehensive evaluation of the short-term impact of air pollution on cause-specific YLL, especially in China. Hence in this study, we selected China as sentinel region in order to conduct a meta-analysis to evaluate disease-specific YLL due to all the main ambient air pollutants. (2) Methods: A meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate disease-specific YLL due to the main ambient air pollutants in China, and 19 studies were included. We conducted methodological quality and risk of bias assessment for each included study as well as for heterogeneity and publication bias. Subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis were also performed. (3) Results: Meta-analysis indicated that increases in PM2.5, PM10, SO2 and NO2 were associated with 1.99-5.84 years increase in YLL from non-accidental diseases. The increase in YLL to cardiovascular disease (CVD) was associated with PM10 and NO2, and the increase in YLL to respiratory diseases (RD) was associated with PM10. (4) Conclusions: Ambient air pollution was observed to be associated with several cause-specific YLL, increasing especially for elderly people and females.

TI  - Sentinel-2 Reveals Abrupt Increment of Total Suspended Matter While <i>Ever Given</i> Ship Blocked the Suez Canal
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The blockage of the Suez Canal, one of the world's key trade routes, by a giant container ship in March 2021 was in the spotlight of news media worldwide, mainly because of its economic impacts. In this study, we look at this event from an environmental perspective by analyzing the impact of the artificial barrier made by the ship over the channel and of operations like dredging on the concentration of total suspended matter (TSM). In this context, multitemporal Sentinel-2 images are used to study short-term variations of TSM within a time window spanning before, during, and after the blockage event. A well-established neural network-based processor called Case 2 Regional CoastColour (C2RCC) is employed to derive remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) and then TSM concentrations from Sentinel-2 imagery. The results indicate that the stuck ship acted as an artificial barrier leading to very different TSM conditions north and south of the canal. Furthermore, the blockage of the Suez Canal and subsequent dredging caused an abrupt increment (+400%) in the concentration of TSM moving north from the ship's location. We also identified a very high contrast between the TSM concentration in the north and south of the vessel during the blockage event.

TI  - The Use of Geoinformatics in Coastal Atmospheric Transport Phenomena: The Athens Experiment
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal environment, an area where abrupt changes occur between land and sea, significantly affects the quality of life of a high portion of the Earth's population. Therefore, the wide range of phenomena observed in coastal areas need to be assessed reliably regarding both data sets and methods applied. In particular, the study of coastal atmospheric transport phenomena which affect a variety of activities in coastal areas, using modeling techniques, demand accurate estimations of a range of meteorological and climatological variables related to the planetary boundary layer. However, the accuracy of such estimations is not obvious. Geoinformatics is able to fill this gap and provide the framework for the design, processing and implementation of accurate geo-databases. This paper aims to highlight the role of geoinformatics in the context of coastal meteorology and climatology. More precisely, it aims to reveal the effect on the performance of a Mesoscale Meteorological Model when a new scheme regarding the input surface parameters is developed using satellite data and application of Geographical Information Systems. The development of the proposed scheme is described and evaluated using the coastal Metropolitan Area of Athens, Greece as a case study. The results indicate a general improvement in the model performance based on the statistical evaluations of three meteorological parameters (temperature, wind speed and wind direction) using four appropriate indicators. The best performance was observed for temperature, then for wind direction and finally for wind speed. The necessity of the proposed new scheme is further discussed.

TI  - Identifying Surface Urban Heat Island Drivers and Their Spatial Heterogeneity in China's 281 Cities: An Empirical Study Based on Multiscale Geographically Weighted Regression
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatially heterogeneous nature and geographical scale of surface urban heat island (SUHI) driving mechanisms remain largely unknown, as most previous studies have focused solely on their global performance and impact strength. This paper analyzes diurnal and nocturnal SUHIs in China based on the multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) model for 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2018. Compared to results obtained using the ordinary least square (OLS) model, the MGWR model has a lower corrected Akaike information criterion value and significantly improves the model's coefficient of determination (OLS: 0.087-0.666, MGWR: 0.616-0.894). The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and nighttime light (NTL) are the most critical drivers of daytime and nighttime SUHIs, respectively. In terms of model bandwidth, population and & UDelta;fine particulate matter are typically global variables, while & UDelta;NDVI, intercept (i.e., spatial context), and NTL are local variables. The nighttime coefficient of & UDelta;NDVI is significantly negative in the more economically developed southern coastal region, while it is significantly positive in northwestern China. Our study not only improves the understanding of the complex drivers of SUHIs from a multiscale perspective but also provides a basis for urban heat island mitigation by more precisely identifying the heterogeneity of drivers.

TI  - Forest and Peatland Fire Dynamics in South Sumatra Province
T2  - FOREST AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - South Sumatra Province experiences forest and land fires every year. Peatland and human activity have caused this region to be more vulnerable to fire. In this study, we used annual mapping to describe the history of forest and land fires in Ogan Komering Ilir (OKI) District of South Sumatra to analyze fire trends during the 2015-2019 period. Hotspot data were obtained from Terra/Aqua MODIS satellite imagery at all confidence levels. Burned areas were identified using the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) Index, with data sources from Landsat 8 satellite imagery obtained from the USGS (United States Geological Survey). The highest number of hotspots were detected in 2015 (33,748), with 72% was located on peatland. Historical analysis of hotspot numbers, shows that the majority of burning occurs in September and October. This indicates that prevention activities must be carried out more intensively before these months. Linear regression between annual hotspot numbers and rainfall was not significant. Hotspots indicative of forest and land fire in OKI District were more influenced by human activities. The largest burned area (993,999 ha) occurred in 2015. The 2015 El Nino event triggered drought and worsened forest and land fires in Indonesia. Although no El-Nino conditions occurred in 2016-2018, fires continued to occur in OKI District, showing their independence from extreme drought. The fires occurring on peatlands burned a large area during 2015-2019 indicating that forest and land fires management must become a top priority in OKI District.

TI  - A phase III randomized clinical trial comparing sentinel node biopsy with no retroperitoneal node dissection in apparent early-stage endometrial cancer - ENDO-3: ANZGOG trial 1911/2020
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sentinel node biopsy is a surgical technique to explore lymph nodes for surgical staging of endometrial cancer, which has replaced full retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. However, the effectiveness of sentinel node biopsy, its value to patients, and potential harms compared with no-node dissection have never been shown in a randomized trial.Primary Objectives Stage 1 will test recovery from surgery. Stage 2 will compare disease-free survival at 4.5 years between patients randomized to sentinel node biopsy versus no retroperitoneal node dissection.Study Hypothesis The primary hypothesis for stage 1 is that treatment with sentinel node biopsy will not cause detriment to patient outcomes (lymphedema, morbidity, loss of quality of life) and will not increase treatment-related morbidity or health services costs compared with patients treated without a retroperitoneal node dissection at 12 months after surgery. The primary hypothesis for stage 2 is that disease-free survival at 4.5 years after surgery in patients without retroperitoneal node dissection is not inferior to those receiving sentinel node biopsy.Trial Design This phase Ill, open-label, two-arm, multistage, randomized non-inferiority trial (ENDO-3) will determine the value of sentinel node biopsy for surgical management of endometrial cancer. Patients with endometrial cancer are randomized to receive: (1) laparoscopic/robotic hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with sentinel node biopsy or (2) laparoscopic/robotic hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy without retroperitoneal node dissection. In stage 1, 444 patients will be enrolled to demonstrate feasibility and quality of life. If this is demonstrated, we will enroll another 316 patients in stage 2.Major Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Inclusion criteria include women aged 18 years or older with histologically confirmed endometrial cancer; clinical stage 1, who meet the criteria for laparoscopic or robotic total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Patients with uterine mesenchymal tumors are excluded.Primary Endpoints The endpoint for stage 1 is surgical recovery, with the proportion of patients returning to usual daily activities at 3 months post-surgery as measured with the EQ-5D. Stage 2 is disease-free survival at 4.5 years.Sample Size 760 participants (both stages).Estimated Dates for Completing Accrual and Presenting Results Stage 1 commenced in January 2021 and is planned to be completed in December 2024 when 444 participants have completed 12 months' follow-up. Stage 2 will enroll a further 316 participants for a total of 760 patients.

TI  - Crop Type Mapping from Optical and Radar Time Series Using Attention-Based Deep Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop maps are key inputs for crop inventory production and yield estimation and can inform the implementation of effective farm management practices. Producing these maps at detailed scales requires exhaustive field surveys that can be laborious, time-consuming, and expensive to replicate. With a growing archive of remote sensing data, there are enormous opportunities to exploit dense satellite image time series (SITS), temporal sequences of images over the same area. Generally, crop type mapping relies on single-sensor inputs and is solved with the help of traditional learning algorithms such as random forests or support vector machines. Nowadays, deep learning techniques have brought significant improvements by leveraging information in both spatial and temporal dimensions, which are relevant in crop studies. The concurrent availability of Sentinel-1 (synthetic aperture radar) and Sentinel-2 (optical) data offers a great opportunity to utilize them jointly; however, optimizing their synergy has been understudied with deep learning techniques. In this work, we analyze and compare three fusion strategies (input, layer, and decision levels) to identify the best strategy that optimizes optical-radar classification performance. They are applied to a recent architecture, notably, the pixel-set encoder-temporal attention encoder (PSE-TAE) developed specifically for object-based classification of SITS and based on self-attention mechanisms. Experiments are carried out in Brittany, in the northwest of France, with Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 time series. Input and layer-level fusion competitively achieved the best overall F-score surpassing decision-level fusion by 2%. On a per-class basis, decision-level fusion increased the accuracy of dominant classes, whereas layer-level fusion improves up to 13% for minority classes. Against single-sensor baseline, multi-sensor fusion strategies identified crop types more accurately: for example, input-level outperformed Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 by 3% and 9% in F-score, respectively. We have also conducted experiments that showed the importance of fusion for early time series classification and under high cloud cover condition.

TI  - A Calibration/Disaggregation Coupling Scheme for Retrieving Soil Moisture at High Spatio-Temporal Resolution: Synergy between SMAP Passive Microwave, MODIS/Landsat Optical/Thermal and Sentinel-1 Radar Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) data are required at high spatio-temporal resolution-typically the crop field scale every 3-6 days-for agricultural and hydrological purposes. To provide such high-resolution SM data, many remote sensing methods have been developed from passive microwave, active microwave and thermal data. Despite the pros and cons of each technique in terms of spatio-temporal resolution and their sensitivity to perturbing factors such as vegetation cover, soil roughness and meteorological conditions, there is currently no synergistic approach that takes advantage of all relevant (passive, active microwave and thermal) remote sensing data. In this context, the objective of the paper is to develop a new algorithm that combines SMAP L-band passive microwave, MODIS/Landsat optical/thermal and Sentinel-1 C-band radar data to provide SM data at the field scale at the observation frequency of Sentinel-1. In practice, it is a three-step procedure in which: (1) the 36 km resolution SMAP SM data are disaggregated at 100 m resolution using MODIS/Landsat optical/thermal data on clear sky days, (2) the 100 m resolution disaggregated SM data set is used to calibrate a radar-based SM retrieval model and (3) the so-calibrated radar model is run at field scale on each Sentinel-1 overpass. The calibration approach also uses a vegetation descriptor as ancillary data that is derived either from optical (Sentinel-2) or radar (Sentinel-1) data. Two radar models (an empirical linear regression model and a non-linear semi-empirical formulation derived from the water cloud model) are tested using three vegetation descriptors (NDVI, polarization ratio (PR) and radar coherence (CO)) separately. Both models are applied over three experimental irrigated and rainfed wheat crop sites in central Morocco. The field-scale temporal correlation between predicted and in situ SM is in the range of 0.66-0.81 depending on the retrieval configuration. Based on this data set, the linear radar model using PR as a vegetation descriptor offers a relatively good compromise between precision and robustness all throughout the agricultural season with only three parameters to set. The proposed synergistical approach combining multi-resolution/multi-sensor SM-relevant data offers the advantage of not requiring in situ measurements for calibration.

TI  - Earthquake Aftermath from Very High-Resolution WorldView-2 Image and Semi-Automated Object-Based Image Analysis (Case Study: Kermanshah, Sarpol-e Zahab, Iran)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to classify an urban area and its surrounding objects after the destructive M7.3 Kermanshah earthquake (12 November 2017) in the west of Iran using very high-resolution (VHR) post-event WorldView-2 images and object-based image analysis (OBIA) methods. The spatial resolution of multispectral (MS) bands (~2 m) was first improved using a pan-sharpening technique that provides a solution by fusing the information of the panchromatic (PAN) and MS bands to generate pan-sharpened images with a spatial resolution of about 50 cm. After applying a segmentation procedure, the classification step was considered as the main process of extracting the aimed features. The aforementioned classification method includes applying spectral and shape indices. Then, the classes were defined as follows: type 1 (settlement area) was collapsed areas, non-collapsed areas, and camps; type 2 (vegetation area) was orchards, cultivated areas, and urban green spaces; and type 3 (miscellaneous area) was rocks, rivers, and bare lands. As OBIA results in the integration of the spatial characteristics of the image object, we also aimed to evaluate the efficiency of object-based features for damage assessment within the semi-automated approach. For this goal, image context assessment algorithms (e.g., textural parameters, shape, and compactness) together with spectral information (e.g., brightness and standard deviation) were applied within the integrated approach. The classification results were satisfactory when compared with the reference map for collapsed buildings provided by UNITAR (the United Nations Institute for Training and Research). In addition, the number of temporary camps was counted after applying OBIA, indicating that 10,249 tents or temporary shelters were established for homeless people up to 17 November 2018. Based on the total damaged population, the essential resources such as emergency equipment, canned food and water bottles can be estimated. The research makes a significant contribution to the development of remote sensing science by means of applying different object-based image-analyzing techniques and evaluating their efficiency within the semi-automated approach, which, accordingly, supports the efficient application of these methods to other worldwide case studies.</p>

TI  - The body on stage
T2  - METHAODOS-REVISTA DE CIENCIAS SOCIALES
M3  - Article
AB  - The present work addresses the question of the body, as a privileged entry way to the analyisis of one of the most important cultural transformations of our time; that is, the emergence of the form of virtual communication as a guideline for social interaction. From a succinct review of the different ways in which scientific production, particularly in social areas, has dealt with the body, a critique is attempted not only to its theoretical constraints (mechanistic, individualistic, materialistic and anthropocentric) but also to the verb centered way of producing them. The qualitative methodological approach is based here on the semiotic analysis that characterize the features and functioning of the different means of production of meaning considered. From this journey, the general purpose of the work is outlined, aimed at reviewing the theoretical limitations and, from there, epistemological and ontological that the research on the body presents. It is also held here, as a hypothesis, that from some of the emerging theoretical aspects of thought about the body, it is posible to build bridges with non-Western cultural traditions, such as the Andean worldview, capable of providing a differential way of understanding the body, and an alternative way of producing knowledge.

TI  - Magnetic Structure and Propagation of Two Interacting CMEs From the Sun to Saturn
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the grand challenges in heliophysics is the characterization of coronal mass ejection (CME) magnetic structure and evolution from eruption at the Sun through heliospheric propagation. At present, the main difficulties are related to the lack of direct measurements of the coronal magnetic fields and the lack of 3D in-situ measurements of the CME body in interplanetary space. Nevertheless, the evolution of a CME magnetic structure can be followed using a combination of multi-point remote-sensing observations and multi-spacecraft in-situ measurements as well as modeling. Accordingly, we present in this work the analysis of two CMEs that erupted from the Sun on April 28, 2012. We follow their eruption and early evolution using remote-sensing data, finding indications of CME-CME interaction, and then analyze their interplanetary counterpart(s) using in-situ measurements at Venus, Earth, and Saturn. We observe a seemingly single flux rope at all locations, but find possible signatures of interaction at Earth, where high-cadence plasma data are available. Reconstructions of the in-situ flux ropes provide almost identical results at Venus and Earth but show greater discrepancies at Saturn, suggesting that the CME was highly distorted and/or that further interaction with nearby solar wind structures took place before 10 AU. This work highlights the difficulties in connecting structures from the Sun to the outer heliosphere and demonstrates the importance of multi-spacecraft studies to achieve a deeper understanding of the magnetic configuration of CMEs.

TI  - High Resolution Distribution Dataset of Double-Season Paddy Rice in China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although China is the largest producer of rice, accounting for about 25% of global production, there are no high-resolution maps of paddy rice covering the entire country. Using time-weighted dynamic time warping (TWDTW), this study developed a pixel- and phenology-based method to identify planting areas of double-season paddy rice in China, by comparing temporal variations of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) signals of unknown pixels to those of known double-season paddy rice fields. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the method's performance at pixel and regional scales. Based on 145,210 field surveyed samples from 2018 to 2020, the producer's and user's accuracy are 88.49% and 87.02%, respectively. Compared to county-level statistical data from 2016 to 2019, the relative mean absolute errors are 34.11%. This study produced distribution maps of double-season rice at 10 m spatial resolution from 2016 to 2020 over nine provinces in South China, which account for more than 99% of the planting areas of double-season paddy rice of China. The maps are expected to contribute to timely monitoring and evaluating rice growth and yield.

TI  - Spatio-temporal pattern and driving forces of ecosystem services in coalfields of Shanxi Province, China
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - Although coal has made a huge contribution to the development of the economy and society and its economic benefits have often attracted much attention, little research has focused on the ecosystem services of coalfields. Based on remote sensing data, meteorological data, and soil data in Shanxi coalfields during 1986, 2000, and 2015, we estimated soil conservation and water yield using the InVEST model, assessed the net primary productivity of vegetation using the CASA model, and estimated sand fixation using the RWEQ model. Further, we simulated the spatial patterns of ecosystem services (ESs) using the k-means cluster analysis method and analyzed the influence factors of ESs using the Geodetector model in Shanxi coalfield areas. The results showed that soil conservation service, water yield service, and sand fixation service increased continuously. The high value area of soil conservation service was mainly concentrated in the north of Hedong coalfield and the northeast of Qinshui coalfield, while the low-value area was distributed in the southwestern edge of Datong coalfield. The high-value area of water yield service was mainly concentrated in the northeast of Qinshui coalfield, while the low-value area was distributed in the northeast of Qinshui coalfield, Xishan coalfield and northwestern Qinshui coalfield. The high-value area for vegetation production service was mainly concentrated in the southeast of Qinshui coalfield, while the low value area was distributed in Datong coalfield, Ningwu coalfield, Xishan coalfield, and northern Hedong coalfield. The distribution of low- and high-value areas of sand fixation service was unfixed. Ecosystem service bundles could be divided into four categories. The first category belonged to soil conservation service bundle, mainly distributed in the northern Ningwu coalfield, the northern Hedong coalfield, and the northern Qinshui coalfield. The second was water yield service bundle, mainly distributed in Huoxi coalfield and southern Qinshui coalfield. The third category belonged to vegetation production service bundle, mainly distributed in parts of Qinshui coalfield. The fourth category belonged to sand fixation service bundle, mainly distributed in the southern part of Hedong coalfield and Qinshui coalfield. Soil conservation service was greatly affected by temperature, digital elevation model (DEM), and industrial output value, with q values of 0.5, 0.3, and 0.2, respectively. Water yield service was greatly affected by precipitation, temperature, and DEM, with q values of 0.8, 0.3, and 0.2, respectively. The industrial output value, precipitation, and temperature q values of vegetation production service were 0.7, 0.6, and 0.2, respectively. The main influencing factors of sand fixation service were precipitation, temperature, and DEM, while the q values were 0.7, 0.3, and 0.3, respectively. The spatial distribution of coalfields ESs and the relationship between multiple ESs were closely related to natural and human factors. Therefore, maintaining the coordination relationship between natural-human factors and ecological services would be helpful to the management of the land reclamation, ecological reconstruction, and the sustainable development of coalfields ecosystem.

TI  - Estimating Forest Stand Height in Savannakhet, Lao PDR Using InSAR and Backscatter Methods with L-Band SAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest stand height (FSH), or average canopy height, serves as an important indicator for forest monitoring. The information provided about above-ground biomass for greenhouse gas emissions reporting and estimating carbon storage is relevant for reporting for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+). A novel forest height estimation method utilizing a fusion of backscatter and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data from JAXA's Advanced Land Observing Satellite Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (ALOS PALSAR) is applied to a use case in Savannakhet, Lao. Compared with LiDAR, the estimated height from the fusion method had an RMSE of 4.90 m and an R-2 of 0.26. These results are comparable to previous studies using SAR estimation techniques. Despite limitations of data quality and quantity, the Savannakhet, Lao use case demonstrates the applicability of these techniques utilizing L-band SAR data for estimating FSH in tropical forests and can be used as a springboard for use of L-band data from the future NASA-ISRO SAR (NISAR) mission.

TI  - A Local-to-Large Scale View of Maritime Continent Rainfall: Control by ENSO, MJO, and Equatorial Waves
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The canonical view of the Maritime Continent (MC) diurnal cycle is deep convection occurring over land during the afternoon and evening, tending to propagate offshore overnight. However, there is considerable day-to-day variability in the convection, and the mechanism of the offshore propagation is not well understood. We test the hypothesis that large-scale drivers such as ENSO, the MJO, and equatorial waves, through their modification of the local circulation, can modify the direction or strength of the propagation, or prevent the deep convection from triggering in the first place. Taking a local-to-large scale approach, we use in situ observations, satellite data, and reanalyses for five MC coastal regions, and show that the occurrence of the diurnal convection and its offshore propagation is closely tied to coastal wind regimes that we define using the k-means cluster algorithm. Strong prevailing onshore winds are associated with a suppressed diurnal cycle of precipitation, while prevailing offshore winds are associated with an active diurnal cycle, offshore propagation of convection, and a greater risk of extreme rainfall. ENSO, the MJO, equatorial Rossby waves, and westward mixed Rossby-gravity waves have varying levels of control over which coastal wind regime occurs, and therefore on precipitation, depending on the MC coastline in question. The large-scale drivers associated with dry and wet regimes are summarized for each location as a reference for forecasters.

TI  - A Google Earth Engine Application to Retrieve Long-Term Surface Temperature for Small Lakes. Case: San Pedro Lagoons, Chile
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake surface water temperature (LSWT) is a crucial water quality parameter that modulates many lake and reservoir processes. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor it from a long-term perspective. Over the last decades, many methods to retrieve LSWT fields from satellite imagery have been developed. This work aims to test, implement and automate six methods. These are performed in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, using 30 m spatial resolution images from Landsat 7 and 8 satellites for 2000-2020. Automated methods deliver long-term time series. Series are then calibrated with in situ data. Two-dimensional (2D) x time data fields are built on the lakes with the calibration, and a subsequent LSWT climatology is derived. Our study area is two urban lagoons with areas smaller than two (2) km2 of the city of San Pedro de la Paz, South-Central Chile. The six methods describe the seasonal variation of LSWT (Willmott's index of agreement > 0.91, R2 > 0.67). The main difference between series is their bias. Thus, after a simple calibration, all series adequately describe the LSWT. We utilized the Pedro de la Paz lagoons to demonstrate the method's utility. Our research demonstrates that these adjacent lagoons exhibit comparable LSWT spatial (15.5-17 & LCIRC;C) and temporal (7-25 & LCIRC;C) trends throughout the year. Differences in geographical pattern might result from the northern island's heat impact and the existence of the Biobio river to the east. Our work represents an efficient alternative for obtaining LSWT in particular lakes and reservoirs, especially useful in medium and small-sized ones.

AB  - Kratochwil's diagnostic approach identifies specific failures in particular, historical contexts in order to prescribe practically realisable remedies under non-ideal conditions. The diagnostic approach compares actual alternatives against each other rather than against some ideal. Yet, the basis for such an identification is unclear. By reinterpreting Kratochwil's approach with the help of Buddha's Four Noble Truths, one can understand Kratochwil's existential worldview and his aims, but the medium Kratochwil uses hinders the attainment of those goals. He tries to communicate in writing something (phronesis) that belongs in the world of experience.

TI  - Monitoring the Spring Flood in Lena Delta with Hydrodynamic Modeling Based on SAR Satellite Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the remote location and the extreme climate, monitoring stations in Arctic rivers such as Lena in Siberia have been decreasing through time. Every year, after a long harsh winter, the accumulated snow on the Lena watershed melts, leading to the major annual spring flood event causing heavy transport of sediments, organic carbon, and trace metals, both into as well as within the delta. This study aims to analyze the hydrodynamic processes of the spring flood taking place every year in the Lena Delta. Thus, a combination of remote sensing techniques and hydrodynamic modeling methodologies is used to overcome limitations caused by missing ground-truth data. As a test site for this feasibility study, the outlet of the Lena River to its delta was selected. Lena Delta is an extensive wetland spanning from northeast Siberia into the Arctic Ocean. Spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data of the TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X satellite mission served as input for the hydrodynamic modeling software HEC-RAS. The model resulted in inundation areas, flood depths, and flow velocities. The model accuracy assessed by comparing the multi-temporal modeled inundation areas with the satellite-derived inundation areas ranged between 65 and 95%, with kappa coefficients ranging between 0.78 and 0.97, showing moderate to almost perfect levels of agreement between the two inundation boundaries. Modeling results of high flow discharges show a better agreement with the satellite-derived inundation areas compared to that of lower flow discharges. Overall, the remote-sensing-based hydrodynamic modeling succeeded in indicating the increase and decrease in the inundation areas, flood depths, and flow velocities during the annual flood events.

TI  - Between Hoffmann and Goethe: The Young Brahms as Reader
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL MUSICAL ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This article provides a critical account of Brahms's early collection of quotations, aphorisms and poems commonly known as Des jungen Kreislers Schatzkastlein in the context of the composer's youthful engagement with German literature. Drawing on archival materials housed in Vienna, it evaluates the 1909 publication of the Schatzkastlein by the Deutsche Brahms-Gesellschaft and traces Brahms's path in assembling his quotations to reveal borrowings from sources he encountered in the Schumann house in Dusseldorf in 1854. The second section of the article considers the different modes of reading implied by Brahms's collection, while the third reflects on the artistic worldview articulated by the assembled entries. While scholars have viewed the Schatzkastlein largely as evidence of Brahms's adolescent infatuation with the writings of the German Romantics, this investigation emphasizes the competing conceptions of artistry present in these fascinatingly messy notebooks and argues that this youthful collection points to the important role played by literature in the development of Brahms's distinctive musical sensibility.

TI  - Sugarcane Yield Forecast in Ivory Coast (West Africa) Based on Weather and Vegetation Index Data
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - One way to use climate services in the case of sugarcane is to develop models that forecast yields to help the sector to be better prepared against climate risks. In this study, several models for forecasting sugarcane yields were developed and compared in the north of Ivory Coast (West Africa). These models were based on statistical methods, ranging from linear regression to machine learning algorithms such as the random forest method, fed by climate data (rainfall, temperature); satellite products (NDVI, EVI from MODIS Vegetation Index product) and information on cropping practices. The results show that the forecasting of sugarcane yield depended on the area considered. At the plot level, the noise due to cultivation practices can hide the effects of climate on yields and leads to poor forecasting performance. However, models using satellite variables are more efficient and those with EVI alone may explain 43% of yield variations. Moreover, taking into account cultural practices in the model improves the score and enables one to forecast 3 months before harvest in 50% and 69% of cases whether yields will be high or low, respectively, with errors of only 10% and 2%, respectively. These results on the predictive potential of sugarcane yields are useful for planning and climate risk management in this sector.

TI  - Root morphological traits of oil palm genotypes with differential resistance to fatal yellowing
T2  - SEMINA-CIENCIAS AGRARIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil has an extensive area where the climate and soil are suitable for oil palm growing. However, in part of this area, production has been limited by the occurrence of the fatal yellowing (FY) anomaly, whose initial symptom is the rotting of absorptive roots. This symptom can be more severe in oil palm genetic materials with a smaller root system. The aim of this study was to examine morphological traits of roots and shoots of seedlings of three oil palm genotypes with different degrees of resistance to FY, namely, Tenera (sensitive), Caiaue (resistant) and Interspecific Hybrid (resistant) to provide bases to elucidate the differential resistance of these materials to FY. Shoot biomass did not vary statistically between the genetic materials. The mass, length and area of fine and very fine roots were significantly higher in the Interspecific Hybrid than in Caiaue and Tenera. The fine and very fine roots of Interspecific Hybrid had a larger mass than Caiaue (114 and 133%, respectively) and Tenera (216 and 178%, respectively). The Interspecific Hybrid also exhibited higher values for the length of fine and very fine roots than Caiaue (155 and 99% respectively) and Tenera (228 and 94% respectively). The root traits of the Interspecific Hybrid and Tenera are compatible with their differential resistance to FY. Our results demonstrate the importance of expanding the study of the relationship between root morphology and resistance to FY in these genetic materials under conditions that favor the occurrence of the anomaly, such as flooding.

TI  - A New Separation Methodology for the Maritime Sector Emissions over the Mediterranean and Black Sea Regions
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this paper is to apply a new lane separation methodology for the maritime sector emissions attributed to the different vessel types and marine traffic loads in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea defined via the European Marine and Observation Data network (EMODnet), developed in 2016. This methodology is implemented for the first time on the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service Global Shipping (CAMS-GLOB-SHIP v2.1) nitrogen oxides (NOX) emissions inventory, on the Sentinel-5 Precursor Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) nitrogen dioxide (NO2) tropospheric vertical column densities, and on the LOTOS-EUROS (Long Term Ozone Simulation-European Operational Smog) CTM (chemical transport model) simulations. By applying this new EMODnet-based lane separation method to the CAMS-GLOB-SHIP v2.1 emission inventory, we find that cargo and tanker vessels account for approximately 80% of the total emissions in the Mediterranean, followed by fishing, passenger, and other vessel emissions with contributions of 8%, 7%, and 5%, respectively. Tropospheric NO2 vertical column densities sensed by TROPOMI for 2019 and simulated by the LOTOS-EUROS CTM have been successfully attributed to the major vessel activities in the Mediterranean; the mean annual NO2 load of the observations and the simulations reported for the entire maritime EMODnet-reported fleet of the Mediterranean is in satisfactory agreement, 1.26 & PLUSMN; 0.56 x 10(15) molecules cm(-2) and 0.98 & PLUSMN; 0.41 x 10(15) molecules cm(-2), respectively. The spatial correlation of the annual maritime NO2 loads of all vessel types between observation and simulation ranges between 0.93 and 0.98. On a seasonal basis, both observations and simulations show a common variability. The wintertime comparisons are in excellent agreement for the highest emitting sector, cargo vessels, with the observations reporting a mean load of 0.98 & PLUSMN; 0.54 and the simulations of 0.81 & PLUSMN; 0.45 x 10(15) molecules cm(-2) and correlation of 0.88. Similarly, the passenger sector reports 0.45 & PLUSMN; 0.49 and 0.39 & PLUSMN; 0.45 x 10(15) molecules cm(-2) respectively, with correlation of 0.95. In summertime, the simulations report a higher decrease in modelled tropospheric columns than the observations, however, still resulting in a high correlation between 0.85 and 0.94 for all sectors. These encouraging findings will permit us to proceed with creating a top-down inventory for NOx shipping emissions using S5P/TROPOMI satellite observations and a data assimilation technique based on the LOTOS-EUROS chemical transport model.

TI  - Remote Sensing and Geospatial Models to Simulate Land Use and Land Cover and Estimate Water Supply and Demand for Water Balancing in Phuket Island, Thailand
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, Phuket Island is facing water scarcity because water demand for consumption was approximately 51 million m(3)/year, whereas water supply was only about 46 million m(3)/year. Thus, the study of water supply, demand and balancing are important for effective water resources management. This study aims to simulate the LULC data using the CLUE-S model, estimate water supply using the SWAT model, and calculate water demand using a water footprint basis for water balancing on the Island. In addition, tourist water demand was separately estimated under normal and new normal conditions (COVID-19 pandemic) to fit with the actual situation at national and international levels. Water balance results with the consideration of ecological water requirements suggest that a water deficit occurs every year under the dry year scenario in normal and new normal conditions. In addition, the monthly water balance indicates that a water deficit occurs in the summer season every year, both without and with the consideration of ecological water requirements. Consequently, it can be concluded that remote sensing data with advanced geospatial models can provide essential information about water supply, demand, and balance for water resources management, particularly water scarcity, in Phuket Island in the future. Additionally, this study's conceptual framework and research workflows can assist government agencies in examining water deficits in other areas.

TI  - Hyperspectral Classification Based on 3D Convolutional Neural Network and Super Pixel Segmentation
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Data from hyperspectral remote sensing have provided detailed spectral and spatial information regarding ground objects. To solve the problems of low robustness and classification accuracy due to the underutilization of spatial information of hyperspectral data in previous classification methods, this paper proposes a classification method based on improved superpixel segmentation and 3D convolution neural network. First, the hyperspectral remote sensing data arc segmented via superpixel segmentation and fuzzy clustering; then, the spatial-spectral joint data formed by the regional segmentation results and hyperspectral data arc trained and classified using a 3D convolution neural network. The proposed method improves the role of spatial information in classification by dividing and fusing spatial regions, reduces the impact of the phenomenon of "same objects different spectra" on classification, and introduces a 3D convolution neural network to train and classify the spatial-spectral joint data, improving hyperspectral classification accuracy. In the Pavia University and Salinas datasets, the proposed method has an overall accuracy of 97.53% and 98.18%, respectively. When compared with the control experiments, the proposed method exhibits a better classification effect, which proves its efficacy.

TI  - A Novel Framework of Integrating UV and NIR Atmospheric Correction Algorithms for Coastal Ocean Color Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric correction is a fundamental process of ocean color remote sensing to remove the atmospheric effect from the top-of-atmosphere. Generally, Near Infrared (NIR) based algorithms perform well for clear waters, while Ultraviolet (UV) based algorithms can obtain good results for turbid waters. However, the latter tends to produce noisy patterns for clear waters. An ideal and practical solution to deal with such a dilemma is to apply NIR- and UV-based algorithms for clear and turbid waters, respectively. We propose a novel atmospheric correction method that integrates the advantages of UV- and NIR-based atmospheric correction (AC) algorithms for coastal ocean color remote sensing. The new approach is called UV-NIR combined AC algorithm. The performance of the new algorithm is evaluated based on match-ups between GOCI images and the AERONET-OC dataset. The results show that the values of retrieved Rrs (Remote Sensing Reflectance) at visible bands agreed well with the in-situ observations. Compared with the SeaDAS (SeaWiFS Data Analysis System) standard NIR algorithm, the new AC algorithm can achieve better precision and provide more available data.

TI  - Retrieval of Total Phosphorus Concentration in the Surface Water of Miyun Reservoir Based on Remote Sensing Data and Machine Learning Algorithms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Some essential water conservation areas in China have continuously suffered from various serious problems such as water pollution and water quality deterioration in recent decades and thus called for real-time water pollution monitoring system underwater resources management. On the basis of the remote sensing data and ground monitoring data, this study firstly constructed a more accurate retrieval model for total phosphorus (TP) concentration by comparing 12 machine learning algorithms, including support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), Bayesian ridge regression (BRR), lasso regression (Lasso), elastic net (EN), linear regression (LR), decision tree regressor (DTR), K neighbor regressor (KNR), random forest regressor (RFR), extra trees regressor (ETR), AdaBoost regressor (ABR) and gradient boosting regressor (GBR). Then, this study applied the constructed retrieval model to explore the spatial-temporal evolution of the Miyun Reservoir and finally assessed the water quality. The results showed that the model of TP concentration built by the ETR algorithm had the best accuracy, with the coefficient R-2 reaching over 85% and the mean absolute error lower than 0.000433. The TP concentration in Miyun Reservoir was between 0.0380 and 0.1298 mg/L, and there was relatively significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity. It changed remarkably during the periods of the flood season, winter tillage, planting, and regreening, and it was lower in summer than in other seasons. Moreover, the TP in the southwest part of the reservoir was generally lower than in the northeast, as there was less human activities interference. According to the Environmental Quality Standard for the surface water environment, the water quality of Miyun Reservoir was overall safe, except only for an over-standard case occurrence in the spring and September. These conclusions can provide a significant scientific reference for water quality monitoring and management in Miyun Reservoir.

TI  - Melt Pond Retrieval Based on the LinearPolar Algorithm Using Landsat Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The formation and distribution of melt ponds have an important influence on the Arctic climate. Therefore, it is necessary to obtain more accurate information on melt ponds on Arctic sea ice by remote sensing. The present large-scale melt pond products, especially the melt pond fraction (MPF), still require verification, and using very high resolution optical satellite remote sensing data is a good way to verify the large-scale retrieval of MPF products. Unlike most MPF algorithms using very high resolution data, the LinearPolar algorithm using Sentinel-2 data considers the albedo of melt ponds unfixed. In this paper, by selecting the best band combination, we applied this algorithm to Landsat 8 (L8) data. Moreover, Sentinel-2 data, as well as support vector machine (SVM) and iterative self-organizing data analysis technique (ISODATA) algorithms, are used as the comparison and verification data. The results show that the recognition accuracy of the LinearPolar algorithm for melt ponds is higher than that of previous algorithms. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient results achieved by using the LinearPolar algorithm with L8 and Sentinel-2A (S2), the SVM algorithm, and the ISODATA algorithm are 95.38% and 0.88, 94.73% and 0.86, and 92.40%and 0.80, respectively, which are much higher than those of principal component analysis (PCA) and Markus algorithms. The mean MPF (10.0%) obtained from 80 cases from L8 data based on the LinearPolar algorithm is much closer to Sentinel-2 (10.9%) than the Markus (5.0%) and PCA algorithms (4.2%), with a mean MPF difference of only 0.9%, and the correlation coefficients of the two MPFs are as high as 0.95. The overall relative error of the LinearPolar algorithm is 53.5% and 46.4% lower than that of the Markus and PCA algorithms, respectively, and the root mean square error (RMSE) is 30.9% and 27.4% lower than that of the Markus and PCA algorithms, respectively. In the cases without obvious melt ponds, the relative error is reduced more than that of those with obvious melt ponds because the LinearPolar algorithm can identify 100% of dark melt ponds and relatively small melt ponds, and the latter contributes more to the reduction in the relative error of MPF retrieval. With a wider range and longer time series, the MPF from Landsat data are more efficient than those from Sentinel-2 for verifying large-scale MPF products or obtaining long-term monitoring of a fixed area.

TI  - Land Use Change and Its Impact on Landscape Ecological Risk in Typical Areas of the Yellow River Basin in China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The basic premise of regional ecological construction would be to scientifically and effectively grasp the characteristics of land use change and its impact on landscape ecological risk. The research objects of this paper are the typical areas of the Yellow River Basin in China and "process-change-drive " as the logical main line. Moreover, this paper is based on multi-period land use remote sensing data from 2000 to 2020, the regional land use change process and influencing factors are identified, the temporal and spatial evolution and response process of landscape ecological risk are discussed, and the land use zoning control strategy to reduce ecological risk is put forward. The results indicated: (1) The scale and structure of land use show the characteristics of "many-to-one " and "one-to-many "; (2) the process of land use change is affected by the alternation of multiple factors. The natural environment and socio-economic factors dominate in the early stage and the location and policy factors have a significant impact in the later stage; (3) the overall landscape ecological risk level and conversion rate show a trend of "high in the southeast, low in the northwest ", shift from low to high and landscape ecological risks gradually increase; and (4) in order to improve the regional ecological safety and according to the characteristics of landscape ecological risk and spatial heterogeneity, we should adopt the management and control zoning method and set different levels of control intensity (from key intensity to strict intensity to general intensity), and develop differentiated land use control strategies.

AB  - While annual crop rotations play a crucial role for agricultural optimization, they have been largely ignored for automated crop type mapping. In this paper, we take advantage of the increasing quantity of annotated satellite data to propose to model simultaneously the inter- and intra-annual agricultural dynamics of yearly parcel classification with a deep learning approach. Along with simple training adjustments, our model provides an improvement of over 6.3% mIoU over the current state-of-the-art of crop classification, and a reduction of over 21% of the error rate. Furthermore, we release the first large-scale multi-year agricultural dataset with over 300,000 annotated parcels.

TI  - Paper Flooding and its relationship with land cover change, population growth, and road density
T2  - GEOSCIENCE FRONTIERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Bangladesh experiences frequent hydro-climatic disasters such as flooding. These disasters are believed to be associated with land use changes and climate variability. However, identifying the factors that lead to flooding is challenging. This study mapped flood susceptibility in the northeast region of Bangladesh using Bayesian regularization back propagation (BRBP) neural network, classification and regression trees (CART), a statistical model (STM) using the evidence belief function (EBF), and their ensemble models (EMs) for three time periods (2000, 2014, and 2017). The accuracy of machine learning algorithms (MLAs), STM, and EMs were assessed by considering the area under the curve-receiver operating characteristic (AUC-ROC). Evaluation of the accuracy levels of the aforementioned algorithms revealed that EM4 (BRBP-CART-EBF) outperformed (AUC > 90%) standalone and other ensemble models for the three time periods analyzed. Furthermore, this study investigated the relationships among land cover change (LCC), population growth (PG), road density (RD), and relative change of flooding (RCF) areas for the period between 2000 and 2017. The results showed that areas with very high susceptibility to flooding increased by 19.72% between 2000 and 2017, while the PG rate increased by 51.68% over the same period. The Pearson correlation coefficient for RCF and RD was calculated to be 0.496. These findings highlight the significant association between floods and causative factors. The study findings could be valuable to policymakers and resource managers as they can lead to improvements in flood management and reduction in flood damage and risks.

TI  - Where and How the East Madagascar Current Retroflection Originates?
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - The East Madagascar Current (EMC) is one of the western boundary currents of the South Indian Ocean. As such, it plays an important role in the climate system by transporting water and heat toward the pole and recirculating to the large-scale Indian Ocean through retroflection modes of its southern extension. Five cruise data sets and remote sensing data from different sensors are used to identify three states of the southern extension of the EMC: early retroflection, canonical retroflection, and no retroflection. Retroflections occur 47% of the time. EMC strength regulates the retroflection state, although impinged mesoscale eddies also contribute to retroflection formation. Early retroflection is linked with EMC volume transport. Anticyclonic eddies drifting from the central Indian Ocean to the coast favor early retroflection formation, anticyclonic eddies near the southern tip of Madagascar promote the generation of canonical retroflection, and no retroflection appears to be associated with a lower eddy kinetic energy (EKE). Knowledge of the EMC retroflection state could help predict (a) coastal upwelling south of Madagascar, (b) the southeastern Madagascar phytoplankton bloom, and (c) the formation of the South Indian Ocean Counter Current (SICC).

TI  - Prediction of Total Imperviousness from Population Density and Land Use Data for Urban Areas (Case Study: South East Queensland, Australia)
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Total imperviousness (residential and non-residential) increases with population growth in many regions around the world. Population density has been used to predict the total imperviousness in large areas, although population size was only closely related to residential imperviousness. In this study, population density together with land use data for 154 suburbs in Southeast Queensland (SEQ) of Australia were used to develop a new model for total imperviousness estimation. Total imperviousness was extracted through linear spectral mixing analysis (LSMA) using Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS, and then separated into residential and non-residential areas based on land use data for each suburb. Regression models were developed between population density and total imperviousness, and population density and residential imperviousness. Results show that (1) LSMA approach could retrieve imperviousness accurately (RMSE < 10%), (2) linear regression models could be used to estimate both total imperviousness and residential imperviousness better than nonlinear regression models, and (3) correlation between population density and residential imperviousness was higher (R-2 = 0.77) than that between population density and total imperviousness (R-2 = 0.52); (4) the new model was used to predict the total imperiousness based on population density projections to 2057 for three potential urban development areas in SEQ. This research allows accurate prediction of the total impervious area from population density and service area per capital for other regions in the world.

TI  - Estimation of Boreal Forest Growing Stock Volume in Russia from Sentinel-2 MSI and Land Cover Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Growing stock volume (GSV) is a fundamental parameter of forests, closely related to the above-ground biomass and hence to carbon storage. Estimation of GSV at regional to global scales depends on the use of satellite remote sensing data, although accuracies are generally lower over the sparse boreal forest. This is especially true of boreal forest in Russia, for which knowledge of GSV is currently poor despite its global importance. Here we develop a new empirical method in which the primary remote sensing data source is a single summer Sentinel-2 MSI image, augmented by land-cover classification based on the same MSI image trained using MODIS-derived data. In our work the method is calibrated and validated using an extensive set of field measurements from two contrasting regions of the Russian arctic. Results show that GSV can be estimated with an RMS uncertainty of approximately 35-55%, comparable to other spaceborne estimates of low-GSV forest areas, with 70% spatial correspondence between our GSV maps and existing products derived from MODIS data. Our empirical approach requires somewhat laborious data collection when used for upscaling from field data, but could also be used to downscale global data.

TI  - Uncertainties Involved in the Use of Thresholds for the Detection of Water Bodies in Multitemporal Analysis from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Although the single threshold is still considered a suitable and easy-to-do technique to extract water features in spatiotemporal analysis, it leads to unavoidable errors. This paper uses an enumerative search to optimize thresholds over satellite-derived modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI). We employed a cross-validation approach and treated accuracy as a random variable in order to: (a) investigate uncertainty related to its application; (b) estimate non-optimistic errors involving single thresholding; (c) investigate the main factors that affect the accuracy's model, and (d) compare satellite sensors performance. We also used a high-resolution digital elevation model to extract water elevations values, making it possible to remove topographic effects and estimate non-optimistic errors exclusively from orbital imagery. Our findings evidenced that there is a region where thresholds values can vary without causing accuracy loss. Moreover, by constraining thresholds variation between these limits, accuracy is dramatically improved and outperformed the Otsu method. Finally, the number of scenes employed to optimize a single threshold drastically affects the accuracy, being not appropriate using a single scene once it leads to overfitted threshold values. More than three scenes are recommended.

TI  - Evaluation and Improvement of FY-4A AGRI Quantitative Precipitation Estimation for Summer Precipitation over Complex Topography of Western China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE) can make up for the insufficiency of ground observations for monitoring precipitation. Using an Advanced Geosynchronous Radiation Imager (AGRI) on the FengYun-4A (FY-4A) satellite and rain gauges (RGs) for observations in the summer of 2020. The existing QPE of the FY-4A was evaluated and found to present poor accuracy over the complex topography of Western China. Therefore, to improve the existing QPE, first, cloud classification thresholds for the FY-4A were established with the dynamic clustering method to identify convective clouds. These thresholds consist of the brightness temperatures (TBs) of FY-4A water vapor and infrared channels, and their TB difference. Then, quantitative cloud growth rate correction factors were introduced to improve the QPE of the convective-stratiform technique. This was achieved using TB hourly variation rates of long-wave infrared channel 12, which is able to characterize the evolution of clouds. Finally, the dynamic time integration method was designed to solve the inconsistent time matching between the FY-4A and RGs. Consequently, the QPE accuracy of the FY-4A was improved. Compared with the existing QPE of the FY-4A, the correlation coefficient between the improved QPE of the FY-4A and the RG hourly precipitation increased from 0.208 to 0.492, with the mean relative error and root mean squared error decreasing from -47.4% and 13.78 mm to 8.3% and 10.04 mm, respectively. However, the correlation coefficient is not sufficiently high; thus, the algorithm needs to be further studied and improved.
