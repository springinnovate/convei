TI  - Evaluating the capability of Worldview-2 imagery for mapping alien tree species in a heterogeneous urban environment
T2  - COGENT SOCIAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Street trees in urban planning have a long history as providers of an amicable environment for urban dwellers. Nevertheless, street trees are not always without a challenge, their ecosystem disservices include, inter alia, cracking pavements and foundations due to wandering tree roots that destroy concrete or asphalt surfaces. Thus, effective mapping of street trees assists in planning a suitable urban environment to improve city life. The traditional method for urban tree mapping is costly, time-consuming and labour intensive. However, commercially operated multi-spectral sensors, such as WorldView (WV) provide a more viable way to map trees at the species level. This study investigates the use of WV-2 imagery in the classification and mapping of five common alien street trees in a complex urban environment. It also examined the feasibility of Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifiers in mapping street trees in a heterogeneous urban environment. The classifiers produced an overall accuracy of 84.2 % for RF and 81.2 % for SVM. This study provides a detailed understanding of urban tree species to the municipality of Johannesburg and offers environmental managers an insight of classification methods for mapping trees using satellite imagery to comprehend their spatial distribution.

TI  - Identifying historical and future potential lake drainage events on the western Arctic coastal plain of Alaska
T2  - PERMAFROST AND PERIGLACIAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Arctic lakes located in permafrost regions are susceptible to catastrophic drainage. In this study, we reconstructed historical lake drainage events on the western Arctic Coastal Plain of Alaska between 1955 and 2017 using USGS topographic maps, historical aerial photography (1955), and Landsat Imagery (ca. 1975, ca. 2000, and annually since 2000). We identified 98 lakes larger than 10 ha that partially (>25% of area) or completely drained during the 62-year period. Decadal-scale lake drainage rates progressively declined from 2.0 lakes/yr (1955-1975), to 1.6 lakes/yr (1975-2000), and to 1.2 lakes/yr (2000-2017) in the ~30,000-km(2) study area. Detailed Landsat trend analysis between 2000 and 2017 identified two years, 2004 and 2006, with a cluster (five or more) of lake drainages probably associated with bank overtopping or headward erosion. To identify future potential lake drainages, we combined the historical lake drainage observations with a geospatial dataset describing lake elevation, hydrologic connectivity, and adjacent lake margin topographic gradients developed with a 5-m-resolution digital surface model. We identified ~1900 lakes likely to be prone to drainage in the future. Of the 20 lakes that drained in the most recent study period, 85% were identified in this future lake drainage potential dataset. Our assessment of historical lake drainage magnitude, mechanisms and pathways, and identification of potential future lake drainages provides insights into how arctic lowland landscapes may change and evolve in the coming decades to centuries.

AB  - Objectives:Remote sensing of water quality parameters (WQPs) has been widely applied along with the emerging importance of obtaining the spatial pattern of water quality at inland reservoir. This study retrieved the Total Phosphorus (TP) via remote sensing imagery at Daecheong reservoir and used it for acquiring the spatial distribution of Trophic State Index (TSI).Methods:First, stepwise regression for TP was established using the ground-based TP measurement and reflectance of Landsat 8 collocated in space and time. With the developed regression model, we estimated the spatial distribution of TSI and evaluated the severity of eutrophication at Daecheong reservoir.Results and Discussion:The result confirmed that predicted TP yielded reasonable statistics compared against measured TP with R2 of 0.956 and p-value of 0.022. Seasonal variation of TP was highly influenced by the precipitation. Similarly, precipitation also influenced to the spatial pattern of TSI. Before the rainfall event (e.g., August 22 2018) at Daecheong reservoir, TSI metric indicated the oligotrographic stage. However, TSI of Daecheong reservoir after the rainfall (e.g., October 25 2018) indicated the mesotrophic and eutrophic stage.Conclusions:These results confirmed that the retrieval of WQP from remote sensing imagery can serve as a robustness tool to monitor the water quality over the large scale area.

Winds are prescribed to 7 m/s in the summer and 10.5 m/s in the winter, to be consistent with representative wind data from the NOAA/Seawinds blended wind data set62. Winter mixing in NWA is simulated by adding 0.1 mmol m-3 DIC daily from October through February (over 155 days). The value is based on a scaling analysis of vertical DIC gradients and diffusivity estimates in the region based on observational in 2015 in the NWA region and 2016 in the CCS. Literature values of physical vertical diffusion combined with vertical profiles of DIC from the ECOA 2015 cruse suggests that diffusive transports of DIC is negligible during summer.

AB  - Godism is a worldview based on Rev. Sun Myung Moon’s new view of God. This paper explains the main themes of Eastern and Western views of reality from the perspective of Godism, and shows their significant implications. Godism possesses wider and deeper insights integrating Eastern and Western views of reality. This is possible because the God of Godism has both Sungsang and Hyungsang dual characteristics, and Yang and Yin dual characteristics. Godism seems able to explain more adequately such themes of Western view of reality as absolute being, creation, the purpose of creation, idea, eidos, prime matter, logos, nous, mind, soul, body, based on the concept of Sungsang and Hyungsang dual characteristics. It seems able to explain more adequately such themes of Eastern view of reality as yin and yang, li and chi, relation, harmony, change, universal laws, man and woman, teleology and dysteleology, based on both the concepts of Yang and Yin dual characteristics and Sungsang and Hyungsang dual characteristics.

TI  - Re-imagining Peace and Reconciliation between South and North Korea in the Missiological Perspective
T2  - Theology and Praxis
T2  - 신학과 실천
M3  - research-article
AB  - This study intends to find reconciliation, justice, and peace between South and North Korea in the missiological perspective. This year(2020) marks the 70th anniversary of the Korean War and the 20th anniversary of the June 15 Inter-Korean Joint Declaration. However, a complete end to the War is not yet achieved. Otherwise, North Korea has blown up a joint liaison office that is symbolized as a communicational place between North and South Korea. In this crisis on the Korean Peninsula, we need to find a moral imagination to achieve peace and reconciliation.There are two opposite (the Conservative and the Progressive) opinions about peace and reconciliation at the Korean Church. Although the Conservative and the Progressive Korean Protestant Church have different approaches to build relationships with North Korea, they must respond to a cooperative way for reunification. For this reason, I attempt to rethink about peace and reconciliation in the Korean Peninsula by understanding sociological, theological, and missological perspectives. First, there are three different sociological methods for North Koran studies: 1) A Totalitarian Approach, 2) An Immanent Approach, and 3) a Micro Approach. Especially, “An Immanent Approach” was developed by focusing on the emic approach (‘study how North Koreans think’). Contextual theology is similar to an immanent approach because it considers the significance of a particular culture. However, contextual theology has emphasis on Christian faith in the Christian worldview. Second, in order to find peace and reconciliation in Korean Peninsula, I discuss the theological and missiological concepts that are the Jubilee, forgiveness, embrace, the alternative community, Kingdom of God, and Kyum-Hu (humility). Without forgiveness, embrace, and humility, it is impossible to make authentic reunification in Korea.

T2  - 한국불교사연구

AB  - This study intended to focus on the realistic expression techniques contained in the Buddhist statues of the Joseon Dynasty by the analysis of Buddhist statues in Gwisinsa(歸信寺) temple. In general, Buddhist art during the Joseon Dynasty is considered to be inferior to that of Unified Silla or Goryeo, when Buddhism was socially important. Of course, it can't be denied that elements that intentionally exclude realism account for a greater proportion in this period. However, it was confirmed through the statues of Gwisinsa that the exclusion or suppression of such realism was never a matter of skill.Although delicate muscle descriptions and sensual human body expressions that appear below the edge of a transparent cloth such as the Seokguram Sculptures from the Unified Silla Period are hard to find in Joseon Dynasty sculptures, but Buddhist statues of Gwisinsa reveal their individuality to the extent that they may have been modeled after a specific person, and their expressions are full of life. In addition, the way in which each statue's movements are depicted and the organic movement of the hem of the garment according to the movement shows skills that are difficult to express without a well-trained technician. Such realism seems to have become static and uniform again after the first half of the 17th century. Perhaps a new worldview and hope for the future, acquired from experiencing two wars, led to this unique artistic tendency in the first half of the 17th century.In addition, it is necessary to look at the background of this large-scale clay Buddha statue. Until now, it was regarded as expressing the will to recover from the Japanese Invasion in 1592, but in addition to this aspect, this article estimated the possibility that each temple in question might have been restored because it had a tradition of having large statues of Buddha before the war. In particular, about the statues composition of the Vairocana triad, it can be assumed that the association of Amitabha and Seokga (or Vairocana) enshrined in the 10 Avatamska temples were combined with the Medicinal buddha later.Furthermore, attention is being paid to the fact that these large-scale Sojo Buddha statues are mainly distributed in North Jeolla and Chungcheong provinces. The reason for this possibly be that the soil around the temple in this area may have been advantageous for the creation of the clay Buddha statue, and it is assumed that the existence of ceramic workshops such as buncheong kilns made it easier to secure quality soil and manpower and facilities to process them.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to examine the aesthetic and mental characteristics of Choi Seungja’s poems and prose writings. In doing so, the mutual correspondence of two genres will be at the center of discussion. Although there has been active research on Choi Seungja, her prose is not well known. She is a great poet and, at the same time, a great prose writer. Not only does her prose in itself have a high literary value, but it also helps us better understand her poems. Choi Seungja sometimes expresses her worldview, her view about poetry, and poetics through her prose. It, thus, can help us profoundly identify her literary world through its interaction with an analysis of inherent meanings in her poetry works.For this purpose, this study, first of all, started with reading her prose books carefully again, and, by reading her poems in detail, tried to grasp the aesthetic and mental characteristics of her entire work world. Through this, we could understand the inner aspects of fears as a basis of Choi Seungja’s literary texts and existential texts, and we could examine the confrontation of fear and romantic longings, the two points where her poetry writing originates. Also, we looked into the bright lyrics and dark lyrics in Choi Seungja’s literature, and as we had previously realized, it was found that they reach higher achievement while endlessly meeting and breaking up with each other as aesthetic embodiment of their unique mental attitudes.

AB  - This paper examines the academic methodology of Hanju Yi Jinsang and Ilbu Kimhang in the nineteenth century. Unlike Hanju, who wished to strengthen independence based on Neo-Confucianist academic systems, Ilbu aimed to renew the world through inverted and reverse generation(Doyeoksaengsung倒逆生成) from the perspective of Tao(道) before it was separated into Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism(Yoobuldo儒佛道).Hanju pursued unity with Tae Geuk(太極), RI(理), which are the source of the three functions(Sam-jae 三才) of heaven, earth, and man (Cheonjiin天地人) through the academic direction of the three viewpoints(Sam-kan三看): the horizontal (Su-kan竪看), vertical (Do-kan倒看), and cross viewpoints (Hoeng-kan橫看) based on the worldview of Neo-Confucianism, and the academic methodology of Sun-chu(順推) and Yeok-chu(逆推). He differentiated between the orthodox and heretical, focusing on yin-yang using the academic methodologies of Sam-kan(三看) and the two chus(兩推), and he emphasized this distinction by strictly differentiating between his argument and the arguments of others, and between Neo-Confucianism and other disciplines.Ilbu(一夫) proposed the Doyeoksaengsung of time and the unity of Sun-yeok in the space that objectifies the Doyeoksangsung and explains that the Samjae of Cheonjiin is achieved and reached through humans represented as the true descendants. He presented Taohak(道學), where the principles of human nature of the descendants are revealed through the methods of suppressing yin while respecting yang(Eokeumjonyang抑陰尊陽) from the ancestors, and revealed that the everyday life is when Sudo(修道), which believes and places its faith that every moment in life is created through teachers(Bango盤古) and parents (Hwaong化翁), and the system that views creation become one.Differentiating between sun(順) and yeok(逆), the Neo-Confucianist academic direction and methodology that pursue unity with Tae Geuk(太極), RI(理), in the reverse direction cannot reveal the aspect of practice which occurs in the forward direction or be integrated with Western academics. Through Doyeoksaeungsung, Taohak shows that Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism, and even Western learning are all self-unfolding of Tao itself.

TI  - In-situ Measurements of Aerosols from the High-Altitude Location in the Central Himalayas
T2  - MEASUREMENT, ANALYSIS AND REMEDIATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTANTS
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Aerosols, both natural and anthropogenic, affect the Earth's climate directly due to the absorption and scattering of solar radiation and indirectly by modifying the cloud microphysics. Due to the short lifetime of these aerosols, their distribution is non-uniform and large uncertainties exist in their estimates at global and regional scale. The characteristics of atmospheric aerosols vary largely from one region to another due to spatial and temporal variations in the emission sources, transport, atmospheric transformation and removal of aerosol particles. The aerosol measurements over the Himalayan region are of crucial importance in order to provide a far-field picture quite away from potential sources. The ground-based measurements of aerosols are utilized along with satellite data to explain various aerosol characteristics over the Himalayan region. The roles of different processes such as boundary layer dynamics, meteorology, regional and long-range transport are assessed. In addition, the aerosol variation over the foothills of the Himalayas in the Indo-Gangetic Plain region has also been studied and the role of the boundary layer dynamics and updraft/downdraft of aerosols is elaborated. The high-altitude location of Himalayas is characterized by the low aerosol loading specially in winter, while significant aerosol abundance is observed in the spring. However, the significant aerosol abundance is observed over the foothills location throughout the year. The strong confinement of aerosols in the foothill region is evident, which leads to the significant enhancement in the surface concentration of aerosols. Interestingly, in the spring season, significant aerosol abundance is seen over the Himalayan region as well. The investigation of the mixing layer depth and the vertical distribution of aerosols over this region in spring reveals the transport and buildup of aerosols from the foothills region to the Himalayan region. The role of absorbing aerosols in the radiation budget over the central Himalaya region is also discussed.

TI  - Application of Field-Monitoring Techniques to Determine Soil Loss by Gully Erosion in a Watershed in Deccan, India
T2  - GULLY EROSION STUDIES FROM INDIA AND SURROUNDING REGIONS
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The study is a compilation of three field-monitoring techniques applied in a watershed in Deccan Traps, India, to measure soil erosion through gullies and rills. More than 4 million hectares of land in India is severely affected by rill and gully erosion. It is necessary to investigate the gully formation process and the problem of gully erosion that will help in proper planning of the landuse in this region. The study area falls in a semi-arid tract of Maharashtra where the landscape is densely dissected by gullies to form badlands. These badlands are greatly disturbed and reclaimed for agriculture. A microprofilometer was fabricated to monitor gully heads and five profiles were monitored every 6 months for 3 years that displayed rapid expansion of gully network annually. Within the same basin, two badland catchments were selected and erosion pins were inserted into the ground. The exposed pinheads were measured after every monsoon for 2 years and volume loss were calculated from these basins for two time periods that yielded the soil loss of 0.76 kg/m(2)/year from sample basin 1 and 1.79 kg/m(2)/year for sample basin 2 during the monitoring period. The third experiment was rainfall simulation under controlled condition on six experimental plots within the same basin. The average soil loss after 1 h experiment was 0.8 km/m(2) which is a very high value for such sediment-starved terrain. A glance at the results obtained from the three techniques reveal that gully network expansion and soil erosion are happening in a big way in the region. Such field-monitoring techniques are helpful not only in understanding the actual soil loss scenario in the field, but such data are valuable because nowadays, soil loss estimates are done using remote-sensing data in GIS environment, and such field generated data provides validity to studies conducted using RS and GIS techniques.

AB  - In this paper, the dynamic urban built-up changes of Yinchuan city based on Landsat 5 in 2001, 2007, 2011 and Landsat 8 images in 2015 is described. Information such as urban built-up area and the situation of surface cover are analyzed. The results show that with the development of the city, the area of urban built-up area and urban vegetation area are increasing every year, and the water system in the city increases at first and then decreases slightly. In addition, a proportion of 4% of the expansion of Yinchuan urban built-up area are indicated in this paper, which is mainly from vegetation, followed by a small number of villages and waters. Finally, this paper analyzes that the economic development, population growth and other factors play an important role in promoting the urban change of Yinchuan city.

AB  - This article is a preliminary study to approach the history of Korean dance from the perspective of generative theory. The generative perspective is to think from a fundamental perspective on what has created and transformed the historical flow of Korean dance. A Silhak scholar Choi Han-gi's 'Gi' theory can be a major methodology for understanding Korean dance as resonance. When looking at dance as a generative theory, Korean dance is the desire of 'resonance'. There is a desire for natural unity to harmonize with the world. Originally, Korean dance was a resonating dance with ‘living’. From the stylistic beauty of 'Dengsil Dengsil' and'Nerul Nerul', which appear in Korean dance movements, we can feel the unique worldview of Korea such as 'vertical-horizontal resonance' and'vertical resonance'. Korean dance was developed while maintaining a'tilt balance' due to the entanglement of horizontal and vertical resonance. This aspect can be well understood by looking at the transition process of “Cheo Yong Mu”. Then, in the period of the modern dance, the resonance declined and it was narrowed down to 'dance to see'. As with the change in the history of art style, if the resonance of Korean dance is also experiencing repeated ups and downs, then it can be predicted that the era of nature-friendly stability and the dance of sensational impulse will come back again.

TI  - Wildlife Sentinels for Human and Environmental Health Hazards in Ecotoxicological Risk Assessment
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGICAL QSARS
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Can animals reflect human and environmental health risks? This is a frequently asked question in the research community. Sentinel species are organisms that can provide early warning signs of potential risks to humans, so that preventive measures can be taken in time to avoid serious adverse health consequences. In spite of the well-known cases of use of sentinel species, animals are continuously offering information that in most cases is underestimated or incorrectly interpreted. Many species may be successfully used as sentinels or monitors of environmental and health hazards; however, there is no ideal species for all types of scenarios and conditions. For this reason, the advantages and disadvantages on the use of potential sentinel species and the main characteristics they should gather to be effective sentinels are discussed. Although a wide range of wildlife species are considered good candidates for biomonitoring purposes, bird species are especially suitable as biomonitors of environmental quality and to estimate human health risks.During the last two decades, the effects induced by endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) on hormone action have been widely tested. Since the mid-twentieth century, it is well-known that humans and wildlife species are simultaneously exposed to multiple chemicals from multiple sources with potential ability to disrupt the endocrine system by different pathways and/or interfere with hormone actions. Moreover, additive effects related to this chemical cocktail exposure could be expected, increasing the potential risks to animal and human health. In addition, carcinogenic, immunotoxic, neurotoxic, behavioral, and other chronic effects are observed in wildlife, which are closely linked to human diseases.

AB  - Lake is one part of inland waters and plays an important role in human life and the surrounding environment. Lakes need to be preserved, especially in the lake area and its border. One way to preserve the lake is to map the potential of spatial information in the lake and its surroundings. Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and Digital Surface Model (DSM) can be used to obtain spatial information in the lake border. DTM and DSM can be extracted from terrestrial and non-terrestrial mapping such as remote sensing satellites. The study area in this study is Lake Oeduli on Rote Island. This study aims to inform the potential utilization of DSM and DTM for the spatial border of lakes. The potential is in the form of determining the lakeside line, lake border area, and vegetation height. All of these potentials can be extracted from DSM and DTM. This DSM and DTM can also be dynamic and non-dynamic. The results of this study can be utilized as a method for spatial information extraction of lake borders in support of national inland waters.

AB  - Rote Ndao Regency is the southernmost region of Indonesia bordering Australia and Timor Leste. This regency has varieties of unique and endemic geology, biodiversity and inland waters. The regency has some 80 lakes where around 20 are saltwater lakes. The salinity of these lakes exceeds the salinity of seawater. The majority of these saltwater lakes are located in the Dead Sea Lake Region of Rote islands. Geologically, the islands have mixed deformations that move vertically and horizontally and are lifted partially from the Australian continent. The biodiversity in this region is also unique as there is a Roti snake-necked turtle that enters endangered animals. There are also unique mangroves conditions that live far from water sources due to vertical deformation. Rote Ndao also has areas of peat coal that are mixed with saltwater areas, freshwater areas, and brackish water areas. Remote sensing can be used to help effectively and efficiently in geological, biodiversity and inland waters mapping. This study aims to inform the related spatial information of the frontier region of Rote Ndao with the use of multidisciplinary remote sensing to realize Geopark. This multidisciplinary approach in remote sensing applications is used to obtain spatial information based on geo-biophysical and classification parameters. Data used in the form of similar to 65-70% remote sensing data and similar to 30-35% non-remote sensing data. Remote sensing data in the form of Landsat, Sentinel, WorldView-2, Planet, Grace, Goce, Champ, and others. This multidisciplinary approach includes remote sensing, geodesy, geology, limnology, biodiversity, water resources, forest conservation, and geo-informatics. The uniqueness of geology and biodiversity in the Dead Sea Lake Region of Rote is expected to make this region become a Geopark.

CP  - 7th Annual International Seminar on Aerospace Science and Technology (ISAST)
CL  - Jakarta, INDONESIA
AB  - Nowadays Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing technology is growing rapidly. Various types of sensors and supporting instruments also have many advantages, one of them is IMU/INS. This instrument plays an important role in image geometry stability, especially in rotation parameters. IMU/INS quality has an effect on determining the horizontal geometry accuracy of satellite images. The data used in this study are ALOS PALSAR and WorldView-2. The study area is located on Rote Island, Indonesia. This study aims to determine the quality effects of IMU/INS influencing the geometric quality of ALOS PALSAR and WorldView-2 satellite imagery. The way to do this is to compare the coordinates on the same object in the ALOS PALSAR and WorldView-2 images. Both of these images are in orthoimage condition. Then reference field is carried out because the two images differ in spatial resolution. ALOS PALSAR imagery is used as reference field because it has a lower spatial resolution. After that, checking at 10 points on the same object in both images. The results obtained in the form of values and direction of object shift in both orthoimage. The pattern of the second shift in orthoimage can be seen. IMU/INS on WorldView-2 is better than ALOS PALSAR when see the shift points. The shift in ALOS PALSAR is systematic, while the shift in WorldView-2 is more random. Fixed incidence angles cause the pattern of systematic shifts but cause high bias or low accuracy in horizontal geometry. The horizontal geometric quality is influenced by the type of IMU/INS used. ALOS PALSAR images use IMU/INS type 2 (tactical) while WorldView-2 images use IMU/INS type 1 or navigational. This IMU/INS quality needs to be considered for the utilization of satellite imagery on certain scale and certain survey mapping applications and each orthoimage has accuracy with certain tolerance.

T2  - 동유럽발칸연구

AB  - This paper traces the creation process of Tolstoy’s novel Holstomer (1885). The first draft of this work had already been almost completed in 1863, and is being revised and published again after 20 years. At this very moment, the peak of Tolstoy’s creation and the spiritual crisis lie side by side. What position should Holstomer take part in the author’s art universe? What artistic evolutionary process is included between the two editions? In this paper, we will examine the following issue: the title of the work in 1885, the subject of “ownership”, and the “unfamiliarity” in the artist’s art technique. First, the transformation of the title can be interpreted as an ambiguous or symbolic meaning of Russian language, and the keyword for “ownership” as the subject of this work reminds us of Tolstoy’s continuing interest, and at the same time, such changes can be seen through these two editions. Interestingly, we will trace the process in which the core problem of Tolstoy’s art technique, “unfamiliarity”, changes from an artistic meaning in the 60’s to a social revelation after going through a spiritual crisis in the 80’s. Holstomer is a work that has a critical social significance at the same time, which began with a passion for life, a strong trace of Tolstoy’s worldview in the 60s, and was born after a period of mental crisis.As Tolstoy’s 1885 creation after experiencing a time of crisis, this work contains both the author's autobiographical appearance and prophetic content. Therefore, Holstomer a work of art that is “closely connected with a new conviction, and a new religious worldview,” is a work that is more exquisitely balanced between art and preaching than any of Tolstoy’s other works.

AB  - This paper aims at examining how Japan recontextualized nationalism to rationalize the logic of imperialism and identifying the transformation process. In the view of the researcher, Japan created its own nationalism in the process of translating “nationality” as kokusui (国粋, lit. national characteristic) and giving the concept new meanings. Therefore, engrossed in its own logic of nationalism or imperialism, Japan has not yet reached the stage of decontextualization. In this respect, identifying which principle is intrinsic in Japan’s worlding process of chauvinism is thought to be significant in revealing the thought structure reflected in Japanese imperialism.Japan’s chauvinism and Japaneseism were born from an attempt to overcome the ambivalent position of anti-Western and anti-Chinese study. The concept of ‘nationality’ in the West was translated as kokusui, and the term was taken from the standpoint that it is irrelevant to imperialism and nationalism. In this context, it was claimed that the term connoted the pursuit of cosmopolitanity as a solution to the problems related to human freedom, liberation and awakening. Nevertheless, the worlding context created based on chauvinism and Japaneseism was a process centered on Japan and served the rationalization of totalitarianism and the justification of imperialism. This process led to the birth of the new concept of cosmopolitanism, which was national morality, and this ultimately resulted in totalism based on morality. To elaborate on this process, this paper first examines the attitude of accepting the concepts of Western theories and the cosmopolitanity found in the way of grafting the Western concepts onto the native language, and how it explains the matter of the subject. This approach will enable to identify the logic that forms the foundation of Japanese chauvinism and Japaneseism, with a focus on the issue of individual awakening as a universal human issue. The intellectual logic that gave birth to Japanese chauvinism and Japaneseism was a new worldview forged by combining Wang Yangming’s theory of liangzhi (良知, lit. original knowing) and the thoughts of Green and Nietzsche with Nichiren Buddhism, under the influence of Schelling and Schopenhauer. This worldview was thus an international perspective created under nationalism, Japaneseism and cosmopolitanism. That is, it was conceived by the unnatural connection of cosmopolitanism borrowed from the West to the internal nationalism and emperor system. To find a subject that can recognize this unnaturalness, there is a need for the awareness of the process where this chauvinism was transformed into a means to explore the world in the world system of the time that was towards imperialism.

AB  - “The Legend of Oghuz Khagan” is not long, but it contains not a few myths, legends and historical stories, vividly showing the life, habits and religious aspects of the ancient Uyghurs. Especially as an ancient primitive religion, the shamanistic aspect is prominently expressed. This shows that although the Kingdom of Gaochang Uyghur, where this work was handed down, accepted Islam around the 16th century, its archeological and ideological base was in Shamanism. In fact, Shamanism is the central thought and cultural origin of all Turkic peoples scattered across the Eurasian continent, ranging from Ancient Turk, including Uighurs, to modern Turkey and other Central Asian and Siberian Turkic peoples. In short, Shamanism was their basic view of the world.“The Legend of Oguz Khagan” is a work from the time of the formation of the ancient Uyghurs, where the myths and legends of the old Uyghur were fused little by little in the course of the propagation, leaving a distinct element of primitive religion that the ancient Uyghurs believed in. This study looks at the remaining shamanistic elements of the work in depth in several aspects, including totem worship, Heaven worship and tree worship. This is not small in that it provides an important clue to the worldview of the ancient Uyghurs.

AB  - The present study argues that one of the ways Luke redefines the idea of the world is by exploring the meaning of oikoumene, “the inhabited world,” focusing on the text of the riot at Ephesus in Acts 19:21-41. This Greek term was a representative concept to signify the Mediterranean World. Subsequently the term oikoumene was embraced by other cultures which needed a concept to portray the world, such as that of the Romans and the Jews. Each culture adopted the term but distinctively adapted it within its own context. There was the tension between two coexisting worlds. Subsequently, within the context of these conflicting worldviews, it was necessary for the biblical authors to clarify how audiences would perceive the oikoumene they inhabited. For Luke, the oikoumene is the world ruled by Roman hegemony in terms of politics and the pagan cult in terms of religion, but the oikoumene should be restored by Jesus and then his followers within their eschatological hope. This theme appears in Acts 19. In this account, Luke portrays that the oikoumene, itself, signifies the world that worships the goddess, Artemis. From the perspective of Luke, Artemis is venerated over much of the Roman oikoumene. Accordingly, Luke depicts a scene in which expansive Christianity enters forcibly into the mother-city of the idolatry cult and thereby the oikoumene. In a sense, Paul’s bold challenge against pagan worshippers is about who shall be the Lord on the oikoumene, Jesus or Artemis or the Roman Emperor? Therefore, this incident illustrates how the Way proclaimed by Paul is turning the oikoumene upside down.

AB  - In this paper, we investigate a multi-beam satellite communication system where multiple terminals transmit information signals to the gateway via a satellite. The satellite is equipped with phased array antennas to form multiple spot beams of which bandwidths are not identically allocated. We formulate an optimization problem to maximize fairness of beam bandwidth allocation. In order to solve the problem, we propose two heuristic algorithms; iterative beam bandwidth allocation (IBBA) and request ratio-based beam bandwidth allocation (RRBBA) algorithms. The IBBA algorithm iteratively equalizes the ratio of allocated bandwidth of each beam to their resource request while the RRBBA algorithm allocates beam bandwidth calculated from the ratio. Simulation results show that the IBBA algorithm has close fairness performance to the optimum while the RRBBA algorithm has less performance than the IBBA algorithm at the price of reduced computational complexity.

AB  - Today, the number of Korean language learners is increasing rapidly. Migrant mission should be approached differently depending on the type of migrants. Since there is a great need for studying Korean language in the early settlement process of foreign students in Korea, studying Korean language is a good point of contact for mission. However, compared to the high demand, there is no supplement of Korean textbooks for mission purpose. Korean language textbook development for mission purpose should consider foreign students as learners, Korean teachers, text of biblical and general contents, and the context of foreign students. Based on this, I analyzed 『Learning Korean with worldviews』 as Korean language textbook for evangelism and present an evangelism plan by using it for foreign students.

AB  - Intensive wildfire is one of the catastrophic hazards threatening human life and the economy. In this study, we aim to detect building damage caused by the Camp Fire, which occurred in Paradise, California in 2018. We use multitemporal coherence based on C-band Sentinel-1 (SAR) and normalized burn ratio based on Sentinel-2 (multi-spectral) imagery. The results revealed that the multi-temporal coherence approach has the promising capability to map building damage but is not as accurate for detecting building damage under a vegetation canopy. Meanwhile, the normalized burn ratio (NBR) still provides meaningful damage maps independent of the canopy, however, the accuracy was slightly lower than the multi-temporal coherence approach for the buildings not covered by the canopy. Nonetheless, we observed that the multi-temporal coherence methods better classified the damage severity than the NBR method. Both methods can play a complementary role in responding to wildfire depending on the characteristics of the land cover.

AB  - This paper is a study on the Sundo(仙道) thought and regional changes of the ‘Circle(圓)Square(方)Octagon(八角)’ symbol and the ‘3759 staircase’ symbol in the stone mound altartomb of the East Asia with the perspective of Korean Sundo culture that is different from the perspective of Chinese ritual culture and the perspective of Western or Northern shamanism.Korean Sundo culture is based on the Ki(氣) philosophical worldview called ‘the idea of the five natural elements of the three dimensions(三元五 行論)’. It is the theory on ‘the creation and regression of the being’, that is, ‘One-Three(One Ki氣-Three Ki三氣, Chun天Ji地In人, Circle圓 Square方Triangle角)’ is the substance of all beings and the cosmic life particle, becomes phenomena(materialization) and the phenomena converge again into the dimension of the substance through the process of ‘13  2  4 8’. The creation and regression process of the being had symbolized by various statues(象) and numbers(數), and reflected in Altar(壇)Shrine(廟)Tomb(塚) and jade artifacts of Baedalkook(倍達國).The ‘CircleSquare’ symbol and the ‘3 staircase’ symbol of the representative Heaven Ritual facility of Baedalkook, ‘the hilly Heaven Ritual facilitiy with a moat(‘three layer-circlesquare-moat’ typed stone-mound altartomb)’, was the expression of the theory of One-Three一三(One Ki-Three Ki, ChunJiIn, CircleSquare Triangle), the core onthology of Korean Sundo and Jigam(止感)Josig(調 息)Geumchog(禁觸) Sundo discipline.The stone-mound altartomb system during Baedalkook period led to the coexistence and combination with the Dolmen system during Dangun Joseon(檀君朝鮮) period. By the third century B.C., it was resurrected in the west side of Mt.Baekdu(白頭). In Goguryeo(高句麗), it regained its status as a representative Heaven Ritual facility, and was prominent in the west side of Mt.Baekdu, Korean Peninsula, and Japanese archipelagos.Since the third century B.C., The stone-mound altartomb system in the west side of Mt.Baekdu, the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago succeeded the original form of Baedalkook and showed some diversification within ‘the idea of the five natural elements of the three dimensions’. In addition to Circle(圓)Square(方) symbol, Octagon(八角) symbol appeared newly. Also in addition to 3 staircase symbol, 759 staircase symbol appeared newly. On the other hand, ‘4 staircase symbol’, the deformation form by the theory of ‘the five natural elements of Yin and Yang(陰陽五行論)’ had appeared in China.

AB  - The statistical characteristics of aerosol–cloud interactions over East Asia were investigated using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite data. The long-term relationship between various aerosol and cloud parameters was estimated using correlation analysis, principle component analysis, and Aerosol Indirect Effect (AIE) estimation. In correlation analysis, Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) was positively Correlated with Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN) and Cloud Fraction (CF), but negatively correlated with Cloud Top Temperature (CTT) and Cloud Top Pressure (CTP). Fine Mode Fraction (FMF) and CCN were positively correlated over the ocean because of sea spray. In principle component analysis, AOD and FMF were influenced by water vapor. In particular, AOD was positively influenced by CF, and negatively by CTT and CTP over the ocean. In AIE estimation, the AIE value in each cloud layer and type was mostly negative (Twomey effect) but sometimes positive (anti-Twomey effect). This is related to regional, environmental, seasonal, and meteorological effects.Rigorous and extensive studies on aerosol–cloud interactions over East Asia should be conducted via micro- and macro-scale investigations, to determine chemical characteristics using various meteorological instruments.

AB  - Background The word 'Gongyeh' translates to 'Craft' in English. It was originally translated from Japanese into a Chinese character, which was then imported into Korea. While the word 'Craft' carries an important concept that spans Art & Design, the translated word 'Gongyeh' slightly distorts the concept. This research investigates the gap between the original meaning of 'Craft' in the west and the meaning of 'Gongyeh' in East Asia, therefore contributing to the future direction of design study.Methods Through literature review, this study conducted a comparative study of the East Asian traditional concept of 'Gongyeh‘ and its Western counterpart. Japan first started modernization in East Asia and created various art-related terms. This study tries to understand the history of Japanese modernity and examines the situation in which Korea accepted and modified the concept of modern ‘crafts’.Result The term “crafts” was created in the West since modern times and was translated and transplanted through Japan. The act of “craft” was not distinguished by the act of “making” in east Asia. The East Asian perspective is that true production is integration of the providence of man and universe. In addition, this study examined the transition in which the new concept of craft is accepted in modern Korea through Japan.Conclusion The acceptance of modern terminology of crafts involved the change of tradition, and view of nature and world. The consideration of traditional concepts of these terms aims to find a connection with the present by finding the cultural background and values that have been forgotten behind current design issues. Based on this study, it is necessary to develop a new future value through the fusion of East-West by combining the Western worldview and knowledge system with the oriental value structure.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND STATISTICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The study aims to monitoring the changes occurring in the values and area of the ground cover of the soil surface during the period 2006-2019 represented by water cover, wet areas, vegetation cover and soil erosion by applying mathematical relationships of a set of spectral indices specialized in studying soil and water. The spectral indices used in the study (EMI, NDWI, TCW and TCG). The results of the study showed a decrease in the values and area of the water cover represented by marshes, swamps and rivers due to the decrease in water levels and the increase in the phenomenon of drought in southern Iraq during the period 2006-2019, in addition to a great possibility to distinguish dry and barren lands from green lands, wet soils and droughts for agricultural uses. It can be concluded that the use of the TCG indices is important in diagnosing the vegetation cover in the study area, which was characterized by its content of plants, palm trees and vegetables, especially the banks of rivers and some reed and sedge plants in the marsh areas. Therefore, the study area was characterized by its low values and green areas and this is an indicator of the weak agricultural investment in it except for some regions. The results of the study also showed that there were levels of wind erosion during the period 2006-2019, ranging between very severe and low, the Dominance of very severe erosion throughout the study area, especially in the year 2006, where the area exposed to wind erosion amounted to about 4325.58 km(2), with a rate of 90.57%.

AB  - This study was carried out in order to identify and map the temporal changes in the land covers in Hilla province using Remote Sensing and GIS. Two images were used of land sate taken in Quick Bird Satellite acquired for the ETM sensor taken on 15 April 2015 and 15 April 2007 with spatial accuracy (0.6 m). These were used as reference sources in the selection of some classification samples after matching them with the Landsat 8 above. In this research using topography maps of the study area (Hilla) with scale 1/10000 generated from the General Authority as a reference data and achieved compatibility with the image of space after it was corrected geometrically 1976, 2000 and 2014. In this research using Geographic Information System (GIS) software with projection images WGS84 process (based on the projection of the global map and the global geodetic system) and within the 38th north. Supervised classification was used to identify land cover classes dominated in the study area. Change detection results showed an increase in the urban areas, in the year 2015 the area had become 1380.350-hectare unit, while in the year 2007 the area was 318.562-hectare unit. Similarly, the vegetation had increased between 2007-2015 from (132.531 to 507.296) hectare unit. Results indicated that urban land and salinization process can be considered as the important phenomena which positively affected the agriculture area. So, the increase in the cover of water is an important reason of decrease in the arid land, which was due to the increase of urban land reach to 1061.788-hectare unit. Many changes have happened in the quantity of reclaimed land in these arid lands between the two years (2007 and 2015).

TI  - Politics and the family: Rethinking the India-Pakistan two-nations theory through the familial construction of political ideas
T2  - INDIA REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - There are very few scholarly endeavors that have focused on Pakistan-India partition and their ongoing conflict from an indigenous theoretical lens. A psycho-cultural paradigm has been used in this article to reexamine and reconceptualize the enduring two-Nations theory - a political ideology, which manifests Hindu-Muslim discord in the Indian Subcontinent by construing both communities as distinct nations based on their inherent ethno-religious and civilizational differences. Considering a very complex process of mass conversion, assimilation, and crisscrossing of caste-system between both groups, this article argues that it is theoretically problematic to differentiate between Hindus and Muslims purely on ethno-religious grounds. Given the significant impact of the institution of family on the lives of the Subcontinental people, regardless of their faith - I propose that it can be more explanatory to categorize both groups as competing branches of a joint family, to understand the construction of political ideology of two-Nations theory in familial terms. This article seeks to clarify the theoretical mechanism through which the family-level ideas can shape peoples' worldview, informing the way they perceive abstract concepts such as group-conflict and the nation, thus impacting their political thoughts.

AB  - A local archive and a system for cataloging satellite data from Russian spacecraft that are received by the FRC KSC SB RAS through the services of the Roscosmos Geoportal have been developed. An automated system for remote sensing data preprocessing has been created, which significantly simplifies access to information, implements search services and web visualization of images registered in the catalog. Practical experience in operating the system has revealed a number of shortcomings of the existing Roscosmos data distribution system. Presented data on the execution of the Roscosmos satellite survey order in 2019 they show that the capabilities of the Russian remote sensing system are very limited, and a significant part of the planned research work has not been implemented due to the lack of ordered satellite data.

AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) governs many biophysical processes at the land-atmosphere interface and the relationship vegetation-LST has been the premise of many studies. This paper purposed to correlate LST with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and surface albedo in the urasslands of Pampa biome during winter and summer seasons. Four Landsat 8 scenes with clear-sky conditions were acquired from the US Geological Survey website and NDVI and surface albedo were calculated. Afterwards, LST was obtained using Split-window (SW) algorithm. Results showed that LST in winter season exhibited less variations between pixels in comparison to summer, where the heterogeneity of the environment is significantly more detectable. LST retrieved from Landsat 8 data was consistent with the actual temperature measured in the field, with differences varying between 1-1.6 K. The LST-Vegetation relationship in the Pampa grasslands varies with the season so that caution must be taken in assuming a regular behaviour between LST and remote sensing vegetation variables, such as empirical relationships that are widely used in many scientific fields.

AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) acquired from remote sensing observations is essential to monitor surface energy and water exchange processes at the land-atmosphere interface. Most LST retrieval methodologies are developed focusing on Northern hemisphere. Consequently, Southern hemisphere has a great need for investigating the performance of LST retrieval algorithms already consolidated in the literature. In this paper, we compared a Split-window (SW) and a Single-channel (SC) method to retrieve LST from Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS images in a dune field, Southern Brazil. To validate the results, the Atmospheric Correction Parameter Calculator (ACPC) tool and Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE) were used. Results demonstrated that both methodologies are in accordance with the RTE, despite they overestimated the LST. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated that the means are not statistically significant (0.05 level). The correlations between LST retrieved and RTE were strong, producing R-2 of 0.984 and 0.973 for the SW and SC, respectively, and RMSE values of 1.18 and 1.6. SW also exhibited the best values of MSD (+/- 0.983) and Bias (0.773), thus reinforcing its superior performance. SW can be applied with an accuracy of 1.18 K in Southern Brazil, without needing complex modeling or specific radiosonde.

TI  - A Novel Sentinel Lymph Node Approach in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma
T2  - CURRENT PHARMACEUTICAL DESIGN
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Occult metastases are common in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) which is why elective neck dissection, adjuvant radiotherapy or watchful waiting have been treatment options after surgical removal of the primary tumour. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has lately emerged as a novel possibility in treatment planning.Objectives: To establish a reliable and clinically useful protocol for SLNB in staging/elective neck dissection in oral cancer.Methods: Fourteen consecutive patients with T1-T2 N0 oral cancer were enrolled when scheduled for elective neck dissection.Results: This study outlines various techniques for improving SLNB in head and neck cancer. After evaluation, a combination of techniques was found to constitute a reliable, clinically adaptable work concept. The suggested procedure starts with the pre-surgical injection of radioactive technetium Tc-99(m) carried on tilmanocept (Lymphoseek (R)) at the tumour site. The radioactivity in the lymph node is then visualized preoperatively with Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT/CT). Intraoperatively, indocyanine green (ICG) is injected and a sentinel node is visualized with near-infrared light. To support the sentinel node detection, the surgeon uses a hand-held gamma detection probe. This approach results in a reproducible and reliable detection of sentinel nodes.Conclusion: This paper presents a novel protocol for the identification of the sentinel node in the head and neck region. The protocol additionally enables the use of flow cytometry analysis of resected lymph nodes.

AB  - The objective of this study was to verify the evolution of surface temperature associated with land use and land cover from 1985 to 2019 in Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil. The methodological procedures were performed in five steps: 1. Definition of the study area; 2. Land use and land cover classification from images of Landsat 5 satellite Thematic Mapper (TM) and Operational Land Imager (OLI) from Landsat 8 satellite; 3. Calculation of surface temperature from TM sensor band 6 and OLI sensor band 10; 4. Analysis of temperature evolution over the historical series; and 5. Temporal relation between surface temperature and land use and land cover classes. The results demonstrated that higher temperatures were associated to the evolution of two classes of land use and land cover: urban area and exposed soil, with the former occupying 31% in 1989 to 75% in 2018 of the study area. When comparing the first and last decade of the historical series for each season, there was an average increase of 4.18 degrees C in the surface temperature of the districts. Thus, adopting policies that mitigate the effects caused by densification and urban sprawl are necessary, mainly through the conservation of vegetated areas and water reservoirs, as these are crucial for the maintenance of air humidity and evapotranspiration.

TI  - One photon-per-bit receiver using near-noiseless phase-sensitive amplification.
T2  - Light, science & applications
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Space communication for deep-space missions, inter-satellite data transfer and Earth monitoring requires high-speed data connectivity. The reach is fundamentally dictated by the available transmission power, the aperture size, and the receiver sensitivity. A transition from radio-frequency links to optical links is now seriously being considered, as this greatly reduces the channel loss caused by diffraction. A widely studied approach uses power-efficient formats along with nanowire-based photon-counting receivers cooled to a few Kelvins operating at speeds below 1Gb/s. However, to achieve the multi-Gb/s data rates that will be required in the future, systems relying on pre-amplified receivers together with advanced signal generation and processing techniques from fibre communications are also considered. The sensitivity of such systems is largely determined by the noise figure (NF) of the pre-amplifier, which is theoretically 3dB for almost all amplifiers. Phase-sensitive optical amplifiers (PSAs) with their uniquely low NF of 0dB promise to provide the best possible sensitivity for Gb/s-rate long-haul free-space links. Here, we demonstrate a novel approach using a PSA-based receiver in a free-space transmission experiment with an unprecedented bit-error-free, black-box sensitivity of 1 photon-per-information-bit (PPB) at an information rate of 10.5Gb/s. The system adopts a simple modulation format (quadrature-phase-shift keying, QPSK), standard digital signal processing for signal recovery and forward-error correction and is straightforwardly scalable to higher data rates.

CP  - Conference on Earth Resources and Environmental Remote Sensing/GIS Applications XI held at SPIE Remote Sensing Conference
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Landslides or rockfalls in mountainous areas in Western Greece are a continuous hazard and thus, observation either in situ or through satellite data is of great necessity. In order to study landslides or rockfalls a very accurate representation of the relief is a prerequisite. In now days diverse remote sensing satellites provides digital surface elevation models (DSMs) with global coverage. The specific data sets present the advantages of covering large areas in a very low cost in comparison with the surveys in the field. In addition, high resolution DSMs enable the analysis of topography with high levels of detail and consequently geomorphometric approach becomes more accurate for studying landlsides or rockfall events. Information which can be extracted from geological and topographic maps in GIS format such as the slope angle distribution, deduced from high resolution DSMs, are substantial in rockfalls survey. In the present work, the accuracy of freely available DSMs are under control for landslides areas in Achaia prefecture in NW Peloponnese. The accuracy of the DSMs in the broader area is investigated using reference points of certified elevation while for the landslide area ground control collected with differential GNSS receiver are used. More specifically, free available DSMs as TanDEMX, ASTER GDEM, SRTM DEM with 30m and 90m spatial resolution, ALOS AW3D30 DEM, DSM from photogrammetric airphoto processing and DSM produced by Interferometric processing of radar images, are under examination in the current study. Furthermore, diverse statistical parameters such as the 2D Root Mean Square Error or the percentile value are computed and presented. The purpose of the aforementioned procedure is to detect the most accurate DSMs which are appropriate for landslide of rockfall monitoring.

TI  - Evaluation of Ka-Band Rain Attenuation for Satellite Communication in Tropical Regions Through a Measurement of Multiple Antenna Sizes
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ka-band is modifying the mode of legacy communication towards versatile satellite-oriented systems with the beam-spot capability and a high-throughput architecture to provide twice the capability of classic Fixed Satellite Service (FSS) satellites, thus significantly reducing the cost per bit. Given this background, the contribution of precipitation rate and Ka-band downpour attenuation are expected to improve statistical models for effect prediction. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and local researchers are working tirelessly to determine the best prediction model for tropical climates. However, persistent and continuous efforts are required because currently available models do not perform well. The current prediction model for large datasets exhibits a certain deviation. Direct beacon measurement has been compared with an available prediction model that analyses rain effects in tropical regions. Theoretically, the size of the antenna and its gain influence the performance of the receiving signal. Size and availability are two factors which cause degradation and outage in the receiving signal. The majority of extant studies focus on a single antenna with a diameter lesser than 2.4m. Theoretically, antennas with a smaller diameter possess a smaller margin in comparison with antennas with larger diameters. This condition could affect the prediction model when the high attenuation causes a rapid outage in a small antenna and lead to the unavailability of measurement results. To study such effects and provide a good recommendation, the current work measures the beacon attenuation data at two locations, namely, Bukit Jalil (Kuala Lumpur) and Cyberjaya (Selangor). The locations are approximately 15 km apart and have antennas from 0.65m to 31.1m in sizes. Analyses using an available prediction model revealed that ITU-R P.618 provides the lowest RMS value of 14.37 with regards to rainfall rate on two selected samples in Malaysia. High-accuracy prediction can be achieved through the contribution of this study, and comparative data can be obtained for future research. This study is an encouraging step towards a highly comprehensive and accurate prediction of tropospheric impairments in Ka-band satellite communications in the tropical region.

AB  - The period of highestfire activity (August 2017) by the radiation power and the number of fires for the period since 2007 to 2019 was revealed. Based on image processing techniques in the infrared range (on a 4 mu m channel) according to MODIS and VIIRS data the statistical analysis of fire data was carried out and variations in the radiation power from fires were studied. The main optical and microphysical characteristics of the atmospheric aerosol for the periods with the largest number of fires for the Black Sea region wereanalyzed. A comprehensive analysis of the main optical characteristics variability and precipitation samples for periods of special fire activity was carried out. Considering that nitrogen oxides enter the atmosphere as a result of combustion processes, an analysis of atmospheric precipitation samples for the content of nitrates for days with the maximum number of thermoactive points according to satellite data was carried out in order to identify a possible correlation.

TI  - Research of the Aerosol Optical and Microphysical Characteristics of the Atmosphere over the Black Sea Region by the FIRMS System during the Forest Fires in 2018-2019
T2  - PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. The Black Sea region where the forest fires were recorded by the FIRMS system, as well as the atmosphere above it, namely the fire-induced variation of the atmospheric aerosol basic optical characteristics, were the main objects of the investigation. The study is aimed at examining the fires in the Black Sea region in 2018-2019 for assessing correlation between these events and variability of the basic optical characteristics over the Black Sea.Methods and Results. Based on the FIRMS system data, variations of intensity of the fire-induced radiation were studied. The results of statistical processing of the MODIS and VIIRS satellite data on the fires in 2018-2019 were represented. For the dates when the fire numbers were the highest in the Black Sea region, the basic optical and microphysical characteristics of the atmospheric aerosol were analyzed due to the SPM and AERONET data. The dates when the fire intensity was particularly high (based on the MODIS and VIIRS data) were analyzed and compared with the dates when the anomalous values of the atmospheric aerosol optical characteristics were recorded over the region under study.Conclusions. For the fire events in the Black Sea region revealed due to the MODIS and VIIRS data, complex analysis of the air mass transfer was performed by the model HYSPLIT, and the aerosol was typed by the CALIPSO algorithm. On June 22, 2019 the most intense fires were recorded. According to the aerosol typing by the CALIPSO algorithm, on this day the predominant aerosol types were the contaminated dust and smoke. Using the MODIS and VIIRS data, investigation of possible source of the aerosol transfer on this date showed that the area of intense inflammationn and smoke was located to the northeast from the Black Sea region. Since the satellite-derived data on this day showed no dust transfer either from the Sahara or the Syria deserts, it is possible to conclude that increase of the values of aerosol optical depth AOD (500) was conditioned by transfer of the aerosol resulted from biomass burning from the north to the Black Sea region.

AB  - Remote sensing satellite images have not been thoroughly studied in greenness analysis of Bangladesh. The purpose of this study is to create a systemic database for greenness analysis of Dhaka Division of Bangladesh. Here, we developed a web-based greenness analysis tool using Remote sensing of MODIS (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite images MODIS NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) is the most popularly used vegetation index in Remote sensing to calculate the amount of greenness. Fifteen years MODIS NDVI images from 2001-2015 are used to extract greenness and accumulated the data of 13 Districts of Dhaka Division to create the database. Using this database and performing algorithms and methodology, this study has found and extracted each green pixels from the original images which is used for analysis. A web-based greenness analysis tool is developed here to display this study of greenness analysis of entire Dhaka This tool allows mainly four options like Time Series Analysis, Monthly Single District Greenness Comparison, Yearly District Based Comparison and Comparison of two District of Dhaka Division at Chosen Date. These options show how greenness changes yearly among the districts and if they are related to each other and represent the results in graph, bar chart plot and map view. The study has shown us that Dhaka division, and by a larger extent Bangladesh, is an agricultural country and most of the green is based on agricultural crops as it shows increase of green during the period of cultivation for crops.

AB  - In this work, we developed a satellite-based Boro rice monitoring system which will be capable of collecting data on rice production area of whole Bangladesh along with a graphical statistics of rice production area every season. In this monitoring system, Bangladesh has been divided into 7 regions and the production area of Boro rice for these 7 regions has been calculated using only the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite data. Our system does not require any ground truth data. The principal approach requires remotely detected information from MODIS at 250m250m spatial resolutions gained more than two distinct time periods: sowing season which is from December 1 to January 10 and growing season which is from January 11 to April 10 throughout the year (Boro Seasons). Total of eight years 2008-2015 MODIS data have been accumulated and an improvised Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) threshold of the Boro rice model has been used for rice area extraction. This monitoring system has some features like region-wise and area-wise information, search options, improvement/deterioration analysis, and rice area extraction map view. The rice monitoring system can be used by the Department of Agriculture of Bangladesh or Food ministry for the collection of accurate and up-to-date information on the country's rice production. It will also be able to provide information on Boro rice production readily accessible to decision-makers and government agencies to help respond better during and after natural disasters or in any need. Moreover, we believe that our developments of forecasting the Boro rice yield would be useful for the decision-makers in addressing food security in Bangladesh.

TI  - A new method of sentinel node mapping for early gastric cancer using a fluorescent laparoscope that can adjust the intensity of excitation light and quantify the intensity of indocyanine green fluorescence: Report of a case
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: One of the drawbacks of indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence sentinel node (SN) mapping is the impossibility of quantifying lymph node fluorescence during surgery. VISION SENSE (R) is a new near-infrared fluorescence laparoscope for bright-field full-color observation, and provides the ability to adjust the intensity of excitation light and quantify the intensity of ICG fluorescence during observation.We report the case of a patient who underwent ICG SN mapping for early gastric cancer using VISION SENSE (R).PRESENTATION OF CASE: A woman in her 60 s was diagnosed with cType0-IIc early gastric cancer located in the anterior wall of the middle gastric body (25 mm in diameter, cT1b, cN0, cM0, cStage IA). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed no metastases. Laparoscopy assisted distal gastrectomy with D1+ lymph node dissection and SN mapping with ICG fluorescence using the VISION SENSE (R) were successfully performed. Using VISION SENSE (R), we could select those lymph nodes objectively showing high intensity by quantifying ICG fluorescence during surgery.The pathological diagnosis was well-differentiated adenocarcinoma, pT1a, NO, MO, pStage IA. No ICG-positive lymph nodes (8 nodes) contained metastases.Postoperative course was good, with no complications.DISCUSSION: The use of VISION SENSE (R) allowing adjustment of excitation light and quantification of ICG fluorescence intensity might decreased the false-negative rate for SNs and increased the sensitivity of the ICG for detecting SNs.CONCLUSION: We successfully performed ICG SN mapping for early gastric cancer using VISION SENSE (R).

AB  - The alarming rate of global mangrove forest degradation corroborates the need for providing fast, up-to-date and accurate mangrove maps. Conventional scene by scene image classification approach is inefficient and time consuming. The development of Google Earth Engine (GEE) provides a cloud platform to access and seamlessly process large amount of freely available satellite imagery. The GEE also provides a set of the state-of-the-art classifiers for pixel-based classification that can be used for mangrove mapping. This study is an initial effort which is aimed to combine machine learning and GEE for mapping mangrove extent. We used two Landsat 8 scenes over Agats and Timika Papua area as pilot images for this study; path 102 row 64 (2014/10/19) and path 103 row 63 (2013/05/16). The first image was used to develop local training areas for the machine learning classification, while the second one was used as a test image for GEE on the cloud. A total of 838 points samples were collected representing mangroves (244), non-mangroves (161), water bodies (311), and cloud (122) class. These training areas were used by support vector machine classifier in GEE to classify the first image. The classification result show mangrove objects could be efficiently delineated by this algorithm as confirmed by visual checking. This algorithm was then applied to the second image in GEE to check the consistency of the result. A simultaneous view of both classified images shows a corresponding pattern of mangrove forest, which mean the mangrove object has been consistently delineated by the algorithm.

AB  - Radiometric correction of remote sensing images is required to improve the quality of image pixel values and provide a measurable physical unit of each pixel. Selection of the appropriate image radiometric and atmospheric correction level defines the success of any remote sensing-based mapping applications. This study aims to assess the effects of radiometric correction levels applied to Landsat 8 (Operational Land Imager, OLI) image acquired in 2018 to the results of the land cover classification using the Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC). The image was corrected into four levels of radiometric and atmospheric correction; no correction (digital number), at-sensor radiance, at-sensor reflectance (top of atmosphere, ToA), and at-surface reflectance (bottom of atmosphere, BoA). A set of classification training sample covering five land cover classes (mangroves, inland vegetation, exposed soil, built-up area, and water body) was selected from the image. To ensure fair class comparison, the number of training sample were set to be proportional to the area of targeted classes. The results of this study show that there is no difference in the classification results of each level of correction, both in the area and distribution of the classes. This finding indicates that MLC result is invariable of image correction level.

AB  - The paper reflects the specificity of the fundamental ideas of the artistic world of M. G. Atamanov, which includes a wide range of literary facts from the content level of the text of the works to their poetics. A particularly important role in the works of M. G. Atamanov is played by cross-cutting themes and images that reflect the author's individual style and his idea of national-ethnic identity. The subject of the research is the book of essays "Mon - Udmurt. Maly mynym vos'?" ("I am Udmurt. Why does it hurt?"), which most vividly reflected the main spiritual and artistic searches of M. G. Atamanov, associated with his ideas about the Udmurt people. The main motives and plots of the works included in the book under consideration are accumulated around the concept of "Udmurtness". The comprehension of "Udmurtness" is modeled in his essays through specific leit themes: native language, Udmurt people, national culture, mentality, geographic and topographic features of the Udmurt people' places of residence, the Orthodox idea. The "Udmurt theme" is recognized and comprehended by the writer through the prism of national identity.

AB  - Globally, 55% of the population lives in urban areas in 2018, and this number is expected to hit 68% by 2050. Earth Observation (EO) images based mapping of the urban regions is a critical parameter in the sustainable urban planning process. In recent years, rapid urban growth is experienced in the coastal metropolitan city of India-Chennai. The two land regions, having heterogeneous land uses, as high-rise high-density and medium-rise low-density of the Chennai city are taken as study area. The fully-polarimetric L-band ALOS-2 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data is used for rapid identification of the urban regions. With respect to this, a comparative assessment of the two supervised classification algorithms such as Wishart and Support Vector Machine (SVM) is presented. The same training data set is used for both algorithms, and a confusion matrix is created algorithm wise. The results of classification with the two classes as urban and non urban indicate that the SVM outperformed the Wishart supervised classification algorithm.

AB  - Introduction: Many astronauts experience intense emotional reactions to viewing the Earth from space that changes the way they see the planet and humanity's place in the universe. Frank White has described this phenomenon as the Overview Effect. This has been described in both spiritual and humanistic terms. But what exactly is the difference or similarity between these two reactions, and to what extent do these reactions reflect new experiences versus pre-launch values? To answer these questions, a reexamination was made of the findings from our previous study on positive effects of being in space, but with a focus on various aspects of the Overview Effect.Methods: The study involved astronauts and cosmonauts recruited from the Association of Space Explorers and the NASA astronaut corps at the Johnson Space Center. A total of 39 respondents completed the Positive Effects of Being in Space questionnaire, which consisted of 36 statements that subjects were asked to evaluate in terms of change they experienced as a result of being in space.Results: The questions clustered into 8 subscales. Although all of the respondents had a positive reaction to being in space, the Perceptions of Earth subscale was the only one with a mean score that was significantly different from the others, reflecting a moderate degree of change. The Earth was viewed as a beautiful, fragile object to be treasured, and changes in this perception significantly correlated with a statement that suggested that the respondents became involved in environmental causes after returning home. In addition to these perceptual changes about the Earth, some subjects said that their space experience gave them a better understanding of the unity of humankind and a stronger sense of wonder and appreciation for the Cosmos, but to a small degree of change from pre-launch values. A subscale indicating spiritual change scored last among the 8 subscales, resulting in no to very small change. This might have been due to the fact that many respondents indicated that there was no possibility for change because their feelings about these spiritual issues were already as high as possible before launch.Conclusions: The findings from this study provide empirical support for the Overview Effect, suggesting that seeing the Earth from space may cause many astronauts to change their worldview on the fragility of the planet and the unity of humankind. In contrast to this more humanistic reaction, there was essentially no change in spiritual attitudes as a result of being in space. However, some respondents indicated that their spiritual faith was already high pre-launch and could not change any more as a result of their mission.

AB  - The proposed array antenna element consists of a rectangular patch with four shorting pins, an extended cavity, and a superstrate. The four shorting pins allow high-order mode operation, which can enhance the bore-sight gain. The mutual coupling strength between adjacent elements is minimized due to the extended cavity structure. In addition, the superstrate can enhance the bore-sight gain using the Fabry-perot structure. The proposed array antenna shows the simulated and measured maximum gains of 25.2 dBi and 24.2 dBi in the zx-plane, 25.6 dBi and 24.5 dBi in the zy-plane at 5.8 GHz. The simulated and measured transmission efficiencies are 7% and 6% at 0.8 m.

AB  - Purpose; The purpose of this study is to examine the problems of the traditional teaching method, and to clari-fy how the teaching and learning methods for creative talents is reflected through the design on teaching and learning method for creative talent in the age of artificial intelligence(AI). The design of the creative teaching and learning model proposed in this study is largely classified into two stages, In-class(Offline Practice Learning Steps) and After-class(Post-Class Inquiry and Project-Based Learning). And the mechanism that connects learning states organically rather than independently separate concept, but is analyzed based on a questionnaire evaluation on the concentration and immersion of classes and the understanding of creative teaching and learning methods. And this paper explores that learners who will be at the center of future society have the power to think through concentration and immersion in solving their own difficult problems based on their experience of teaching and learning methods in university education. In this process, creativity is expressed. They will also feel happy with a sense of accomplishment, confidence, and satisfaction while solving difficult problems. This is why problem-based learning is necessary in university education. The teaching and learning method proposed in this study is to in-duce learners to think freely based on dialogue rather than discussion, and to lead the class by achieving the con-centration and immersion in class, thus leading to a sense of achievement. The teaching-learning model, which incorporates elements that can solve problems on their own with convergent and logical thinking, has become an opportunity to reveal the importance of fostering creative talent for the artificial intelligence era.

AB  - This study explains the development of citizen sensing that detected radioactive contamination, mapped the data and shared it through social media immediately after the Fukushima nuclear accident. In this way, this is an attempt to highlight the process by which a new form of sensitivity and responsibility with regards to radioactive hazards is created. In particular, by focusing on the activities of SafeCast, which consists mainly of hacker spaces, DIY-sensing and crowdsourcing, in the immediate aftermath of the Fukushima nuclear accident, this study explores the process by which the citizens’ abilities to sense and respond are intensified by means of devices and concepts that reflect the citizens’ interests. By re-translating sensitivity and responsibility into sense+ability and response+ability, the researcher suggests that the post-Fukushima citizen sensing can be contrasted to the world divided into science and politics, knowledge and faith, values and facts, experts and public, and that it is stylizing a new form of life. First, the study will examine the post-Fukushima State-citizen relationship and elaborate on the formation of a public around the issue of radioactive contamination. In this way, this created an opportunity for the ideas of citizen sensing to emerge as a new form of risk communication. Secondly, this study suggests that citizen sensing has a sensory ability that distinguishes it from existing government organization and civil movements, by exploring the process of radioactive contamination detection by SafeCast, formed through the merging of hacker spaces and DIY-sensing.Thirdly, by describing the process by which radioactive contamination maps are created and shared through crowdsourcing, this study reveals that SafeCast’s response ability is distinguished from other agencies that create radioactive contamination maps. Fourthly, this study considers the discussions about the validity analysis of SafeCast’s radioactive contamination detection and mapping, as well as the possibilities of a worldview that does not merely consider scientific validity and values to be mutually exclusive.

AB  - Despeckling of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images is still an open issue in the remote sensing community. Many filtering approaches have been adopted by the scientific community in order to reduce speckle noise effects including, such as spatial-based and non-local techniques. Mainly all existing approaches present some limitation in terms of accuracy or computational time or edge preservation. Recently a frequency-based solution presented as an improvement of the classical Wiener filter was proposed in order to limit the previous mentioned critical issues. The algorithm was already tested on both simulated and Sentinel-1 data. In this paper, we assess and validate the effectiveness of the proposed solution exploiting different very high-resolution (VHR) data such as, COSMO-SkyMed and RADARSAT SAR images. The results are interesting proving that the developed filter can effectively deal with the case of different VHR SAR images and can provide accurate results within a very limited time.

TI  - Three Decades of Coastal Changes in Sindh, Pakistan (1989-2018): A Geospatial Assessment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal erosion endangers millions living near-shore and puts coastal infrastructure at risk, particularly in low-lying deltaic coasts of developing nations. This study focuses on morphological changes along the similar to 320-km-long Sindh coastline of Pakistan over past three decades. In this study, the Landsat images from 1989 to 2018 at an interval of 10 years are used to analyze the state of coastline erosion. For this purpose, well-known statistical approaches such as end point rate (EPR), least median of squares (LMS), and linear regression rate (LRR) are used to calculate the rates of coastline change. We analyze the erosion trend along with the underlying controlling variables of coastal change. Results show that most areas along the coastline have experienced noteworthy erosion during the study period. It is found that Karachi coastline experienced 2.43 +/- 0.45 m/yr of erosion and 8.34 +/- 0.45 m/yr of accretion, while erosion on the western and eastern sides of Indus River reached 12.5 +/- 0.55 and 19.96 +/- 0.65 m/yr on average, respectively. Coastal erosion is widespread along the entire coastline. However, the rate of erosion varies across the study area with a general trend of erosion increasing from west to east in the Indus Delta region (IDR), and the highest average erosion rate is 27.46 m/yr. The interdecadal change during 1989-1999, 1999-2009 and 2009-2018 periods depicted an increasing linear trend (R-2 = 0.78) from Karachi to Indus River (IR) East zone. The spatial trend from west to east is positively correlated with mean sea level rise, which has increased from 1.1 to 1.9 mm/year, and negatively correlated with topographic slope, which is found to be decreasing eastward along the coastline. The findings necessitate appropriate actions and have important implications to better manage coastal areas in Pakistan in the wake of global climate change.n

TI  - Secretory breast carcinoma in adulthood - A case report with literature review
T2  - VOJNOSANITETSKI PREGLED
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction. Secretory breast carcinoma is rare subtype of breast carcinoma which occurs primarily in children and young adults, so in the past it was called juvenile carcinoma. Case report. A 67-year-old female patient presented with mass of the right breast since one month. After physical, routine laboratory examination and mammography, core needle biopsy was performed and histopathological examination confirmed invasive carcinoma. Immunohistochemically, estrogen-receptors (ER) and progesteron-receptors (PR) showed weak positive reaction in 10% of tumor cells, while human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) was without expression. After an adequate preoperative preparation, operation was done - quadrantectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy. Postoperatively, the patient was treated with 6 cycles of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and fluorouracil (CMF) combination, radiotherapy (60 Gy) and tamoxifen. After 5-year follow-up the patient had no signs of the disease. Conclusion. Secretory breast cancer is a rare subtype of invasive breast carcinoma with wide age range of occurrence and good prognosis despite its triple-negative immunophenotype. Although the therapeutic management is non-consensual for this breast cancer special type, surgery is considered the mainstay of the treatment as well as the adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation.

AB  - This essay is a comparative analysis of three texts of major poets of Spain's Golden Age: Luis de Gongora, Lope de Vega, and Juan de Jauregui. The poets worked with a common trope, sharing a worldview that blended themes of Hebrew kingship with the Spanish Habsburg dynasty. The poems are based on the concept of Spanish Solomonism, and are related by inventive, and very different, evocations of the Temple of Jerusalem as the seat of Christian monarchy, holiness, and visual beauty.

TI  - Authoritarian Populism and the Discourse of "the People" in the Turkish Islamist Media: The Case of Yeni Safak
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The expression "the people" became an epicenter of media debates during Turkey's June 2018 national elections and its transition from parliamentary to presidential governance. Through qualitative and semiotic analysis of primary sources (newspaper stories, op-eds, columns, and editorials), this study investigates political rhetoric and the concept of "the people" in Turkish Islamist print media, particularly the progovernment Turkish daily Yeni Safak. This article brings to light how a contested meaning of the concept "the people" was featured in the daily in the midst of rival, polarizing populist discourses during the 2018 national elections in Turkey. The analysis reveals that Yeni Safak articulated views representing populism and the ethos of political Islam in the media ideology-an ambiguous and equivocal systemic worldview of media institutions grounded in a greater system of beliefs and processes naturalized as social reality. As a result, Yeni Safak created unyielding divides in the society and served the production, dissemination, and mobilization of the populist discourse of the ruling party constellated around the politics of the definition of "the people."

CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing of the Ocean, Sea Ice, Coastal Waters, and Large Water Regions

AB  - Analysis of possibilities of identification and characterization of marine processes using their signatures in radar and optical imagery of the sea surface is a very important problem of the ocean remote sensing which has not been solved yet completely by now. Marine slicks which are the areas of suppressed wind waves can be recorded by different sensors and can be indicators of internal waves, non uniform currents, atmospheric convective cells, etc. Field studies including those simultaneous and co-located with remote observations is the most perspective way to the problem solution. An expedition of the Institute of Applied Physics RAS was organized to study the nature of slick bands and its dynamics in the field of various subsurface processes. Field experiments were carried out in the coastal zone of the Black sea from the Oceanographic Platform of Marine Hydrophysical Institute RAS and from the shore. The structure of the currents in the studied area is characterized by significant heterogeneity, so we were able to register different slick structures in the flow field and wind and the slick dynamics. In some experiments, marine slicks were recorded simultaneously in satellite Sentinel images. Observations of surface manifestations of internal waves were carried out using a digital radar station MRS-1000 and multi-frequency radar complex of IAP RAS. At the same time the measurements of currents in the water column were carried out using the ADCP WH Monitor 1200 kHz, wind speed and direction at a height of 30 meters using WindSonic acoustic anemometer. During the passage of internal waves a system of slick bands with a reduced intensity of small-scale waves were observed. Slick bands were observed mainly over the rear slopes of the internal waves; the data from the accompanying measurements showed that the phase velocity was close to the surface current velocity. Theoretical analysis has shown that in this case the convergent zones, where surfactants are accumulated were formed at the rear slopes of the internal waves. This mechanism of slick formation was predicted earlier theoretically and then was modeled in laboratory experiment.

TI  - Eschatological Representations of the Tsarist Elite on the Eve of the Great Russian Revolution
T2  - BYLYE GODY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Great Russian revolution of 1917 was the fatal event in the life of the tsarist elites, which they could not overcome and which broke them as the basis of the system of making and implementing managerial decisions. The growth of crisis phenomena in the Russian Empire led to the growth of the revolutionary movement, which in turn had a direct impact on the formation of negative moods in the ruling elites and a premonition of the coming end of their existence. The reign of the last two Russian emperors simultaneously became the time of the last rise of Russian Imperial power and a time of deep systemic political crisis. Attempts to understand the essence of these events were made by the elites at the same time in their course. But these assessments were not always objective and constructive.In their memoirs, many representatives of the political class of Russia sought to give a fairly objective, although not always scientific, assessment of the events taking place in the country related to the systemic crisis of the management system. Some (such as General A. I. Denikin) pointed out that the authorities were late with the reforms being carried out in the country, while others (such as K. N. Pobedonostsev) argued that the country was not "frozen" enough and that it should be "frozen" even more. This paper examines the features of the worldview of the elite associated with their feelings of socio-political reality on the eve of a revolutionary revolution. Their eschatological premonitions were predetermined by a sense of their own historical impotence and inability to change the situation for the better by their own efforts.

AB  - Based on observational data, we analyzed seasonal variations of the outgoing longwave radiation at the outer boundary of the atmosphere and air temperature near the Earth's surface. It has been shown that under quiet geomagnetic conditions, there is positive annual average correlation between the outgoing longwave radiation and near-surface temperature at latitudes higher than 30 degrees. In the seasonal course, this dependence remains, with the exception of the winter period. At low latitudes, the outgoing longwave radiation correlates with the near-surface temperature above land, and over the oceans these characteristics are anticorrelated throughout the year.

T2  - 2020 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ACOUSTICS, SPEECH, AND SIGNAL PROCESSING
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP)
CL  - Barcelona, SPAIN
AB  - This paper presents a novel statistical model for the characterisation of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images of the sea surface. The analysis of ocean surface is widely performed using satellite imagery as it produces information for wide areas under various weather conditions. An accurate SAR amplitude distribution model enables better results in despeckling, ship detection/tracking and so forth. In this paper, we develop a new statistical model, namely the Laplace-Rician distribution for modelling amplitude SAR images of the sea surface. The proposed statistical model is based on Rician distribution to model the amplitude of a complex SAR signal, the in-phase and quadrature components of which are assumed to be Laplace distributed. The Laplace-Rician model is investigated for SAR images of the sea surface from COSMO-SkyMed and Sentinel-1 in comparison to state-of-the-art statistical models such as K, lognormal and Weibull distributions. In order to decide on the most suitable model, statistical significance analysis via Kullback-Leibler divergence and Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics is performed. The results show a superior modelling performance of the proposed model for all of the utilised images.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Glacier recession and thermal expansion account for 75% of observed sea level rise Pt The importance of studying glacial melting is amplified by number of unmonitored glaciers in the world and complicated by the feasibility of exhaustive field monitoring. Remote sensing techniques such as multiyear satellite imaging provide a valuable dataset for such comprehensive surveillance. Current techniques using remote sensed data involve volume-area scaling analysis that rely on active field measurements [2,3]. This study demonstrates the potential utility of fractal analysis [4] of multi-year glacier landsat images to serve as a predictive indicator of glacial melt. Specifically, it investigated how annual changes in the observed surface geometry of glaciers correlate with the 1) mass balance of the glacier, 2) observed temperature around the glacier. The results show that the fractal dimension changes in the landsat images are predictive of the glaciers' mass balance (p=0.0008), and mean temperatures (p<0.0005). This study suggests that it is possible to rely on readily available remote sensing techniques to rapidly and continuously monitor the world's glaciers and identify critical glacial regions undergoing melting.

AB  - In Belarus, the authoritarian ruler Lukashenka has created a personality-based regime in which all political and social processes are controlled by him via a rigid vertical power structure. For him, power is a question of life and death. His worldview is dominated by conspiracy theories, and politics is a battle against his enemies. Lukashenka regards the state as being his own, and the people as his subjects. Due to his lack of communication with society, he failed to register the development of a revolutionary situation in the run-up to the 2020 presidential election. For Lukashenka, the only way of responding to the protests is to use repression and violence. Yet the fundamental social changes that have been set in motion are unstoppable.

TI  - Rethinking of the spiritual heritage of Leo Tolstoy in contemporary Japan
T2  - JAPANESE STUDIES IN RUSSIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The study of the reception of Tolstoy's teaching in Japan is of interest both in terms of the history, opportunities, and prospects of intercultural communication, consideration of ways to strengthen mutual understanding between the two countries, and in terms of the determination of the importance of certain ideas of domestic thought through their impact on the consciousness of people in different parts of the world as a whole.The article overviews the history of the initial stages of perception and influence of Leo Tolstoy's teaching. The main channels of its transmission and dissemination are traced and the reasons for its popularity in Japan are investigated. Among them, it is possible to single out such reasons as this teaching's practical orientation and humanistic nature, its consonance with the Buddhist worldview in a number of aspects, the philosophy of pacifism and non-resistance, ecumenism, idealization and ethization of agricultural work in harmony with nature, reflections on the humanitarian problems of progress. The author's analysis is focused upon the ways of rethinking and applying Tolstoy's concepts by contemporary Japanese humanities thinkers in their search for approaches to solving the civilizational, political, sociocultural, humanitarian problems of the 21st century. The subject of special attention is the incorporation of Tolstoy's ideas by modern Japanese Buddhist thinkers, in particular, Ikeda Daisaku, as well as comparative studies of Tolstoy's major philosophical concepts and key doctrines of the Japanese Buddhist tradition. The issue of particular interest is the appeal to the Russian thinker's spiritual heritage in the Japanese pacifist discourse in line with the present-day debate regarding the future of the peace clause of the Japanese Constitution and Japan's determination of its new role in the world. The article is the first attempt to generalize views on Tolstoy's heritage and its assessments in contemporary Japan in recent decades. The author aims to complement significantly the existing knowledge about the interpretation of Tolstoy's thought abroad, thanks to the determination of the spectrum of problems for which the resource of Russian philosophy is being used today and the identification of ways and forms of perception of its ideas.

AB  - Coastal zones are areas that are vulnerable to ecological damage. One type of ecosystem that is vulnerable to damage in coastal zones is mangroves. The coastal area of East Aceh is one of the areas where the existence of mangrove ecosystems has a high level of criticality. The level of criticality of mangroves in the area is caused by various factors such as exploitation of natural resources, physical development such as residential areas, and conversion of land to other designation areas without considering to the sustainability of mangrove ecosystems. By utilization of Landsat 8 and Bing Map Imagery satellite image data using the concept of geographic information systems, the extent of mangrove forest and its critical level can be inventoried. Determination of the critical level of mangrove forests was carried out by referring to the mangrove inventory guidelines issued by the Indonesian Ministry of Forestry in 2005. The results of data processing showed that the critical level of mangrove forests reached 4,200.02 hectares in severely damaged conditions, 7,286.93 hectares in damaged condition, and 9.704, 01 hectares are not damaged. Based on these results, forest management efforts are needed through the method of rehabilitating mangrove forests toimprove the condition of heavily damaged mangrove forests.

CP  - International SAUPEC/RobMech/PRASA Conference
CL  - Cape Town, SOUTH AFRICA
AB  - This paper discusses Deep Learning (DL) and Transfer Learning (TL) state of the art techniques applied to a binary classification task for change detection in satellite imagery. A blob detection algorithm is applied to a Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) generated displacement map. The blobs are classified as either positive, corresponding to uplift or subsidence, or negative, corresponding to noise. The novel dataset consists of Sentinel-1 DInSAR processed georeferenced images of displacement, phase, coherence and RGB Sentinel-2 optical satellite imagery of the blobs. TL via Feature Extraction (FE) is applied using numerous DL models with weights pretrained on the ImageNet dataset to generate feature maps after removing the last predictive layer. A Logistic Regression classifier is then applied to the features. Fine-Tuning (FT) and Random Initialisation (RI), training from scratch, are also applied to ResNet-50 and EfficientNet B4 architectures. The best performing model (85.76 %) is the ResNet-50 using FE. Small ensembles of some models are also investigated. An ensemble of ResNet-50, ResNeXt-50 and EfficientNet B4 has an accuracy of 84.83%. TL via FE with the ResNet-50 has an accuracy of approx. 9% and 8% higher than when using it for TL via FT or RI respectively. The EfficientNet B4 obtained an accuracy of 82.29% for FE, 66.35% for FT and 50.00% (as good as a random guess) for RI.

AB  - Currently, with the improvement of the spatial resolution of hyperspectral sensors, the influence of shadows on data gathered from these sensors increases, which makes these data hard to interpret automatically. Therefore, the shadow compensation process of such data is necessary. In this investigation, a linear pixel-by-pixel hyperspectral unrnixing-based approach, addressing the spectral variability phenomenon, is used to compensate for the shadow effect in the considered data. Indeed, in this approach, which is based on nonnegative matrix factorization, this effect is considered as a spectral variability phenomenon, and thus spectral variables involved in shaded areas are considered as variants of the same variables in unshaded regions contained in the same imaged scene. Experiments are conducted on a real hyperspectral image to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. These experiments show that the used approach yields a satisfactory de-shadowing result and outperforms other tested methods from the literature.

AB  - Education has an important place in transitional strategy of society to sustainable development that is proved by many international acts. In the outlines of modern approaches, education for sustainable development is characterized as innovative concept of changes to educational activity, as mechanism of realization of strategy of sustainable development, as instrument of modernization of educational practice, as one of the basis of modern educational quality and continuity standards. National system of global aims for consolidation of society of sustainable development with an accent on the significance of educational matter was created in Ukraine. Education for sustainable development is characterized by being part to structure creating social institutes of modern society, transversality, subjective direction, integrativity, forward-looking character. This vector of education research is same with global man's intentions of civilization development-increase in human's value in all spheres of life, developing of democratic management, constructive cooperation and communication, etc. Among multidimensional potential of researched phenomenon the most practical value has environmental education. As for today, environmental education is a practical mechanism of transformation of educational system on the principles of sustainable development. Environmental education is seen as an instrument for systematic formation of man's basic attributes for being part of education for sustainable development field-critical thinking, environmental worldview, subjective-value approach to environment, eco-cultural values. Cumulative result of environmental education is formation of environmental culture.

Further development of remote sensing technologies creates opportunities for solving more complex problems requiring multi-time analysis of satellite data. Assessment of success reforestation after a disturbance in forest cover is such an important task. The traditional method of an assessment of successful reforestation is laying out the ground plots, which task requires significant time and resources. Fieldworks and transfer of land to forest cover land is carried out according to the method, which is developed by the Federal Agency for Forestry of Russia. This method has various criteria of success reforestation for every region. Arkhangelsk region, Vologda region and Republic of Karelia became the territories for research. Forest vegetation of this region belongs to the taiga zone and is divided into five groups: the area of pre-tundra forests and sparse taiga, northern taiga, middle taiga and south taiga. International forest classification relates this area to boreal forest. The task of transfer land to forest cover land can be optimized by using remote sensing data. This research shows analysis of recovery of the normalized difference vegetation index, the shortwave vegetation index and the normalized burn ratio in the framework of reforestation objects. Filed data was collected for every object and this data includes a number of young trees, average height and species composition. Processing of a considerable number of satellite imageries requires significant computing power because of the Google Earth Engine platform using for analysis data. The most suitable index was chosen in the analysis of the obtained data for the development of an automatic method for transfer land to forest cover land. The most suitable index for dividing lands on forest cover and non-forest cover lands is the shortwave vegetation index. Optimal threshold for transferring land is achievement of recovery index of 80 % from initial values before disturbance. The automatic method was developed using unsupervised classification and threshold values of recovery index.

TI  - IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CATEGORY OF THE TENSE OF THE VERB IN THE NORTHERN DIALECTS OF THE UDMURT LANGUAGE
T2  - EZHEGODNIK FINNO-UGORSKIKH ISSLEDOVANII-YEARBOOK OF FINNO-UGRIC STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper explores the functioning of tense forms of verb in the Northern dialects of the Udmurt language, which have insufficient coverage in scientific literature. The relevance of the study is due to the need for a comprehensive research of the category of the tense in the context of territorial varieties of Udmurt language. The empirical base of the research is the language materials of the author's dialectological expeditions to the areas of Northern Udmurt. The paper highlights specific features of the Northern Udmurt dialects on the one hand and features with limited diffusion in certain microsystems of studied dialects on the other. Consistent comparison of the language facts of Northern Udmurt dialects with similar phenomena in other dialects of Udmurt is made. The study demonstrates that in the studied dialects the verb tenses in their substantial and structural characteristics largely coincide with the system of the Udmurt literary language. Dialectal peculiarities are revealed in derivation, paradigms of conjugation, distribution and semantics of the use of separate tense forms. Distinctive features of the morphological character are observed in terms of the expression of individual forms of the present tense, which is due to the phonetic laws existing in the Northern dialects. Certain intra-dialect peculiarities are revealed in the forms of inflection (for example, the paradigm of modal perfection in a positive aspect varying in the Northern dialects). The paper deals with quantitative composition and peculiarities of derivation of analytical past tense forms in the Northern dialects of the Udmurt language. The main attention is paid to the most widely spread analytical forms of past tenses. Structural and semantic features of functioning of considered forms in Northern dialects are noted. The study has identified dialectal differences in the accentuation in verb forms with the suffixes -my, -dy, -zy.

TI  - Gender Aspect of the Image of Altai in George Grebenstchikoff's Works
T2  - IMAGOLOGIYA I KOMPARATIVISTIKA-IMAGOLOGY AND COMPARATIVE STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper considers gender characteristics of the image of Altai in fiction and publicistic texts by George Grebenstchikoff The texts under consideration are Grebenstchikoff s essays Altai Russsian, My Siberia, the fairy tale Khan-Altai in Russian and in English. The paper aims at revealing the relationship between the narrator and the locus of the texts in terms of the category of gender. Imagological characteristics of the image of Altai gender identity in Grebenstchikoff s texts show the mixture of subjective, emotional, objective, philosophical and analytical narrative traditions in these texts about Altai. Gender identity of the image of Altai is connected to the traditional, patriarchal androcentric worldview, when the way of verbal expression is "controlled by the dominating group", and the reality of the less influential groups is not represented. The masculine nature of Altai, the Mountain Spirit, is shown in the Altai folklore, which is connected to the embodiment of Altai in the images of White Burkhan and his friend Oyrot. Symbolically, this masculine embodiment of Altai exists in George Grebenstchikoff's texts as the image of Khan-Altai, the reminiscence to the art and prosaic works of Grigory Choros-Gurkin. This masculine image of Khan-Altai is associated in Grebenstchikoff's texts with the motifs of running water (a river, a spring) and a song glorifying Altai (a hymn of eternal life). Both the masculine Khan-Altai himself as well as Khan-Oirot, the male embodiment of the river (Chulyshmanbogatyr), the shepherd, and the shaman Bakhsa are endowed with a voice, can sing and, thus, participate in the communication with the gods and forces of nature. In self-translations (My Siberia, Khan-Altai) Grebenstchikoff uses the standard pronoun it while referring to Altai. In the patriarchal, androcentric worldview the masculine image of Khan-Altai is represented with the traditional cognitive metaphors as A MAN IS A WARRIOR, A MAN IS A CREATOR and A MAN IS A SINGER. The narrator in Grebenstchikoff's texts describes the internal space of Altai semiosphere. Opposite to the "chaos", strange and dangerous space, this "fairy tale", "mysterious" semiosphere is separated from the outer world by the line of the Altai Mountains. In his publicistic texts, Grebenstchikoff's narrator is expressly objective, transferring the folklore metaphor ALTAI - BOGATYR, firstly, with the help of represented speech, and then, with by direct citing from the Altai epic. In the fairy tale Khan-Altai, the narrator is extremely emotional and subjective: he speaks directly to Altai-Bogatyr [Giant Altai], which is related to gaining insight into the spiritual vertical as well as the narrator's ascending to the female embodiment of Altai - its highest peak, Belukha. The reference to Belukha, the queen of Altai, is made in Grebenstchikoff's texts with the help of the pronoun ona / Ona [she / She]. The same strategy is used in the self-translations into English: the author uses the pronoun she /She contrary to the rules of the English grammar Masculine embodiment of Altai, Khan-Altai, is the reminiscent image in Grebenstchikoff's texts. But the real embodiment of Altai is a strong archaic symbol of the Altai queen, "the queen of Asian mountains", the Belukha, which creates the spiritual stairs of the world for the narrator and his follow-travelers. The writer follows there the traditions of Russian Romantic montanistics, reconsidered in the context of modernism.The masculine embodiment of the Altai image, Khan-Altai, turns out to be a "reminiscence image" in the reviewed Grebenstchikoff s journalistic and literary texts. The true embodiment of Altai is the powerful archaic image-symbol of the queen of Altai, the "queen of the Asian mountains" Belukha, who creates for the narrator and his companions the "spiritual vertical" of the world.

AB  - Increased population growth will impact on changes in land use for human settlements and other living needs. It is caused to land use change that negatively impacts the environment if it is not managed properly. Therefore, the information regarding to land use map is essentially needed. This research aims to asses land use change in Bedadung Jember watershed using a remote sensing technology as Bedadung watershed is one of the largest watersheds through the settlement areas of Jember regency. Remote sensing technology is widely used to provide any information such as land use changes without having an immediate monitoring in site. Therefore, it can be used to monitor land use changes in an area regularly. Landsat-8 has 30x30 m resolution is one of remote sensing technologies which is suitable for this research. The method of classifying land use change used supervised classification with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) analysis approach in Geographic Information System (GIS). The results showed that within 16 years from 2001-2017, Bedadung Jember watershed had increased its settlement areas to 36,79 km(2) or 2,66%, forest areas are decreased to 47,98 km(2) or 3,47%, paddy field areas are decreased to 122,33 km(2) or 8,84%, open areas are increased to 3,86 km(2) or 0,28%, shrub areas are increased to 37,68 km(2) or 2,72% and plantation areas are increased to 90,82 km(2) or 6,57%. Simulation results with daily rainfall plans on land use in 2001 and 2017 show that the peak discharge generated in 2001 was 68.8 m3/s, while in 2017, it was 103.9 m3/s. Peak discharge in 2017 is higher than in 2001. This simulation shows that the condition of land use in 2001 is better than in 2017.

AB  - The importance of monitoring soil properties is constantly increasing among researchers and policy-makers. In this context, it is imperative to identify cost effective and reliable strategies for soil mapping compared to the costlier traditional solutions. A wide range of tools are becoming available that enable better utilization of Earth Observation capabilities to monitor the soil ecosystem. This work is an effort of assessing the potential of Sentinel-2 imagery data for mapping Soil Organic Matter (SOM) contents and investigating the possibilities of its enhancement through ASTER derived information.The rural area around the lake Zazari, located in the Western Macedonia district of Greece, was chosen as study area. Initially, pixel-wise vegetation indices (NDVI and NBR2) were calculated, utilizing a local version of the CEOS Open Data Cube for masking Sentinel-2 bare soil pixels extending a three-year period (2017-2019). The generated mask was used to extract soil spectral signatures at the image level over selected 100 field samples. The resulting time series was expanded through the conjunction of ASTER Thermal InfraRed bands by matching the exact data acquisition dates of two platforms.The conclusive part of the work contains the application of regression modelling to effectively assess soil variables. The local Partial Least Square regression algorithm was chosen, due to its characteristics of performing inherently local predictions. Five-fold cross-validation technique was used for reporting the models' accuracy, which was assessed through R-2 coefficient, RPIQ ratio and RMSE. The model estimated SOM values among a synthetic bare soil composite image that was acquired over study area's agricultural fields. Two models were trained and compared; one over Sentinel-2 imagery bands that were used as the predictor variables' set and a second over an expanded predictor variables' set, including ASTER thermal bands. The results signified evidence of accuracy increase of SOM content assessment, through spaceborne imagery analysis.

AB  - High resolution satellite images are used to monitor environmental changes, map-making and military intelligence and forecast natural disasters. Nowadays, these contain spatial dissimilarities due to differences in their radiometry resolution, spectral characteristics and time delay from high resolution satellite sensors (multispectral and panchromatic). The use of pansharpened high spatial resolution images significantly increases the possibility of thematic recognition. Pansharpening is a technique that is used to combine the spatial details of a panchromatic image with the the several spectral bands of a lower resolution multispectral image. To date there have proposed a large number of fusion methods. However, most available methods are not effective for the latest very high resolution, such as WorldView-3 satellite imagery. Most methods for increasing spatial resolution lead to artifacts - objects that are not present in the original scene, but that appear in the resulting image. In this paper, we present the pansharpening technology of high resolution satellite images, using integration of bicubic interpolation, color system HSV and wavelet-transform. The aim of the proposed technology is to obtain the high resolution multispectral satellite image after the previous geometric correction of primary multispectral images and optimal wavelet decomposition into approximation and detail coefficients according to the chosen information value function linear forms. The proposed technology was verified by a number of different satellite data. The experimental evaluations are carried out on WorldView-3 images. Visual and quantitative analyses show that our presented technology can achieve high spectral and spatial quality and outperforms some existing pansharpening methods.

T2  - CASE REPORTS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A 68-year-old woman with a breast mass was referred to our hospital. Imaging studies showed an oval well-defined mass, 1.3 cm in size, in her left lower outer quadrant of the breast. Core needle biopsy with immunohistochemical staining showed atypical spindle cells forming solid nests with necrosis and papillary lesions, leading to the tentative and pre-operative diagnosis of invasive ductal carcinoma. Due to the absence of daughter nodules, extensive ductal spread, and lymphadenopathy on imaging evaluation, the patient underwent breast-conserving surgery and sentinel node biopsy, resulting in negative surgical margins and no lymph node involvement. Post-operative pathological examination showed triple negative atypical cells with squamous differentiation, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), with cystic parts and a small amount of low-grade adenosquamous cell carcinoma (LGASC), both encompassing the cystic parts in a contiguous fashion. No cases with synchronous SCC and LGASC in the breast have been reported to date. An etiologic correlation between SCC and LGASC should be further evaluated. (c) 2020 The Author(s). Published by S.

T2  - TOWN AND REGIONAL PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - There are many drivers of climate change. The urbanization process has been adjudged to be one of the major factors influencing spatial variation in land use and land cover change (LULC), land surface temperature (LST), land surface emissivity (LSE), increasing greenhouse gases emission, and climate change. This article uses a multispectral satellite remote sensing and survey-based approach to examine the nexus of LULC and LSE in the Ibadan city region, Nigeria. The spectral reflectance, the sun angle spectral radiance of the Landsat imageries (2000, 2010, 2018) was corrected and converted from digital number. The LULC, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Built-Up Index (NDBI), LSE and LST were obtained from the analysis of Landsat imageries. From the findings, temperature increase was identified as a peculiar environmental issue. Analysis of the Landsat imageries revealed that the NDVI value increased from 0.44 in 2000 to 0.47 in 2018. The NDBI values showed that built-up areas in the core of the urban areas have the highest NDBI values (0.023-0.602). The spatio-temporal trends of LST were related to the changes in LULC, and the built-up area had the highest LSE. The maximum LST (43 degrees C) was observed in the year 2018 at the core area of the city where building density was highest. The study suggests an application of cool pavements, green development, and urban forest regeneration for sustainable development.

TI  - An Artist in a Watershed Time: New Forms of Expressing Faith and Religiosity in Texts by Vaidotas Daunys
T2  - ACTA BALTICO-SLAVICA
M3  - Article
AB  - This article discusses Christian themes in the works of the Lithuanian poet, essayist, publisher and editor Vaidotas Daunys (1958-1995). Daunys belonged to the generation of Lithuanian writers born between 1947 and 1995, whose most intense creative period were the 1980s and 1990s - the dusk of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic, the activity of Sajudis (Reform Movement of Lithuania), and the beginning of systemic transition in the independent Republic of Lithuania. Still within the confines of the Soviet system, the ideological demands of the Communist Party of the USSR and the omnipotent censorship, a careful process began in Lithuanian literature of reconstructing severed bonds with its own national (including emigre) and Western European culture. The political breakthrough of 1990 resulted in a completely new political situation and sped up the existing cultural processes. An important position within Lithuanian culture was reclaimed by religion (mostly Catholicism), Christian tradition, and the closely related national and patriotic themes. The author analyses Vaidotas Duanys's most important works (poems as well as essays) against the backdrop of his biography but also as an expression of the Christian tradition and its shape at the turn of the 1990s. Vaidotas Daunys's creative biography places him among those who throughout the Soviet period balanced between the conformism of the socio-political status quo and a (naive?) faith in creative independence and the possibility to safeguard one's own worldview. Daunys was the editorin-chief of the Pergale [Victory] monthly (from 1987), the Veidai [Faces] almanac (1985-1988) and, starting from 1988, the Krantai [Shores] monthly. In 1985, he published his first book of poetry, entitled Metu laikai [The Four Seasons]; the next one, Kelio zenklai [Road Signs], appeared in 1999, after the poet's death. In independent Lithuania, he established the Regnum Foundation (whose fields of activity include publishing, music and culture) and reactivated the tradition of the inter-war cultural criticism magazine Naujoji Romuva [The New Romuva]. Vaidotas Daunys died tragically in the summer of 1995, while preparing to take flight at a balloon race.

AB  - In this paper we present an approach to image time series analysis in order to identify tillage areas as a part of early detection of cereal and crop cycles, over the Merguellil plain in central Tunisia. We used Sentinel-2 (S-2) data to calculate eight spectral indices: Normalized Difference Vegetation index (NDVI), Saturation Index (SI), Soil Color Index (CI), Form Index (FI), Redness Index (RI), Brightness Index (BI), Difference Tillage Index (NDTI) and Soil Tillage Index (STI). Principal component analysis (PCA) and indices time series analysis showed that only the difference of BI between the date D+1 and the date D "Delta(BI)" allows tillage detection. NDVI threshold (0.2) allows distinction between vegetation and bare or poorly covered soils. Spectral based tillage indices such as Brightness Index, the normalized difference tillage index and Normalized difference of Bands red and 2 discriminated tillage practices in March and May of 2018 over the Merguellil plain, with an overall accuracy of 92.3%. Sentinel2 data appears to be efficient and effective in classifying tillage practices over large areas.

AB  - The advertising discourse reveals both the features of originality and ethnocultural specificity of the worldview and the results of the influence of modern globalization processes. The formation of the Russian advertising discourse and its further development is largely determined by the historical and cultural factors of the global civilization process. In various periods of the socio-economic development of Russia, the domestic advertising discourse in all its diversity seemed to be "embedded" in the cultural and civilization matrix of the global advertising and information semiosis which significantly affected (and still affects) the semiotic and verbal nature of its formation. The article reveals the modifications of modern advertising discourse on all the levels of its formation under the circumstances of expanding globalization. In modern Russian advertising semiosis thus all aspects of social and civilizational evolution are presented: taking into account ethno-cultural specifics, the ability to psychologically and mentally correctly use linguistic, semiotic, manipulative and suggestive, cultural and many other factors of the national life of another ethnic group, another consumer country. Further research into the specifics of Russian advertising discourse will allow to determine all the mental-cognitive, semiotic, verbal, and ethno-cultural parameters of the advertising picture of the world of the 21st century.

TI  - Assessing local trends in indicators of ecosystem services with a time series of forest resource maps
T2  - SILVA FENNICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the 1990's, forest resource maps and small area estimates have been produced by combining national forest inventory (NFI) field plot data, optical satellite images and numerical map data using a non-parametric k-nearest neighbour method. In Finland, thematic maps of forest variables have been produced by the means of multi-source NFI (MS-NFI) for eight to ten times depending on the geographical area, but the resulting time series have not been systematically utilized. The objective of this study was to explore the possibilities of the time series for monitoring the key ecosystem condition indicators for forests. To this end, a contextual Mann-Kendall (CMK) test was applied to detect trends in time-series of two decades of thematic maps. The usefulness of the observed trends may depend both on the scale of the phenomena themselves and the uncertainties involved in the maps. Thus, several spatial scales were tested: the MS-NFI maps at 16 x 16 m(2) pixel size and units of 240 x 240 m(2), 1200 x 1200 m(2) and 12 000 x 12 000 m(2) aggregated from the MS-NFI map data. The CMK test detected areas of significant increasing trends of mean volume on both study sites and at various unit sizes except for the original thematic map pixel size. For other variables such as the mean volume of tree species groups, the proportion of broadleaved tree species and the stand age, significant trends were mostly found only for the largest unit size, 12000 x 12 000 m(2). The multiple testing corrections decreased the amount of significant p-values from the CMK test strongly. The study showed that significant trends can be detected enabling indicators of ecosystem services to be monitored from a time-series of satellite image-based thematic forest maps.

AB  - The article presents investigation of the possibility of drying coniferous forest areas detecting by multispectral satellite data in the visible and NIR spectral range with low spatial resolution, obtained by the imaging systems of three satellites - the Belarusian spacecraft (BS), Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2. A forest area in the south of Belarus was considered as a test site. High-resolution multispectral airborne data and, in part, ground measurements were used as reference ground data by which training samples were formed. Most of the known classical methods of supervised classification have been tested, the maximum likelihood method turned out to be the best for this task. In order to improve the accuracy of identifying the drying areas of coniferous forests on multispectral images, parametric transformations of images in the spectral space are proposed, which should lead to an increase in initial small spectral differences. The methodological issues of assessing the accuracy of the satellite images classification are considered using the result of the classification of airborne image with high spatial resolution as a ground truth image. The assessment of the classification accuracy, both visually and using the obtained confusion matrices, allows us to conclude that the images of the BS, Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 can be used to detect drying area of coniferous forests as well as the expediency of carrying out the proposed transformations of the original images.

AB  - In this paper, the authors present a robust methodology for multitemporal analyses of 'Ogosta' reservoir near Montana in Bulgaria, based on the processing of satellite images only with open-source data and software solutions. The 'Ogosta' reservoir was chosen as it is one of the largest man-made water body in the country and its wall is situated less than 600m away from the nearest neighbourhoods and the free water level of the reservoir is higher than the level of the city of Montana. Reservoir poses an enormous danger for the population of the region, especially after heavy snow melting. Thus, the authors decided to analyse the multitemporal development of the water surface. We chose open- source optical data from Sentinel-2. The extraction method was by computing the normalized difference water index and binarizing the images. Every binary image was later vectorized in order to created polygons with surface water data and calculate their area. The results were compared with a surface polygon of the reservoir.

AB  - Soil nutrient estimation can be used as a key input to increase crop yield and agriculture fertilization. Due to the shortage of the ground measured spectrum technology and costliness to obtain hyperspectral images, multispectral remote sensing data is used to explore the soil nutrient content estimation. In this paper, we have used optical remote sensing data (Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2), terrain/climate data (precipitation, radiation, slope etc.) and ground truth value to estimate four nutrients: N, K, P, and OC for two districts of Maharashtra, India. We compared four linear and non-linear regression models: multiple linear regression (MLR), random forest regression (RFR), support vector machine for regression (SVR) and gradient boosting (GB) for estimation of NPK and OC. Comparative results suggest that, GB and RFR performed better than other models with sMAPE in range of 0.125-0.377 for all nutrients, which is better or comparable with literature reported accuracy [1]. Therefore, the approach has potential to generate high resolution (< ha) soil nutrients map and can reduce soil sampling effort/cost.

T2  - ZHURNAL NOVAYA EKONOMICHESKAYA ASSOTSIATSIYA-JOURNAL OF THE NEW ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The article analyzes some directions of the evolution of scientific thought of the founder of the Austrian School C. Menger, which became the subject of discussions in the last decade. It is shown that it is wrong to tract changing of his definition of the "capital" as a principal reversal. It is just a different accent: on the one hand, capital is a homogeneous fund for generating future income, and on the other, it realized in the heterogeneous capital goods. Money as an organic institution by its origin is combined with the possibility of the state's influence on its improvement. Classical liberalism as a worldview basis of the theory does not contradict the performance of certain economic functions by the state. The introduction to the analysis of human associations as an uber-individual agent with their own needs and demands for goods, however, does not mean Menger's abandon of the methodological individualism. The main method is the content analysis of both well-known and less-known his works, including the second posthumous edition of "Grundsatze der Volkswirtschaftslehre".

T2  - TheScientificWorldJournal
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - An analysis of land cover changes (LCCs) was done in Image Forest Reserve (IFR) from August to October 2019. Free satellite images for 1990, 2004, and 2018 were downloaded from Landsat 5 (TM) and Landsat 8 (OLI) available through the USGS portal. Ground surveys were conducted using systematically set plots of 20m*40m to identify the existing land cover types and human illegal activities. Geographical coordinates for each of these plots were recorded using handheld GPS. We witnessed the changes of land cover types in the three decades. Forest had contracted, while shrubland and grassland and woodland had expanded within IFR. Between 1990 and 2004, woodland, bareland and rocky outcrops, shrubland, and grassland had consistently decreased though at a different rate of change, while forest has increased between the same assessment periods. The period of 2004-2018 has shown a consistent increase at different rates in woodland, bareland and rocky outcrops, shrubland, and grassland at a different rate of change, while forest has decreased between the same assessment periods. Further study is needed, bylaws and laws should be implemented, participatory forest management should be encouraged, beekeeping and ecotourism should be introduced, provision of regular education to the community by the Tanzania Forest Service (TFS) should be encouraged, and awareness creation should be made.

AB  - The National Democrats are enjoying increasing popularity among opponents of the regime in Russia. They have deep roots in Russian 19th century intellectual history. They combine positive ideas about democracy and market economy with ethnonational views. After overcoming antisemitism, the ideas nurtured by the supporters of this movement have become compatible with those of right-wing liberals. Elements of their worldview include an idealised image of the classical West, criticism of Russia's model of ethnic federalism, majoritarian democracy, criticism of Islam and migration. Their goal is democracy, but the demos to which they refer are only the ethnic Russians.

T2  - AEROSPACE RESEARCH IN BULGARIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the study was to compare in situ and remote sensing data, in order to assess the applicability of satellite images in water quality monitoring of floodplain lakes. Two indicators of trhophic status were compared: chlorophyll a and total suspended matter. Two lakes on Lower Danube floodplain were selected: Srebarna and Malak Preslavets. Data were obtained in july and august 2018. Sentinel 2 MSI L1c images were analyzed in SeNtinel Application Platform (SNAP), (v. 6.0). According to in situ data, Srebarna lake indicated status of eutrophy, while Malak Preslavets experienced hypertrophic conditions. Satellite data indicated eutrophic conditions for both lakes. Comparing the results from in situ and satellite data, chlorophyll a showed higher correlation (r = 0.66) and comparable results. On the other hand, significantly overestimation of suspended matter according to satellite data were found, as well weaker correlation (r = 0.57) between both methods. Remote sensing i.e. Sentinel products are emerging as a powerful tool in environmental observation. Although weather conditions could have significant impact on environmental dynamic especially in floodplain lakes, combining and comparing of different methods could improve the preciseness of the methodology as well as assessment reliability.

TI  - Dissent in the Soviet Society: Stages of Formation and Development (From the Mid-1950s to the Early 1990s)
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The article analyses the formation of dissent in the Soviet society in the mid-1950s - early 1990s. It aims to reveal the content, characteristic features and specificity of the protest outlook of the Soviet citizens during the Khrushchev Thaw, the Era of Stagnation and the Perestroika. The sources for writing the article are archival documents of the central and regional authorities, materials and memoirs of dissidents, scientific literature. The authors note that different ideological views were formed during the mentioned periods. During the Khrushchev Thaw, with a liberalisation of the political climate, dissent was shown in performances of individuals who believed in the democratisation of the country and freedom of speech, including in the ruling Communist Party. However, this phenomenon did not last long; it was stopped by a criminal law. Court cases in Tomsk Oblast show this tendency at the regional level. According to the authors, the Era of Stagnation was the time of the final conservation of the ideology of Marxism-Leninism. The promotion of the concept of developed socialism, which had nothing to do with real life, began. Part of the Soviet citizens, especially the scientific intellectuals, made attempts to create structures and organisations for protection of the national, religious, political, and economic rights. The formation of various worldview currents infringing on the interests of the ruling party and the authorities began. The result of the opposition was a complete defeat of all organisational structures of dissent in regions at the beginning of the 1980s. According to the authors, with the declaration of the perestorika policy, there formed an essentially new situation in society. The country's democratisation, publicity, freedom of speech promoted the emergence of many informal organisations of various worldview orientations. Various ideologies competed on how to modernise the state system of the country. The result of this competition was the overthrow of the ruling Communist Party and the coming to power of the new political forces which proclaimed the ideas of liberal economy and a constitutional state. Their methods of fight against ideological opponents in the early 1990s were similar to those of the communist party. In the conclusion of article, the authors argue that the solution of the most difficult external and internal problems, the guarantee of a certain stability and prospects for the country's further development are possible only by synthesising various worldview concepts that account for the needs of society and the state, by respecting the balance of interests of different social groups.

AB  - End-to-End Mission Performance Simulators for Earth Observation missions are one of the prominent tools for system design and scientific validation in early mission phases. The European Space Agency has promoted efforts to exploit synergies between activities and reduce engineering costs in mission planning. The main goal of the BIBLOS project is to provide a library of software units called "Building Blocks", or simply "Blocks". These blocks could then be integrated into modules, following the reference architecture developed in the frame of the ARCHEO-E2E project, in order to build an End-to-End Simulator in an efficient manner. The first stage of BIBLOS project, referred to as EOMODEL (or BIBLOS-1) and, focused on Passive Optical instruments, was successfully finished (in April 2016) with the geometry, scene generation and instrument modelling of optical imagers, which are one of the most frequent types of passive optical instrument on Earth Observation satellites.BIBLOS-2, which is the second stage of the BIBLOS project, is a currently finished activity with the purpose of expanding the BIBLOS library to include Passive Microwaves instruments and Active Microwaves instruments. Additionally, as part of a continuous improvement process, this second stage of BIBLOS has also updated some of the most computational performance intensive blocks for Passive Optical instruments with parallel implementation for Graphic Processing Units. For BIBLOS-2, the Sentinel-1 and MicroWave Imager (MWI) instruments have been selected to develop the building blocks for Active Microwaves and Passive Microwaves instruments respectively.During the BIBLOS-2 stage the full simulation chain has been developed for Passive Microwave, starting from the Geometry Module, through Scene Generation and Instrument Modules and ending at Level 1 Processing Module. For Active Microwave Instruments this stage of the BIBLOS activity is focused on the Geometry Module and the Performance Evaluation Module only. Special efforts are devoted to adapt the Geometry Module for monostatic, bistatic and multistatic missions in various configurations and with different a number of microwave instruments. In addition, the Performance Evaluation Module is in charge of evaluating the performance figures and providing plots, such as diamond diagram, ambiguity area and ratios, Noise Equivalent Sigma Zero and antenna radiation patterns.This paper presents the work successfully carried out during the BIBLOS-2 stage, currently performed by GMV under ESA contract.

AB  - United Nations in 2019 predicted by 2050, approximately 70% of humans will live in urban areas. The development without a proper plan can leading a treat to the environment and increasing the urban heat effect. The urban heat effect is where the condition the temperature in urban areas higher than rural. It becomes highly essential subject areas due to continues urban growth to fulfill the demand of the migration population from rural areas to urban areas. In general, prior work is limited to a subset of urban green space in mitigation of urban heat island. Hence, the effect of water bodies has not studied extensively, particularly in the tropical rainforest climate. Thus, understanding this is a key to uncover the origin of the influence land use/land cover in water bodies' effects on urban heat effect. For this study, the following critical data from Landsat 5 TM in the year 1988 and Landsat 8 TIR OLI. The first step this studied applied pre-processing, namely geometric correction, radiometric correction, and atmosphere correction. The second stage generates the land surface temperature (LST) for the year 1988 and 2019. The third stage performs 200 samplings, which 100 samplings to north and 100 to the south from Sarawak river. The measurement of LST takes from water bodies following next every 100 meters until it reached 1000 meters. The result did not demonstrate a direct correlation between distance water bodies and LST. The land use and land cover type of active influence on the LST pattern than the distance waterbody effect. However, the distance for water below 200 meters shows a strong relationship between LST. It notable that a close correlation exists between the LST distance of water bodies at this below 200 meters. The effect of the waterbody in reducing the LST at urban heat was active at a distance of 200 meters and below. There were clear benefits to be seen in the mitigation of urban heat islands. The theoretically should provide further interest to urban planners and policymakers to develop sustainable cities.

M3  - Data study
AB  - This datasets contains the satellite images used in this research article published in Remote Sensing (doi :10.3390/rs11212511). The images cover part of Leyte Island, the Philippines, before and after 2013 Typhoon Haiyan.Paper abstract:Natural disasters are projected to increase in number and severity, in part due to climatechange. At the same time a growing number of disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate changeadaptation measures are being implemented by governmental and non-governmental organizations,and substantial post-disaster donations are frequently pledged. At the same time there has beenincreasing demand for transparency and accountability, and thus evidence of those measures having apositive e_ect. We hypothesized that resilience-enhancing interventions should result in less damageduring a hazard event, or at least quicker recovery. In this study we assessed recovery over a 3 yearperiod of seven municipalities in the central Philippines devastated by Typhoon Haiyan in 2013. Weused very high resolution optical images (<1 m), and created detailed land cover and land use mapsfor four epochs before and after the event, using a machine learning approach with extreme gradientboosting. The spatially and temporally highly variable recovery maps were then statistically relatedto detailed questionnaire data acquired by DEval in 2012 and 2016, whose principal aim was to assessthe impact of a 10 year land-planning intervention program by the German agency for technicalcooperation (GIZ). The survey data allowed very detailed insights into DRR-related perspectives,motivations and drivers of the affected population. To some extent they also helped to overcomethe principal limitation of remote sensing, which can effectively describe but not explain the reasonsfor differential recovery. However, while a number of causal links between intervention parametersand reconstruction was found, the common notion that a resilient community should recover betterand more quickly could not be confirmed. The study also revealed a number of methodologicallimitations, such as the high cost for commercial image data not matching the spatially extensive butalso detailed scale of field evaluations, the remote sensing analysis likely overestimating damageand thus providing incorrect recovery metrics, and image data catalogues especially for more remotecommunities often being incomplete. Nevertheless, the study provides a valuable proof of conceptfor the synergies resulting from an integration of socio-economic survey data and remote sensingimagery for recovery assessment.

T2  - MSMR
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - This report primarily focuses on the data collected and analyzed from the worldwide network of sentinel military treatment facilities chosen to participate in the Department of Defense Global Respiratory Pathogen Surveillance (DoDGRS) program. Sites that participated in the 2018-2019 DoDGRS program submitted 24,320 respiratory specimens for diagnostic testing. Clinical results showed a total of 5,968 positive influenza cases. In the beginning of the season, starting in surveillance week 48, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was the predominant subtype. The predominant subtype switched to influenza A(H3N2) beginning in week 6 and continued through the end of the season. Influenza B virus detection was less common during the surveillance period (i.e., 1% of total submitted specimens and 5% of total influenza detected). In addition to routine surveillance, the DoDGRS program also conducts vaccine effectiveness (VE) studies twice per year to determine interim and end of season estimates. Overall, the adjusted end of season VE for all dependents regardless of influenza type was 30% (95% CI: 22%-38%).

AB  - The world of poetry in Ku Sang’s poetry is focused on revealing ethical metaphysical values rather than the artistry of poetic language, as the poet himself has often mentioned. In this text I looked at the ethical metaphysical landscape of the Ku Sang’s poetry of conception in three aspects. The first is a panentheism view, meaning that God and the world are existentially distinct and God transcends the world, but the world is existentially within God. In this regard, <Absolute Absence> shows ‘personal panentheism’, <The Reality of the Word> shows ‘part-whole panentheism’, and <Human who has no beginning or end> is related ‘relational panentheism’. The second is a work showing the eschatological history philosophy of Christianity, and several works such as <In the Winter Orchard> show hope and faith in the resurrection, and divine providence will achieve the ultimate completion of history, and all things will be restored in it. There are also works such as <Darkness of the Midday>, <A Rock>, and <An Old Tree> that reveal the belief that it is a thing. Also, in front of the time of eschatological judgment, works such as <As he goes alone> stand out and show his ethical subject. The third is the works of ethical worldview with Christian theological ethical awareness. It can be divided into three categories: self-reflective poetry confronting the subject, poetry contemplating harmony with others, and prophetic spirituality poetry warning and criticizing the moral corruption of society.

AB  - Globally, remotely sensed agricultural monitoring is impeded by cloudy conditions which render the acquired images useless. In semi-arid landscapes, rainfed croplands dominate agricultural production; thus, the majority of planting occurs in the rainy season, characterized by erratic cloud cover. The clear-sky pixels in partly-cloudy images can be used to increase the number of useful observations for quantitative analysis. This is achieved by cloud screening and atmospheric correction (AC) processes. However, the effectiveness of various AC approaches under partly-cloudy conditions is still unknown. Many studies validate surface reflectance (SR) under clear-sky conditions, with only a few focusing on the validation of SR under partly-cloudy conditions. This study sought to validate Sentinel-2 SR products derived from various AC approaches, i.e., MAJA, Sen2Cor, iCor, and FORCE, using in-situ spectral measurements. A partly-cloudy image with >60% cloud cover, acquired over a semi-arid agricultural landscape and +/- 3 days of the field measurements, was used as a test case. The results showed R-2 of <0.2 with in-situ SR in the VIS and SWIR, and R-2 of similar to 0.6 in the Red-edge and NIR regions, attributable to low aerosol scattering effect in the NIR. However, RMSE, MAE, and BIAS error metrics showed consistently higher errors across all AC approaches and crop types, with varying magnitude per spectral band. This finding can be attributed to the high presence of clouds in the image, which enhanced the apparent path radiance, causing an overestimation of the aerosol optical thickness, hence an underestimation of SR. The need for further validation of SR under various cloud conditions emanates from this study, to ascertain the utility of AC approaches under such conditions. Overall, the results have implications for the utility of remotely sensed images for agricultural crop monitoring in partly-cloudy conditions.

AB  - Mangrove ecosystem is a natural resource that can be beneficial for coastal community. One of its benefits is it can be utilized as an ecotourism spot such as Baros Mangrove Conservation Area in Kretek, Bantul. Hence, mangrove ecosystem must be conserved or expanded if possible. The first step to conserving mangrove ecosystem is to map its existing condition. UAV can be used to acquire a high-resolution imagery quickly. With modified near-infrared (NIR) sensor from a pocket camera can produce three band i.e. NIR, green, and blue that can be used to calculate several vegetation indices such as Simple Ration (SR), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Enhanced Difference Vegetation Index (ENDVI). Those bands and vegetation indices then used to map mangrove using Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis approach. The result indicated that high-resolution imagery from modified NIR camera sensor can be used to detect mangrove and distinguish it from other object using supervised classification. The digitally classified imagery then compared to manually digitized mangrove map to calculate the total error of the map.

TI  - Evaluation of open Digital Elevation Models: estimation of topographic indices relevant to erosion risk in the Wadi M'Goun watershed, Morocco
T2  - AIMS GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Various Global Digital Elevation Models (DEM) are available freely on the Web. The main objective of this work is to evaluate the latest digital elevation models towards the estimation of morphological and topographic erosion parameters in the Wadi M'Goun watershed. We have evaluated multiple DEMs: SRTM (3-arcsec resolution, 90 m), ASTER GDEM (1-arcsec resolution, 30 m), SRTMGL1 V003 (30 m), and ALOS-PALSAR (12.5 m). We have applied for this purpose open source GIS software. To compare and evaluate each DEM, different processing methods have been applied to estimate the Wadi M'Goun watershed characteristics, namely Hypsometry, topographic slope extraction, retrieval of Slope Length and Steepness factor (LS-factor) and topographic wetness index. The accuracy of the ALOS-PALSAR and SRTMGL1 V003 (30 m) DEMs met the requirements applying to the required morphometric parameters. DEMs vertical accuracy has been evaluated by applying the root mean square error (RMSE) metric to DEM elevations vs. actual heights of 353 sample points extracted from an accurate survey-based map (toposheet). The RMSE was 1718 mm for ALOS-PALSAR, 1736 for SRTM 1-arcsec, 1958 for ASTER GDEM 1-arcsec and, 3189 for SRTM 3-arcsec. These results indicate that best accuracy is achieved with the high-resolution of the ALOS PALSAR DEM. This study suggests potential uncertainties in the open-source DEMs, which should be taken into account when estimating topographical and morphometric parameters related to erosion risk in the Wadi M'Goun watershed.

TI  - SYNERGETIC USE OF THE SENTINEL-2, ASTER, AND LANDSAT-8 DATA FOR HYDROTHERMAL ALTERATION AND IRON OXIDE MINERALS MAPPING IN A MINE SCALE
T2  - ACTA GEODYNAMICA ET GEOMATERIALIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Many of the known Tertiary porphyry Cu deposits (PCDs) are situated in the Central Iranian Volcanic Belt (CIVB). The study area is located in the southern part of the CIVB and southern part of the Kerman Cenozoic magmatic arc. This research highlights the significance of the synergetic use of operational land imager aboard the Landsat-8 (OLI), Sentinel-2, and advanced space-borne thermal emission and reflection radiometer (ASTER) data for exploration of copper mineralization in a mine scale. Multispectral images in the visible and near infrared bands of (0.45-1.0 mu m) the OLI and Sentinel-2 were used to identify the gossan zones. ASTER short wave infrared (SWIR) data with the wavelength between 1.65 and 2.43 mu m were used for mapping hydrothermal alteration zones. Laboratory spectra obtained from minerals such as muscovite and illite (phyllic alteration), kaolinite and montmorillonite (argillic alteration), epidote and chlorite (propylitic alteration) were applied in mixture tuned matched filtering (MTMF) algorithm on the ASTER data to enhance the existence of these minerals. The spectra of the index minerals from each alteration type were used in this algorithm and the abundances of minerals in the MTMF image were rescaled to be within the ranges of 34-54 %, 54-74 % and 74-100 %. The studied mineralized zone is associated with the iron rich phyllic and argillic hydrothermal alteration types which can be best detected by using integrated ASTER, OLI, and Sentinel-2 images. The diamond drill cores data also indicate that copper is more enriched below the gossan zones. The gossan index minerals (GIM) including goethite, jarosite, and hematite were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) method, spectral analyses, and petrographic examinations. The Sentinel -2 data proved to provide remarkably better mapping result for iron oxide minerals than the OLI and ASTER data. The directed principal component analysis (DPCA) method, In the data of the Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 were used for mapping of the gossan index minerals such as goethite, jarosite and hematite and the argillic, phyllic and propylitic hydrothermal alteration types were enhanced using the MTMF methods. The hydrothermal alteration pattern and the distribution of the gossans in the study area show a porphyry-type mineralization. This study showed that the synergetic use of different satellite images with different spatial and spectral resolutions can be used for mineral exploration in a large scale. The use of laboratory spectra obtained from hydrothermal alteration minerals in MTMF method depicts that the alteration minerals were mapped more accurately relative to those MTMF images that are derived from standard spectral libraries. The samples collected from the surficial hydrothermal alteration zones as well as diamond drill cores showed that the copper mineralization occurres mainly along the border of the phyllic and argillic alteration zones, and the magnetite mineralization in the propylitic zone.

AB  - In order to understand the effect of pollution on the atmosphere over Ahmedabad city we have extracted two years (2017-18) of satellite and ground data. RF over Ahmedabad is determined by this data. For the satellite data, we used two different Radiative Transfer Model's (COART & SBDART) while for ground measurement we only used SBDART to estimate RF. COART results for MODIS indicates 6.24% increase RFATM in winter 2018 compared to 2017 that is very similar to SBDART results for MODIS. Ground measurements with SBDART indicates 46.89% increase in RFATM in winter 2018 compared to winter 2017. AOD observations from MODIS are smaller than the ground-based ones and that particularly the change from 2017 to 2018 is much smaller in MODIS than observed at the ground. The study presents comparison of RF using two different model approaches for winter 2017 & 2018. However, the study concludes that anthropogenic activities are resulting to RF.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Investigations of Dengue Fever in Pakistan Through an HL7 Based Public Health Framework for Hotspot Analysis
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The importance of a standard based interoperability framework is now widely recognized. In order to understand the challenges, feasibility and impact of outcomes of such architectures for public health improvement, it is important to implement and demonstrate the usefulness of data analytics based on pathway provided by the framework. This work provides an implementation details and results of transferring dengue data from source database to data analytical programs used by public health authorities. Dengue fever, a mosquito-borne disease that occurs in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, is considered to be a significant threat in both developing and the developed countries. This study investigates the spatio-temporal distribution of dengue in Pakistan from the years 2014-2017 and identify the most frequently affected hotspots of dengue across the the 3 provinces in the country using data mining, clustering and GIS based analysis of data. In addition, the identification of most vulnerable dengue locations has led to investigation into the potential environmental or geographical conditions that may have contributed to dengue prevalence in the area. These investigations present interesting results that shows positive correlation for temperature, humidity and population density with the dengue incidences. In addition, the results are able to identify disease hotspots over time windows that can be mapped to any spatio-temporal scales. The outcome of this research is crucial for optimal use of resources for combating dengue fever at a regional or national scale by identifying the hotspots. The hotspots identified can be use to create a sentinel surveillance network for a pandemic disease. In addition, the work serves as a useful reference for a comprehensive national level early warning and rapid disease outbreak detection framework for any disease of public health context.

TI  - Machine-Learning Algorithms for Mapping Debris-Covered Glaciers: The Hunza Basin Case Study
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Global warming is one of the main challenges of recent times. The glaciers are melting faster than expected which has resulted in global mean sea level rise and increased the risk of floods. The development of modern remote sensing technology has made it possible to obtain images more frequently than ever before. On the other side, the availability of high-performance computing hardware and processing techniques have made it possible to provide a cost-effective solution to monitor the temporal changes of glaciers at a large scale. In this study, supervised machine learning methods are investigated for automatic classification of glacier covers from multi-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery using texture, topographic, and spectral data. Three most commonly used supervised machine learning techniques were investigated: support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN) and random forest (RF). The proposed method was employed on the data obtained from Passu watershed in Hunza Basin located along the Hunza river in Pakistan. Three main classes were considered: glaciers, debris-covered glaciers and non-glaciated areas. The data was split into training (70%) and testing datasets (30%). Finally, an area-based accuracy assessment was performed by comparing the results obtained for each classifier with the reference data. Experiments showed that the results produced for all classifiers were highly accurate and visually more consistent with the depiction of glacier cover types. For all experiments, random forest performed the best (Kappa = 0.95, f-measure = 95.06%) on all three classes compared to ANN (Kappa = 0.92, f-measure = 92.05) and SVM (Kappa = 0.89, f-measure =91.86% on average). The high classification accuracy obtained to distinguished debris-covered glaciers using our approach will be useful to determine the actual available water resources which can be further helpful for hazard and water resource management.

TI  - Landsat based distribution mapping of high-altitude peatlands in Hindu Kush Himalayas - a case study of Broghil Valley, Pakistan
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the alpine regions of Hindu Kush, Himalayas and Karakorum, climatic and topographic conditions can support the formation of peat, important for the livelihood of the local communities, and ecological services alike. These peatlands are a source of fuel for the local community, habitat for nesting birds, and water regulation at source for rivers. Ground-based surveys of high-altitude peatlands are not only difficult, but also expensive and time consuming. Therefore, a method using cost-effective remote sensing technology is required. In this article we assessed the distribution and extent of high-altitude peatlands in a 2000 ha area of Broghil Valley using Landsat 8 data. The composite image was trained using a priori knowledge of the area, and classified into peatland and non-peatland land covers using a supervised decision tree algorithm. The Landsat-based classification map was compared with field data collected with a differential GPS. This comparison suggests 82% overall accuracy, which is fairly high for high altitude areas. The method was successfully applied and has the potential to be replicated for other areas in Pakistan and the high-altitude regions of the neighbouring Asian countries.

TI  - City-scale Modeling of Urban Heat Islands for Kolkata
T2  - CLIMATE CHANGE, HAZARDS AND ADAPTATION OPTIONS: HANDLING THE IMPACTS OF A CHANGING CLIMATE
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The Kolkata metropolitan area (KMA) is one of the sub-tropical urban environments experiencing swift and incessant urbanization process that has resulted in significant energetic differentiation in rural-urban domain as advection of heat wave and urban heat island (UHI) effect, it has to persuade on urban climate, biological environment and socio-economic atmosphere of urban society. The preparation of UHI susceptibility zonation is the preliminary measure for UHI risk assessment and hazard mitigation. The present study has been adopted the city-scale modeling of UHI by means of geographic information system (GIS) based statistical models for building the UHI susceptibility zonation using remote sensing (RS) data and other ancillary data. Initially, the UHI inventory map with 350 random pixels were extracted from mono-window algorithm (MWA) derived land surface temperature (LST) map using e-cognition approach. As such, UHI locations in LST map were then split into a ratio of 70/30 for building the UHI models and model validations. Finally, a spatial database of socio-economic, structural and radiative drivers with nine UHI conditioning factors has been prepared, including population distribution, land use and land cover (LULC), building material, building height, building roof type, building roof reflectance, building age, building association and road pavement and these database were extracted from multi-spectral scanning (MSS), thematic mapper-5 (TM-5) of Landsat images, Google Earth (GE) historical images and OpenStreetMap (OSM) with intensive rapid visual field survey (RVFS). The geospatial relationships between UHI inventory's pixels locations and nine conditioning thematic factors were recognized by using four GIS-based statistical models i.e. analytical hierarchy process (AHP), two-class kernel logistic regression (KLR), support vectors machines (SVM) and spatial multi-criteria evaluation (SMCE) model. These models were constructed based on of training dataset and model-derived results have been validated and compared with the area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, kappa index and five different statistical evaluationmeasures to corroborate the noteworthy differences on the overall performance. The results of goodness of fit are of 86, 87, 85 and 89% and corresponding prediction capabilities are of 81, 85, 82 and 87% for AHP, KLR, SVM and SMCE models respectively. The statistical measures show that the SMCE model gives up overall better performance and precise results than the AHP, KLR and SVM models. The KLR and AHP models have produced to some extent better results than the SVM model in provisions of positive spatial prediction values. Hence, the study revealed that SMCE and KLR are the promising physical data mining approach to be considered to map the spatiality of UHI susceptibility zonation.

TI  - Spatiotemporal change analysis of snow cover in response to climate (in-situ temperature) over the Upper Indus Basin, Pakistan
T2  - JOURNAL OF HIMALAYAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The hydrologiest are debating on the rise in global glacier melting. However, the situation in Karakoram glaciers seems not the same. Therefore, it is essential to measure the status of snow in the Karakoram region of (GB; Gilgit-Baltistan) Pakistan. To this end, the current study examines the dynamics of snow cover using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 8-days sow-cover in response to in-situ meteorological indicators from four high altitude automatic weather stations in Upper Indus Basin (UIB). The results conclude that the 8-days snow cover images not only show the qualities of MODIS (high resolution) images it's also characterized the high accuracies for snow-cover classification (-85 to 95 %). We analysed the snow-cover dynamics in the U113 and computed the maximum quantity of snow cover days (SCD) in a year that shadowed an increasing trend from 2000-2014, with an increase in snow-covered area (SCA) of 45.04% to 59.26% of the total land area of GB. Besides, there is a slightly decreasing trend observed in the SCA of Hindukush, and Himalayan mountains region in the last 15 years, due to increases in temperature and precipitation. Spearman's correlation analysis is also obtained between monthly and annually snow-cover changes (snow accumulation /depletion over six elevation zones above 2000 m elevation) and temperature. The month of January shows decreasing trends for five elevation zones out of six zones below 6000 m elevation. In spring, particularly in March shows a decreasing trend for two zones above 5000m elevations, while shows increasing trend in autumn for three zones above 4000 m elevation. A negative trend observed between monthly SCA and Khunjerab area (mean temperature and precipitation), and similar results are also noted for the remaining three regions such as Deosai, Naltar and Shandoor of UIB. The study suggests that, in the UIB region, climate change also employ a significant influence on regional SCA and days, as well as the distribution of snow-cover. These findings help for the forecasting of seasonal flow in the area and signifying snow-cover as a possible predictor of climate change.

TI  - ASSESSMENT OF SENTINEL-2-DERIVED VEGETATION INDICES FOR THE ESTIMATION OF ABOVE-GROUND BIOMASS/CARBON STOCK, TEMPORAL DEFORESTATION AND CARBON EMISSIONS ESTIMATION IN THE MOIST TEMPERATE FORESTS OF PAKISTAN
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In developing countries like Pakistan, leading CO2 emission source is deforestation of temperate forests, which must be estimated precisely for resilient climate policy. This research evaluates temporal deforestation, above and below ground carbon stock, biomass estimation potential of vegetation indices derived from Sentinel-2 imagery, carbon emission from deforestation and carbon sequestration potential. Forest inventory data was collected and used in allometric equations, to calculate aboveground biomass and carbon stock. The temporal deforestation rate was estimated using LANDSAT 7 & 8 (2000-2015) data. Biomass was predicted using the most optimal VI by developing linear regression model. The carbon emission from deforestation was estimated using activity data and emission factor. Above ground biomass and carbon stock estimated for the study area were 148.79 t/ha and 69.93 t/ha with mean CO2 equivalent value of 322.5 t/ha. The estimated forest cover change using Landsat satellite data (2000-2015) was about 16.88% with 2.51% annual deforestation rate. Relationship between red-edge VIs and AGB were the best and reduced saturation problem. Carbon loss in fifteen years were about 6.96 Mt CO2 e. The carbon sequestration capacity for the study area was 82.07 t/ha +/- 13 t/ha. This research methodology is cost effective, helps in sustainable forest management and reduces carbon losses.

TI  - On the Performance of Temporal Stacking and Vegetation Indices for Detection and Estimation of Tobacco Crop
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Machine learning in association with remote sensing has assisted agricultural specialists in monitoring, classification and yield estimation of crops. Tobacco is a major taxable crop of Pakistan, however the existing traditional methods for its monitoring and yield estimation are not only expensive and time consuming but also have limitations in terms of accuracy of collected data by a large number of diverse human surveyors. Due to the existence of such loopholes in the employed mechanism for tobacco crop monitoring and yield estimation, its illicit growth and distribution is on the rise. In this paper we have established a sophisticated machine learning mechanism for tobacco crop estimation using temporally stacked sentinel-2 satellite's data of Pakistan. Instead of the conventional approach of using single remotely sensed imagery for the target crop classification, we propose a machine learning based classification algorithm while keeping in view the phonological cycle of the target tobacco crop. Using the proposed mechanism, the temporal variations within the tobacco crop and its association with the variations of other vegetation is considered to improve the classification performance of the employed machine learning algorithm. Furthermore, the impact of stacking the vegetation indices derived from near infrared and vegetation red edge bands of sentinel-2 with the original sentinel-2 datasets, including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Index 45 (NDI45), on the classification performance of the machine learning mechanism is investigated. Ground Truth data for training of our Artificial Neural Networks classifier, was obtained using indigenously developed survey application "GEOSurvey". Experiments were conducted using our proposed mechanism while considering various input data setups - including single date imagery, temporally stacked datasets based on phonological cycle of tobacco crop and different combinations of NDVI and NDI45 stacking. Our proposed experimental setup consisting of temporally stacked imagery along with NDVI stacking results in the best classification performance of 95.81% with reference to the single date imagery stacked with NDVI and NDI45, with performance gain of 07.32%.

CL  - Roorkee, INDIA
AB  - The energy balance of a snowpack derives the production of snowmelt water. Proper budgeting of this energy driven processes is required for the efficient management ofwater resources. The study area is a part ofNorth-Western Himalayas, i.e. Manali sub-watershed (area = 350 km(2)), situated in the Himachal Pradesh state, India. The region experiences snowfall from December to February with January being the coldestmonth. Meteorological data and remotely sensed data from Landsat ETM+, IRS P-6 LISS-III andMODIS8-day snowcover data product of thewatershed has been used as input. For simulation of energy-exchange process and estimation of the amount of snowmelt generated, a physically based Utah Energy Balance model was used. The model performances were found good and an agreement between the observed and simulated values was obtained with few over- and under-predictions and the coefficient of determination being 0.718 at the Manali outlet.

TI  - Land cover mapping of the Mekong Delta to support natural resource management with multi-temporal Sentinel-1A synthetic aperture radar imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has great potential for land cover mapping, especially in tropical regions, where frequent cloud cover obstructs optical remote sensing. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the utility of Sentinel-1A SAR imagery for characterising land use and land cover (LULC) in Bac Lieu, a rapidly developing province of the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, to support natural resource management for land use planning and monitoring. Twenty-one SAR images acquired in 2016 were classified in a four-step process. Firstly, the SAR images were pre-processed to produce Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) texture images. Then, to reduce the effects of rainfall variation confounding the classification, the images were divided into two categories: dry season (Jan-April) and wet season (May-December) and three input image sets were produced: 1) a single-date composite image (two VV-VH bands), 2) a multi-temporal composite image (eight bands for dry season and sixteen bands for wet season) and 3) a multi-temporal and textural composite image (sixteen bands for dry season and thirty two bands for wet season). We then applied Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) classifiers to characterise urban, forest, aquaculture, and rice paddy field for the three input image sets. We tested a combination of input images and classification algorithms and found that no matter the classification algorithms used, multi-temporal images had a higher overall classification accuracy than single-date images and that differences between classification algorithms were minimal. The most accurate classification resulted from a combination of the SVM classifier and multi-temporal and textural input image sets from the dry and wet seasons; with an overall accuracy of 94.81% and Kappa coefficient of 0.92. Our land cover mapping showed that Bac Lieu province is dominated by shrimp farming and rice paddy fields, with natural coastal forested ecosystems only made up a small proportion of the province. The results demonstrated the potential use of SAR as an up-to-date complementary data source of land cover information for local authorities, to support their land use master plan and to monitor illegal land use changes. Long-term monitoring of land use in Bac Lieu province, as well as in the Mekong Delta, will be crucial for decision makers, to ensure sustainability and food security in this region.

TI  - Evaluation of MODIS Near-IR water vapor product over Iran using ground-based GPS measurements
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, water vapor as one of the most important greenhouse gases has played an essential role in many weather and climate processes, and it has been studied by various methods. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor installed on Aqua and Terra satellites is one of the existing remote sensing tools capable of producing Precipitable Water Vapor (PWV) products. In this research, one year of ground-based observation from a network of 38 GPS stations were utilized to evaluate the accuracy of MODIS Near Infrared (Near-IR) PWV over Iran. Initially, GPS PWV estimates at three radiosonde stations (OIFM, OIII and OIMB) were evaluated. Agreement of GPS-derived PWV with respective values obtained from radiosonde in terms of bias and RMSE were 1.5 mm and 3 mm respectively. After evaluation of GPS PWV estimations in the study area, MODIS Near-IR cloud free water vapor products at the location of GPS stations were extracted and evaluated. Times series comparison between MODIS and GPS showed that both methods agree very well with a correlation coefficient of 0.95. The mean bias and RMSE of differences between these two techniques (GPS and MODIS) during one year were obtained -2.2 mm and 3.4 mm respectively. The negative value of bias indicates that MODIS Near-IR in comparison with GPS overestimates PWV in this area. In addition, it was found that the bias values and the height of the stations have a linear relation. Therefore, a linear model as a function of height was obtained to calibrate MODIS Near-IR PWV products. Results showed that the calibration with the help of the presented model increases the efficiency of MODIS Near-IR water vapor data. The Amount of bias reduction after calibration of MODIS data was obtained 2 mm.

T2  - NOVYI FILOLOGICHESKII VESTNIK-NEW PHILOLOGICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The article examines literary lullabies by Kalmyk 20th - and 21st century poets in the aspect of folklore tradition and its transformation. Kalmyk literary lullabies have never been subject or object of any special research, and there is no published anthology. The paper introduces into scientific discourse 15 texts by 11 poets. The work reveals certain ties between literary lullabies and folklore ones in terms of plot patterns, dream fable, motifs, system of characters, structure, images and style. Poetics of titles in many poems manifests the genre archetype - 'The Cradle Song' (Kalm.), focuses on the addressee - 'To the Child' (Kalm.). The influence of the era can be traced in somewhat political contexts of literary lullabies of the 1930s - 1940s, and even 1960s, abundant in Soviet myths about the Big Family, archetypes of Father, Mother, and Hero. Evolution of the genre from public towards private aspects was communicating the idea of expected happy future for children in their Motherland, devoted labor for the latter's cause constituting the ideological basis of becoming a truly patriotic citizen. The human and natural worlds depicted manifest the ethnic worldview and beliefs. Literary lullabies involve elements of well-wishing yorals, spells, protective magic, counting-out rhymes, and used to maintain the Kalmyk versification tradition. Russian translations of some Kalmyk poetic lullabies to a certain extent agree with original texts, a few of them have been set to music.

TI  - A Variational Approach for Fusion of Panchromatic and Multispectral Images Using a New Spatial-Spectral Consistency Term
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we propose a variational approach for fusion of two coregistered high-resolution panchromatic (HRP) and low-resolution multispectral (LRM) images to reach the high-resolution multispectral (HRM) one, i.e., pan-sharpening. In this fusion technique, there is a tradeoff between structural information of an HRP image and spectral information of LRM one. To reconstruct the HRM image, which benefits from the best characteristics of both images, we consider several fidelity terms. The structural fidelity term is used to transfer structural information of an HRP image to HRM one, and a spectral fidelity term is utilized to preserve spectral consistency between HRM and LRM images throughout the fusion process. To reduce the spectral distortion occurred due to the discrepancy between intensity values of HRP and LRM images, a novel spatial-spectral fidelity term is designed to keep the intensity ratio between multispectral and panchromatic pixels in the high-resolution space as the same as the low-resolution space. Moreover, the total variation (TV) regularization term is employed as a prior to promote the sparseness of gradient in HRM bands. These fidelity terms were formulated in a convex optimization problem. However, the structural and TV terms made this optimization problem nondifferentiable. Therefore, we developed an efficient majorization-minimization algorithm for solving the optimization problem. The proposed method applied to three datasets, acquired by WorldView-3, Deimos-2, and QuickBird satellites. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed method, visual analysis, as well as quantitative comparison to various pan-sharpening methods, was carried out. The experimental results suggested that the proposed method outperformed the competitors visually and quantitatively.

TI  - The biological effects of chemical contaminants in the Arabian/Persian Gulf: A review
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - The Arabian Gulf is a shallow sea naturally exposed to extreme conditions of temperature and salinity due to its location, semi-enclosed nature, bathymetry and restricted circulation. Compared to open marine systems, the added stress imposed by pollutants is likely to have additional adverse consequences. Maintaining good marine environmental quality is crucial for several socio-economic reasons, one of the most important being that the region relies heavily on seawater as a source of freshwater through desalination. While regionally based marine monitoring programs employing chemical endpoints have been widely deployed, few have evaluated the potential biological effects of those contaminants detected. However, it is now widely recognized that an integrated approach using both chemical measurements and appropriate biological endpoints in key sentinel species is essential to the design and implementation of marine environmental programs. Here we present an exhaustive review of the studies published so far in the Gulf on the biological effects of chemical contaminants using different biological endpoints and suggest potential areas requiring additional research.

AB  - Several atmospheric phenomena often contaminate multispectral remote sensing images. Haze is one of the atmospheric phenomena that obscure the transparency of the scene. It affects the quality of an acquired satellite image. In this paper, we propose the dehazing method for Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. The correlation of the visible bands and infrared bands (narrow near-infrared (NIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) bands) are considered for constructing the linear combination formulas. The linear coefficients are determined by using the multiple linear regression of the haze free image samples. The results show that our proposed method can be used to remove the haze, both thin and thick haze, especially the haze in the smoking area.

AB  - The study examines the problem associated with the fact that features of dehumanization are largely manifested in modern society and in education. There is a loss of spiritual and moral values, a rejection of a worldview based on justice, a lack of attention and respect for a person is increasingly manifested, and his life and morality are being devalued. The leading role in forming the moral image of the younger generation should belong to the general educational organization, teachers and educators. In accordance with this, the goal of the study was set: to identify the level of humanization of pedagogical activity in modern sociocultural conditions. To achieve this goal, the following tasks were set and solved: on the basis of a comparative historical and pedagogical analysis of scientific literature, trace the genesis of the concept of "humanism"; characterize the humanistic foundations of modern education; consider conceptual approaches to the humanization of education; determine the pedagogical conditions for the practical implementation of the humanistic paradigm in the professional activities of university teachers, school teachers and educators. Based on the results of a survey of junior students and their inclusion in project activities to study the heritage of humanist teachers of the XIX-XX centuries, conclusions are drawn that the values of their future professional activities can be formed in the course of studying pedagogy. When carrying out educational projects that have a humanistic orientation, future teachers develop a humanistic consciousness, reorient from material values to spiritual ones, and the personality of the future teacher is humanized.

AB  - The availability of medium resolution satellite imagery (i.e. Sentinel-2A) provides the rapid, low-cost and more accurate mapping. This report presents the use of satellite imagery (Sentinel-2A) for mapping of marginal Agricultural Land in the eastern part of Situbondo Regency. The study area covers three (3) districts, i.e., Arjasa, Jangkar, and Asembagus. This study uses two methods of image classifications (i.e., unsupervised and supervised). Sentinel-2A images for dry seasons of 2018 use for this study. The dry season of this region usually occurs from April to November. Then, 450 ground control point for training areas collected during the fields surveys between June until Octobre 2019. This study also uses multi-band (i.e., 2,3,4,5 and 8A) of the sentinel 2a image. Image treatments use "Multispect" and SNAP, two open-source image processing software. The procedures include image enhancement, registration, clipping, and classification. The classification consists of preprocessing, processing and post-processing tasks. Then, classification results evaluated by confusion-matrix (overall and kappa accuracy). Furthermore, the thematic maps produce from both unsupervised and supervised classification are then compared to existing thematics maps and statistics data. The unsupervised method use iso-data algorithm and produce five (5) class of land uses, i.e., (1) forestry and plantation; (2) build-up area, (3) irrigated paddy field, (4) non-irrigated rural areas (ladang/tegalan). The unsupervised method did the overall accuracy = 79 % and kappa accuracy = 72%. The supervised methods use maximum-likelihood algorithms and produce six (6) class, i.e., (1) forestry - plantation; (2) urban or build area, (3) irrigated paddy field, (4) non-irrigated rural areas, (5) dry-marginal land and (6) water body. Supervised method provide overall accuracy = 95,8% and kappa accuracy = 93,2%. The result shows the potential use of Sentinel 2A to map dry-marginal agricultural land in the study area.

AB  - The article provides a practical example of the positive experience of the students of the medical academy in the international social project on combating arterial hypertension in order to improve the level of general competence and effective intellectual and professional socialization in getting higher medical education. The phenomenon of professional socialization should be considered along with the concepts of professional orientation, professional development, professional adaptation and professional becoming. Professional socialization is the ultimate link in the professional way of the individual. The algorithm of professional socialization of students in higher education consists of the following stages: professional orientation -> professional development -> professional adaptation -> professional becoming -> professional socialization. It should be noted that a personality who successfully socializes, has a well-defined social orientation, actively strives to self-determination and self-realization in society and is able of productive adaptation to the surrounding society on the basis of knowledge about social reality. In this case, the success of socialization is connected not only with the presence of specified qualities in the person, but, first of all, with the real actions in which these qualities are realized. By mastering the roles system, students acquire socially significant qualities, develop their worldview, their goals, motives, interests, feelings, personal and socially important needs, develop different types of competencies, including social competence, which will allow them to become what they want to become. Professional development of young talented individuals is possible only in open communication and interaction systems, it is in the international social projects of medical societies that constantly exchange energy and information with the environment, and at the same time, being a source of development and prospects for preserving the life of nation. Such a model of education supposes changing the role of teacher: the transition to joint actions with the student in new situations in an open, changing, modern world.

M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The presence of speckle noise in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images makes the images of low quality in terms of textural features and spatial resolution which are required for processing issues such as image classification and clustering. Already, there are many adaptive filters to remove noise in SAR images. ENVI software is a fully applicable tool for this purpose which has a good library including several filters in the classes of adaptive, orderstatistics and non-linear filters.Materials and Methods: In this study, the toolbox of ENVI is reviewed, analyzed and then numerically evaluated based on several single-band images along with multi-band polarimetric SAR (Pol-SAR) images achieved from SAR sensors such as TerraSAR-X. For evaluation, two metrics including Equivalent Number of Looks (ENL) and Edge Preservation Index (EPI) are used which show the ability of the filters in preserving jointly spatial/textural features based on general information and edges quality, respectively.Results: It is notable that both metrics illustrate that some classic filters are better in comparison to newer filters.Conclusion: The experiments can help us in selecting a better filter towards our aims. In this respect, attention to the results of commercial filters of ENVI software and their analysis can guide us to find the best case in order to process commercial data of SAR sensors in the applications of environmental monitoring, geo-science studies, industrial usages and so on.

AB  - We consider the rationale for the integration of remote sensing data and ground information using a statistical criterion to solve natural resources and environmental problems. The method is proposed to be implemented as the module of the "computer assistant". The algorithm that describes a set of the sequence of operations for automation of the decision-making procedure is presented. This algorithm should free the operator from a significant amount of subjective and labor-intensive work, which is performed using visual methods.Based on the proposed methodology, we perform the object recognition in aerospace images of the territory with different geological and landscape conditions and, respectively, with standard objects of different classes with different sets of values of informative features (of different nature and dimension). For the recognition and classification of images of studied objects, the probabilities of the ratios of informative features of the studied areas to ones of each standard object present in the aerospace image were determined.The results of testing the proposed methodology are presented on the examples of assessing oil and gas prospects in the areas of the Dnieper-Donetsk cavity and the problem of classifying crops of different varieties in different periods of vegetation in the agricultural fields in the Kyiv region.

TI  - A Hybrid Feature Method for Handling Redundant Features in a Sentinel-2 Multidate Image for Mapping Parthenium Weed
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multidate images provide additional spectral information valuable for mapping plant species. However, correlated or redundant variables created from multiple image data and a large set of variables impede accurate and efficient landscape classification. Nevertheless, with the implementation of an appropriate feature selection method, the full potential of multidate images and subsequent increased classification accuracies may be achieved. Feature selection is a process of automatically selecting features in a dataset that contribute the most to the prediction of a target variable. It improves the classification process in terms of computation cost and predictive accuracy. Feature selection algorithms are typically classified into three groups: filters, wrappers, and embedded. Due to the inherent tradeoffs provided by different feature selection approaches, we hypothesize that a hybrid approach could optimize landscape delineation by leveraging on their complementary strengths. In this regard, we propose a new feature selection method that combines a filter ReliefF, a wrapper Support vector machines-backward (SVM-b), and the embedded random forest in mapping the noxious Parthenium weed using a Sentinel-2 multidate image. The new approach was compared to its three constituents based on the size of optimal feature subsets and classification accuracies. To make comparison and assessment of developed models from selected variables more valuable, the split between training and test datasets was implemented in three different ratios, namely, 3:1(Dataset 1), 1:1(Dataset 2); 1:3 (Dataset 3). The new approach was also evaluated against the multidate image without feature selection and a single-date image. Results showed that the new approach yielded the highest overall accuracies with the smallest optimal feature subsets. For instance, on Dataset 3, the OA was 86.6% with 22 optimal features, whereas it was 84.7% with 35 optimal features using SVM-b, which was the second most performing feature selection algorithm. The new approach yielded higher classification accuracies than the multidate image without feature selection and the single-date image. The findings of this study under-score the capability of hybrid methods to select fewer features from multidate images, with higher predictive accuracies than individual feature selection methods.

AB  - The study area is located in Iran central zone and Urumieh-Dokhtar volcanoplutonic belt. Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) satellite data was used to identify alteration zones associated with Fe-Skarn mineralization in the Ravanj village, Markazi Province, Iran. Argillic, phyllic and propylitic alteration zones are typically associated with Fe-Skarn mineralization in the study area. In this research, the Selective Principal Component Analysis (SPCA) method was applied to VNIR + SWIR bands of ASTER remote sensing data. Bands 1, 4, 6 and 8 were designated for identification clay minerals. Bands 4, 5, and 6 were selected for argillic alteration mapping. Bands 1, 2, and 4 were used to identification iron oxides/hydroxide minerals. Bands 5, 6, and 7 were chosen to map phyllic alteration zones. Bands 7, 8, and 9 were nominated to specify propylitic alteration mapping. According to the eigenvector statistics calculated using SPCA for ASTER, inverse SPC4 image identified clay minerals and SPC2 images detected argillic alteration, oxides/hydroxide minerals, phyllic alteration and propylitic alteration. In this paper, SPCA technique is an appropriate method because of the distinction between alteartion minerals, vegetation for Fe-Skarn mineralization exploration.

TI  - Practicing land degradation neutrality (LDN) approach in the Shazand Watershed, Iran
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Neutralizing land degradation due to overexploitation of natural resources is an acceptable strategy under developing conditions. However, this important approach has not been adequately introduced and adopted in the world. The present study therefore aimed to calculate Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) for the Shazand Watershed with an area about 1740 km(2) located in central arid and semi-arid region of Iran. The LDN status was basically assessed using three indicators, viz. land use and land cover, soil organic carbon and land productivity using Land Cover/Use Changes (LUC), Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) and Net Primary Productivity (NPP) metrics for two sub-periods during 2000 to 2016. Towards this, 140 soil samples were then taken from the top 30-cm of the soil from homogeneous units representing an area >= 1-km(2) for four different main land uses including irrigated farms, rain fed farms, range lands, and orchards. Consequently, SOC and various soil properties such as sand, silt, clay, gravel, bulk density (BD), pH, electrical connectivity (EC), calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and nitrogen (N) were analyzed. NPP metric was also obtained using MODIS satellite images for three periods of 2000-2008, 2008-2016, and 2000-2016. The results of combination of study metrics indicated that net loss occurred in irrigated lands, rain fed lands, and range lands in the first eight-year period (2000-2008) and in contrary a balanced and stable situation in the second eight-year period (2008-2016). Overall, the LDN status in the Shazand Watershed was in a net loss situation during the period from 2000 to 2016 in irrigated lands, rain fed lands, and range lands covered areas of 12,290, 44,170 and 66,630 ha, respectively.

TI  - Sebaceous carcinoma: controversies and their evidence for clinical practice
T2  - ARCHIVES OF DERMATOLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Sebaceous carcinoma (SC) is a potentially aggressive malignancy of periocular or extraocular skin. It arises sporadically or is associated with Muir-Torre syndrome (MTS). Here, we review three controversial clinical conundra related to the diagnosis and treatment of SC and offer evidence-based recommendations. First, following a diagnosis of SC, deciding which patients to screen for MTS can be challenging. The Mayo MTS Risk Score is a clinical score that incorporates the key cutaneous findings in MTS but relies heavily on personal and family history that may not be available at the time of SC diagnosis, especially in young patients. Young patients, who have extraocular SC and are suspected to have MTS though do not meet criteria by Mayo MTS Risk Score, should have their tumors tested using immunohistochemistry for mismatch repair proteins. Second, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is used in periocular SC to evaluate nodal disease. Patient selection is critical for SLNB. Periocular SC stage >= T2c (by American Joint Commission on Cancer, 8th edition) may be considered for SLNB given positivity rates over fifteen percent in expert hands. Lastly, treatment of metastatic SC is an area of active investigation. When possible, tumor profiling may be used to select targeted agents. Future research into these three key questions is needed.

TI  - Use of MODIS EVI to map crop phenology, identify cropping systems, detect land use change and drought risk in Ethiopia - an application of Google Earth Engine
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Effective agricultural planning requires up-to-date and spatial crop phenology and land use (LU) data for time-critical and location-specific extension, inputs or emergency aid. Usually, this information is most sparse where most needed, (sub)tropical smallholder-dominated landscapes. Our study enhances planning methods for food-security and climate change adaptation in rain-fed smallholder agriculture of South Central Ethiopia. In a case study covering 10,500 km(2) and four agroecological zones, we developed a phenology-oriented approach for dynamic classification of cropping systems using Google Earth Engine. Complementary datasets of MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index were merged, increasing time resolution from 16 to 8 days. Derived pixel-and crop-specific seasonal time series at 250 m resolution reflected vegetation phenology. Random Forest was applied to classify agricultural LU types and cropping systems. Vegetation period onset, validated against farmers' sowing dates, was used to detect crop rotations and map drought risk for the years 2003-2018. Identified LU types were: single cropping (maize/haricot bean, wheat/barley), and double cropping (maize/other, maize/wheat). Overall accuracy for agricultural LU was 76-94%.We use open source data and online data processing. High temporal resolution phenology data allow identifying needs for agricultural inputs and emergency support "in real time", assess drought risk and monitor LU dynamics.

TI  - Molecular Dynamics Simulations Reveal Novel 12-Mer Peptide Derived From CPE30 of Clostridium Perfringens Targeting M Cell
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND ALLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Oral vaccine has been become the most effective strategy in the fight against intestinal infections because of its economy, ease, and capability on inducing responses not only systemic but also local, especially in mucosal compartments. The major obstruction to potent vaccine development is antigen dispersion and tolerance. To overcome this hindrance, we aimed to target M cells, which are the main sentinel gateway for taking up luminal antigens and initiating specific mucosal responses. In this study, 12-mer peptide (CPE12) derived from the C-terminal of 30 amino acids of Clostridium perfringens (CPE30) was predicted to be a good binder using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations. To confirm the interaction between CPE12 and M cell receptor, the coding gene for CPE12 was cloned and expressed, CPE12 was then purified, and evaluated ex vivo afterwards. As a result, ex vivo assessment on murine M cells demonstrated that CPE12 had lower binding on murine M cells surface comparing to CPE30. These present results suggest that CPE12 could be a competent candidate peptide for oral vaccine development.

TI  - Feasibility of ultrafast dynamic magnetic resonance imaging for the diagnosis of axillary lymph node metastasis: A case report
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - A 74 year old Japanese woman was diagnosed with invasive breast carcinoma. Her axillary lymph node was slightly swollen and had a short-axis diameter of 8 mm, but fine-needle aspiration did not lead to the diagnosis of metastasis. Subsequent 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography showed no abnormal accumulation on the lymph node. Ultrafast dynamic magnetic resonance imaging yielded a very fast contrast enhancement like that of the primary lesion based on which we suspected lymph node metastasis. To our knowledge, this is the first report that shows that ultrafast imaging has contributed to the diagnosis of axillary lymph node metastasis.

TI  - Instructing the Heavenly King: Joseph Edkins's Mission to Correct the Theology of Hong Xiuquan
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECCLESIASTICAL HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper examines Joseph Edkins's failed attempt to correct the theology of Hong Xiuquan during his trip to Nanjing in March and April 1861. Through his debates with individual rebels and his written exchange with Hong, Edkins learned that the Taipings were unwilling to accept 'orthodox' teachings and scriptural interpretations that conflicted with their established belief system. Challenging exclusionary and pathologising discourses, the paper shows that Hong's response to Edkins's efforts was rooted not in his 'irrational' modes of thinking, but in his desire to preserve both his revelation-based worldview and the personal authority that it legitimised.

TI  - Determination of nitrogen content of cotton plant leaves from RapidEye and PlanetScope satellite data
T2  - Mustafa Kemal University Journal of Agricultural Sciences
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims: The aim of this study was to determine the changes in nitrogen contents of cotton plant leaves by using satellite images, to estimate nitrogen status in the plant leaves with the help of satellite images, and to determine nitrogen fertilizer requirements in large cotton production areas by using satellite images in the future to make nitrogen application recommendations.Methods and Results: The experiment was carried out in randomized plot design with three replications in six different locations under Mardin province ecological conditions in Turkey. Data from four bands of PlanetScope and five bands of RapidEye satellites were used in the study. The correlation between leaf nitrogen content and reflectance of satellite bands was determined and regression (leaf nitrogen content-reflectance) and reverse regression (reflectance-leaf nitrogen content) analyses were performed. Significant correlation were found between leaf nitrogen content and RE_Blue (r=-0.58**), RE_Green (r=-0.46**), RE_Red (r=0.67**), PS_Blue (r=-0.54**), PS_Green (r=-0.43**), PS_Red (r=-0.42**).Conclusions: It is recommended to use RE Blue, RE_Green, RE Red, PS_Blue, PS_Green, PS_Red satellite bands for the estimation of cotton leaf nitrogen content.Significance and Impact of the Study: This study is of great importance in order to determine the need for nitrogen fertilizer usage in large cotton production areas. The study is important in terms of widespread impact and rapid results in large cotton production areas, especially considering the growing cotton cultivation areas in the GAP (South East Anatolia Project) region for optimum nitrogen fertilization in cotton production.

AB  - The Open Data Cube (ODC), created and facilitated by the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS), is an open source software architecture that supports analysis-ready satellite data packaged into "cubes" to minimize data preparation complexity and take advantage of modern computing for increased value and impact of Earth observation data. Since its inception in 2017, the ODC has fostered a community to develop, sustain and grow the technology and its applications. Such early success has resulted in bold goals for facilitating the implementation of country-level data cubes around the world to achieve a virtual global data cube through connected regional deployments. Advancements in the ODC infrastructure and its associated application algorithms along with a regional demonstration in Africa suggest this goal is achievable. In addition, there are also considerable advancements in the specification, production and use of Analysis Ready Data (ARD), which is the core element of any data cube deployment. Such advancements will optimize the value of ARD for global users by demonstrating increased access and use of diverse datasets, interoperability between datasets, and increased use of machine learning. This paper summarizes the past, present and future of the ODC and ARD initiatives.

M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose - This paper aims to explore and investigate the maintenance or (re)construction of (South) Korean identity during turbulent times of rapid social and economic change, especially since the 2008 financial crisis.Design/methodology/approach - This study explores how the Korean media responded to financial events over the period between 2008 and 2013, and the ways in which iconographies of yin-yang were incorporated into Korean financial magazine cover images were investigated. Semiotic analysis of 20 magazine front covers was performed based on adapted Barthesian semiotics, which included front-cover background color, text color and vowel-structure interpretation following yin-yang principles.Findings were validated through semi-structured interviews with designers employed by the magazines. Findings - Results show that Korean identity remains loyal to the traditional symbolic uses of yin-yang harmony to illustrate positive and negative sides of financial events, although there is some degree of following Western thinking in the use of symbols. This mirrors the modern Korean identity, which intertwines Western thinking with traditional values.Originality/value - This paper provides an extended evaluation of the articulation of yin-yang principles by Koreans as elements of a worldview combining both Confucian and Western values. Yin-yang provides an inflexion to the ways in which events are depicted and denoted in "Confucian capitalistic" Korea. The suggested methodology triangulating semiotic interpretation with verification through interviews with designers can be extrapolated in other studies investigating the representation of events within a specific population or society.

AB  - The Urban Heat Island (UHI) Effect has intensified due to urbanization and heat management at the urban level is treated as an important issue. Green space improvement projects and environmental policies are being implemented as a way to alleviate Urban Heat Islands. Several studies have been conducted to analyze the correlation between urban green areas and heat with linear regression models. However, linear regression models have limitations explaining the correlation between heat and the multitude of variables as heat is a result of a combination of non-linear factors. This study evaluated the Heat Island alleviating effects in Seoul during the summer by using a deep neural network model methodology, which has strengths in areas where it is difficult to analyze data with existing statistical analysis methods due to variable factors and a large amount of data. Wide-area data was acquired using Landsat 8. Seoul was divided into a grid (30m x 30m) and the heat island reduction variables were enter in each grid space to create a data structure that is needed for the construction of a deep neural network using ArcGIS 10.7 and Python3.7 with Keras. This deep neural network was used to analyze the correlation between land surface temperature and the variables. We confirmed that the deep neural network model has high explanatory accuracy. It was found that the cooling effect by NDVI was the greatest, and cooling effects due to the park size and green space proximity were also shown. Previous studies showed that the cooling effects related to park size was 2℃-3℃, and the proximity effect was found to lower the temperature 0.3℃-2.3℃. There is a possibility of overestimation of the results of previous studies. The results of this study can provide objective information for the justification and more effective formation of new urban green areas to alleviate the Urban Heat Island phenomenon in the future.

AB  - As the risk of landslide is recently increasing due to the typhoons and localized heavy rains, effective techniques for the landslide damage detection are required to support the establishment of the recovery planning. This study describes the analysis of landslide- damaged areas using ISODATA(Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique Algorithm) with Sentinel-2 image, regarding the case of Gokseong in August 7, 2020. A total of 4.75 ha of landslide-damaged areas was detected from the Sentinel-2 image using spectral characteristics of red, NIR(Near Infrared), and SWIR(Shortwave Infrared) bands. We made sure that the satellite remote sensing is an effective method to detect the landslide-damaged areas and support the establishment of the recovery planning, followed by the field surveys that require a lot of manpower and time. Also, this study can be used as a reference for the landslide management for the CAS500-1/2(Compact Advanced Satellite) scheduled to launch in 2021 and the Korean Medium Satellite for Agriculture and Forestry scheduled to launch in 2024.

AB  - The increased frequency and intensity of wildfires can cause damages to the ecosystem and the atmospheric environment. Rapid identification of the wildfire damages is also important for establishing forest restoration, budget planning, and human resources allocation. Because the wildfires need to be examined for vast areas, satellite remote sensing has been adopted as an effective method. Many studies for the detection of wildfires and the analysis of burn severity have been conducted using mid- and high-resolution images. However, they had difficulties in the sensitivity problem of NBR (Normalized Burn Ratio) for multi-temporal images. This paper describes the feasibility of the detection and classification of wildfire burn severity using Sentinel-2 images with K-means and ISODATA (Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Techniques Algorithm) methods for a case of the Andong fire in April 2020. The result can be a reference to the appropriate classification of large-scale wildfire severity and decision-making for forest restoration planning.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) observations are applied to marine fog (MF) detection in combination with Himawari-8 data based on the decision tree (DT) approach. Training and validation of the DT algorithm were conducted using match-ups between satellite observations and in situ visibility data for three Korean islands. Training using different sets of two satellite variables for fog and nonfog in 2016 finally results in an optimal algorithm that primarily uses the GOCI 412-nm Rayleigh-corrected reflectance (R-rc) and its spatial variability index. The algorithm suitably reflects the optical properties of fog by adopting lower R-rc and spatial variability levels, which results in a clear distinction from clouds. Then, cloud removal and fog edge detection in combination with Himawari-8 data enhance the performance of the algorithm, increasing the hit rate (HR) of 0.66 to 1.00 and slightly decreasing the false alarm rate (FAR) of 0.33 to 0.31 for the cloudless samples among the 2017 validation cases. Further evaluation of Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation data reveals the reliability of the GOCI MF algorithm under optically complex atmospheric conditions for classifying marine fog. Currently, the high-resolution (500 m) GOCI MF product is provided to decision-makers in governments and the public sector, which is beneficial to marine traffic management.

AB  - The Korea Professional Football League has a regional connection system, which influences sports tourism.Sport events provide economic benefit to communities that lack tourism resources or other regional development factors and attract tourists. Therefore, it is necessary to activate soccer stadiums’ usage and further lead the visitors to traveling the sites. Attractive tourist sites should be connected to the sport stadium and developed based on geographic locations. Therefore, it is important to analyze the location around a soccer stadium. The current study aimed to (1) analyze land cover, which is one of the geographical features around it, centered on regional soccer stadiums, (2) investigate residents’ leisure activities and identify tourism needs for leisure activities, and (3) examine whether each city has proper tourist attractions based on the land cover and residents’ desires for their leisure activities. In order to analyze the land cover by region, SVM(Support Vector Machine) was performed using the Sentinel-2 satellite image, which is a remote sensing data. The statistical data related to leisure activities were collected and used from the Korean Statistical Information Service. As the land cover around the soccer stadiums and the leisure activities desired by the local residents appeared differently in each city, this study suggested the development direction by differentiating each region in the development of tourist sites around the soccer stadium.

AB  - Recently the theme of exclusion became a hot issue in religious studies. This issue was an object of some New Testament studies by scholars. The question was whether or not a certain New Testament author held an exclusivist worldview. It has generally been believed that the Johannine worldview is exclusivist. Against the above scholarly position, in this paper I would like to argue that John does not hold the exclusivist worldview, either toward insiders or outsiders of the Johannine community. One of the most important factors in judging whether a certain author holds an exclusivist worldview or not, I propose, is his attitude towards his opponents or rivals in particular. Thus in this paper I take John’s attitudes towards his outsiders(opponents) and his insiders(rivals) reflected in the Gospel of John seriously. First, Is John exclusivistic against his opponents, namely “Jews” or “world”? Is the so-called Johanine dualism exclusivistic? Second, Is John against his rivals? Is John elitist? Is there any discrimination against a certain group of Jesus’ disciples? By analyzing Johannine opponents expressed in such words as “world” and “the Jews”, I try to show that John is not definitely exclusivistic against them. Further, by examining the “empty tomb” event in John 20:1-10, I attempt to show that the nature of the rivalry between Peter and the Beloved Disciple is not exclusivistic against each other. There is a subtle rivalry in it, through which the Fourth evangelist wants to show a constructive rivalry, which is not exclusive in nature. This paper shows that John is not excluvisitc against neither his opponents nor his rivals.

T2  - Journal of Preventive Veterinary Medicine

M3  - research-article
AB  - The distribution of wild boar (Sus scropa) in the Republic of Korea was forecasted using environmental factors. A species distribution model was applied with the standard normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), solar zenith angle (SUNZ), daytime land surface temperature (dTemp), and nighttime land surface temperature (nTemp). Understanding wild boar distribution is important for controlling African swine fever (ASF) because the disease could be endemic in wild boar or spread from wild boars to domestic pigs. Among the five predictors, the NDVI was the most influencing factor for the wild boar distribution. The relative contributions of the predictors were 67.4 for NDVI, 16.9 for dTemp, 10.5 for SUNZ, 4.4 for EVI, and 0.8 for nTemp. The area size under the receiver-operating curve of the receiver-operating characteristics for the current model was 0.62, but the real wild boar observation data overlapped with the predicted high-density wild boar distribution area. The wild boar distribution density was relatively higher in Gangwon-do, Gyeongsangbuk-do, Gyeongsangnam-do, and Jeollanam-do. Given the ASF epidemics, contact between ASF-infected animals and ASF-susceptible animals in high-density wild boar distribution areas should be prevented by long-range fencing or active surveillance.

AB  - This study is an attempt to propose ‘Religious Visual Literacy,’ and to establish its concept. To this end, it deals with the relationship between images and religions from prehistoric times to the Reformation.The discovery of Gobekli Tepe reveals that religious motives were deeply involved in the birth of images and that images provided an ontological worldview for the participants in the sacrifice.

In the period of the Reformation, three types of paths (Lutheranism, Calvinism, and secularization) being formed between images and Christianity, it researches them.As such, this study historically tracks the religious dimension that had been marginalized in the recent study of image and detects the deep layers and types of relationships between images and religions.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to clarify the correlation between Lee Kwangryeo's Five rules of reading Laozi and Lee Chungik's Chowon’s discourse of Laozi. There are some translations and papers on these, but there is no direct comparison and analysis of the correlation between the two. Lee Kwangryeo and Lee Chungik are both people of Kanghwa school who lived in Kanghwado, and are the same family members, teachers and disciples. Both of them sought a new worldview in Laozi that goes beyond Confucianism in the atmosphere of the times that denied heresy. Unlike before, it is the influence of the Five rules of reading Laozi that all Confucianism itself could be denied in the Chowon’s discourse of Laozi Lee Kwangryeo called Laozi a saint, and expressed Laozi as a scripture as well. The reason is to accept Laozi's idea that emphasizes reality and to escape from the ideology of Confucianism that emphasizes the cause. Lee Chung-ik commented on the whole of Laozi under this influence. Although Lee Chungik's Chowon’s discourse of Laozi has some differences in part, it is not completely out of Lee Kwangryeo's overall view. In this regard, the conclusion of this paper is that Five rules of reading Laozi and Chowon’s discourse of Laozi are closely connected and break away from the ideology of Neo-Confucianism of the ZhuXi school as well as Confucianism.

AB  - Background Lateral pelvic lymph node dissection (LPND) is a technically demanding procedure. Consequently, there is a possibility of incomplete dissection of lateral pelvic lymph nodes (LPNs). We aimed to identify metastatic LPNs intraoperatively in real-time under dual guidance of fluorescence imaging and 3D lymphovascular reconstruction, and then to remove them completely.Methods Rectal cancer patients who were scheduled to undergo LPND after preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) were prospectively enrolled. We traced changes in suspected metastatic LPNs during preoperative CRT and defined them as index LPNs on post-CRT imaging studies. For fluorescence imaging, indocyanine green (ICG) at a dose of 2.5 mg was injected transanally around the tumor before the operation. For 3D reconstruction images, each patient underwent preoperative axial CT scan with contrast (0.6 mm slice thickness). These images were then manipulated with OsiriX. Index LPNs and essential structures in the pelvic sidewall, such as the obturator nerve, were reconstructed with abdominal arteries from 3D volume rendering. All surgical procedures were performed via laparoscopic or robotic approach.Results From March to July 2017, ten rectal cancer patients underwent total mesorectal excision with LPND after preoperative CRT under dual image guidance. Bilateral LPND was performed in five patients. All index LPNs among ICG-bearing lymph nodes were clearly identified intraoperatively by matching with their corresponding 3D images. Pathologic LPN metastasis was confirmed in four patients (40.0%) and in five of the 15 dissected pelvic sidewalls (33.0%). All metastatic LPNs were identified among index LPNs. Four (80.0%) of the five metastatic LPNs were located in the internal iliac area.Conclusion Index LPNs among ICG-bearing lymph nodes in pelvic sidewall were clearly identified and completely removed by matching with their corresponding 3D reconstruction images. Further studies and long-term oncologic outcomes are required to determine the real impact of dual image guidance in LPND.

TI  - Fine-Scale Columnar and Surface NO<sub>x</sub> Concentrations over South Korea: Comparison of Surface Monitors, TROPOMI, CMAQ and CAPSS Inventory
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Fine-scale nitrogen oxide (NOx) concentrations over South Korea are examined using surface observations, satellite data and high-resolution model simulations based on the latest emission inventory. While accurate information on NOx emissions in South Korea is crucial to understanding regional air quality in the region, consensus on the validation of NOx emissions is lacking. We investigate the spatial and temporal variation in fine-scale NOx emission sources over South Korea. Surface observations and newly available fine-scale satellite data (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument; TROPOMI; 3.5 x 7 km(2)) are compared with the community multiscale air quality (CMAQ) model based on the clean air policy support system (CAPSS) 2016 emission inventory. The results show that the TROPOMI NO2 column densities agree well with the CMAQ simulations based on CAPSS emissions (e.g., R = 0.96 for June 2018). The surface observations, satellite data and model are consistent in terms of their spatial distribution, the overestimation over the Seoul Metropolitan Area and major point sources; however, the model tends to underestimate the surface concentrations during the cold season.

TI  - New Era of Air Quality Monitoring from Space: Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS)
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) is scheduled for launch in February 2020 to monitor air quality (AQ) at an unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution from a geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) for the first time. With the development of UV-visible spectrometers at sub-nm spectral resolution and sophisticated retrieval algorithms, estimates of the column amounts of atmospheric pollutants (O-3, NO2, SO2, HCHO, CHOCHO, and aerosols) can be obtained. To date, all the UV-visible satellite missions monitoring air quality have been in low Earth orbit (LEO), allowing one to two observations per day. With UV-visible instruments on GEO platforms, the diurnal variations of these pollutants can now be determined. Details of the GEMS mission are presented, including instrumentation, scientific algorithms, predicted performance, and applications for air quality forecasts through data assimilation. GEMS will be on board the Geostationary Korea Multi-Purpose Satellite 2 (GEO-KOMPSAT-2) satellite series, which also hosts the Advanced Meteorological Imager (AMI) and Geostationary Ocean Color Imager 2 (GOCI-2). These three instruments will provide synergistic science products to better understand air quality, meteorology, the long-range transport of air pollutants, emission source distributions, and chemical processes. Faster sampling rates at higher spatial resolution will increase the probability of finding cloud-free pixels, leading to more observations of aerosols and trace gases than is possible from LEO. GEMS will be joined by NASA's Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution (TEMPO) and ESA's Sentinel-4 to form a GEO AQ satellite constellation in early 2020s, coordinated by the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS).

AB  - The purpose of this study is to examine the background of the emergence of the “Five Major Ideological Education” presented after there was a change in ideological education, and Kim Jong-un seized power in North Korea and to analyze its significance. Ideological education is an education of teaching worldview or morality, which is provided in a form closely combined with practical activities. Since North Korea has traditionally attached more importance to the intellectuals’ thinking than to professionalism, it has considered ideological education one of the important educational activities. In Kim Jong-un's regime, the importance of this ideological education is still emphasized. The difference from the previous period is that the emphasis has been changed, as it designated the “Five Major Ideological Education”` including Greatness Education, Kim Jong Il Patriotism Education, Belief Cultivation, Anti-imperialist Class Education, and Moral Education. It is hard to see the “Five Major Ideological Education” as just the designation of core ideological education. The characteristics of the Kim Jong-un regime’s “Five Major Ideological Education” are that it gradually carries out the ideological educational activities related to real life, emphasizing everydayness, reality, and practicality. This change in the ideological education reflects the changes of the leader and younger generations of North Korea, but the foundation of its ideological education is its authorities’ realistic prescription for maintaining the regime.

AB  - Cities are highly susceptible to disasters due to concentration of population and infrastructure and intensive land use, and there are various factors that affect vulnerability according to regional characteristics. This study analyzed the vulnerability of the heat wave and the surface temperature extracted from Landsat 8 satellite data. Areas with high surface temperature and with high vulnerability did not match. This study overlaid the results of vulnerability analysis and the land surface temperature(LST) in order to identify causes of vulnerability. The results showed that some areas within high-density commercial and semi-residential areas were the most vulnerable, with climate exposure factors, the ratio of the vulnerable populations and residential defective areas being the main causes. Accordingly, alternatives such as green space and residential environmental improvement could be suggested. Various policies for reducing and adapting to heat wave have been established and implemented. However, it is necessary to examine the regional and spatial characteristics of the city, to accurately diagnose the cause of the heat wave, and to prepare appropriate long-term alternatives accordingly.

AB  - This paper analyzed dramas written by Lee Gang-baek in the 1970s using the concept of ‘dramatist’, meta-dramatical technique. His drama Works were F ive, Three, Egg, W atchma n, N ae - ma, C haos a n d Order i n the museum, G ae - P pul ( dog’s hor n) . Dramaist in Lee Gang-baek’s 1970s drama works could be categorized into three types The first type of dramatist showed a philosophical perception based on self-consciousness with the ‘Theatrum mudi’. ‘Ra’ in F ive , ‘Da’ in Three , ‘Nae-ma’ in N ae - ma were the types. They developed self-consciousness by repeatedly experiencing the same situation and realized the limits and tragedies of human beings. The works of this type of dramatist were covered in a political drama, but they essentially dealt with human beings and internal reflection. The second type of dramatists confronted another dramatist in the drama. Citizen ‘Ra’ in Egg , ‘Da’ in W atchma n were the types. They had skepticism of the power and tried to uncover the world's darkness, but eventually fell into a victim. It was because these works were reflecting the era in which individuals with convictions inevitably lost their against with the world, and in this respect, their defeat was already scheduled. The last type of dramatists led the crowd to change. ‘Sun-u’ in C haos a n d Order i n the museum , ‘He’ in G ae - P pul were the types. They seemed to have been defeated by the world on the surface, but through the defeat and sacrifice, they changed the crowd and further led to the victory of the people. It was at this point that it was throwing a strong social message as a political drama. The characters who led the drama in Lee Gang-baek’s drama showed various aspects as a dramatist, from a philosophical investigator, an accuser of the world, to a savior of the people. This could be said to be the result of the philosophical consideration of the human existence of the playwright Lee Gang-baek, the problem consciousness of the times and society, and his worldview as a playwright.

T2  - THE JOURNAL OF KOREAN PHILOSOPHICAL HISTORY

AB  - This paper reviews Confucianism, which appeared in various myths in ancient Chinese, centering on sage and sage-king concept. "Sage" meant the special ability to listen to God's voice and interact with God, and the vital value of human communication was cut off, so that humans no longer needed the power of sage. One of the important changes lies in the formation of the value of Confucianism. In Confucianism, a current and ideal view of politics was formed to achieve the realization of politics through moral completion. In the process, the ancient king with the ability of Sage was gradually divided into two separate attitudes and capacities: sage and king. In other words, the idea of a completed human being who realizes moral values and a king who must implement the right politics of giving grace to the people based on virtue is leading to an inner and outer king, or stage-king. On the other hand, however, the characteristics of the Shamans tradition still exist and have mutual bargaining points. If human beings still have a worldview of interacting with God, the meaning of special ability, which is the original meaning of Sage, also remains. There are also those who still possess such abilities. Especially in 『Classic of Mountains and Seas』, the descendants of Shamans appear in the communication between heaven and earth. These are those who give the human world the benefit of extending life through communication with Heaven, even though they do not have the status of the world. The myths of Han dynasty can be seen not by controlling and suppressing the people, but by guiding them to a better life, as shown by the later changes in the myth of XiWangMu(西王母) and Wu. This is a duty due to be fulfilled by the Holy King of Confucianism, a completed personality and ideal leader, and such aspirations are naturally reenacted by people in Han dynastic mythology. Thus, mythology tends to seek infinite life to overcome the pain of reality, but above all, it reflects the present-oriented value of Confucianism, expressing the desire to improve not only the present but also the present-day life.

TI  - Factors affecting the negative predictive value of positron emission tomography/computed tomography for axillary lymph node staging in breast cancer patients
T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/Objective: Axillary lymph node staging (ALNS) is an important step in the treatment of breast cancer and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a standard procedure for ALNS. Recently, the use of positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) for whole body staging in patients with breast cancer has been increasing. The negative predictive value (NPV) of the specific diagnostic modality is the crucial value for excluding axillary lymph node metastasis (ALNM) and guiding the decision not to proceed with axillary lymph node dissection. The aim of this study was to identify patient groups in which PET/CT yields a high NPV for ALNS.Methods: We reviewed data from the records of 262 patients with breast cancer who underwent PET/CT before surgery between February 2009 and March 2018. We searched for factors associated with pathological axillary lymph node metastasis in patients with negative ALNM on PET/CT. Then, we calculated the NPV of PET/CT for ALNS in the patient group without the identified factors and in all patients.Results: Age >= 75 years and tumor size on ultrasonography (US) >= 15 mm were the associated factors; the NPV of PET/CT in patients without these factors compared to all patients was 97.2% versus 88.7%.Conclusion: The NPV of PET/CT for ALNS in patients younger than 75 years and with tumor size on US < 15 mm is higher than that in all patients and comparable to the NPV of SLNB reported in previous studies (90.1-97.0%).

AB  - Recently, ultra-dense low earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellation over high-frequency bands has considered as one of promising solutions to supply coverage all over the world. Given satellite constellations, efficient beam coverage schemes should be employed at satellites to provide seamless services and full-view coverage. In LEO systems, hybrid wide and spot beam coverage schemes are generally used, where the LEO provides a wide beam for large area coverage and additional several steering spot beams for high speed data access. In this given setting, scheduling multiple spot beams is essentially required. In order to achieve this goal, Vickery-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auction-based trustful algorithm is proposed in this paper for scheduling multiple spot beams for more efficient seamless services and full-view coverage.

AB  - As remote sensing technologies are evolving, and more satellites are orbited, the demand for using satellite data for disaster monitoring is rapidly increasing. Although natural and social disasters have been monitored using satellite data, constraints on establishing an integrated satellite-based near real-time disaster monitoring system have not been identified yet, and thus a novel framework for establishing such system remains to be presented. This research identifies constraints on establishing satellite data-based near real-time disaster monitoring systems by devising and testing a new conceptual framework of disaster monitoring, and then presents a feasible disaster monitoring system that relies mainly on acquirable satellite data. Implementing near real-time disaster monitoring by satellite remote sensing is constrained by technological and economic factors, and more significantly, it is also limited by interactions between organisations and policy that hamper timely acquiring appropriate satellite data for the purpose, and institutional factors that are related to satellite data analyses. Such constraints could be eased by employing an integrated computing platform, such as Amazon Web Services(AWS), which enables obtaining, storing and analysing satellite data, and by developing a toolkit by which appropriate satellites’sensors that are required for monitoring specific types of disaster, and their orbits, can be analysed. It is anticipated that the findings of this research could be used as meaningful reference when trying to establishing a satellite-based near real-time disaster monitoring system in any country.

AB  - Recently, a lot of damages have been caused by urban flooding, and heavy rainfall that temporarily occur are the main causes of these phenomenons. The damages caused by urban flooding are identified as the change in the water balance in urban areas. To indirectly identify it, this research analyzed the change in the remote sensing indices on each land cover before and after heavy rainfall by utilizing daily precipitation data and multi-temporal Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Cases of heavy rain advisory and warning were selected based on the daily precipitation data. And statistical fluctuation were compared by acquiring Sentinel-2 satellite images during the corresponding period and producing them as NDVI, NDWI and NDMI images about each land cover with a radius of 1,000 m based on the Seoul Weather Station. As a result of analyzing the maximum value, minimum value, mean and fluctuation of the pixels that were calculated in each remote sensing index image, there was no significant changes in the remote sensing indices in urban areas before and after heavy rainfall.

TI  - Dust Lidar Ratios Retrieved from the CALIOP Measurements Using the MODIS AOD as a Constraint
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lidar ratio for dust aerosols is retrieved from a synergetic use of the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) Total Attenuated Backscatter coefficients and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aerosol Optical Depths (AODs) for 5 years from 2007 to 2011. MODIS AODs from the Dark Target (DT) algorithm over ocean and from the Deep Blue (DB) algorithm over land are used as a constraint for the retrieval. The dust lidar ratio is retrieved larger over land (46.6 +/- 36.3 sr) than ocean (39.5 +/- 16.8 sr) and shows distinct regional variation. Lidar ratio for Saharan dust (49.5 +/- 36.8 sr) is larger than Arabian dust (42.5 +/- 26.2 sr). Lidar ratios for dust aerosols transported to Mediterranean Sea (44.4 +/- 15.9 sr), Mid Atlantic (40.3 +/- 12.4 sr), and Arabian Sea (37.5 +/- 12.1 sr) show lower values relative to their source regions. Retrieved dust lidar ratios for Taklamakan and Gobi Deserts region (35.0 +/- 31.1 sr) and Australia (35.4 +/- 34.4 sr) are slightly lower than the above-mentioned regions. AOD comparison between CALIOP and MODIS shows that the CALIOP AOD is biased low. When including clear air AOD for CALIOP, however, AODs from two sensors become more comparable.

AB  - This study examines two flu epidemics in Asia: Asian flu of 1957 and Hong Kong flu of 1968 to understand how the global influenza surveillance system developed in East Asia during the Cold War. They are also known as pandemics which, ten-year apart, swept the whole globe due to the antigenic shift of Influenza A viruses. The first outbreak of both flu cases is considered to be started in mainland China, however, unfortunately this information did not reach the rest of the world until the epidemic had spread over several countries; and Hong Kong has been the first place where the outbreak was detected. Because of Hong Kong’s special position to the PRC and the UK, it played a crucial role in not only spreading these new viruses to the free world but also making Influenza surveillance more systemic at both global and regional levels. After an introduction, Chapter 2 discusses political and economic functions of colonial Hong Kong in the Cold War, which played a role in exporting not only the flu virus but also the epidemic intelligence from HK to the world. Chapter 3 and 4 examine how flu surveillance system developed and operated in ‘Far East’ during the Cold War, focusing on Asian flu and Hong Kong Flu, in 1957 and 1968 respectively. These chapters unfold both official and unofficial networks of WHO in East Asia, which provided a central role in adopting and implementing the global surveillance system. Chapter 4 also highlights the relationship between two flu epidemics, which reinforced colonial Hong kong as a sentinel post for Influenza.

AB  - The biggest issue in the South and North Korean art community, immediately after independence in 1945, was to purge the entire Korea of the remnants of the Japanese rule and create new national art. Once the government was established in 1948, North Korea restored its national cultural heritage, which was damaged by Japan, and formed a new art history aligned with the socialist ideology and the North Korean regime. The artists who defected to North Korea laid the foundation for descriptions of the art history in the 1950s and 1960s, the formative period of early North Korean art, and thus played a key role in the discourse of North Korean art thereafter. Ideology had a huge influence on the convictions and perspectives the artists had about art, and their artistic activities were reflected in their descriptions of art history.The most important thing in the art history of North Korea is its tradition of socialist realism that reflects reality. The tradition is the most important source of development of art, and it has reflected the sentiments and aesthetic consciousness of the people based on the historical materialism of Marxism–Leninism. The artists who defected to North Korea highly appreciated the progressive achievements in the mural paintings and crafts of the Goguryeo dynasty, the ceramics of the Goryeo dynasty, and the paintings of the Joseon dynasty. They, however, criticized the Buddhist art in that it only reflected the worldview of a certain class, namely the Buddhist clergy who were considered as the aristocracy during the Goryeo dynasty, which resulted in the degeneration of Buddhist art. At the same time, the Buddhist art was regarded as a reflection of the “people’s character” and “ethnic form” of socialist realism and expanded the view of art history by encompassing it within the category of national art.

Methods: Analysis was done for 2018 patient safety report data’published in 2019. In 2018, 9,250 patient safety incidents were reported, and for this study data (3,757) from hospitals with more than 500 beds were analyzed. SPSS 25.0 was used for the crosstabulation analysis and multinominal logistic regression. Results: There were no factors affecting the sentinel event. The main factors of adverse events were age, patient room, treatment room, day duty of nurses, falls, transfusions, and medication. Conclusion: In order to prevent patient safety incidents, elderly patients should receive verbal and nonverbal communication that will help them understand the complexity of the disease. Finding ways to reduce nurse overtime and reduce human error by computerizing patient monitoring systems, fall prevention activities, and patient safety regulations and procedures are necessary.

AB  - Understanding Japanese worldview and their way of thinking appropriately will enable us to communicate the gospel with them effectively through the way they understand. The Japanese worldview seems to be quite different from other East Asian countries, including China and Korea. The Japanese are basically people who abhor having a sense of shame, and if they concentrated on the ministry without recognizing unique Japanese worldview and her culture, the fruits of Japanese missionary work would be inevitably scarce. As for Japan, which is geographically close but can never be intimate with Korea, which is a country that had been exploited by Japanese imperialism in the past, have the tendency to avoid a great devotion to do Japanese mission, differently from God’s intention. Above all it is necessary to understand Japanese mission from the standpoint of reformed life theology and critical contextualization.Simultaneously we agree that Japanese imperialistic aggression and anti-humanitarian behavior is also considerably connected to their worldview and culture. Concerning Japanese Samurai, to pollute his/her honor is more disgraceful than to die. At the same time Japanese people do not betray their communitarian ethics, including ‘Sekendei’, which pay attention to how other people judge an individual and consider communities’ decision-making all the time. This culture originates from ‘Wa’ thought Japanese people pursue, Confucian value of harmony, and their relationship. Above all Japanese culture is deftly connected with Japanese Shintoism, which calls for its transformation into a biblical worldview.

TI  - Application of satellite remote sensing in monitoring dissolved oxygen variabilities: A case study for coastal waters in Korea
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Dissolved oxygen (DO) is one of the critical parameters representing water quality in coastal environments. However, it is labor- and cost-intensive to maintain monitoring systems of DO since in situ measurements of DO are needed in high spatial and temporal resolution to establish proper management plans of coastal regions. In this study, we applied statistical analyses between long-term monitoring datasets and satellite remote sensing datasets in the eastern coastal region of the Yellow Sea. Pearson correlation analysis of long-term water quality monitoring datasets shows that water temperature and DO are highly correlated. Stepwise multiple regression analysis among DO and satellite-derived environmental variables shows that the in situ DO can be estimated by the combination of the present sea surface temperature (SST), the chlorophyll-a, and the SST in the month prior. The high skill score of our proposed model to derive DO is validated by two error measures, the Absolute Relative Error, 1-ARE (89.2%), and Index of Agreement, IOA (78.6%). By applying the developed model to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) products, spatial and temporal changes in satellite-derived DO can be observed in Saemangeum offshore in the Yellow Sea. The analysis results show that there is a significant decrease in estimated DO between summer of 2003 versus 2012 indicating summer coastal deoxygenation due probably to the Saemangeum reclamation. This study shows the potential capability of satellite remote sensing in monitoring in situ DO in both high temporal and spatial resolution, which will be beneficial for effective and efficient management of coastal environments.

AB  - This article analyzes how the Ayllu’s social and economic systems were viewed from the perspective of the Andeans during the Incan empire. Specifically, this paper looks at how reciprocity and dualism were the founding principles which affected the establishment of all social and economic structures existing at the time, from systems ranging from labor organization all the way to the conceptualization of land ownership. From its inception, the Ayllu’s social and economic structures were based on Andean worldview and cultural values, particularly the social collective values of dualism and reciprocity. Firstly, the concept of Andean dualism and reciprocity are particularly reflected in the Ayllu’s organization of class structure. Kurakas, Ayllu’s nobility, and Jatunrunas, Allyu’s term for common people, cooperated with each other and significantly relied on each other in order to maintain an orderly and peaceful existence. Secondly, within the Allyu’s conceptualism of labor organization, the idea of communality, based on the promise of reciprocity, was the underlying social agreement which legitimized the Allyu’s land-holding, which was considering the most significant kind of property. In contrast, the Andean indigenous people believed that nature could not become personal property, and rather that human beings and nature should coexist in harmony. In reality, Andean people valued mutual cooperation and respect amongst themselves, but the transactions occurring within the Ayllu’s economy were based on realistic needs, which eventually led to instances of control, revenge, use of force, and high competition. I insist that we should avoid idealize the Ayllu. While the Andean traditional worldview was reflected in Ayllu society, it was still somewhat distant from the socio-economic structure of the Ayllu.

AB  - This study reviews pre-modern Korean literature studies focusing on the trends in ecological studies. First, previous studies used ecological terminology, including jayeon, hwangyong, and saemyong, saengtae, in a broad and sometimes undefined manner. Further studies need to clarify the terms and explain why the terms are important in understanding pre-modern people’s ecological sensitivity. Second, some previous studies revealed pre-modern scholars’ eco-centric views based on their positive descriptions on selected animals. Still, the term eco-centric view can be valid when the writers recognized the values of animals based on their natural characteristics rather than their people-like behaviors and their amicable relations to people. Third, previous studies have often idealized the time and space of pre-modern Korea’s human-nature relations and ecological surroundings. However, Korean history showed that people under different circumstances had various views on nature and the environment. The idealization of the past is partly because the previous studies have generally taken a philosophical and ideological approach focused on Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism. Although this approach is devoted to facilitating a profound understanding of the pre-modern Korean literati’s worldview, the approach is somewhat insufficient for providing practical, effective ways to address today’s environmental problems. An interdisciplinary approach that adopts ideas from the fields of ecology and history can facilitate an understanding of how premodern people acted and thought in conflicts between people and non-human beings.

AB  - The regulation of satellite remote sensing is generally included with the scope of statutes governing outer space activities. But not all states opted for dedicated satellite remote sensing regulation. The decision whether to do so depends in part on the specific capabilities of national satellite remote sensing programs.Five states that have dedicated statutes governing operations with remote sensing data are the United States, with its developed Landsat regime (the Land Remote Sensing Policy Act of 1992, LRSPA), Canada, with its Remote Sensing Systems Act, Germany, with its Satellite Data Securities Protection Act (SatDSiG), France, with its Law on Space Operations (LOS), Japan, with its Act on Ensuring Appropriate Handling of Satellite Remote Sensing Data.The major purpose of this article is to shed light on some legal issues surrounding remote sensing activities by comparative review. The paper analyzes international conventions or soft law and national law and policies relating to satellite remote sensing. It also offers some implications and suggestions for regulations of satellite remote sensing operations and satellite data.

AB  - Land cover and land use (LULC) are the key determinant factors that influence the regional climate. In this study, we present LULC classification for the Taipei City, Taiwan based on Sentinel-2B image acquired in 2018. A recently-proposed Nomalized Difference Laten Heat Index (NDLI) and Nomalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) are ultilized and compared to derive LULC, in particular, water bodies. Validation is based on reference datasets collected from Google Earth and field survey. Overall accuracices of classification are about 76% for NDLI and 91% for NDVI. However, it is shown that NDLI is highly capable to distinguish the water bodies from the others, such as built-up and bareland with accuracies of 100% and 95%, respectively, while NDVI shows better perfomance on vegetation classificantion only. In addition, it is found that shortwave infrared (SWIR)-2 (band 12) is more sensitive to identify the water bodies in comparison to SWIR-1 (band 11) of Sentinel-2B image to compute NDLI for extracting water bodies. This result further demonstrates that NDLI can be used as an effective indicator to detect and map the water surface or built-up or bareland by using Sentinel-2 imagery as initially suggested by Liou et al. [1].

AB  - Among the Korean Diaspora literature, Soviet Far Eastern Korean literature was the first to be formed. After the Russian Revolution, Soviet Far Eastern Korean literary circle was formed and based on Seonbong newspaper. Literary circle, led by Choi Horim, expanded further when Cho Myunghee entered the Soviet Far Eastern area in 1928. However, Cho Myunghee and Choi Horim were at odds over the identity of the Joseon people. Cho Myunghee tried to keep Korean identity connected with colonial Korea, while Choi Horim regarded them as a minority ethnic group in Soviet Russia. This confrontation was dominated by Choi Horim due to the leftist policy of Comintern before 1935. However, Cho Myunghee gained the upper hand after 1935 when policies advocating anti-imperialist struggles were proclaimed at the 7th Congress in Comintern. Cho Myunghee published a new literary magazine named 'The Country of Workers' after discarding 'Hometown of Workers', which was the first Korean literary magazine and managed by Choi Horim.However, in 1938, when forced migration to Central Asia took place, Cho Myunghee was arrested and died in prison, while Choi Horim moved to Central Asia. The Joseon people's literary circles in Soviet Far Eastern area were wiped out.When the Soviet Union was stationed north of the 38th parallel in 1945 under the pretext of disarming the Japanese army, it was accompanied by the Russian Korean of Central Asia. Among them were those who had been studying literature since the time of the Soviet Far Eastern Korean period, and Cho Gicheon and Jeon Donghyuk are representative figures. They were creative based on the Chosun Newspaper, the organ of the Soviet military. ChoGicheon, who claimed the identity of the Korean people through his connection with his homeland, worked hard to learn Korean history and culture, including the Korean language, and created them based on this. He was strongly aware of the independence of Korea, which is different from the Soviet Union. On the other hand, Jeon Donghyuk regarded Korean people as a minority of the Soviet Union, so his mission was to introduce civilized Soviet literature and culture to the underdeveloped Korea. Cho Gicheon and Jeon Donghyuk were two trends of Korean intellectual who came in with the Soviet army at that time. These confrontations existed not only in North Korea but also in Central Asia. This confrontation was naturally resolved in the 1970s, when Russian language became the main literary language rather than the Korean language. Due to the language problems. Anatoly Kim and other generations who are currently engaged in creative activities in Russian language represent another worldview and style.

AB  - In the early 20th century, Russian literature and art was a period of hybridization of diverse and unique trends, schools, and concepts. This period already contained prerequisites for the anti-Utopian worldview to sprout in social consciousness. These are important scientific achievements, the development of a new economic system, and the newly formed ideas of individuals at the time.The main characteristics, images, and motifs of the Russian anti-Utopian literary genre can be summarized as follows. Anti-utopia reveals the essential meaning of human existence through the real reality full of pain and inequality. This becomes a structure that creates internal cracks in the ideal society. Images that represent the genre characteristics of anti-utopia include squares, museums, and rituals. The square is the center of power and the mythical space where rituals are performed, and the museum represents the boundary between the ideal world and the real world, and becomes the spatial background of the protagonist's departure from the utopia world. The ritual acts as an anti-utopian pseudo-carnival lifestyle. The characteristic motifs of anti-utopia are love and ideological dialogue. Love becomes a direct catalyst to experience real reality, and ideological dialogue is an important light motif that is repeated in anti-utopia works, which clearly shows the confrontation between real and fictional truths. In addition, the unique space and time model is presented as an effective model for defining the genre characteristics of the anti-Utopia dual world.

AB  - Narrative qualitative research design was used to explore the journey of self-acceptance of three transgender individuals throughout the transition process. The primary research questions of this study were the following: (1) How do transgender individuals experience and express their narrative of selfacceptance? (2) How does their level of acceptance in the family and society impact their self-acceptance narrative? Research sub-questions included: (3) How does counseling impact transgender individuals' self-acceptance throughout the transition process; and (4) What was helpful or unhelpful in counseling? The analysis of narratives through interview and a narrative photo project revealed six superordinate themes that participants shared throughout their process of self-acceptance: (1) Awareness and Self-Discovery, (2) Family Acceptance Levels, (3) Shift in Worldview, (4) Counseling Impact, (5) Influence of Geographical Location, (6) Living in the Ambiguity. A discussion, implications for counselors, and areas of future research are provided.

TI  - A Convolutional Neural Network for Coastal Classification Based on ALOS and NOAA Satellite Data
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Although coastal classification has been attended in recent years, it is still a complicated problem in quantitative geomorphological and hydrological sciences. Nowadays, the integration of deep learning in remote sensing and GIS analysis can quickly classify and detect different characteristics on both land and sea. Therefore, the authors proposed the use of a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) for coastal classification based on these technologies and geomorphic profile graphs. The primary input data is digital elevation/depth models obtained from ALOS and NOAA satellite. Eight hundred coastal samples representing eight types of coasts taken along the coastline in Vietnam were used for training and testing various ConvNets. As a result, three ConvNet models using three different optimizer functions were developed with the accuracies of about 98 & x0025; and low values of the loss function. These models were used to classify 1029 in 1150 coasts (equal to 89 & x0025;) in Vietnam. Nearly 11 & x0025; of Vietnamese coasts could not be defined by three ConvNet models due to their complex geomorphic profile graphs, and require assessments of other natural components. The trained ConvNet models can potentially update new coastal types in different tropical countries towards coastal classification on national and global scales.

AB  - Drought is the main natural disasters in Indonesia. Study of spatial and temporal drought pattern distribution is great significance for disaster prevention and mitigation. Agricultural drought assessment was used to monitor agricultural sustainability, particularly in East Java as the national centre for agricultural production in Indonesia This study aimed to detect the spatial and temporal pattern of agricultural drought using Vegetation Health Index (VHI) and illustrated drought characteristics in East Java, Indonesia during 2017-2018. In this research, we use LST and EVI data from MODIS Terra satellite data. We used LST for calculating TCI, and EVI for calculating VCI. VHI were obtained by TCI and VCI score. The result showed that all drought-affected areas were experienced by moderate droughts. Bojonegoro, Magetan and Gresik district has the highest drought level compared to another district in East Java. Drought area increased significantly in September to October, which is dry season in Indonesia and cover 69.13% of agricultural area.

TI  - RECONSTRUCTION OF CREATIVE HISTORY OF POEM BY M.YU. LERMONTOV "THEY LOVED EACH OTHER FOR SO LONG AND DEARLY..." (1841) AS A WAY OF UNDERSTANDING THE MEANING OF TEXT
T2  - NAUCHNYI DIALOG
M3  - Article
AB  - Dynamic poetics is analyzed - from draft to clean manuscript - the poem by M. Yu. Lermontov "They loved each other for so long and dearly..." (1841), which is a free translation of the poem by H. Heine. Based on a comparison of the transcription of clean manuscript and two draft manuscripts of the poem, as well as the source - the German text - Lermontov's creative process, his work on choosing the exact word and creating an integral artistic image is reconstructed. The article outlines the causes and mechanisms of Lermontov's textual corrections that help to understand the movement of author's thought. The process of Lermontov's work on the text is associated with the emotional saturation of the "skeletal part" of a German source. Based on the textual analysis of the manuscripts of Lermontov's poem from the "Notebook presented by V. F. Odoyevsky", the semantic transformation of the source of the poem is traced, the process of enhancing the tragedy of the text achieved through its openness to eternity is revealed. The relevance of the problem is seen in the need to clarify the originality of the artistic imagery of Lermontov's poem, to identify the reasons for the strength of its aesthetic impact on the reader, as well as the ontological meaning of the text. The semantic evidence of the text is revealed in the need for direct relations "here and now", in understanding eternal life as a continuation of the mortal life. The novelty of the study has a factual (for the first time the creative process of composing a poem is presented in as much detail as possible) and interpretative in nature, associated with the refinement of Lermontov's worldview.

TI  - Spatial Non-Uniformity of Surface Temperature of the Dead Sea and Adjacent Land Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pronounced spatial non-uniformity has been obtained of daytime sea surface temperature (SST) of the Dead Sea and of land surface temperature (LST) over areas adjacent to the Dead Sea. This non-uniformity was observed in the summer months, under uniform solar radiation. Our findings are based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data (2002-2016) on board the Terra and Aqua satellites. MODIS data showed that, on average for the 15-year study period, daytime SST over the eastern part of the lake (Te) exceeded by 5 degrees C that over the western part (Tw). This SST non-uniformity (observed in the absence of surface heat flow from land to sea at the eastern side) was accompanied by spatial non-uniform distribution of land surface temperature (LST) over areas adjacent to the Dead Sea. Specifically, LST over areas adjacent to the eastern side exceeded by 10 degrees C that over areas adjacent to the western side. Our findings of spatial non-uniformity of SST/LST based on MODIS data were supported by Meteosat Second Generation LST records. Regional atmospheric warming led to a decrease in spatial non-uniformity of SST during the study period. Temperature difference between Te and Tw steadily decreased at the rate of 0.32 degrees C decade(-1), based on MODIS/Terra data, and 0.54 degrees C decade(-1), based on MODIS/Aqua data. Our simulations of monthly skin temperature distribution over the Dead Sea by the Weather Forecast and Research (WRF) model contradict satellite observations. The application to modeling of the observed SST/LST spatial non-uniformity will advance our knowledge of atmospheric dynamics over hypersaline lakes.

TI  - THE INDIGENIZATION OF ACADEMIA AND ONTOLOGICAL RESPECT
T2  - COSMOS AND HISTORY-THE JOURNAL OF NATURAL AND SOCIAL PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - My intent in this essay is not to discuss the actual content of Indigenous experiences and knowledges, as I have neither the requisite expertise nor experience to do so with any competence. Rather, what I wish to discuss are some implicit pitfalls in the idea of "Indigenization" when advocated in the context of Western metaphysical assumptions that have not been made explicit. Like it or not, this context is one in which we all now stand, but it is also disrupted by very different contexts, as revealed by the Canadian Truth and Reconciliation Commission for instance. More specifically, I wish to raise the possibility that an implicit ontological framework derived from Western European history may surreptitiously guide the negotiation of the interface between Western and Indigenous scholarship, and do so in a way that, rather than bringing about decolonization, actually may perpetuate colonization at more subtle and insidious levels. Drawing upon Heidegger's work, I argue that making such ontological frameworks explicit increases the chance of success for any such interface by opening the door to what I will call "ontological respect" (to be distinguished from the respect of persons as commonly understood in terms of Western liberal democracy and human rights). To put it simply, if we are going to understand the other, we must also understand ourselves (where the "we" in this case refers to the settler heirs of Western history). Such ontological respect, I will argue, is itself made possible by a Heideggerian variant of the phenomenological "epoche" or suspension of presuppositions, which suggests an explicit methodology for intercultural exchange, a methodology I call the "intercultural epoche."

TI  - Invasive Cancer Confined to the Nipple of the Conserved Breast: A Case Report
T2  - CASE REPORTS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive breast cancer deriving from the milk duct and lobule that develops in the nipple is extremely rare, except in Paget's disease and skin cancer. This is the second reported case of the development of invasive cancer confined to the nipple after breast-conserving surgery. A 69-year-old woman visited our department due to redness, swelling, and bloody discharge of the right nipple in the last month. A needle biopsy was suggestive of invasive ductal carcinoma; we performed a removal surgery of the right residual breast tissue and a second sentinel lymph node biopsy. She underwent these procedures 10 years previously as well. Thus, we diagnosed the present lesion as a local recurrence, but it was unknown whether the lesion was a true recurrence or second cancer, namely, metachronal ipsilateral breast cancer. The present case helps promote awareness that invasive cancer rarely develops in the nipple after conserving surgery. Patients should be encouraged to visit a medical facility if experiencing skin changes and swelling of the nipple. Additionally, breast cancer patients must be carefully selected for breast-conserving surgery; failure to do so may later result in nipple-specific local recurrence. (c) 2020 The Author(s).

TI  - Distant Metastasis after Surgery for Encapsulated Papillary Carcinoma of the Breast: A Case Report
T2  - CASE REPORTS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the absence of clear interstitial invasion, encapsulated papillary carcinoma (EPC) of the breast may be attributed to an extremely good prognosis if handled similarly to ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) with suitable local treatment. Here, we report our experience with a case of EPC of the breast that presented with carcinomatous pleuritis and lymphangitis carcinomatosa postoperatively, which rapidly resulted in a poor outcome. A 67-year-old woman was diagnosed with DCIS of the left breast and underwent left partial mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy. EPC was diagnosed because the pathological examination showed no sign of interstitial infiltration. Postoperative radiation therapy was performed. Five years and 9 months postoperatively, the patient began experiencing cough and shortness of breath on exertion. Imaging showed right pleural effusion and consolidation of the lung field, but nothing suggesting local recurrence in the preserved left breast, local lymph nodes, or opposite breast was observed. Postoperative recurrence of breast cancer, carcinomatous pleuritis, and lymphangitis carcinomatosa were diagnosed based on the results of pleural fluid cytology. One month later, multiple brain metastases were found, and the patient died of the primary disease 5 months after recurrence. After surgery for EPC without clear interstitial infiltration, there was a small possibility of a poor outcome from distant metastasis. Therefore, although distant metastasis is uncommon, regular examination and testing should be performed.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Distribution of Human-Elephant Conflict in Eastern Thailand: A Model-Based Assessment Using News Reports and Remotely Sensed Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In Thailand, crop depredation by wild elephants intensified, impacting the quality of life of local communities and long-term conservation of wild elephant populations. Yet, fewer studies explore the landscape-scale spatiotemporal distribution of human-elephant conflict (HEC). In this study, we modeled the potential HEC distribution in ten provinces adjacent to protected areas in Eastern Thailand from 2009 to 2018. We applied the time-calibrated maximum entropy method and modeled the relative probability of HEC in varying scenarios of resource suitability and direct human pressure in wet and dry seasons. The environmental dynamic over the 10-year period was represented by remotely sensed vegetation, meteorological drought, topographical, and human-pressure data. Results were categorized in HEC zones using the proposed two-dimensional conflict matrix. Logistic regression was applied to determine the relevant contribution of each scenario. The results showed that although HEC probability varied across seasons, overall HEC-prone areas expanded in all provinces from 2009 to 2018. The largest HEC areas were estimated during dry seasons with Chantaburi, Chonburi, Nakhon Ratchasima, and Rayong provinces being the HEC hotspots.However, the HEC potential was reduced during severe and prolonged droughts caused by El Nino events. Direct human pressure caused a more gradual increase of HEC probability around protected areas. On the other hand, resource suitability showed large variation across seasons. We recommend zone-dependent management actions towards a fine-balance between human development and the conservation of wild elephants.

TI  - The Horseman on the Pale Horse. Thoughts and Notes on the History of the Plague in Past Times
T2  - TUNA-AJALOOKULTUURI AJAKIRI
M3  - Article
AB  - This essay aims to revisit some basic features of the history of plagues and pestilences in Estonia and Livonia, particularly from the time of the Black Death until the plague and famine of 1601-1603. Those of us who stayed in self-isolation during the coronavirus pandemic have possibly refreshed their acquaintance with dark sentiments while rereading Boccaccio's Decameron or Camus' almost forgotten novel La peste, or else by puzzling over the horrifying messages in the Book of Revelation. Indeed, the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse made their imprint on the mentalities of the Later Middle Ages. The fourth horseman, the one riding a pale horse, has been personified as Death, and symbolises plague and pestilence. The fear of death and God's wrath belonged to the worldview of people in medieval times; thus, the plague was understood as God's judgement upon faithless people. Indeed, the Catholic Church explained the plague as God's punishment for sins. Therefore, one can understand the rise of the motif of the Last Judgement in preaching during and after the Black Death pandemic in Europe.Despite divine providence, the plague made no distinction between the sinful and the righteous, killing them both. The Black Death, or the bubonic plague (1347-1351/3), is estimated to have killed one third, or at least 25 million, of the population of Europe. In various European regions, outbreaks of the plague recurred periodically in the following centuries, every 10-15 years. One must admit that the term plague or pestilence (Latin pestilencia) was the common designation for epidemic diseases, not all of which could always be identified specifically as the bubonic plague.The Black Death swept through western and central Europe toward the east and spread in Estonia and Livonia in 1350 and 1351. The scarce available data tell about great mortality in Livonia in 1351. According to selective research, Riga may have lost ca. one quarter of its population (Fr. Benninghoven); another study suggests that the plague killed ca. 30% of craftsmen in Reval/Tallinn (K. Kaplinski). Looking back at the calamitous fourteenth century, one must consider the compound effects of the Great Famine (1315-1317), the St. George's Night Uprising (1343-1345), and the Black Death on social and economic life in Estonia. Whether or not the post-Black Death societal condition of the Estonian territories should be interpreted in the framework of the Late Medieval crisis still requires further research (cf. P. Raudkivi, I. Leimus). New waves of epidemics already followed in the late 1300s and continued through the fifteenth century. Thus, the apocalyptic horsemen who symbolised war, famine, plague, and death stayed firmly fixed in Late Medieval and Early Modern mentalities. The popular motif of danse macabre as an artistic genre (cf. the painting Dance of Death by Bernt Notke in the St. Nicholas Church in Tallinn) or the ars moriendi theme in literary texts belong to the context and afterlife of the Black Death.The chronologies of plagues and pestilences in Europe in those centuries are astonishing (cf. G. Sticker, J.-N. Biraben): almost all decades are filled with some kind of epidemic diseases, shifting in time, while spreading in a wave-like motion from the west to the east, disappearing only to return again. The recently published chronology of the pestilences in Livonia - 1420, 1444, 1464, 1474, 1482, 1499, 1503-1505, 1515-1521, 1525, 1531, 1539, 1546, and the early 1550s - reflects such frequency that a late medieval person would have experienced an epidemic disease at least twice during their lifetime. To help people in their daily life, plague ordinances (Pestordnungen) were drawn up, which were later issued in printed versions.The archival collections of the Tallinn City Archives include the manuscript of a late fifteenth century plague ordinance, obviously copied from a Middle Low German original or a translated text. Although confession of sins was suggested as the major means of fighting the pestilence, some practical advice was also given, including remedies, such as avoiding the south or warm wind, fumigating the living space with laurel, juniper, hyssop etc., washing the hands and face with clear water and vinegar, and using vinegar and rosewater for disinfection. The universal remedy for the disease was a medieval wonder drug, theriac. How effective the plague ordinance was during the frequent epidemics visiting Reval in the early sixteenth century remains unknown.The archival sources quite often mention plagues and pestilences, although these data are not always sufficient to diagnose the disease. In 1498, for instance, Revalian account books registered a new epidemic of the French disease, or Spanish smallpox, which in fact was syphilis. A severe outbreak of the so-called English sweating sickness occurred in Reval in 1530-1532, killing, among others, three leading evangelical preachers who initiated the Lutheran Reformation in the town. Besides Reval, another outbreak of the same disease in the early 1550s also affected southern and western Estonia.The later sixteenth century is mostly overshadowed by the Livonian War (1558-1583), which caused misery and calamities; thus, the apocalyptic vision captivated people's minds anew. The Chronicle of the Province of Livonia (1584) by Balthasar Russow serves as the best guide to this fateful period. Plague and death accompanied Pastor Russow and his congregation both during the sieges and in peacetime. Russow recorded the outbreaks of epidemic diseases in 1561, 1566, 1570-1571, 1577, 1579, and 1580 with clerical accuracy. The chronicler later learned that the latter epidemic `spread throughout the entire world, through Turkey and the land of the Tatars as well as through all of Christendom'. This outbreak is better known as the Italian influenza epidemic of 1580. Russow himself survived two other destructive pestilences in 1591 and 1597 before he died in 1600.Georg Muller, Russow's successor at the Holy Spirit Church of Reval, eyewitnessed the far more disastrous famine and plague of 1602-1603 in his hometown. The plague killed about 3,000-4,500 citizens in the single year of 1603; at its peak in July of 1603 alone, Muller buried more than 13 victims a day. A few days before he lost his spouse, Muller preached to his congregation about the impending doomsday. This prophesy was never fulfilled. Muller's congregation revived, and the losses among the Revalian clergy were recovered by the influx of new preachers from Germany, thus ending the era of the Middle Low German culture.While modern research has argued that the Black Death may be interpreted as the turning point of history (O. Benedictow), other scholars have issued the prophetic message of the eventual return of the plague in our times (S. Scott, Chr. Duncan). It gives one pause to think that now, in the days of the coronavirus pandemic, this prediction is becoming reality.

TI  - Role of physical processes in formation of spring phytoplankton bloom in the Bering Sea
T2  - Trudy VNIRO
M3  - Article
AB  - The main part of the annual primary production in the Arctic and Subarctic zones of the World Ocean is formed during the spring phytoplankton bloom. The timing of the bloom depends on combination of physical factors. Oscillating control hypothesis, proposed in [Hunt et al., 2002] for the Eastern Bering Sea, describes annual peculiarities of ecosystem development related to conditions of the spring phytoplankton bloom. We review propositions of this hypothesis on the reasons of phytoplankton bloom and its connection with physical processes for four local regions of the Bering Sea shelf. The regions include western, northern and south-eastern parts of the shelf. The analysis is based on ocean color and microwave remotely sensed data as well as on atmospheric reanalysis. The results allow for hypothesis improvement. An early phytoplankton bloom may be present in the surface layer in April or May along the eastern Bering Sea shelf even in situations of early sea ice retreat (e. g. February-March) or absence of ice during winter. However, such combinations were not observed in the western Bering Sea shelf region. In 1998-2018, early ice retreat in the western shelf region was always accompanied by relatively late phytoplankton bloom. The temporal lag between sea ice retreat and phytoplankton bloom may be substantial in some years along the southernmost position of the ice edge. On the other hand, the spring bloom in the northern part of the shelf usually follows the ice retreat. In case of early ice retreat, the timing of the bloom is determined not only by wind conditions, but also by heat balance at the surface of the sea. The results are proposed to be used in further analysis of ecosystem dynamics of the western Bering Sea shelf.

TI  - Theoretical and Literary Ideas of Russian Symbolists and M.M. Bakhtin
T2  - NOVYI FILOLOGICHESKII VESTNIK-NEW PHILOLOGICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The article aims to characterize the influence of the Russian symbolists' theoretical and literary heritage on M.M. Bakhtin's views. While formalists decided to cast down the "mystical" and, therefore, philosophical foundations in analyzing literary fiction, Bakhtin became a direct follower of the traditions of Russian symbolists, who focused not only on the form but on the semantics of the text as well. Evidently, in the 1920s Bakhtin kept returning to the synthetism of Russian symbolists' theoretical conclusions. It was thanks to Bakhtin that the line of Russian philosophical literary studies, which flourished at the beginning of the 20th century with the works by D.S. Merezhkovsky, A. Bely, V. Ivanov and others, continued unbroken. In Bakhtin's work "Art and Responsibility" one can see the reflection and interpretation of Russian symbolists' aesthetic concepts. It evidently echoes their articles - especially ones by V. Ivanov - on the mission of a poet. Another influence on Bakhtin's early aesthetic views was V.Ya. Bryusov. Bakhtin's work "On the Philosophy of an Action" echoes symbolists' writings even more, especially in the part on the role of individualism, which mirrors antinomic relationships with life and others. Bakhtin shared the aesthetical ideas and worldview of Russian symbolists, which in part explains his connection to the symbolist' synthetic literary studies. Another topic of the article "On the Philosophy of Art" is a polemic with the formalists. In his works from the mid-1920s, such as "The Author and the Protagonist in Aesthetic Activity" and "On the Topic of the Methods of Literary Art's Aesthetic" he would develop these points further. In this polemic Bakhtin once again relies on aesthetic - the second component of creative works of Russian symbolists. Thus, Bakhtin continues the traditions of symbolists' synthetic literary studies without denouncing the importance of studying the form of a literary work.

TI  - Secretory breast carcinoma in a male child: Case report and literature review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY CASE REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The secretory breast carcinoma is very rare in children. It represents less than 1% of malignancy cases in childhood and is even less common in males, with 15 cases reported until 2004. Therefore, the aim of this study is to report a male child with breast carcinoma and review literature.PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 14-year-old male patient with a history of a painless slow-growing lump in the left breast and, five years later, onset of yellow discharge from the papilla. Ultrasound scanning demonstrated a well-defined, regular, homogeneous and hypoechoic mass.Nodule excision was initially performed, followed by mastectomy, due to compromised radial margin. Immunohistochemistry revealed weakly positive estrogen and progesterone receptors. Adjuvant therapy was not required. Sixteen months after resection, the patient is well with no complaints or recurrence.DISCUSSION: Due to its rarity, there is no therapeutic guideline. Although the recommended treatment is still surgical excision, there is no consensus as to its extent. Prognosis is usually favorable. Our patient was submitted to mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy due to compromised radial margin.CONCLUSION: Secretory breast carcinoma is a rare form of breast cancer, especially in male children; which hampers standardization of diagnosis, treatment and prognosis establishment.

AB  - Background: The 2020 Coronavirus pandemic is a major international public health challenge. Governments have taken public health protection measures to reduce the spread of the virus through non-pharmalogical measures. The impact of the pandemic and the public health response on individual and population mental health is unknown. Methods: We used Google Trends data (1 Jan 2020 - 1 Apr 2020) to investigate the impact of the pandemic and government measures to curb it on people's concerns, as indexed by changes in search frequency for topics indicating mental distress, social and economic stressors and mental health treatment-seeking. We explored the changes of key topics in Google trends in Italy, Spain, USA, UK, and Worldwide in relation to sentinel events during the pandemic. Results: Globally there appears to be significant concerns over the financial and work-related consequences of the pandemic, with some evidence that levels of fear are rising. Conversely searching for topics related to depression and suicide fell after the pandemic was announced, with some evidence that searches for the latter have risen recently. Concerns over education and access to medication appear to be particular social stressors. Whilst searches for face-to-face treatments have declined, those for self-care have risen. Conclusions: Monitoring Google trends shows promise as a means of tracking changing public concerns. In weeks to come it may enable policy makers to assess the impact of their interventions including those aiming to limit negative consequences, such as government funded financial safety nets.

AB  - Ever since gaining liberation in 1945, Korean society has constantly recalled memories of Japan’s invasion and Korea’s anti-Japanese movements for an independent state (AMIS). In the process, a small number of new religious groups were also identified as main subjects within AMIS. However, the logic necessary to connect these religious groups with AMIS was still weak. In order to solve this situation academically, the purpose of this article is to illuminate the activities of Mugeukdo (無極道) and Jo Jeongsan (趙鼎山) through the lens of AMIS and to reflect on the issues that will arise when linking the religion with AMIS. Regarding this purpose, this article analyzed the internal and external data collected by Daesoon Jinrihoe (大巡眞理會) about Jo Jeongsan and Mugeukdo’s activities linked to AMIS. Later, this paper presents several tasks for future research on this subject matter.Specifically, according to Chapter Ⅱ, the AMIS of Jo Jeongsan and Mugeukdo were generally centered on resistance at the family level, Jo Jeongsan’s order to participate in the March 1st Movement, and Mugeukdo’s industrial activities. In Chapter Ⅲ, I reviewed the contents of Chapter II using Daesoon Jinrihoe’s external materials. According to the results of the review, future research is required to discover and cross-check materials related to the AMIS of Jo Jeongsan and Mugeukdo believers. Likewise, further research is needed to highlight the theory of the enthronement of emperor (天子登極說) and the Great Opening of the later world (後天開闢) in terms of AMIS. These efforts can make contributions that increase the credibility of Daesoon Jinrihoe’s internal data on the AMIS of Jo Jeongsan and Mugeukdo and expand the periphery of AMIS as it relates to certain religious groups.Subsequently, in Chapter Ⅳ, I present three items for reflecting upon the connection between certain religious groups and AMIS. The first is that criteria for establishing the category of AMIS is necessary to determine whether religious activities can be included. Second, reductionist approaches make it difficult to explain the reasons why some of the people who participated in AMIS did so while forming ‘new religious movements,’ and why these groups have maintained their religious identity even after liberation was achieved in 1945. Third, it is necessary to distinguish between the primary and the secondary dimensions to elaborate on the connection between these religions and AMIS. This means that researchers should be expected to look at whether the activities in question are based on a religious worldview and whether the goal of the activities is the realization of AMIS or the implementation of some aspect of that religious worldview.In the future, considering the mechanisms that make AMIS memorable in Korea, religious groups and religious studies should take greater interest in discovering and accumulating data that facilitates research on these topics. At the same time, effort should be made to find the basis for AMIS within religious worldviews. It can also be made possible through specific interest in further elaboration on the various AMIS-related activities of Jo Jeongsan and Mugeukdo.

AB  - Plans to mitigate overheating in urban areas requires the identification of the characteristics of the thermal environment of the city. The key information is the distribution of higher and lower temperatures (referred to as “hotspot” or “coldspot”, respectively) in the city. This study aims to identify the areas within Jeonju City that are suffering from increasing land surface temperatures (LST) and the factors linked to such this phenomenon. To identify the hot and cold spots, Local Moran’s I and Getis-Ord Gi* were calculated for the LST based on 2017 images taken using the thermal band of the Landsat 8 satellite. Hotspot analysis revealed that hotspot regions, (the areas with a high concentration of Land Surface Temperature) are located in the old town area and in industrial districts. To figure out the factors linked to the hotspots, a correlation analysis, and a regression analysis taking into account environmental covariates including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and land cover. The values of NDVI showed that it had the strongest effect on the lowering LSTs. The results of this study are expected to provide directions for urban thermal environment designing and policy development to mitigate the urban heat island effect in the future.

TI  - One Mind of Bunhwang Wonhyo and Myogong Daehaeng
TI  - 芬皇 元曉의 一心과 妙空 大行의 한마음
T2  - The Journal of the Korean Association for Buddhist Studies
T2  - 한국불교학

AB  - This paper examines the continuity and discontinuity of fundamental mind and present consciousness in Bunhwang Wonhyo (芬皇 元曉, 617~686) of Silla and Myogong Daehaeng (妙空 ⼤⾏, 1927~2012) of Korea. Wonhyo called fundamental mind the "Origin of One Mind", while Daehaeng called it "One Mind Juingong". On the other hand, both Wonhyo and Daehaeng called present mind as the One Mind. Therefore, the enlightened One Mind of Buddha corresponds to Wonhyo’s "Origin of One Mind" and Daehaeng’s "One Mind Juingong". Thus, Wonhyo’s "Origin of One Mind" and "One Mind" corresponds to Daehaeng’s "One Mind Juingong" and "One Mind".However, One Mind has been used to convey a variety of meanings. In the case of Wonhyo, this term means alaya vijnana, but at other times, he also used it to mean tathagatagarbha. He did not stop there. He used the term to mean nirvana and he even went further and used it to mean the "Origin of One Mind".Wonhyo established his thoughts originally from the old translation system and accepted the new translation system on top of it. The four different kinds of One Mind ― that is, One Mind as alaya vijnana, tathagatagarbha, nirvana, and Origin of One Mind can be understood as the results of his endeavors in seeking the truth of Buddhism.In the case of Daehaeng, One Mind was understood as four different concepts: Buddha-nature, One Mind Juingong, One Mind, and Five Gong (cooperation). These four concepts seem to be the core ideology that constitutes Daehaeng’s worldview. Daehaeng referred to this One Mind with many names: Juingong, Dad, Mom, pillar of mind, everyday mind, clean water, one thing, original face, one thing that does not exist, Amitabha, main Buddha, all-inclusive god, my dear, and others.Daehaeng also emphasized the concept of Juingong; this Juingong means "the self that leads oneself", "the true self of everyone", and "the true mind of the mind". It also means "a place that encompasses every being, supports everything, and operates everything". It is "a father and son at the same time", "the highest one and the lowest one at the same time", and "a non-fixed being that can become anything". Therefore, this Juingong is a whole being that cannot be divided into parts. This tradition of Daehaeng’s Juingong practice can find its origin in Musang (無相, 680~756 or 684~762) who attained enlightenment through ascetic practices deep in the mountain.The structure of Wonhyo’s One Mind ideology is composed of Origin of One Mind, single taste (eka-rasa), One Mind, innate enlightenment and thusness. On the other hand, the structure of Daehaeng’s One Mind ideology is composed of One Mind Juingong and One Mind. Here, "One Mind Juingong" is equivalent to Wonhyo’s "Origin of One Mind" and One Mind is equivalent to the One Mind of Wonhyo. Therefore, Daehaeng’s "One Mind Juingong" is equivalent to the 9th consciousness  in other words, amala vijnana  and One Mind is equivalent to the 8th consciousness, or alaya vijnana.In the above sense, both Wonhyo and Daehaeng’s 9th consciousness and 8th consciousness share both continuity and discontinuity at the same time. At the point where both consciousnesses meet, the aspect of dharma-kaya can be found; and at the point where both consciousnesses do not meet, the aspect of saṃbogha-kaya is found. Daehaeng’s One Mind Juingong and One Mind represent these two aspects.

AB  - The folk culinary terminology is associated primarily with the lifestyle, the material and spiritual culture of the Bulgarians, with the people's worldview and religious beliefs, but it also has its own linguistic dimensions. Culinary vocabulary can be a part of the phraseological core of sustainable comparisons. The proposed new circle of traditional culinary support words (phraseological cores) on the right side of the MB, i.e. of the comparator, is made up of divisions based only on the three main ways of special thermal processing (cooking, baking, frying). It is tailored to the origin (vegetable or animal) of the food. It paints an interesting picture that confirms ethnocultural observations of the historical development of food processing.

AB  - Objective: Summary of current evidence about sentinel lymph node concept in early stages cervical cancer.Design: Review.Setting: Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, General University Hospital, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague.Methods: First, a comprehensive search of a peer-reviewed journals in gynaecological oncology was conducted based on a wide range of key words used in PubMed database. Second, the reference section for each article found was searched in order to find additional articles. Third, extensive personal clinical and scientifical experience with sentinel lymph node concept in cervical cancer was utilized.Results: Sentinel lymph node biopsy is routinely used in the management of early stages cervical cancer with high detection rate in skilled surgeon's hands. It has high sensitivity and low false negative rate. The intraoperative sentinel lymph node examination (i.e. frozen section) has low accuracy because it fails to detect about half of cases with lymph node involvement. Final pathological examination with intensive protocol for ultrastaging detects additional 10% of patients with small metastases (i.e. micrometastasis), who would be otherwise missed. There are limited data about the importance of micrometastasis involvement in sentinel lymph node; there is also growing evidence about negative prognostic impact and patients with micrometastasis should be managed with the same criteria as patients with macrometastasis.Conclusion: Sentinel lymph node biopsy followed by full pelvic lymph node dissection is currently standard of care until ongoing prospective trials answer question about oncological safety of less radical surgical approach with sentinel lymph node biopsy only.

AB  - Sentinel-2 offers the capabilities to observe Arctic sea ice features with high spatial and temporal resolution. Arctic sea ice drift, however, exacerbates observing the temporal evolution of floes by means of time series analysis. We therefore developed a novel rotation-invariant ice floe descriptor based on ice floe geometry and an image-processing workflow consisting of three main steps: (i) ice floe extraction, (ii) ice floe description and (iii) ice floe matching. We tested the methodology on Sentinel-2A images from 10 June and 3 July, 2017, and selected five floes present in both images. We further added ten "false samples" in the second image. All floes from the first image were correctly identified and matched with the floes from the second image. The methodology enables the identification of individual ice floes and determination of their relative rotation from multiple Sentinel-2 images.

TI  - Near 40-year drought trend during 1981-2019 earth warming and food security
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - Following the 2014 report of the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Earth surface has been warming up since the mid-18th century. From the late 1970s, Earth warmed up intensively, leading to unusual environmental, economic and social events. An intensive 19th century's, Earth warming has speeded up ice melting and sea level rise, increased water shortage and drought intensity. Expected drought intensification and expansion would reduce crop production, deteriorating food security and intensifying poor population's hunger. Since climate warming is continuing, we estimate long-term interaction between global warming and high-resolution drought tendencies and its consequences for global and regional food security. This paper develops and investigates satellite-derived 38-year high-resolution drought data sets and evaluate their trends, during 1981-2018. Drought was estimated using satellite-based Vegetation Health (VH) method. The results indicated that for the entire globe, hemispheres and the main grain-producing countries (China, USA and India) drought has not intensified and expanded during 38-year, while the global temperature anomaly has strongly increased. Since drought has not intensified and expanded during strong global warming, food security in the next few years is likely to remain at the level of the most recent decade.

CL  - Taoyuan, TAIWAN
AB  - Background: Vascularized submental lymph node (VSLN) transfer is an emerging approach for extremity lymphedema. This study investigated the long-term outcome and venous complications of VSLN for unilateral lower extremity lymphedema. Methods: Between 2010 and 2018, patients who underwent VSLN for unilateral lower extremity lymphedema were retrospectively evaluated. Patient demographics, operative records, complications, circumferential improvement, and episodes of cellulitis were analyzed. Further comparisons were performed between different types, numbers, and techniques of venous anastomoses. Results: A total of 75 VSLNs in 70 patients survived, giving a 100% success rate. Six flaps (8%) had venous complications (VC group) and 69 flaps (92%) did not (No-VC group). There were no statistical differences in types, numbers, and techniques of anastomoses between two groups (P = .65, 1, and .56, respectively). At a mean follow-up of 32.0 +/- 23.0 months, mean circumferential improvement and episodes of cellulitis between two groups did not statistically differ significantly (P = .31 and .09, respectively). Conclusions: VSLN is an effective treatment for lower extremity lymphedema. The types, numbers of veins, and techniques of venous anastomoses did not statistically affect the venous complication rates. Functional outcomes of the VSLNs were not compromised if venous complications were salvaged promptly.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a simplified atmospheric correction algorithm for snow/ice albedo retrievals using single view satellite measurements. The validation of the technique is performed using Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) on board Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellite and ground spectral or broadband albedo measurements from locations on the Greenland ice sheet and in the French Alps. Through comparison with independent ground observations, the technique is shown to perform accurately in a range of conditions from a 2100 m elevation mid-latitude location in the French Alps to a network of 15 locations across a 2390 m elevation range in seven regions across the Greenland ice sheet. Retrieved broadband albedo is accurate within 5% over a wide (0.5) broadband albedo range of the (N = 4155) Greenland observations and with no apparent bias.

AB  - The water footprint of a crop is defined as the total volume of water consumed for the production of the crop in the growing season. The total water footprint comprises of the three components, i.e. the rainwater (green water footprint), irrigated water (blue water footprint) and the polluted water (grey water footprint) usage for the production. This study discusses the potential of the remote sensing techniques for the assessment of the green and blue water footprint of rice crop with the help of high temporal resolution and real-time data, in the tropical region of Ranchi, Jharkhand. In this paper, the evapotranspiration (ET) and rainfall (RF) have been identified as the key parameters for the assessment of the water usage. The study uses MODIS Evapotranspiration data and CHIRPS rainfall data, along with CLIMWAT station data to estimate the green and blue component of the water usage.

TI  - FUNERARY PRACTICES IN MODERN CHUKCHI CULTURE
T2  - TOMSKII ZHURNAL LINGVISTICHESKIKH I ANTROPOLOGICHESKIKH ISSLEDOVANII-TOMSK JOURNAL OF LINGUISTICS AND ANTHROPOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article examines the funeral Chukchi traditions that have survived to the present time. Many scientists believed that archaic forms of funerals would give way to a modern unified ritual. However, in some national villages of Chukotka people are still buried by burning or leaving the dead body on a hill or in an open area; modern funeral rites are also often associated with some elements of traditional culture.The authors consider the worldview associated with death, the attitude to death in the Chukchi and neighboring ethnic groups. For a comparative analysis of the rites occurring in different years, the authors give descriptions of the funeral rites by scientists and travelers of the XVIII-XX centuries.Existing ritual practices in modern Chukchi culture are represented by the following methods of burial of the dead: burning, leaving the body in the open air, laying the body with stones, burial "in Russian".Among the traditional burial practices, the most common is the ritual of burning. Moreover, in the village of Vaegi of Anadyr districts the funeral "in Chukchi" is the most preferable for residents. The exceptions are the cases when the spouses and close relatives of the representatives of other nationalities can not do the will of the dead in the ceremony of burning.Other traditional methods of burial are few but still occur in the village of Ilirney (Iultinsky district), Rytkuchi village (Chaunsky district), in some villages of Anadyr and Chukotka district.Surveys of residents showed that most often "in Chukchi" they bury the old people, who voiced their will during his lifetime, or "tundra-people" engaged in traditional farming away from the villages.It should be noted that nowadays few informants could describe the ritual as a whole, many people know the order of ritual acts, but cannot disclose their meaning. The funeral rites are frequently held in a "truncated" version (once the mandatory manipulations with the dead are no longer produced, for example, tendons cut, "open" chest, etc.).In rural areas, there are still experts who own traditional burial practices. They participate in the preparation and conduct of the rite, teach the younger generation to conduct rituals.

TI  - FOREIGN POLICY IMPERATIVES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE VISEGRAD GROUP AND UKRAINE
T2  - BALTIC JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the analysis of the main stages of creation and development of the Visegrad Group as a regional grouping, which is successfully developing when being a member of NATO and the European Union. This kind of research is especially relevant in connection with the exacerbation of the economic crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of the research is to analyze the strategic stages of creation and development of various cooperative aspects of the Visegrad countries; such a format of interaction has not lost its relevance after accession to the European Union. Analytical separation of periodization of the stages of formation, identification of problems and solutions faced by the Visegrad group's countries is important for creating a modern economic and political worldview of cooperation and indentifying the main areas of cooperation in Europe. Based on the use of documents, including protocols and declarations as a result of meetings at various levels within the Visegrad Group, the specific stages of its development and interaction with Ukraine in a wide range of components that are the essence of Euro-Atlantic integration are analyzed and identified. Specific examples illustrate that Ukraine has always been in the field of key interests of the Visegrad Four, getting effective assistance and support in various forms from it. There have been identified not only practical issues of regional cooperation and security, but also some aspects of the value and civilization dimension. The member countries of the Visegrad Group, having initiated the format of cooperation "V4 + Ukraine", took an active part in the most important processes that Ukraine went through on its way. The assumption is proved that the experience of the Visegrad countries is relevant and useful for Ukraine on the way to the realization of its Euro-Atlantic integration aspirations. Despite the difficulties within the European Union, between Ukraine and some of the signatories of the 1991 Visegrad Declaration, cooperation with Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary is the most effective communication platform for intensifying a broad dialogue between Ukraine and the European Union.

AB  - In this study, we present a new technique for automated retrieval of ice concentration from RADARSAT-2 dual-polarization HH-HV ScanSAR images. We extended our previously introduced ice and water detection approach (based on more than 15,000 SAR images) operating at 2.05 km x 2.05 km spatial scale to a set of 19 retrieval scales ranging from 2.05 km (41 pixel) down to 0.25 km (5 pixel). Then we designed a technique for estimating ice concentration in 2 km x 2 km (40 x 40 pixel) areas using ice and water retrievals derived at multiple spatial scales. We demonstrated that the proposed approach shows a very good agreement with the Canadian Ice Service (CIS) Image Analysis ice concentrations (RMSE=2.2%, R-2 = 0.996). The developed technique will be adapted to the data stream from the RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) for data assimilation in Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) Regional Ice-Ocean Prediction System (RIOPS).

TI  - Evolutionary Theory and Evolutionary Practice in the Evolving World
T2  - VOPROSY FILOSOFII
M3  - Article
AB  - The first scientific theories of evolution, the theory of biological evolution and the theory of social evolution, having arisen in the 19th century historically as Ch. Darwin and K. Marx separate and independent doctrines, in process of its development were transformed into modern scientific theories of evolution and into the concept of global evolutionism. They influenced greatly not only on science and the humanities, but also on culture in general, on thinking of people and their worldview. Founders of "the synthetic theory of the evolution" called by B.M. Mednikov Darwinism in the 20th century, in particular J. Huxley and Th. Dobzhansky insisted that man already became the main factor of evolution which determine his own existence and evolution as well as existence and evolution of the whole organic world. Thus, the evolution of man transforms into its new stage and becomes really human one, that is an evolutionary humanistic practice. The theory of this evolution and transition to it is the theory of transition from pre-history of man to actually human history, and the origin of science of man creating his own evolving human being and evolving Universe humanized by him.

TI  - The Image of "Steppe" in the Russian and Hungarian Literatures (Selected Pages)
T2  - NOVYI FILOLOGICHESKII VESTNIK-NEW PHILOLOGICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper examines the representations of the steppe image in the Russian and Hungarian literatures on the examples of works by A.P. Chekhov and Hungarian poets and writers, especially Miklos Meszoly. The correlation of the poetic worlds is analyzed via two scientific approaches: firstly, mythopoetic, and, secondly, tropological. It is not very difficult to compare the works of authors who seem so distant in time and semantic orientation. They are brought together as a general linguistic worldview of the Russian and Hungarian peoples ("steppe" / "puszta"), and a specific poetic purpose of the writers. The image of the steppe belongs to those objects of artistic and philosophical reflection, which allow to detect, on the one hand, the genetic connection of literary traditions, on the other - their typological similarity. The analysis first summarizes the development of the image of the steppe in the Russian folklore, Cossack songs and Chekhov's works using the example of "The Steppe", "The Pecheneg" and "At Home", followed by a brief overview of the Hungarian literary tradition on the steppe wildlife, in particular, in poems of Sandor Petofi. Meszoly read Chekhov intensively, and most likely he was familiar with the novellas and short stories mentioned above. The poetics of the short novel "High School" clearly grows out of this heritage, but the importance of the special linguistic world of its author should not be diminished, that is why the stories are loaded with unusual metaphors, comparisons and personifications, renewing the literary canon.

TI  - STUDY ON THE RELATIONS AMONG TOURISM ENVIRONMENTAL IMAGERY, SERVICE QUALITY, AND REVISIT INTENTION IN ECOTOURISM
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Along with the popularity of environmental awareness, the advance of management in conservative area, and the change in consumer markets, ecotourism, different from traditional mass tourism, has emerged. The tourism environmental imagery of a tourism destination would affect visitors' judgment on the selection of tourism destinations as well as form the expectation of local tourism. Before deciding the tourism consumption, the overall tourism environmental imagery of a tourism destination is a decision reference for visitors selecting tourism activity. Aiming at ecotourism visitors in Guangdong Province, total 500 copies of questionnaire are distributed in this study, and 387 valid copies are retrieved, with a retrieval rate of 77%. The research results show positive relations between: (1) tourism environmental imagery and service quality; (2) service quality and revisit intention, and (3) tourism environmental imagery and revisit intention. According to the results, suggestions are eventually proposed in this study, expecting to understand the ecotourism characteristics in visitors' mind and the successive behaviour so as to enhance the environmental attitudes as well as to provide reference for relevant units to achieve the goal of sustainable development of ecotourism.

TI  - The Semantic and Hermeneutic Approach to Disciple Arab Believers in the Context of Bible Teaching Ministries
T2  - ACTS Theological Journal
T2  - ACTS 신학저널
M3  - research-article
AB  - In Arab countries, only a small portion of Arab pastors have reached the professional level in Fuṣḥa (classical and modern literary Arabic) proficiency. Foreigners who minister in Arab countries learn Fuṣḥa from native Arabs, but the problem is that Arabs do not tell them that the word meanings in the Arabic Bible are not necessarily the same when they are used in the Qur’an or in Islamic theological context.Arabic language had existed before Islam, but some of the words took special theological meanings in Islamic context as the Islamic comAbstract munity used Arabic languages in their own worldview. Moreover, Arabic has changed over time that even Arab Muslims do not understand the fact that seemingly common words may carry distinctive theological meanings in the Qur’an.During the 1400 years in the Arab world, Islam and Christianity have proceeded within their own respective hermeneutic communities that some vocabularies, religious or theological, began to take up different meanings or distinctive nuances.This paper examines how Christian and Muslim communities use the vocabularies such as Dhihn, Ruḥ, Nafs, Nafs lawwamah, Birr, and Taqwa, in distinctive ways within their respective theological contexts. By one practical implication, this writer suggests that the Bible study materials for discipling BMBs(or CMBs) should incorporate such linguistic characteristics instead of using existing Bible study materials that are readily used in non-Islamic context.When the commonly used vocabularies by Arab Christians and Arab Muslims pertain differences in the theological content and concept, it is argued that one should consider a semantic- (rhetorical)- interpretive approach as a solution. Specifically, this writer proposes the following procedures: a thorough word study of the original language, the use of rhetoric elements such as Majaz (a meaning other than the original meaning), and an analysis of examining the semantic fields. For example, it is demonstrated that the use of Majaz is beneficial in explaining the “Son of God” to BMB. While the conventional theories and strategies in Arab world ministries are much appreciated, this writer proposes this new approach based on the linguistic features in Arab Muslim context would produce better results in teaching the Bible to Arab Christians and Arab Muslims.

TI  - Detecting leaf phosphorus content in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi-inoculated soybean using hyperspectral remote sensing data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING FOR AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS, AND HYDROLOGY XXII
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing for Agriculture, Ecosystems, and Hydrology XXII held at SPIE Remote Sensing Conference
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Phosphorus (P) is an important parameter participated in the process of metabolism, photosynthesis, and energy exchange of crops. A growing number of studies have focused on effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) inoculation on crop P uptake. In this context, efficient and nondestructive monitoring of the changes of leaf P content (LPC) in inoculated crops is of vital. In this study, hyperspectral remote sensing was explored in an attempt to diagnose P deficiency in the inoculated and non-inoculated soybean plants. Greenhouse pot experiment was conducted under drought stresses, and measurements of leaf spectral reflectance and LPC were carried out at the 30th, 45th and 64 th days after inoculation. We transformed the raw spectral reflectance (R) into the first derivation (FD), second derivation (SD), reciprocal (1/R), reciprocal logarithm (log(1/R)) and first derivation of log(1/R) (log'(1/R)). Results indicated that the AMF-inoculated plant had significantly higher LPC than the counterparts under different drought stresses. Analysis of the correlation between LPC and the raw and five transformed reflectance in the 350-2500 nm spectral range indicated that the green bands center around 545 nm and 567 nm, as well as near infrared (NIR) band center around 832 nm were the most sensitive (r>0.73). The kernel ridge regression (KRR) of LPC with the sensitive bands selected from the raw/transformed reflectance was performed, showing that FD, 1/R and log(1/R) produced excellent results in LPC assessment, with determination of coefficient (R-2) all larger than 0.70. Validation with independent samples revealed that the log(1/R)-KRR model achieved the strongest and superior prediction accuracy, with R-2 of 0.93, RMSE of 0.23 g/kg and RRMSE of 7.8%, respectively. Our results indicate that the log(1/R)-KRR derived from hyperspectral remote sensing data can provide the most suitable estimation model for describing the dynamic changes of LPC in the AMF-inoculated soybean.

TI  - Cross-cultural communication - lost in translation: A corpus study
T2  - RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF LINGUISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to cross-cultural communication and its implementation in Polish translations of Russian fiction. Nowadays, both the study of national specifics relating to the worldviews of speakers of different languages, and the analysis of the way those worldviews are reflected in translation, are becoming more relevant. This article aims to study the properties of cross-cultural dialogue, which is mirrored in parallel fictional texts. The research material came from the Russian-Polish corpus. The analysis indicates that nationally specific features can manifest themselves on different levels of the language system - in vocabulary, phraseology, word formation, morphology, and syntax. The translation of sentences which include units representative of the Russian linguistic worldview demonstrates both cross-cultural successes and failures (omission of elements symbolic of Russian culture, their inaccurate interpretation or replacement with items typical of the Polish worldview). The existing printed and electronic dictionaries, as well as online translators, do not fully meet current requirements, including those related to conveying Russian cultural and linguistic senses by means of the Polish language. The practice of translating literary works from Russian into Polish demonstrates the need for further investigation of the worldviews of both nations.

AB  - A regional chemistry-transport model and remote sensing observations are used to study the absorption properties of organic carbon in biomass burning (BB) aerosol emitted from wildfires in Siberia. Using multi-wavelength retrievals of the absorption and extinction aerosol optical depths (AAOD and AOD) at Siberian sites of AERONET, we obtained an empirical relationship enabling the estimation of the contribution of brown carbon (BrC) to the BB aerosol absorption in a near-UV spectral region by using available satellite observations of AAOD and AOD. Application of this relationship to constrain our simulations of a large-scale episode of transport of BB plumes from Siberia towards Europe allowed us to parameterize an imaginary part of the refractive index of organic carbon in Siberian BB aerosol as a function of the BB aerosol photochemical age as well as to estimate the efficient mass fraction of BrC in the smoke plumes.

AB  - The article analyzes the apprehension of Handel's musical heritage by the Western European and American literary criticism. Despite the multifaceted study of Handel's works, the author unravels an unexplored area-tragic oratorios. The unraveling was conditioned by the moral stance of Handel, formed by his ethical attitude to reality. In the embodiment of his oratorios' concepts, he reached the level of comprehending music as a reflection of spiritual and emotional life (an idea which consolidated only at the end of the 18th century); and in his individual understanding of the personality's image, he created a special kind of vocal-instrumental choral genre, majestic, exalted by the concept of faith, unprecedented in value and scale-a tragic oratorio. It turned out to be a kind of meta-genre, which absorbed the previous ample artistic experience and had the potential to pass its messages to humanity in the future, extrapolating its energy to other genres. Taking the moral and religious values, which dominated over earthly passions, as a model, Handel, apparently, set the task of cultivating his listeners and thereby "ideafied" his oratorical works. The paradox, however, was in the fact that by crystallizing the characters' desire to make the most graceful moral choice, the composer showed them tragic hopelessness. By doing so, he proved to be a philosopher-artist, whose worldview was largely determined by conflicting dualism: the lofty Christian ethics and Western European secular morality.Having created a gallery of tragedy heroes, Handel showed their moral basis as not monolithic, but fundamentally disharmonious: their inner spiritual worlds were split by irreconcilable contradictions, existing both within and in the relation with the outside world. The protagonists, illuminated by transcendental light (Christ, Theodora, Jephthah), strived for spiritual perfection while suffering severely on their ways to its achievement. With such tragic characters, the composer brought the baroque ethical and aesthetic system to its highest limits-to the boundaries of the classical art of the Enlightenment and even beyond.

TI  - The "Magic Tablecloth": Personal Property and Sovkhoism in Soviet and Post-Soviet Russia
T2  - REGION
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper discusses the concept of personal property as an ideological construct of Soviet power in its agricultural application. The case in point is the collectivized reindeer husbandry of the Russian Far North. I argue that personal property, as it developed in Soviet agricultural history, was a critical, informally employed tool in the creation of an existentially secure, paternalistic reality, represented by the Soviet farm (sovkhoz). "Sovkhoism" is introduced as a cover term for the practices and general worldview symbolized by the sovkhoz. A methodological claim I make is that reindeer husbandry provides the best possible example of how sovkhoism was engendered and developed. The paper also looks at post-Soviet reinterpretations of sovkhoism and makes predictions for its future. I conclude that the study of personal property and the worldview of sovkhoism calls attention to the role of mixed property categories and, further, the blurring of categorial distinctions in general. The blurring of the line between private and public (collective) property in the case discussed, with its lasting attractiveness for powered and disempowered actors alike, provides a hitherto ignored explanation for the popularity of Soviet and Soviet-like regimes.

AB  - Recently, there has been a remarkable growth in Artificial Intelligence (AI) with the development of efficient AI models and high-power computational resources for processing complex datasets. There have been a growing number of applications of machine learning in satellite remote sensing image data processing. In India, agriculture has a huge impact on the national economy and most of the critical decisions are dependent on agricultural statistics. In this work, machine learning models have been applied for crop classification of Sentinel-2 satellite temporal remote sensing image data. Guntur district region of Andhra Pradesh, India has been used as the study area. The main reasons for selecting this region are the diversity of agricultural crops and the availability of ground truth. The performance of machine learning models Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Convolution Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and RNN with Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) have been evaluated for crop classification. Classification accuracies are generally evaluated by using test data. In most cases the classification accuracy from test data is not commensurate to estimated crop areas from the classified image. Such methods limit the estimated crop areas acceptance for official purposes. The uniqueness of this work is the classification accuracy is evaluated by estimated crop areas. The results show that SVM has the best F1 score of 0.99 and estimated major crop areas have 95.9% agreement with the ground surveyed crop area.

AB  - The paper shows the results of optical measurements carried out during the coccolithophore bloom and the primary bio-optical characteristics obtained. Blooming coccolithophores produce a significant amount of mineral suspension, increasing light scattering and reducing the transparency of water. An increase in the backward scattering leads to an increase in the upwelling radiance and the reflectance coefficient of the sea water. On the base of field and satellite data, the characteristics of coccolithophore bloom in June 2017 in the Black Sea are calculated. A weak relationship between the biological and optical characteristics of the bloom is observed. It is shown that in 2017 the optical properties at the test site were determined not only by coccolithophore suspension, but also by a suspension of terrigenous origin. Suspension concentrations and optical parameters during the bloom are estimated.

TI  - ORGANISED FREETHINKING IN RUSSIA IN LARGE CITIES (WITH MOSCOW AND ST. PETERSBURG AS EXAMPLES)
T2  - VESTNIK PRAVOSLAVNOGO SVYATO-TIKHONOVSKOGO GUMANITARNOGO UNIVERSITETA-SERIYA I-BOGOSLOVIE-FILOSOFIYA-RELIGIOVEDENIE
M3  - Article
AB  - Our paper aims to present a comprehensive study of the present-day freethinkers in Moscow and St Petersburg. By means of a questionnaire-based survey (N=669), we analyse social and political attitudes and features of freethinkers' worldview. The article proposes an operational definition of a freethinker. In compliance with this definition, we, for example, exclude from the study representatives of other faiths. Beside the analysis of the general sample, the article identifies the specificity of the organised freethinking in both capitals. Organised freethinking is represented by a number of public organisations and non-formal societies of cultural, educational, and social orientation whose aim is to criticise religion, church and to promote secular ideas in society. Apart from the questionnaire, we have used data of 14 interviews with leaders of organisations and with their active members. The data obtained by the questionnaire show that freethinkers do not make up a homogenous community, but are a milieu that consists of subgroups with differences in their worldview, political preferences, attitudes to religion and the church. The following previously observed regularities have been confirmed: the freethinker is most often a man younger than 39, with a higher or incomplete higher technical education, with medium income. A significant percentage of those inclined to superstitions shows a contradictory character of freethinkers' worldview. Anticlerical and antireligious attitudes are rather strong, but the interviewees demonstrate tolerance towards religious persons. There is no significant differences between those belonging to organisations and communities (N=150) and other freethinkers in terms of their social and demographic properties or views. But the organised freethinkers have a more active position as to defending their ideals in the Internet and in the public domain. Organised freethinking in both capitals is not a mass phenomenon. Despite the increase in the anticlerical attitudes in society, freethinkers are not eager to unite into organisations and are considerably disjointed.

TI  - Linguistic and Cultural Worldview of Modern Bilingual Chinese American Writers
T2  - RUPKATHA JOURNAL ON INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES IN HUMANITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with Chinese inclusions in the novels by modern Chinese American writers E. Tang and M.H. Kingston. In the process of the study different types of bilingualism are taken into consideration. Being bilingual representatives of the second-generation immigrants both E. Tang and M.H. Kingston can evaluate the level of linguistic and cultural assimilation of the Chinese in the multinational environment. The research is focused on the ways linguistic and cultural worldview of bilingual authors is reflected in their works. To reach the goal of the research the continuous sampling method is used to collect the data. Though in most cases the authors explain or translate inclusions, we find it important to track the origin of the inclusions under study. The analysis has shown that the majority of Chinese inclusions illustrate such basic cultural values as family circle, forms of address, cuisine and etc. Inclusions in the texts prove that root culture and newly acquired one peacefully coexist in Chinese community in the USA. The results indicate that inclusions employed by the authors in the novels reveal their personal emotional attitude to the characters and prove that their bilingualism and biculturalism help to bridge the gap between different cultures and nations.

TI  - The Dialogue between Religious Educational Tradition and Scientific Pedagogy of Morality: Cognitive Schemas in the Logic of Similarities and Differences
T2  - BOGOSLOVNI VESTNIK-THEOLOGICAL QUARTERLY-EPHEMERIDES THEOLOGICAE
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this article is to search for correlations that would be meaningfully verified and logically justified, such as pedagogical description of an individual's social behavior, which would be focused on a priori personal recognition of the religious form as the standard of building individual moral intentions and their social embodiment, and social behavior, emphasizing the conscious derivation of moral principles from non-religious human values and secular ethics. The authors substantiate the essential difference between religious and traditional scientific interpretation of the basic principles of moral behavior related to the degree and methods of individual's comprehension of the moral ,proto-form'. It is substantiated that the religious form of moral behavior is characterized by a significant degree of inclusion of apriorism, which frees the individual from the need to independently seek the basic moral principles, confining him/herself to a priori faith in ,religious maxims'. It is shown that the traditional scholarly intentional-and-semantic representation of morality presupposes 1) the ,withdrawal' of moral positions from religious content by means of empirical, conceptual-and-theoretical and contextual ,tools' and the resulting 2) independent construction by the individual of a moral improvement roadmap, which would enable non-religious multi-aspect reflection. This conclusion is supplemented by the identification of the correlation of religious and scholarly pedagogical interpretation of the concept of 'tolerance'.

TI  - GRAPHIC NOVEL ADAPTATION OF "AND QUIET FLOWS THE DON" BY M. SHOLOKHOV (THE RUSSIAN-SERBIAN COMIC STRIP "THE COSSACKS")
T2  - PHILOLOGICAL CLASS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with the graphic novel "The Cossacks: A novel about the life of the Don Cossacks" by S. Soloviev published in Belgrade in 1938-1939. This is a kind of adaptation of the first two books of Mikhail Sholokhov's novel "And Quiet Flows the Don". The graphic novel under review is one of the first creative products of the ninth kind of art in Serbia and is connected with the emergence of this phenomenon in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Its publication laid the foundation of the famous "Belgrade School", which developed the European traditions of graphic literature. The interest of the Yugoslavian community in the Cossacks and in Sholokhov coincided with the publication of the graphic novel. The study shows the conditions, under which the Russian .Serbian graphic novel was created, and analyzes its structure, plot lines, characters and etymology of the names. With reference to Sholokhov's "Md Quiet Flows the Don", the graphic novel "The Cossacks" may be considered as a kind of pastiche - a plot contamination of epic story about real events with an adventurous narrative. Of particular interest is the artistic-conceptual presence of the elements of Sholokhov's artistic world in the sphere of synthetic art. There are significant esthetic differences between the epic novel of Sholokhov and the graphic novel of S. Soloviev. Still it is possible to find attempts to preserve the language of the characters and the specificity of the author's speech. The outcome of the adaptation of Sholokhov's masterpiece can be presented in the following way: a transformation of the literary text into a visual-narrative discourse takes place in its course. The visual-narrative unity of the comics about the Don Cossacks makes it possible to unite separate scenes and dialogues into a holistic picture. A new, postmodern method of packing the meanings - a special form of realization of a folklore mythopoetic kind of worldview - is created. "The Cossacks" is based on the poetics of a comic strip, the essence of which boils down to an adventurous plot focusing on the unity of character and speech. In this interpretation, the graphic novel, being a complete modification of the text of "And Quiet Flows the Don", remains on the marginal pages of Sholokhov studies. Nevertheless, it contains a significant communicative, cognitive and literary-artistic potential and is a successful attempt to build a certain cultural bridge between the two Slavic peoples.

M3  - Article
AB  - Aim. Islands and peninsulas in the Volga are of great environmental and recreational importance for the Volgograd agglomeration. Identifying the current state of geocomplexes in the Sareptsky peninsula allow us to assess the developmental trends of the floodplain ecosystems in the Lower Volga, which are under intense economic pressures.Material and Methods. The mapping was done by decoding Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and drawing landscape contours using the QGIS program. Field work was carried out in June 2019. Seven test plots were laid out. Inventory of forest plantations was undertaken with distribution of trees according to condition and a geobotanical description of the grass stand was done.Results. The Sareptsky peninsula was revealed to be an island by origin that was artificially attached to the native coast. The landscape structure of the peninsula includes 6 natural-anthropogenic complexes, of which the largest area (62.9%) is occupied by natural floodplain forest and cultivated forest. 13.9% is occupied by water meadows of the central floodplain, 8.0% by aquatic complexes of inland water bodies, 7.3% by anthropogenically transformed areas (settlements and industrial lands, roads and hydraulic structures), 5.1% by open areas of fresh-water floodplain and 2.8% by beach shoals of the river channel floodplain. The signs were revealed of a negative effect on the Volga through the regulation of its flow from desiccation of poplars and meagre species composition of meadow vegetation. It was established that the territory of the peninsula is exposed to a small extent by recreational activities.Conclusion. Landscape-ecological studies made in the Sareptsky peninsula allowed the assessment of the current state of forest and meadow ecosystems, the identification of the principal factors involved in the deterioration of their ecological status and the articulation of a better way to optimize nature management.

AB  - Estimations of the morphological and microphysical characteristics of mesoscale convective complexes (MCC) in the south of Western Siberia for 2010-2019 years received. It was noted that the MCC lengths along latitude and longitude are on average similar to 140 and 120 km, and typical ranges of their change (limited by the 25th and 75th percentiles) are 120 divided by 160 km and 100 divided by 130 km, respectively. The MCC upper boundary height is on average 12 km and generally changes in the range from 9 to 13 km. The MCC cloud particles effective radius is on average 27 microns and typical range of his change are 25 divided by 29 microns. The integral water content of MCC clouds is on average 1,2 kg/m(2), and most often varies in the range from 0,8 to 2,1 kg/m(2).

AB  - Fuel moisture content (FMC) is an important fuel property and an important parameter controlling the rate spread of a wildland fire. Currently the dead FMC is estimated based on relatively sparse observations over Conterminous United States while the live FMC is sampled manually and infrequently. An effective operational wildland fire prediction requires real-time, high-resolution fuel moisture content data set. We have therefore developed a fuel moisture content data set by combining satellite and surface observations as well as National Water Model output using a machine learning model. The new FMC data set is integrated in the Colorado Fire Prediction System (CO-FPS) for operational wildland fire prediction.

M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.
AB  - Theoretical understanding of the thermodynamic controls on tropical cyclone (TC) wind intensity, as well as numerical simulations, implies a positive trend in TC intensity in a warming world. The global instrumental record of TC intensity, however, is known to be heterogeneous in both space and time and is generally unsuitable for global trend analysis. To address this, a homogenized data record based on satellite data was previously created for the period 1982-2009. The 28-y homogenized record exhibited increasing global TC intensity trends, but they were not statistically significant at the 95% confidence level. Based on observed trends in the thermodynamic mean state of the tropical environment during this period, however, it was argued that the 28-y period was likely close to, but shorter than, the time required for a statistically significant positive global TC intensity trend to appear. Here the homogenized global TC intensity record is extended to the 39-y period 1979-2017, and statistically significant (at the 95% confidence level) increases are identified. Increases and trends are found in the exceedance probability and proportion of major (Saffir-Simpson categories 3 to 5) TC intensities, which is consistent with expectations based on theoretical understanding and trends identified in numerical simulations in warming scenarios. Major TCs pose, by far, the greatest threat to lives and property. Between the early and latter halves of the time period, the major TC exceedance probability increases by about 8% per decade, with a 95% CI of 2 to 15% per decade.

TI  - TRANSFORMATION OF THE MYTH OF PYGMALION AND GALATEA IN H. HEINE'S ARTISTIC PROSE
T2  - IMAGOLOGIYA I KOMPARATIVISTIKA-IMAGOLOGY AND COMPARATIVE STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The article focuses on the transformation of the myth of Pygmalion and Galatea in H. Heine's artistic prose. The author draws on mythological studies (A.F. Losev, O.M. Freidenberg, N.V. Braginskaya) and studies of Heine's literary texts (S.P. Gidzheu, V.A. Pronin, S. Wurfel, M. Broad, J. Sammons and others). The mythologem of the "revived statue" is relevant for the literature of the early 19th century due to "remythologisation" and increased attention of romanticists to the synthesis of arts. Heinrich Heine actively uses the images of living statues and paintings, including those that really exist, in his journalism and lyrics. The idea of a revived statue is rooted in the ancient story of a hero charmed by a statue. Antique ekphrases record the similarity of a work of art with a divine model, outlining an obvious connection with the problem of imitation as a key problem of ancient aesthetics. In the antique world, statues were the objects of love and aesthetic worship, perceived as reservoirs of divine powers and visible evidence of the art transforming power. Heine addresses the problem of a sculpted copy realism and raises the debatable question of the relationship between illusion and reality, the living and dead, nature and creations of human genius. Ancient and medieval sources are used in romantic poetry as a syncretic unity, including deep meanings associated with the author's personality. Heine uses Antiquity and Christianity as a component of the myth of Pygmalion and Galatea, playing with their oppositions: polytheism and monotheism in his poetry are both opposed to as well as mixed with each other. The myth of a reviving statue in Heine's prose often leads to the motifs of Plato's epistemology caused by the dualism of Plato's cosmology. The myth of Pygmalion and Galatea demonstrates the specificity of a romantic worldview, which seeks to combine poetry, philosophy, and mythology. The archetypal basis of the plot and the Neoplatonic paradigm act as a synthetic unity, which provides the narrative with universality and polysemy, often reducing it to a symbol or reference. In H. Hein's works, the images of reviving statues are often subject to symbolisation or travesty reevaluation, demonstrating a certain inconsistency of the mimetic idea in plastic art that captures one frozen moment. Heine's image of ideal, inaccessible beauty is verified by human Imagination, which gives subjective emotionality and dynamics to the object reproduced in art.

AB  - Lignite mining in Greece has been a huge industry. Especially, in the extraction site of Western Macedonia many villages were relocated due to the site's spatial growth. Public Power Corporation (PPC) SA Ptolemaida lignite mine is the biggest in Balkans that contributes significantly to country's electricity production. This paper aims at formulating a methodological procedure in order to delineate rapidly the lignite coal mine boundaries through an object based image analysis, in Orfeo ToolBox and QGIS. Site boundaries can be modified through expansion of mining activities or unexpectedly due to a natural disaster. For that reason, a Sentinel-2A imagery was obtained and three frequent segmentation approaches were applied including MeanShift, Watershed and Morphological profiles, from a notable remote sensing open source package (Orfeo Toolbox). Following various tests, the optimal parameters for each segmentation algorithm are presented alongside with the corresponding results regarding lignite mine area boundaries delineation. In addition, the proposed methodological framework may apply to different environmental subjects monitoring including large constructions, mineral extraction, landfills and archaeological sites.

AB  - The article presents the results of a theoretical study of human health. The ideas about the nature and criteria of personal health from the standpoint of modern humanitarian knowledge are generalized. The main approaches to the problem of personal psychological health are presented. The study of personal health was carried out from the standpoint of the Christian doctrine of man, formed in line with the Eastern Christian worldview, according to which human nature is a trinity of spirit, soul and body. The spiritual basis is considered as the main basis in man, which, in the normative type of his organization, has a transformative effect on his soul and body. Various characteristics of personal spiritual and moral health are given and their role in implementation of man's life mission is shown. The interrelations of spiritual, mental and physical health, as well as the causes of diseases and their spiritual meaning are investigated. Personal health is considered as an integral, complex, multi-level socio-cultural formation, including psychophysical, psychological, spiritual and moral characteristics of man.

AB  - The surface soil freezing and thawing (F/T) status plays important roles in water and energy exchanges, hydrology cycle and terrestrial ecosystem. Passive microwave remote sensing tends to be one of the most effective ways of monitoring global surface F/T status, due to its strong sensitivity to the changes of liquid water and its short revisiting period. Many surface F/T products have been produced based on the observations from different passive microwave sensors. However, due to the differences in spatial scales, satellite data sources, transit times etc., the accuracy and the consistency of different F/T products need to be well considered in front of the comprehensive utilization. In this study, the surface F/T products with resolutions of 36 km, 25 km, 25 km and 6 km derived from SMAP, SSMIS, AMSR-2, AMSR-2 (downscaling) were validated separately based on the in-situ observations in Ngari prefecture and Maqu on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Then a comparison analysis was conducted on the F/T products derived from SMAP and SSMIS to figure out the consistency between F/T products derived from different sensors. The results show that: 1) the verification accuracy in Maqu is higher than that in Ngari prefecture, which reflects the limited capability of passive microwave in identifying the soil surface F/T status in the arid region. 2) The F/T products with resolutions of 6 km and 25 km, which were both derived from AMSR-2 and have the same transit time, showed similar validation accuracies. 3) There is a good agreement between the F/T products derived from SMAP and that from SSMIS. This study will be conducive to the comprehensive application of multi-scale F/T products in the fields of climate change and ecological environment.

AB  - Since the huge earth quake in 2011 in Japan, the Japanese government has strongly encouraged growth of renewable energy use. As a result, even we focus on only mega-solar photovoltaic (PV) power plants (> 1.000 kW), the amount of the power generation significantly increased. Because such rapid increasing of the PV power plants changes land use widely, verification of the spreading of the PV power plants should be essential for assessing economic/environmental issues. In this study, to verify the increasing of the PV power plants based on observations, we applied a method that can detect the PV power plants efficiently with a convolutional neural network to Landsat-8 images. From the detection, we successfully identified the increasing of the area of the PV power plants quantitatively at the same time identifying the location of each PV power plant in many prefectures in the capital region of Japan.

TI  - TRANSFORMATION PROCESSES IN THE RIVER-BASIN SYSTEM OF BYSTRYTSIA AND THEIR GEOINFORMATION-CARTOGRAPHIC MODELS
T2  - GEODYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The problem of assessing the scales and direction of the development of transformation processes that occur in river systems and components of the natural environment of their basins under the influence of a wide range of factors in the long run, remains an urgent task. This is due to the diversity of human and societal impacts on river basin systems (RBS) and the need to assess the effects of global and regional climate change and their impact on water runoff, sediments and solutes discharges, the geoecological status of river basin systems. To a large extent, this applies to the river basin systems of the Carpathian region, thus the river basin system of Bystrytsia is being selected as a study object, as well as the right-bank tributary of the Dnister, located in Ivano-Frankivsk region and covering mountain (Ukrainian Carpathians) and foothill (Precarpathian) landscapes with peculiar natural and economic conditions. This RBS is typical for the Carpathian region, so the results will also reflect the situation in other RBS. The aim of the paper is the quantitative assessment of the scales and long-term trends in the development of transformation processes in the structure of the river basin system of Bystrytsia, the exploration of the range of factors responsible for these changes and their geoecological consequences and the reflection of the results on a series of cartographic models of RBS. The performed research is based on a complex technique, which combines methods of cartometric analysis of the structure of river systems on the basis of different time (1855, 1925, 1955, 1975, 2008) topographic maps of scale 1: 100 000; methods of analysis of the state of landscape components (soils, forest cover, land structure, etc.) and their long-term changes; methods of analysis of monitoring data on changes of objects and development of processes (water, sediments, and dissolved substances of runoff in rivers, manifestation of erosion, mudflow, landslide, karst, mining processes; industrial, agricultural, forestry and water management activities, sewage discharges, surface water and groundwater intake, etc.); methods of remote sensing data analysis and geoinformation-cartographic modeling. As a result of the performed research the conceptual model of transformation processes in river basin systems which occur under the influence of natural and anthropogenic factors is developed, parameters of structure of river systems are defined (number of rivers of different orders, their length, general order of RBS on each "time slice" of its state), the scale of development of transformation processes in RBS Bystrytsia from one time slice to the next and for the whole studied period, the degree of influence of natural and anthropogenic factors on these transformations and their geoecological consequences is revealed and estimated as well. A series of digital maps of RBS Bystrytsia have been compiled, which reflect the main results of the research. A set of environmental measures aimed at improving the river and basin system of Bystrytsia and measures to optimize nature management is substantiated.

TI  - Interviral Recombination between Plant, Insect, and Fungal RNA Viruses: Role of the Intracellular Ca<SUP>2+</SUP>/Mn<SUP>2+</SUP> Pump
T2  - JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recombination is one of the driving forces of viral evolution. RNA recombination events among similar RNA viruses are frequent, although RNA recombination could also take place among unrelated viruses. In this paper, we have established efficient interviral recombination systems based on yeast and plants. We show that diverse RNA viruses, including the plant viruses tomato bushy stunt virus, carnation Italian ring-spot virus, and turnip crinkle virus-associated RNA; the insect plus-strand RNA [(+)RNA) viruses Flock House virus and Nodamura virus; and the double-stranded L-A virus of yeast, are involved in interviral recombination events. Most interviral recombinants are minus-strand recombinant RNAs, and the junction sites are not randomly distributed, but there are certain hot spot regions. Formation of interviral recombinants in yeast and plants is accelerated by depletion of the cellular SERCA-like Pmr1 ATPase-driven Ca2+/Mn2+ pump, regulating intracellular Ca2+ and Mn2+ influx into the Golgi apparatus from the cytosol. The interviral recombinants are generated by a template-switching mechanism during RNA replication by the viral replicase. Replication studies revealed that a group of interviral recombinants is replication competent in cell-free extracts, in yeast, and in the plant Nicotiana benthamiana. We propose that there are major differences among the viral replicases to generate and maintain interviral recombinants. Altogether, the obtained data promote the model that host factors greatly contribute to the formation of recombinants among related and unrelated viruses. This is the first time that a host factor's role in affecting interviral recombination is established.IMPORTANCE Viruses with RNA genomes are abundant, and their genomic sequences show astonishing variation. Genetic recombination in RNA viruses is a major force behind their rapid evolution, enhanced pathogenesis, and adaptation to their hosts. We utilized a previously identified intracellular Ca2+/Mn2+ pump-deficient yeast to search for interviral recombinants. Noninfectious viral replication systems were used to avoid generating unwanted infectious interviral recombinants. Altogether, interviral RNA recombinants were observed between plant and insect viruses, and between a fungal double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) virus and an insect virus, in the yeast host. In addition, interviral recombinants between two plant virus replicon RNAs were identified in N. benthamiana plants, in which the intracellular Ca2+/ Mn2+ pump pump was depleted. These findings underline the crucial role of the host in promoting RNA recombination among unrelated viruses.

TI  - "ANGELIC CREATIONS" IN THE V. RASPUTIN'S PROSE: SPECIFICITY OF REPRESENTATION, FUNCTIONS
T2  - PHILOLOGICAL CLASS
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the article is to analyze the typology of messengers (from Old Greek:, angelos) in V. Rasputin's prose: from pagan mediators, fools to saints and "angelic creatures". In spiritual culture, the messenger is "a superhuman being, an intermediary between man and God". The paper examines the poetics of meeting and communicating with the messengers (chronotope and circumstances), changing their functions. The originality of the message that the messengers reveal to the heroes is described. The importance of images of the messengers, whose efforts make the connection between times, is determined by the specifics of the writer's worldview, which is based on the belief in the unity of the world and man. Heroes see prophetic dreams, visions, communicate with deceased ancestors, which matches with archaic visionary practices.Messengers in the artist's prose have their own special functionality, which is emphasized by the typology. The messengers-neurotransmitters bind to different worlds, easily passing through the border (a wise raven from the story "What to convey to the crow?"); wise old women, fools can approach the mystery, open the borders of existence to the limits of mystery. Angelic creatures stand out of the indicated range. Natasha from the story with the same title, the girl Katya from "The Unexpectedly" ("Suddenly"), nurses with "iconpainted faces" from the story "In the Hospital", whose appearance among people was initially defined as a miracle. The meeting with the angel is built on the model of the tester and the test subject, instantly revealing the spiritual potential of the individual. Images of the angels also differ from each other. If the images of Natasha and the nurses are correlated with the figure of the guardian angel, then the girl Katya is associated with the image of the Witness of God. The appearance of the Witness on the Earth occurs in tragic times. The emphasis on the angelic images in the master's later work is associated with an increase in the tragedy of the worldview, he can't help seeing the thinning of faith and the powerlessness of the people. The writer falls into despair, but hopes for the possibility of a miracle, the nostalgia for which permeates all his later prose.

AB  - One of the prime objectives for orbital civilian SARs is forest observation. Though tremendous effort has been devoted to improving applications like biomass estimation and deforestation detection, the reliability has been impeded by insufficient knowledge about spatial-temporal variabilities of forest backscatter. In the tropics, these backscatter fluctuations are largely controlled by the rainfall regime. This paper investigates the impact of rainfall on L-band forest observation using 300 TB pan-tropical ALOS-2 ScanSAR timeseries with 1.5 billion TRMNI based GSMaP precipitation datasets. The results show that the correlation between forest gamma naught and antecedent rainfall can exceed R=0.9 in many areas outside the rainforest. In the rainforest strong negative correlation below R=-0.8 can occur in the severely flooded forest. We assess the impact of rainfall on deforestation detection accuracies and discuss a new classification scheme for tropical forests using statistics of seasonal backscattering behaviors together with response to precipitation.

AB  - This quality improvement project's purpose was to define and provide best practices in surgical patient positioning and transfer processes with the surgical spine table to increase patient safety. Using the Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control quality improvement framework, a multidisciplinary team analyzed surveys, qualitative interviews, ergonomics, near-miss sentinel events and skin integrity data to standardize this process. Results reinforced the need to develop and standardize the process of patient positioning and transfer from cart to table. Findings resulted in practice changes, including a standardized best practice for transfer of patients, educational tools, and checklists for continued monitoring of patient safety issues. Metrics for intervention effectiveness include reduced patient skin integrity, increased staff satisfaction, and improved comfort level with use of spine table accessories and equipment. This practice improvement has a patient safety focus in the perioperative nursing practice.

AB  - The forests of the permafrost zone of Central Siberia are influenced by natural and anthropogenic factors. Using remote sensing data, disturbed areas of forest cover are detected in the IR range as an anomalies of the surface temperature, which are significant for a long time (similar to 20 years). Long-term changes in the temperature balance of the surface affect both the state of the lower soil horizons and the dynamics of the seasonally thawed layer, and, therefore, can affect the variation in the water balance and groundwater runoff. For the area of interest, a trend is shown of similar to 20% increase in the total area of disturbances per last two decades. A correlation analysis between large-scale thermal anomalies of the underlying surface and the series of gravimetric data on Equivalent Water Height (EWH) parameter is performed for the territory of the two river basins of the Nizhnyaya Tunguska and Podkamennaya Tunguska (Central Siberia). As a first approximation we estimated the relationship between the forest and on-ground cover disturbance and thermal anomalies of the underlying surface, which affect the seasonal dynamics of groundwater.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to present the problem of the integration of the global positioning system (GPS)/global navigation satellite system (GLONASS) data for the processing of aircraft position determination. Design/methodology/approach The aircraft coordinates were obtained based on GPS and GLONASS code observations for the single point positioning (SPP) method. The numerical computations were executed in the aircraft positioning software (APS) package. The mathematical scheme of equation observation of the SPP method was solved using least square estimation in stochastic processing. In the research experiment, the raw global navigation satellite system data from the Topcon HiperPro onboard receiver were applied. Findings In the paper, the mean errors of an aircraft position from APS were under 3 m. In addition, the accuracy of aircraft positioning was better than 6 m. The integrity term for horizontal protection level and vertical protection level parameters in the flight test was below 16 m.Social implications The paper is addressed to persons who work in aviation and air transport. Originality/value The paper presents the SPP method as a satellite technique for the recovery of an aircraft position in an aviation test.

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Digital surface models representing the heights of an area can be derived from two or more (multi-) stereo images of airborne or spaceborne sensors. A satellite stereo image of a current very-high-resolution satellite like WorldView or GeoEye with ground pixel sizes of about half a meter allows the derivation of surface models in the range of the same resolution. Such surface models are the basis of many applications like the three-dimensional representation of the area, 3D change detection, calculation of volumes, detection of sight lines, or water flow and flooding. Satellite imagery covers large areas of about 400 square kilometers with ground resolution of about 1 meter, while airborne images from planes or drones usually cover only small areas but with higher resolution. In this chapter the basics of digital surface models are shown, and the actually best method for deriving dense digital surface models from airborne and spaceborne images is described. Some examples finally show the possible results.

T2  - SOTSIOLOGICHESKIE ISSLEDOVANIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article focuses on the analysis of the dynamics of the subject of sociology, proceeding from the fact that all sociological paradigms have studied, one way or another, the conditions and tendencies of changes in the life-worlds of people, although the representatives of each of them did it in their own way, which was determined by the dominant social problems. The accelerating and complicated development of nature and society under the influence of the "arrow of time" (I. Prigogine) required the complication of theoretical and methodological tools, which resulted in successive transitions from mechanistic monodisciplinarity, the instruments of which were borrowed from the natural sciences, to sociological disciplinarity, then to the increasingly complex interdisciplinarity and further to the development of post-disciplinarity, which, however, preserves the sociological core. At the same time, the article reveals specific contribution of world sociological congresses that took place in the 21st century, as well as individual scientists, to the development of the subject of sociological science in the context of the transition from Newtonian to the nonlinear-Einstein picture of the world. The author comes to the conclusion that the transition to more complex, actually modern inter- and post-disciplinary methodologies does not mean diminishing or denying the significance of previously created tools - each of them can be effective for the analysis of phenomena of different structural and functional complexity. He also suggests that post-disciplinarity with the sociological core should be given a humanistic vector of development. In this he sees the general prospects for the humanization of knowledge and life-worlds of people in the development of digital technologies, which carry both unprecedented alternatives to life and side-effects for people and society.

TI  - Data Fusion for Increasing Monitoring Capabilities of Sentinel Optical Data in Marine Environment
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine monitoring constitutes one of the main thematic areas of the Sentinel mission. The Sentinel 3 OLCI (S3) sensor provides satellite data for services relevant to the ocean and land. While the spatial resolution of S3 images (300 m) is suitable for most marine applications, there are some applications such as floating debris detection, suspended mater estimation, etc., that require higher resolution. To fulfill this requirement this study applies an unmixing-based data fusion technique on S3 and BRDF-corrected Sentinel 2 (S2) images and evaluates the fused data by calculating the correlation coefficient and the spectral angle distance (SAD) indexes. Then, it explores the increased monitoring capabilities of the fused image by applying improved chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and total suspended matter (TSM) algorithms, developed for satellite data. The fused image presents spectral similarity to S3 data and spatial similarity to S2 image. Consequently, the products provided by the fused image have much better resolution than those of S3 image, which enables detailed estimations of Chl-a and TSM concentrations. However, the dynamic nature of the marine environment that results in the formation of time-varying patterns at sea surface, in relation to the time lag between S2 and S3 image acquisitions may locally affect the accuracy of the products in the neighborhood of these patterns. This study exploits the effective elimination of directional reflectance effects in S2 ocean images, interprets the fused image and the generated ocean products, and points out the constraints regarding the synergy of Sentinel optical data for ocean areas.

AB  - The drainage basins or catchments for the Patagonian Ice Field are part of glacier inventories like the Randolph Glacier Inventory (RGI) or the Global Land Ice Measurements from Space (GLINTS), These catchments are used in many glaciological studies for integrating remote sensing measurements over the area of a single glacier. An accurate basin boundary delineation is therefore important for applications like mass balance measurements for individual glaciers in Patagonia, Here we investigate existing catchment delineations of the Southern Patagonian Ice Field (SPI) with a modified watershed algorithm that is capable of including ice velocity measurements from SAR offset tracking during the delineation process. The classical watershed delineation is performed using only a DEM. We show that apart from the basins of Bernardo, Greve, Tempano and Occidental there is no dependence of the basin boundary on the measured ice velocity direction and that the glaciers of SPI flow in the direction of the steepest surface slope of modern high resolution DEMs like the TDM global DEM or SRTM. Additionally, a map of basin probabilities has been produced, which highlights several locations on the ice field where the delineation of the exact basin boundary is difficult.

AB  - Polar mesocyclones (PMCs) and their intense subclass polar lows (PLs) are relatively small atmospheric vortices that form mostly over the ocean in high latitudes. PLs can strongly influence deep ocean water formation since they are associated with strong surface winds and heat fluxes. Detection and tracking of PLs are crucial for understanding the climatological dynamics of PLs and for the analysis of their impacts on other components of the climatic system. At the same time, visual tracking of PLs is a highly time-consuming procedure that requires expert knowledge and extensive examination of source data.There are known procedures involving deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) for the detection of large-scale atmospheric phenomena in reanalysis data that demonstrate a high quality of detection. However, one cannot apply these procedures to satellite data directly since, unlike reanalyses, satellite products register all the scales of atmospheric vortices. It is also known that DCNNs were originally designed to be scale-invariant. This leads to the problem of filtering of the scale of detected phenomena. There are other problems to be solved, such as low signal-to-noise ratio of satellite data, and an unbalanced number of negative (without PLs) and positive (where a PL is presented) classes in a satellite dataset.In our study, we propose a deep learning approach for the detection of PLs and PMCs in remote sensing data, which addresses class imbalance and scale filtering problems. We also outline potential solutions for other problems, along with promising improvements to the presented approach.

TI  - Biodiversity assessment of Indian mangroves using <i>in situ</i> observations and remotely sensed data
T2  - Biodiversity (Ottawa)
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves are one of the most productive coastal ecosystems, which act as natural barriers against natural calamities such as cyclones, tide upsurges and tsunamis. Mangrove ecosystems provide natural habitat for a wide variety of flora and fauna, whilst the economic contribution by mangroves for tourism, fisheries and other natural resources is also of paramount importance. This study focusses on the biodiversity of four major regions of Indian mangroves, namely, Bhitarkanika (Odisha), Pichavaram (Tamil Nadu), Chorao Islands (Goa) and Porlob Jig (Andaman and Nicobar Islands). The study aims to monitor the present status of mangroves in Southern and Eastern coasts of India, with the synergistic use of optical and SAR data. The aerial extents of all the Dominant vegetation spatial maps generated revealed that the Bhitarkanika mangroves had the largest extent (14425 ha) among the four mangrove regions. The second largest area recorded was by the Porlob Jig mangroves of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands (9972 ha), followed by the Pichavaram mangroves (788 ha) and the mangroves of Chorao Islands of Goa (603 ha). Decision makers, for taking the necessary conservation and management actions to protect these fragile, vital habitats can ultimately use this data.Key policy insightsThis paper provides an insight into the major mangrove species of India. It gives a detailed account of the varying mangrove biodiversity in the Eastern and Western coast of India. The prevalence of various kinds of mangroves from different ecosystems were documented. Among these, Rhizophora annamalayana specious was found indigenously in Tamil Nadu.

AB  - Cloud contamination represents a large obstacle for mapping the earth's surface using remotely sensed data. Therefore, cloudy pixels should be identified and eliminated before any further data processing can be achieved. Although several threshold, multi-temporal and machine learning applications have been developed to tackle this issue, it still remains a challenge. The main challenges are imposed by the difficulty to detect thin clouds and to separate bright clouds from bright non-cloud objects. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven to be one of the most promising methods for image classification tasks and their use is rapidly increasing in remote sensing problems. CNNs present interesting properties for image processing since they directly exploit not only the spectral information but also the spatial covariance of the data. In this work, we study the applicability of CNNs in cloud detection of Sentinel-2 imagery, a complex remote sensing problem with crucial spatial context. A patch-to-pixel CNN architecture consisting of three convolutional layers and two fully connected layers is trained on a recently available manually created public dataset. The results were evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively through comparison with ground truth cloud masks and state-of-the art pixel-based algorithms (Fmask, Sen2Cor). It was shown that the proposed architecture even though simpler than the deep learning architectures proposed by recent literature, performs very favorably, especially in the challenging cases. Besides the evaluation of the results, feature maps where observed as an initial effort to extract the weights of the useful kernels for cloud masking applications.

AB  - Climatic changes that have occurred over the past decades, with an acceleration of urbanization of territories and technological development, leads to the significant changes not only in the atmosphere, but also in the Earth's surface. Surface water bodies are one of these components. Today there are 3 main methods of monitoring water bodies - field, remote and combined. In this paper, we show the possibility of automating remote monitoring of water bodies using QGIS, Python and Sentinel-2 data of the main and largest lakes of the Kerch Peninsula. Having analysed both the available satellite data and the features of the study area, we came to the conclusion that it is advisable to use the NDWI index instead of the mNDWI. After processing and analysing the Sentinel-2 data for 2018 using the data processing model presented in the work, we obtained time series of changes in the areas of the studied lakes of the Kerch Peninsula.

AB  - Methodological issues of identifying active fracture zones as enhanced oil recovery zones using information-space technologies are considered. Because the insufficiency of seismic methods for identifying active fracture zones used landscape indicators of active fracturing zones, which are determined by the results of a joint analysis of seismic data and satellite images. To determine the landscape indicators, a summer satellite image of medium resolution (30 m.) Landsat was used. To identify landscape indicators of active fracture zones, the landscape features of the field territory were used, in particular, the directions of rivers and other watercourses, the rectangular shapes of the boundaries of the transition of wetlands to forest complexes, and others. The location of landscape indicators was used to confirm the identification of active zones of fracture by landscape indicators near a high-debit well in a satellite image. Other examples of interpretation of active fracture zones using the identified landscape indicators in a satellite image are presented.

AB  - Verbenaya Kosa is accumulative form of the barrier type. It is located on the southeast coast of the Sea of Azov. It is part of the marine edge of the Kuban River Delta and has been formed over the past 200 years under the influence of the simultaneous action of natural and anthropogenic processes. A study of the coastline dynamics of the Verbenaya Kosa has been conducted since the middle of XXth century. The coastline has shifted 80-400 m from 1973 to 2006 in different sections of Verbenaya Kosa. Complex of coastal protection structures (9 km long) was created in 2007. During the construction of the shore protection structure and subsequent period, lithomorphodynamic monitoring of Verbenaya Kosa was carried out. It has included annual topographic-bathymetric measurements of the surface and underwater slope of the accumulative form. The analysis of literature data, engineering survey materials, monitoring data, supplemented by remote sensing data allowed summarize information on the structure and dynamics of the Verbenaya Kosa relief. Historical topographic maps (since 1877) and satellite images of the 1960-1970s, made by the US Geological Survey, were used to evaluate of the long-period dynamics of the studied area. Since 2015, shoreline and submarine bars configuration monitoring has been conducted using Sentinel-2 satellite data. Studies have shown that the development of Verbenaya Kosa was determined by the rate of Kuban Delta extension into the sea water area, sea level fluctuations and changes of the wind-wave regime. Since the middle of XXth century, anthropogenic factor has become determining factor for the Verbenaya Kosa development. Currently, the coastline of it has stabilized.

M3  - Article
AB  - Aim of the studyThe aim of this paper was to develop and test detection methods of sandbars for a selected section of the Lower Vistula (Wisla) river with the use of Sentinel-2 Level 2A optical images.Material and methodsThe analyses were performed in the QGIS (version 2.18.4) and SNAP (version 7.0) software. Both the image reprogramming and pixel value analysis were conducted in the SNAP software. QGIS was used to perform activities involving the remainder of the work, such as steps with satellite data, i.e. processing, surface analysis, and their visualisation. For multispectral images, water indices were used such as: NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index); MNDWI (Modified Normalized Difference Water Index); AWEIsh (Automated Water Extraction Index shadow); AWEInsh (Automated Water Extraction Index no shadow); LSWI (Land Surface Water Index); MLSWI (Modified Land Surface Water Index); MSI (Moisture Stress Index); SWM (Sentinel Water Mask) to separate sandbars from a water. These index methods base on a threshold value. Not all tested indices provided satisfactory results. Therefore, the layers were generated for 5 water indices.Results and conclusions The analyses have shown that, for the selected section of the Lower Vistula, it is possible to detect sandbars in the river channel on the basis of Sentinel-2 satellite's data. A proper selection of remote sensing index, creation of binary classification and selection of processing algorithm are important when detecting river islands. Every water index used produced different results. The difference may be reduced by improving the threshold value algorithm.

AB  - In this paper, the 2017 Maoxian landslide in Sichuan province, China was investigated by using multi-temporal SAR and optical datasets. The pre- and post-failure scars of the landslide were depicted by using the K-means classification of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) maps. Two stacks of ascending and descending Sentinel-1A/B C-band SAR images were applied to explore the pre-failure characteristics of this event. Advanced time-series InSAR analysis was processed to detect the pre-failure movements of this event, with identifying the spatial-temporal pattern and evolution of the source area of the Maoxian landslide. The maximum line-of-sight (LOS) deformation rate measured over the slope surface was up to -30 mm/year in the descending track, with only -18 mm/year for the ascending track. Most importantly, an obvious acceleration was detected from the time series analysis of selected measurement points at the source area before the occurrence of failure. By comparing the TS-InSAR result with the precipitation record over this region, it is evidenced that heavy rainfall might be the major triggering factor of the Maoxian Landslide.

AB  - Classification of mixed classes that are having similar backscatter response at different polarization combinations, using single frequency synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is very intricate and there is always a high possibility of misclassification. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to classify the mixed classes using multi-frequency SAR data. An artificial neural network (ANN) approach is used for classification of the considered mixed classes using various polarimetric parameters obtained from single acquisition ALOS2 PAL SAR (L band) and Sentinel 1 (C band) dual pol SAR data. An image statistical measure based separability index analysis is used to identify the optimal polarimetric parameters for developing the classifier. It is observed that, the proposed multi-frequency approach is able to classify the mixed classes with an overall accuracy of 87%.

TI  - Assessment of Applicability of Satellite-Derived Ocean Color Data for Studying Variability of Total Suspended Matter in the Surface Layer of the Deep Part of the Black Sea
T2  - PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. Studies of spatial-temporal variability of total suspended matter are necessary for understanding the biochemical processes which form and support stable functioning of a marine ecosystem. The aim of the work is to assess applicability of satellite data for studying total suspended matter variability in the surface layer of the deep part of the Black Sea.Methods and Results. Application of the regression analysis yielded the linear regression equations that unite the in situ measurements of the total suspended matter concentrations in the surface layer in the northeastern (June, 2005-2015) and western (November, 2016, 2017 and December, 2017) deep sea areas, and the regional satellite products (the particulate backscattering coefficient, the absorption coefficient of colored detrital matter and the chlorophyll a concentration). Based on the measured and calculated data arrays, the maps of the total suspended matter concentrations in the surface layer of the northeastern Black Sea were constructed. The interannual changes in the in situ measured concentrations of the total suspended and lithogenic matters, as well as in the quasi-synchronous satellite regional products (the light absorption coefficient of colored detrital matter at 490 nm and the particulate backscattering coefficient at 555 nm) in June, 2005-2015 were considered. High total suspended matter concentrations were noted in 2012, just when extreme growth of the coccolithophorid population was observed in the Black Sea. The correlation coefficients were used to evaluate whether the relation between the total suspended matter concentration and the individual analyzed parameters was fast.Conclusions. Spatial distributions of the measured and calculated total suspended matter contents showed satisfactory agreement. In course of the whole observation period, difference between the values of the measured and calculated total suspended matter concentrations was on average 6-23 %. Possibility of application of the satellite-derived ocean color data for studying spatial-temporal variability of the total suspended matter content is shown.

AB  - In this study, we investigate sensitivity of total surface water transformation to salinity from different data sources. Here we use surface salinity from NCEP CFSv2 reanalysis, GLORYS ocean reanalysis, Aquarius satellite data and ISAS-15 (product of optimal interpolation of ARGO buoys) as well as heat and freshwater fluxes from NCEP CFSv2 reanalysis. The largest spread in estimates of salinity is observed for Aquarius satellite in subpolar regions. The best correspondence between transformation computed using salinity from different datasets is observed for subtropical waters. Model-based products (CFSv2 and GLORYS) are the most consistent in estimates of surface water transformation and the largest discrepancies between these datasets are observed in the regions with high freshwater fluxes.

AB  - Soil-transmitted helminth infections propagate poverty and slow economic growth in low-income countries. As with many other neglected tropical diseases, environmental conditions are important determinants of soil-transmitted helminth transmission. Hence, remotely sensed data are commonly utilised in spatial risk models intended to inform control strategies. In the present study, we build upon the existing modelling approaches by utilising fine spatial resolution Landsat 8 remotely sensed data in combination with topographic variables to predict hookworm prevalence in a hilly tribal area in southern India. Hookworm prevalence data collected from two field surveys were used in a random forest model to investigate the predictive capacity of 15 environmental variables derived from two remotely sensed images acquired during dry and rainy seasons. A variable buffer radius (100-1000 m) was applied to the point-prevalence locations in order to integrate environmental conditions around the village centroids into the modelling approach and understand where transmission is more likely. Elevation and slope were the most important variables in the models, with lower elevation and higher slope correlating with higher transmission risk. A modified normalised difference water index was among other recurring important variables, likely responsible for some seasonal differences in model performance. The 300 m buffer distance produced the best model performance in this setting, with another spike at 700 m, and a marked drop-off in R-2 values at 1000 m. In addition to assessing a large number of environmental correlates with hookworm transmission, the study contributes to the development of standardised methods of spatial linkage of continuous environmental data with point-based disease prevalence measures for the purpose of spatially explicit risk profiling.

AB  - A comprehensive analysis of sediment and phytoplankton dynamics in Chilika lagoon by synthesizing various remote sensing datasets is presented in this study. The goal of the study was to monitor and analyze the spatio-temporal variability of total suspended sediment (TSS) and chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration and associated environmental forcings in the coastal lagoon. NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance cloud free data was used to develop a TSS and chl-a model. Finally, a case study showing implication of satellite based TSS and Chl-a models to assess the impacts of natural hazards such as cyclones on water quality of Chilika Lagoon is presented. This case study is based on comparing the effect of two anniversary very severe cyclonic storms (VSCSs): category-5 Phailin (12 October, 2013) and category-4 Hudhud (12 October, 2014) that impacted the lagoon. Analysis for 14 years (2001-2014) using MODIS 8-day composites (MOD09Q1) data indicated that the seasonal variability of TSS is dominant in all the three sectors of the lagoon compared to inter-annual variability. The main reason for large variations in the northern sector is the shallow depth and intrusion of large sediment discharge from Mahanadi River from the northern side, which is the largest fresh water distributary for Chilika Lagoon. Anniversary cyclone impact analysis revealed that Phailin's impact on Chilika Lagoon and its watershed resulted in unprecedented levels of precipitation and runoff before-during-after the landfall, which shattered the typical sectorial turbidity gradient. Exponential increase in turbidity because of a combination of run-off and wind driven re-suspension of fine sediments resulted in strong attenuation of light in water column post-Phailin. Limited light condition coupled with enhanced flushing rate due to flooded river and increased freshwater discharge reduced the Chl-a concentration after the passage of Phailin. In contrast, relatively farther landfall location, trajectory away from the lagoon, relatively lower wind intensity and short duration of stay of VSCS Hudhud, led to lesser precipitation and surface runoff compared to Phailin. Consequently, lagoon did not experience a drastic increase in turbidity and light attenuation. Sufficient light availability, stable wind, reduced flushing all favored the phytoplankton growth after passage of Hudhud and thus, Chl-a concentration increased almost threefold in all the sectors of the lagoon. The approach used in this study can be applied to other cyclone-prone coastal areas. Coupling of satellite based observation with modelling output from systems such as Giovanni can improve monitoring program implemented in numerous coastal estuaries and lagoons.

AB  - The MICROTOPS II aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua AOD and angstrom exponent (AE) were collected during December 2016 to May 2017. Higher AOD values were recorded during winter (December - February) and summer (March - May) Months. These values were observed by MICROTOPS II (0.35 - 1.279) and MODIS (0.222 - 1.904) during winter season. During summer AOD values were recorded by MICROTOPS II (0.272 1.744) and MODIS (0.227 - 1.33). Whereas MODIS AE (0.218 - 1.799) values were found high during winter season indicates about the dominance of fine particulates. During summer months MODIS AE (.001 1.648) values are indicating about the mixing of the aerosol particles. The relative humidity values during December and January months were found to be high, while its values were found decreasing during late February due to transition phase. Relative humidity values were recorded low during summer (36 86%) months in compare to the winter (50 - 100%) months.

TI  - Potential Underestimation of Satellite Fire Radiative Power Retrievals over Gas Flares and Wildland Fires
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire Radiative Power (FRP) is related to fire combustion rates and is used to quantify the atmospheric emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols. FRP over gas flares and wildfires can be retrieved remotely using satellites that observe in shortwave infrared (SWIR) to middle infrared (MIR) wavelengths. Heritage techniques to retrieve FRP developed for wildland fires using the MIR 4 mu m radiances have been adapted for the hotter burning gas flares using the SWIR 2 mu m observations. Effects of atmosphere, including smoke and aerosols, are assumed to be minimal in these algorithms because of the use of longer than visual wavelengths. Here we use Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and Landsat 8 observations acquired before and during emergency oil and gas flaring in eastern Saudi Arabia to show that dark, sooty smoke affects both 4 mu m and 2 mu m observations. While the 2 mu m observations used to retrieve gas FRP may be reliable during clear atmospheric conditions, performance is severely impacted by dark smoke. Global remote sensing-based inventories of wildfire and gas flaring need to consider the possibility that soot and dark smoke can potentially lead to an underestimation of FRP over fires.

TI  - Forest Cover Change Analysis in Sundarban Delta Using Remote Sensing Data and GIS
T2  - INTELLIGENT COMPUTING PARADIGM: RECENT TRENDS
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The present study deals with change detection analysis of forest cover in Sundarban delta during 1975-2015 using remote sensing data and GIS. Supervised maximum likelihood classification techniques are needed to classify the remote sensing data, and the classes are water body, barren land, dense forest, and open forest. The study reveals that forest cover areas have been increased by 1.06% (19.28 km(2)), 5.80% (106.82 km(2)) during the periods of 1975-1989 and 1989-2000, respectively. The reversed tendency has been observed during 2000-2015, and its areas have been reduced to 5.77% (111.85 km(2)). The change detection results show that 63%-80% of dense forest area and 66%-70% of open forest area have been unaffected during 1975-2015 and 1975-2000, respectively, while during the interval 2000-2015, only 36% of open forest area has been unaltered. The overall accuracy (86.75%, 90.77%, 88.16%, and 85.03%) and kappa statistic (0.823, 0.876, 0.842, and 0799) have been achieved for the year of 1975, 1989, 2000, and 2015 correspondingly to validate the classification accuracy. Future trend of forest cover changes has been analyzed using the fuzzy logic techniques. From this study, it may be concluded that in future, the forest cover area has been more declined. The primary goal of this study is to notify the alteration of each features, and decision-maker has to take measurement, scrutinize, and control the natural coastal ecosystem in Sundarban delta.

TI  - AMATEUR POETRY FOR THE OCCASIONS: GROUP AXIOLOGICAL VOCABULARY AND CREATIVE SPEECH PRACTICES
T2  - VESTNIK VOLGOGRADSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-SERIYA 2-YAZYKOZNANIE
M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents the results of linguistic, axiological, and stylistic analysis based on the collection of amateur poetry for the occasions "For such a small company..." (2019) published in Yekaterinburg. The collection includes poetic texts written in different years "by friends for friends". All the authors are philologists who graduated from Ural University in 1966. The study is essential, as it identifies the system of basic values reflected in the poems written for different occasions, which preserve the axiological code of Russian culture. The original texts provide new material for scientific analysis, which shows the literature-centrism of Russian culture and makes it possible to clarify the status of poetry for occasions. The intra-group poetry of this kind is found to have axiological vocabulary, which is characterized by being correlated to a certain chronotope, by presenting a system-forming integreme (in the analyzed texts it is the axiologeme of "friendship"), a special set of nominations of basic values, and by verbalizing value preferences. The axiological content of the congratulatory texts is specifically studied, wherein the motive of the family is developed. There are described creative speech practices: the development of unique image parallels that form the basis of comparative tropes, the use of technologies of transforming precedent texts and different types of puns. The authors' orientation on the aesthetic impression is proved to reinforce the worldview significance of the transmitted values of cooperation and spiritual unity.

AB  - Kazakh people paid much attention to the education of children, including features of their formation, socialization and worldview. Centuries-old credo is family education. The aim of the family is not the birth of children, but also to impart not only the skills and values of social and cultural environment, but also a full-fledged member of their society. Despite all this is a breaking-down of family ties of spouses. The consequence of this is socialization children without one parent. Children living is single-parent families are subjected under the psychological emotional stress. This circumstance is becoming one of the actual problems of Kazakhstan.

AB  - Shoreline changes occur due to abrasion and accretion processes that are triggered due to intensive human activities in coastal areas. The shoreline in the Kendal region is dynamic, and shows mixed results from tidal and dominated by riverine activity. The Shoreline changes have different impacts, all of which may not be visible. Coastal dynamics in the Kendal region cause spatial-temporal shoreline changes. To observe these we need a long and continuous set of data. The purpose of this study is to determine changes in the shoreline in parts of the Kendal coastal district and to calculate the value of the changes. The data used were derived from TM data 1990, to OLI data 2017. To derive the shoreline from the satellite data, a band ratio of Red band to IR band was employed. The shorelines were digitized and saved along with the appropriate MM/DD/YYYY added to the attribute table. The Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) was used to compute rate-of-change statistics. The Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) is an extension of ArcGIS, developed by USGS. Using the extension, transects were laid every 100 m. Then, using NET SHORELINE MOVEMENT (NSM), LINEAR REGRESSION RATE (LRR) and END POINT RATE (EPR), the changes every 100 meters were analyzed and stored in a table. Subsequently, using the table, erosion, and accretion, were analyzed, and understood. The farthest accretion process was 1763.29 m and 792.14 m for the abrasion processes.

M3  - Review
AB  - Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) which was an essential part of breast cancer treatment and the gold standard in evaluation of the status of axillary lymph node had notorious with increased arm morbidity and reduction of quality of life. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) accurately stages the axilla in early breast cancer and ALND is omitted in SLNB negative patients. In patients with positive SLNB the omission of ALND with or without replacement of axillary radiotherapy has also been recommended by guidelines. The neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) which has been increasingly used for large breast cancers to downstage the tumours for allowing breast conserving surgery and decreasing mastectomy rate has also been used in axillary node positive patients to reduce the need for ALND. The issues surrounding the treatment of axilla in patients treated with NAC; application and false negative rate of SLNB, number of identified sentinel lymph nodes, and axillary radiotherapy instead of ALND are currently the discussed and practiced hot topics. The quests for decreasing arm morbidity without compromising outcome in breast cancer treatment which have begun with the invention of SLNB continue for axilla conserving surgery. This article reviews the adventure of axillary treatment in breast cancer patients treated with or without NAC.

M3  - Article
AB  - Aim of the studyThe aim of the article is to analyze current approaches and investigate some possible new approaches to planning and implementation of restrictions related to the protection of water and aimed at the regulation of land use.Material and methodsThe proposed approach to surface water protection suggests imposing water protection restrictions of land use. This requires developing a land use management project. Designing water protection zones and near-shore protective belts is based on the consideration of options generated by geo-information modeling and use of remote sensing data. The operational options of ArcGIS 10.7 were used as basic software for the performance of the spatial analysis of data. The research territory for seeking confirmation of the proposed methods of projecting water protection zones and near-shore protective belts covered a part of the Seret river and its basin, located within the administrative borders of the Zalishchyky district of the Ternopil region.Results and conclusionsThe results of our research demonstrate that development of a land management project consisting in establishing water protection zones and near-shore protective belts with a specific regime of farming within relevant borders should become one of the most important mechanisms to prevent contamination, reduce flood risk, and improve sanitary-hygienic conditions of water-defined entities, processes, and activities. While developing the land management project, the authors performed calculation of the width of the water protection zone according to the principle of the reference value of an optimal width of the belt, which could catch the surface slope runoff.

AB  - Ukrainian agricultural industry is one of the main sectors of economic growth. Nevertheless, Ukraine is way behind in the development. This is mostly due to the low level of modern technologies utilization by businesses and state entities. To ensure transparency, equity and reliability of Ukrainian land market, objective information on land use and crop state is required. The World Bank program "Supporting Transparent Land Governance in Ukraine" addresses these issues. Within the project, we performed satellite monitoring of land use in Ukraine, analyzed the feasibility of Google's cloud-based technology for processing large amount of data and developed a new platform to analyze the crop state using open and free Sentinel-1/2 satellite data. It is a 5-year project, which is extended for the whole country this year. We plan to make the technology of satellite monitoring operational and deployed in governmental institutions in 2023.

AB  - In the past few years, deep learning methods developed and progressed in the many applied fields of science due to the appearance of large amounts of freely available data and improvement of computing resources. The task of crop mapping based on satellite data is not an exclusion. However, the appearance of clouds and shadows on the optical images cause difficulties on applying typical deep learning methods that recommend themselves in other issues. The easiest solution was to consider only images with a small percentage of clouds, but such way decreased the available data informativeness. In this study, we propose the new deep learning method based on recurrent neural network for efficient and precise crop mapping based on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery. The main idea of the study is to utilize all available information from the satellites and to provide an opportunity for neural network to extract the necessary features without any expert knowledge. Taking into account that regular feedforward neural networks could not deal effectively with such issue, authors suggest recurrent neural network with long short-term memory cells. Experimental results for the part of Kyiv region showed that this approach is rather efficient and outperformed traditional machine learning approaches and deep U-net architecture in terms of overall accuracy.

The possibilities of using data of remote sensing of the Earth from various sensors (Modis-Terra, Modis-Aqua, Landsat 5, Landsat 7, Landsat 8, Sentinel-2, Sentinel-3) to study the quality of water in inland waters are described. Many researchers note the great potential of the Sentinel-3 satellite for studying inland waters with complex optical conditions (high turbidity, color, colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and total suspended matter). It is shown that the optical properties of inland waters differ depending on the trophic status of the reservoir, on the season of the year, the physicochemical composition of water, the species composition of phytoplankton and other factors. Currently, both traditional methods and new improved algorithms are used to monitor the state of water bodies with complex optical conditions. Various methods of atmospheric corrections and calibrated spectral indices are used, classifications of reservoirs by the presence of phytoplankton particles, suspended particles of organic and inorganic matter, and CDOM are developed. It was noted that the concentration of chlorophyll a and the turbidity of the water are the most important biophysical parameters used to assess the quality of water and determine the ecological status of inland waters.

AB  - The paper presents information on the distribution of thickets of coastal aquatic and higher aquatic plants in the water area of the Omutninsky reservoir, subject to eutrophication processes. During the route survey of the reservoir, 33 dominant species of aquatic and coastal aquatic plants were identified. Large thickets of Equisetum fluviatile L., Scirpus lacustris L., Persicaria amphibia (L.) S.F. Gray, Potamogeton lucens L., P. perfoliatus L. were recorded in shallow areas in the upper reaches and in the central part of the reservoir along the coastline. Interpretation of satellite images from Landsat-5 and Sentinel-2 satellites was carried out, the normalized vegetation index (NDVI) was calculated for the investigated water area. According to the results of the NDVI calculation, the areas of overgrowth of the water area of the Omutninsky reservoir with emergent vegetation were calculated. The data were processed using the QGIS Desktop 3.14.1 with GRASS 7.8.3 program. A tendency was revealed for a decrease in the areas of overgrowth with higher aquatic vegetation in the water area of the Omutninsky reservoir for the period 2011 to 2019, which is most likely associated with the influence of the temperature factor.

T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Determination of the trophic status of a reservoir is necessary for making decisions on the use of a water body for industrial production and domestic purposes. The calculation of the trophic state index (ITS) of a reservoir based on measuring the value of the hydrogen index and the content of dissolved oxygen in water allows us to evaluate the trophic state of a water body, regardless of its type and region of study. According to the results of the physicochemical analysis of water for 2011-2019, the dependence of pH on the degree of oxygen saturation of water was established for one of the largest reservoirs in the Kirov region (Omutninsky reservoir) which is subjected to eutrophication. Based on the dependence found, the ITS index of the reservoir was calculated. Over 9 years of observations, ITS increased from 7.8 to 8.1 units, which indicates the transition of the Omutninsk reservoir from the mesotrophic to the eutrophic type. Using the Earth remote sensing methods for the reservoir, areas of mass development of phytoplankton and higher aquatic plants have been identified. Field observations in these areas revealed thickets of Equisetum fluviatile L., Scirpus lacustris L., Persicaria amphibia (L.) S. F. Gray, Rotamogeton lucens L. The data obtained by calculating the turbidity index and the concentration index of chlorophyll a in water are consistent with field data observations and can be further used in environmental monitoring of the Omutninsk reservoir and other reservoirs in the region.

TI  - Integration of a statistical forest reflectance model and Sentinel-2 MSI images into a continuous forest inventory system
T2  - BALTIC FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Spectral signatures of forest stands in Sentinel-2 MSI spectral bands are simulated with the statistical forest reflectance (SFRM) model and compared to the spectral signatures measured in spectral images at ten study sites in Estonia. As an overall measure of the agreement between simulated and measured spectral signatures we used the total error calculated as the sum of relative errors over spectral bands B2 to B11 of Sentinel-2. The distribution of the total error has strongly positive skewness at all study sites and all types of forests (broadleaf, pine and spruce forests). The right tail of the distribution is low. The stands of high value of the total error far right in the tail of the distribution may have some errors in their inventory data, or the inventory data are outdated. Pertinent stands should have priority in their in situ checking process. The SFRM model is a simple and reliable tool for the validity checking of forest inventory data, using routinely collected forest inventory data and operational satellite information of moderate spatial resolution. The model is simple and computationally efficient. Preparing input data for the model is a simple query in the forest inventory database. The suggested procedure can be incorporated into the automated systems of continuous forest inventory.

T2  - AIP ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Magnetic nanoparticles and their detection systems are widely applied to the diverse biomedical applications, and the more accurate detection techniques have been explored. Here, we propose the cavity-shaped magnet that enables the application of the highly sensitive magnetic sensor for the enhancement of the detection ability. The numerical simulations based on the finite element method revealed the wide area of the magnetic null point (B similar to 0 and del B similar to 0) of the cavity-shaped magnet. The strong gradient of magnetic fields of del B-Z similar to 160 mT/mm in the conventional column-shaped magnet reduces to approximately zero and the wider magnetic null area is obtained in the cavity-shaped magnet. The magnetic null area of the column- and cavity-shaped magnet are similar to 0.1 x 0.05 mm(2) and similar to 0.25 x 0.6 mm(2), respectively, indicating that the area expands to approximately 30 times larger. This scale-up of the magnetic null area in the proposed cavity-shaped magnet suggests the application of the highly sensitive magnetic sensor, thereby would be offering the more accurate magnetic nanoparticle detection for biomedical applications.

AB  - Digital image forgery is a known issue due to the increasing availability of technologies and software that make it easy to create distorted images. In order to counter such attacks, several approaches have been developed to detect fakes. Of particular importance are the methods for detecting distortions of a particular type of digital image - Earth remote sensing data, which can be used to ensure the safety of protected areas, monitor the state of the environment, etc. This article proposes a new scheme based on neural networks and deep learning, which is based on the use of the new convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to improve the quality of detection of the most common type of attack on digital images - embedding duplicates. As part of the proposed architecture, additional preprocessing layers are used to improve detection quality. This approach also demonstrates invariance to distortions introduced into the duplicated region. Experiments show that the proposed solution exceeds the known copy-move detection algorithms - the metric value F1 reaches 0.77. At the same time the proposed deep learning approach shows high quality for the splicing detection task.

AB  - The article considers the features of childhood-related paradigm and explores the ways it is embodied in different types of English discourse. The authors explore the linguistic representation of childhood related concepts in discourse of art and literary poetic discourse as they play a significant role in the process of shaping children's worldview and help develop their artistic tastes. The authors focus on minitexts that represent the titles of paintings produced by British and American artists depicting scenes and characters referring to the theme of childhood and minitexts exemplified by titles of children's poems created by British and American authors. The paper presents a mixed approach to the study of mini- format naming units of paintings' and poems' titles addressed to children that helps achieve the beneficial effect of revealing insights into cognitive, pragmasemantic and discursive aspects. The themes exposed in the linguistic units of the named titles correlate with the historical development of the childhood-related concept: it has linguistic, cultural and educational features that affect the formation and development of the personality. The paper gives a critical analysis of a scientific understanding of the children's world infrastructure and focuses on the unusual involved in the creation of the titles' artistic imagery and aesthetic effect.

M3  - research-article
AB  - This paper aims to examine the Kim Jong-sam's Romanticism.Kim Jong-sam was interpreted as a modernist poet. Because he wrote poetry that doesn't follow the traditional rhythm and he belongs to bilingual generation in the 50s. However, Kim Jong-sam can also be classified as a romantic poet.This is because the tragic worldview that frequently appears in his poems, the consciousness of poverty and alienation, salvation, and the will to find a new language are the attributes of romanticism. In particular, Kim Jong-sam's main theme is salvation.His life as an individual was also more obsessed with Western culture, art, and music than Korean society in the 50s, and such aspects are actively expressed in poetry.Nevertheless, in a number of poems, regardless of salvation, a lonely sentiment is subsided like sediment over old wine. Why is lonesome found in Kim Jong-sam, who consistently maintained a romantic attitude? This paper attempts to follow the formation of sediments.The reason why it is worth paying attention to Kim Jong-sam's tendency to romanticism is that it is difficult to find studies that focus on such aspects. In his poems, there is an emotion that is not fully explained by modernism alone, which is different from the poets who promoted contemporary modernism.Therefore, this paper is meaningful to read the romanticist tendency from Kim Jong-sam, recognized as a modernist, and to approach his poetic world more diversely.

AB  - In order to examine the various ideas reflected in the ceremonies of mourning of the siberian Nanays and the ceremonies of mourning of Korea, first I looked at the view of soul, life and death, the otherworld, fear and respect of soul of the dead. Next, I in depth looked at the worship of soul of the dead or ancestors revealed on the surface of the ceremonies of mourning in relation to the shamanistic idea.Their worldview is reflected in the ceremonies of mourning of the Nanays and the ceremonies of mourning of Korea, which show similar procedures.First, in the view of the soul, person has the soul of multiplicity, the soul of the dead does not immediately leave the otherworld, but stays in this world for a certain period of time, and the soul of the dead is identified with a living person.Second, in the view of life and death, a person's life and death depend on the existence of a soul. When the soul stays in a person's body, that person is considered alive, and when the soul leaves the body, that person is considered dead.Third, in the view of otherworld, material things in this world exist in the same way in otherworld. In otherworld, the soul of the dead lives the same life as in this world.Fourth, in the fear and respect of soul of the dead, the living person fears the soul of the dead. Because of this fear, the living person respects the soul of the dead.The fear of soul of the dead is one of the shamanistic ideas. The fear of soul of the dead leads to the idea of worship of soul of the dead, and that worship of soul of the dead naturally leads to ancestor worship. These shamanistic ideas were reflected in procedures of the ceremonies of mourning in Nanays and Korea.

AB  - This is a Korean animation case study as a transmedia content. It examines <Ghost Messenger> in accordance with the media platform, the world view, the story and character, and the audience. <Ghost Messenger> has been produced as five volumes so far. Their media platform type is divided as OVA, feature animation, novel, and game, and the kinds of content are commercial animation, seed novel, and RPG. By providing different stories with these different types of media, it pursues a diversification of the media platform. Second, it has the cultural value of modernizing a cultural prototype, for it modifies a mythical character of Gangnim Doryeong, which is the Grim Reaper in the Korean mythology underworld. It is materialized as follows: setting two worlds as a bimodal spatial background, modernizing a temporal background through the application of digital technology, and combining traditional and modern elements. These points lead to establishment of a core story, which works at the whole media platform. Third, the story of every platform maintains the characteristic of independence, but also shows the continuation by using prequel, sequel, remake, and spin-off type. This makes the every platform story work as the sub-plot for the entire story. Characters of differentiated capacities keep differentiated antagonistic relationships in every platform, which proves the story independence.Fourth, audience shows two types of activities. Activities such as purchasing behavior and visiting companies give producers motivation for production. The accumulation and sharing of creative experiences are seen in blogs, YouTube, and fan communities.These activities show that audience as a prosumer develops a participatory culture.Through the analysis on <Ghost Messenger>, this research suggests that animation production in Korean needs to consider both the diversification of target audience and the application of multiple platforms.

M3  - research-article
AB  - Kim Jiha(1941~) has focused on the violent world of political ideology as a resistance literature that represents the history of modern poetry literature in the 1970s and 1980s. The reputation of Kim Jiha Literature has been extensively explored under the theme of the Kim Jiha, demonstrating his vigorous activity, and will continue to be addressed in the follow-up generation of the survey. In this way, much research on Kim Jiha literature, which is represented by resistance literature, is based on life thought, but it can be derived from the perception of the vitality of modern Korean poetry.On the other hand, the start of the Kim Jiha and the pursuit of researchers who can converge with life thoughts include the awareness of half-life death and the restoration of life sacredness. In addition, if we deepen these two dimensions, we can note that the origins of Kim Jiha literature include historical tragedy and violence. In this way, in the era of chaos and absence centered on the keyword "vitality", prior research has been concluded with discourses on the spoken words of lifeism, ethnic consciousness, eastern thought, and living movement. However, after removing this, his poetry possible worldview and poetic awareness began with violent reality and ended with tragedy.Next, Kim Jiha poetry as a meaning of purification by preserving tragedy and overcoming the violence of the times, and paying attention to the image of "burning" that appears on his test specimens "burns on" did. It is a fact that this burning action exerts a cathartic effect that causes compassion and fear in advance while performing a purifying function. Therefore, this article focuses on test specimens based on burning images and purifying effects in sympathy and fear in order to expel the tragedy and violent purifying rituals exhibited during the Kim Jiha’s poet.The purification surface of literary, tragedy and poetic violence that appeared on the Kim Jiha piece was subdivided into three parts and analyzed. In this paper, the method of this research is based on the previous research that has been pursued, and the rebirth and eternity of death and circulation that is, crying and rebirth.In addition, in general, the meaning of "burn" burning is displayed inspired by the purification association in the specimens searched for, and there is a catharsis of sympathy and fear. It first disclosed the eternal revival of life, the second, the cycle of death through ecological consciousness, and the third, poetic meaning through the recreation of crying by the spirit.

AB  - This study aims to investigate the experience of posttraumatic growth (PTG) in mothers of children with cancer. The participants were 13 mothers of children under age 18 who had been diagnosed with cancer and whose treatment was complete. In-depth interviews were conducted and analyzed using grounded theory. The major finding was that PTG constituted finding meaning and reconstructing the worldview by means of rumination between contradictory domains: withdrawal and advancing. Withdrawal domains include intrusion by distressing thoughts and feeling isolated, and advancing domains refer to discovering gratitude in life, family togetherness, increased empathy, and spiritual change. The findings suggest that the PTG may be summarized by Lao-tzu’s aphorism: “A person who is advancing in Tao may appear to withdraw”. Given the characteristics of PTG, which may be the harmonious coexistence of contradictions, psychosocial services should be provided for all family members of children with cancer.

AB  - The reign of King Seongjong was a time when Joseon became stable as a Confucian society. Despite the fact that "Gyeongguk Daejeon(경국대전)," which had been revised several times, was completed only after the time of King Seongjong's reign, it is also a clue that shows that this period is the starting point for the establishment of a ruling order based on Confucian ideology. It can be found that the meaning of the "Namnyeosangyeoljisa(男女相悅之詞)" should be discussed and analyzed in various ways, including language, politics, social and musical suitability, rather than simply focusing on the problem of lewd affection between the opposite sex that conforms to the Confucian situation.King Seongjong emphasized the importance of fostering management who learned the notes by emphasizing the importance of Ak(樂). Recalling the fact that the music sheet was used to accommodate the ancestral rites and only changed the lyrics, it is also believed that the subject of the dispute between Namnyeosangyeol(男女相悅), which was raised in the early Joseon Dynasty, was limited to the lyrics, or poetry.Since the discussion of the male-female hierarchy took place in later generations rather than in the period of creation of the first movement, it cannot be concluded that the subject of the dispute is limited to the lyrics.In this book, we wanted to focus on the original appearance of the "Namnyeosangyeol(男女相悅)". In the discussion of the male and female ranks took place in later generations rather than in the period of the creation of the movement in the early Joseon Dynasty, it cannot be concluded that the subject of the dispute was limited to "Gasa(가사)." In this study, we wanted to focus on the original appearance of the ''Namnyeosangyeol(男女相悅)''.In particular, it is meaningful that "Namnyeosangyeollon(남녀상열론)" is not just a lewd story of men and women, but rather a representation of the politics of reality, political links through music, and examples and relationships. Rather than referring to the vulgarity of the lyrics, the emergence of "the theory of succession" was conscious of the fact that the custom of "the succession" remained at the royal feast. Through this, we were able to examine the changes in Sungjong's perception and worldview. Sungjong actively tried to utilize the musical's usefulness and positive meaning. With the balanced readjustment of manners and music, King Seongjong was able to reach the peak of the music culture during the early Joseon Dynasty.

AB  - Mass movements and therefore rockfalls are common natural hazards that require the development of new methodologies and techniques for an effective research, which could help governments, communities or policy makers in the adoption of the most appropriate practices. In that context different remote sensing data have been used and several methodologies have been tested. In the present study, we initially map a rockfall occurred on the settlement Myloi, which is located near the village of Andritsaina in Western Greece, while later we estimated the volume of rock fragments. The data sets consist of repeated GNSS measurements, laser scanning surveys and UAV campaigns over the study area. The precise mapping of the rockfall was carried out through the processing of GNSS measurements. However, mapping was also performed using orthophotos derived from UAV data and 3D images of laser scanning campaigns. Regarding the volume estimation, three methodologies were applied -two of them were photogrammetric and one was geophysical- using ArcGIS, Cloud Compare and Oasis Montaj from Geosoft respectively. The selection of different types of data and processing methodologies took place within the framework of the comparison of their results in terms of accuracy as well as the achievement of their synergy in the direction of a more detailed research.

AB  - This paper classifies the style and discusses natural language processing problems presented by eleven academic journals published during the modern Enlightenment period which have been digitized to the Korean history database. This is a basic step in studying these journals, which deploy various types of stylistic formats, including Chinese, Korean, and Korean written in Chinese characters. These stylistic complexities are significant obstacles which prevent accurate data extraction by means of digital humanities methodologies based upon word processing.Journal articles were initially classified into ten types, and those articles which predominantly used Chinese words with Korean grammatical patterns were selected for further research. This style was typically used by articles which translated or transcribed academic content, and also for articles which described new or revised legal codes. Thus, if digital humanities methodology is applied to articles selected by this stylistic criterion, research results tend to be more tightly focused upon the introduction of modern education and knowledge, and upon new concepts related to the legal, political, and economic fields.The method of discourse analysis used by this study, in which stylistic criteria are used to segment the texts found in journals of modern Enlightenment for further analysis, is a useful and appropriate tool, since the various types of modern Enlightenment material are readily and recognizably separable on the basis of their writing style: each type tends toward a characteristic format. This segmentation also allows a clearer and more focused discussion of how to process the target data for each style, resulting in an increased accuracy for the data extracted, and a more effective understanding of the way in which the worldview of the authors is revealed by their stylistic choices.In addition, this paper discusses the morphological analysis of the Chinese words, especially the processing of vocabulary in complex relations and derivative relations. The general criteria used in Korean linguistic analysis are inadequate for this kind of morphological analysis, which needs to be adapted to the specific research aims of a particular study.

AB  - Luxury brands and products have been growing every year in many countries around the world. While luxury fashion, the core of the luxury sector, has been constantly growing, completely different luxury is reinventing a transformation in the fashion industry. The purpose of the study was to discover the socio-cultural meaning inherent in the new fashion phenomenon called new luxury based on the socio-cultural theory. To this end, data from various sources such as books, academic papers, professional institution reports, newspaper articles related to new luxury fashion were collected. Then, the unifying metatheory for clothing and textile based on cultural anthropology was introduced as a theoretical framework to interpret the meaning, symbolic value, and discourse belonging to new luxury fashion. The results were as follows. Unlike the traditional luxury, which is strictly tied to the concept of price, craftsmanship, historical status and wealth, new luxury is complex and dynamic, linking true self, community and culture, values we share, and worldview to the brand. Three sub-components were derived from the three components of the new luxury fashion culture, ideology, social structure, and technology. The sub-components of ideology were sharing of self-interest & self-value, desire for newness, and transition from conspicuousness to experience. The sub-components of social structure were the rise of the middle class in emerging markets, the emergence of new generations, and luxury democratization. The sub-components of technology were tech innovation and transfer, multi-channel, and the digitally advanced. The contributions of this study are to provide an academic framework in the field of new luxury and to be helpful for the market research capability of the fashion industry and the real time education for a new field required by the era.

AB  - This study focused on the fact that female heroic novel is ‘the story in which female characters grow into the hero’, and examined the Identity formation of female characters from the perspective of gender and clarified its educational meaning.First, the aspects of gender identity development appeared in Honggyewoljeon and Banghallymjeon were reviewed in view of individuals and the society. Both Honggyewoljeon and Banghallymjeon focus on the lives of the women, who did not follow the gender norms of the society, and the process that they went through to develop their capabilities to get the social status and power were described to show the growth process of women. As they lived their own lives without limitation of their biological gender out of the women’s identity, they showed to materialize that gender was not given but established by the actions. The individual and the society were interconnected, and mutual recognitions are required. Hong Gyewol and Bang Gwanjoo unveiled the strong barrier, androcentrism which existed between them and the world by will and capability and changed the perception on them. As a result, women were accepted as the members of community with the social status. Their identities and life styles were recognized socially by demonstrating the positive attitude on the capability of women from those who were neighbors representing the society system and ideas of the times. This is to project the friendly worldview to the women’s capabilities, which can be considered to apply the idea of ability system prioritizing the capabilities of the individuals to gender, classes, and ranks.Then, the educational meaning from the aspects of gender identity development in these novels was reviewed in view of thinking system and life style. Heroine is the existence to be in confrontation and coexisted with both femininity and masculinity without fixing either gender to suggest the issue of dichotomy thinking system, which can be considered as the reasonable and meaningful fictional existence. In the female hero novels, the inherent issues of the human-being, which they wanted to live with their needed ways rather than fixed by the society in the framework of heroine narration, were revealed to expand the scope of recognition on various identities and types of lifestyles. It is very important for both men and women to select the lifestyle to fit in their lives as the independent human-beings. In this sense, femininity and masculinity are not fixed but continuously changed to be reorganized to cope with the times and the situations, which should be considered. In this respect, Honggyewoljeon and Banghallymjeon have the educational meanings that showed the open viewpoint beyond the existing rigid recognition on the thinking system and lifestyle.

AB  - This article is devoted to the problems of women's prose and the originality of the language and stylistic device in the works of V. Tokareva. Women's prose is represented by women, whose author, heroine, and tells about women's fate and women's psychology from the point of view of women. The specifics of women's prose include intertextuality, aphorism, essayism and journalism of style, etc. The specifics of women's prose and its reflection in V.Tokareva's prose are considered.The study examines the author's linguistic and style-forming means, such as parceling and reminiscence and metaphor, asserting the continuation of Chekhov's artistic tradition. Victoria Tokareva's works have a wide range of problems: she writes about people's attitudes towards truth and lies, about love and a sense of duty. Problems such as relationships between representatives of different generations, family, the meaning of life, terrible living conditions in Russia and the desire to leave for another are also raised. country. Tokareva's characters, changing in accordance with the time, have the same grievances, the same sadness and the same hope for happiness. The pursuit of happiness is like the foundation of their relationship to the world. On this basis, the semantic field of understanding “happiness” is analyzed in comparison with the understanding of “love” and “life.” In this way, Tokareva's concept of "happiness" is investigated, reflecting the author's worldview, and it is realized by the peculiarities of the author's individual writing style.

AB  - This paper is about the political thought of Godang Cho Man-sik. The Godang is a leading visionary, independence activist, and thinker born in modern and contemporary Korean history. I searched his worldview to find out more about his political ideas. His worldview was divided into three main categories. First, the world view of the spirit of sacrifice, second view of the spirit of responsibility, third view of the spirit of reform. Based on this, the political ideology of the Godang was also divided into three categories. First, the political ideology of the can be defined as the theory of national education. The theory of Godang national education is based on the link between people and education.And his theory of national education appeared as the unification of practice in the field of education. Second, the Godang’s political ideology is linked to the theory of national unity. The theory of national unity is an assertion that only unity of the nation is the patriotic path of the nation. As a part of realizing this theory of national unity, the Godang was practiced with the assertion that'Let's not ask about our hometown'. Finally, his political thoughts can be defined as the theory of national independence.The theory of national independence presupposes the theory of national subjectivity. The result of the national subject is national independence, and the premise of national independence is the national subject. In this respect, he launched a movement to promote the production of Joseon in order to build the competence of the national subject, and made every effort to cultivate talented people with love for the nation in the educational field.

AB  - This thesis is about Dr. Baek Baek's worldview and political philosophy. His view of the world was analyzed by dividing it into a view of space, view of life, and view of mortality. His view of the universe argues that this universe moves according to principles and has a certain orbit. And human beings are also a component of space activities. His view of life is that it is an active, independent, and organic being that actively acts on the environment. Finally, to sum up his view of life, he argues that he is developing his philosophy in the relationship of the community and that he should be free from greed in an unconscious manner and always act honorably and die. To explain his political philosophy, the first is harmonious politics. Harmonic politics refers to the harmony between me and my opponent and the harmony of mental, economic and legal life. The second is the theory of politics. The theory of anarchy is that it renounces the honor that is reserved for me and that it is for the benefit of the whole community, free from the selfishness of being myself. The third is the theory of civil politics. People's politics emphasizes the politics of distribution and equality on the premise of sharing, or caring. Finally, it is fair politics. Fair politics is a political theory of echoing, presupposing the relationship between me and the world. And his theory of fair politics is based on his belief in democracy.

TI  - A multidimensional quality model: an opportunity for patients, their kin, healthcare providers and professionals in the new COVID-19 period.
T2  - F1000Research
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Background: It is twenty years since the Institute of Medicine (IOM) defined quality in healthcare, as comprising six domains: person-centredness, timeliness, efficiency, effectiveness, safety and equity. Since then, a new quality movement has emerged, with the development of numerous interventions aimed at improving quality, with a focus on accessibility, safety and effectiveness of care. Further gains in equity and timeliness have proven even more challenging. The challenge: With the emergence of "service-oriented" systems, complexity science, the challenges of climate change, the growth of social media and the internet and the new reality of COVID-19, the original domains proposed by the IOM invite reflection on their relevance and possibility for improvement. The possible solution: In this paper we propose a revised model of quality that is built on never-ending learning and includes new domains, such as Ecology and Transparency, which reflect the changing worldview of healthcare. We also introduce the concept of person- or "kin-centred care" to emphasise the shared humanity of people involved in the interdependent work. This is a more expansive view of what "person-centredness" began. The delivery of health and healthcare requires people working in differing roles, with explicit attention to the lived realities of the people in the roles of professional and patient. The new model will provide a construct that may make the attainment of equity in healthcare more possible with a focus on kindness for all.

TI  - Irrigation-triggered landslides in a Peruvian desert caused by modern intensive farming
T2  - NATURE GEOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Intensification of agriculture leads to stress on the environment and subsequently can have strong societal and ecological impacts. In deserts, areas of very high sensitivity to land-use changes, these local-scale impacts are not well documented. On the arid southwestern coast of Peru, several vast irrigation programmes were developed in the 1950s on the flat detritic plateau surrounding narrow valleys to supply new farming areas. We document the long-term effects of irrigation on the erosion of arid deserts in the Vitor and Siguas valleys, south Peru, using 40 yr of satellite data. We demonstrate that irrigation initiated very large slow-moving landslides, affecting one-third of the valleys. Their kinematics present periods of quiescence and short periods of rapid activity, corresponding to landslide destabilization by their headscarp retrogression. This analysis suggests that the landslide motion continues long after their initiation by irrigations. Those landslides affect the fertile valley floors, leading to the destruction of villages and agricultural areas. We conclude that modern intensive farming can strongly impact traditional agriculture in desert areas where water management is particularly critical.

AB  - Despite enormous advances in remote sensing data over the past 20 years, harnessing and exploiting that data by the Civil Engineering community has been relatively limited. To understand the full potential of such data, first this paper briefly recaps the Civil Engineering community's engagement with remote sensing for dike monitoring and post-earthquake damage assessment. Next, the state of the art is introduced with special considerations for recent advances in quality, affordability, accessibility, and equipment size; the role of national aerial laser scanning data collection programs; and the increasing applicability of remote sensing to a wide range Civil Engineering applications. Finally, the paper concludes with a vision of how Civil Engineering can better benefit from existing technologies not regularly exploited today, as well as the logistical challenges of storing and integrating such data in a computationally meaningful manner.

TI  - Estimating potential soil sheet Erosion in a Brazilian semiarid county using USLE, GIS, and remote sensing data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aimed to estimate soil erosion in Machados County, Brazil. Rainfall erosivity was calculated using monthly and annual precipitation averages over a 30-year interval, soil erodibility was obtained with a granularity-based equation, and topography and land cover were obtained from DEM data and Sentinel - 2B imagery, respectively. A GIS interface was used to spatialize parameter results and for topography and land cover analysis. The achieved results allowed surmising that the soil loss for the study region risk is low, but significant, with a mean value of 8.11 t/ha year. About a quarter of the total area presented high soil loss, above 20 t/ha year. The biggest influential factors were soil erodibility, with a mean value of 0.028, and land cover, averaging 0.1409. The topographic factor averaged 3.414 and rain erosivity, found to be 2747.22 mm/year, is considered low for the region. Given a lack of conservative practices observed during field work, the soil stewarship P factor was considered 1 for the assessment. The use of orbital images to obtain C factor and the expression applied to calculate soil erodibility provided adequate results. In addition, there is a need for research to monitor and quantify erosion processes in Brazilian semiarid, as well as their erosion tolerance.

TI  - Parasitism of <i>Melanaphis sacchari</i> (Hemiptera: Aphididae) by <i>Lysiphlebus testaceipes</i> (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) in the Greenhouse and Field
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The sugarcane aphid, Melanaphis sacchari (Zehntner), is an economically important invasive insect pest of sorghum, Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench, production in the southern United States. Studies were conducted to: (1) assess the fecundity of Lysiphlebus testaceipes (Cresson) parasitizing M. sacchari in the greenhouse, and (2) examine the temporal synchrony between L. testaceipes and M. sacchari in the field during 2017 and 2018. Results indicate that after 96 h, the number of M. sacchari increased approximately 90-fold from a single adult in the greenhouse study. The percentage of mummification observed in the greenhouse study was 15.2 +/- 3.3%. Of those mummies, L. testaceipes adults emerged from 88.7 +/- 4.4%, with 38.6 +/- 8.4% of those males. Field observations showed that L. testaceipes appeared in the sentinel fields in late July to August. The percentage of mummies observed in the June- and July-planted plots of 2017, and June-planted plots of 2018 were 4.5 x 10(-4) +/- 1.5 x 10(-4)%, 7.4 x 10(-4) +/- 4.4 x 10(-4)%, and 4.4 x 10(-5) +/- 1.7 x 10(-5)%, respectively. Even though parasitization of M. sacchari by L. testaceipes was observed in both field and greenhouse, the lack of wasps before late July and low rate of parasitization in the field suggest that this species is not well synchronized with M. sacchari populations. Additional natural enemies (e.g., other parasitoids, predators, and entomopathogens) or other adaptations will be necessary before this pest is managed using biological control in Georgia.

T2  - UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE: APPLICATIONS IN AGRICULTURE AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Geospatial data of urban green spaces (UGS) is mostly unavailable for emerging Indian cities, which effects their provisioning, maintenance and monitoring. In absence of spatial data, the strategic vision and comprehensive urban planning to enhance urban environment of cities witnessing transition are compromised. Owing to the direct link between urban environment and wellbeing of urban dweller, it is utmost important to address this gap and support planning process by providing the required data set of desired spatial and temporal scale. Though satellite imagery and remotely sensed data are widely used in environmental studies, for urban greens the spatial resolution of images is inapt. In addition, high cost acts as a barrier towards its wide scale application. Thus, the study reviews current state of literature on application of UAVs for spatial data generation to allow integrated analysis to support urban planning process. A case example of Nagpur city is presented to highlight specific direct applications. The review finds UAVs as cost effective and efficient tool for images with relevant resolution for planners and decision makers. While regulation hinder its wide applicability, the cost component, flexibility, timely monitoring and accessibility weighs UAVs as suitable tool for data collection in urban areas. As use of UAVs in urban areas is still limited, the study recommends more experimentations and trials to arrive at set methodology which could help in mapping of UGS and other qualitative data gathering to support urban planning and urban greening.

AB  - Spatiotemporal mapping of shrublands live fuel moisture content (LFMC) is of critical significance for wildfire risk assessment. Previous studies generally estimated the shrubland LFMC based on PROSAILH radiative transfer model (RTM), the model assuming that shrub canopies were homogenously and continuously distributed. We argued that this treatment was inaccurate since shrublands present diverse distribution and structure that normally can be classified into closed and open shrublands according to IGBP scheme. To this end, this study explored the effects of PROSAILH for open and closed shrublands LFMC retrieval based on National Fuel Moisture Database. The results showed that 1) PROSAILH performed poorly on open shrublands LFMC retrieval due to heterogeneity, whereas 2) better results were found for closed shrublands LFMC cases. Thus, this research suggested that PROSAILH is not suitable for all types of shrublands LFMC retrievals.

TI  - Modeling Arctic Boundary Layer Cloud Streets at Grey-zone Resolutions
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - To better understand how model resolution affects the formation of Arctic boundary layer clouds, we investigated the influence of grid spacing on simulating cloud streets that occurred near Utqiagvik (formerly Barrow), Alaska, on 2 May 2013 and were observed by MODIS (the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer). The Weather Research and Forecasting model was used to simulate the clouds using nested domains with increasingly fine resolution ranging from a horizontal grid spacing of 27 km in the boundary-layer-parameterized mesoscale domain to a grid spacing of 0.111 km in the large-eddy-permitting domain. We investigated the model-simulated mesoscale environment, horizontal and vertical cloud structures, boundary layer stability, and cloud properties, all of which were subsequently used to interpret the observed roll-cloud case. Increasing model resolution led to a transition from a more buoyant boundary layer to a more shear-driven turbulent boundary layer. The clouds were stratiform-like in the mesoscale domain, but as the model resolution increased, roll-like structures, aligned along the wind field, appeared with ever smaller wavelengths. A stronger vertical water vapor gradient occurred above the cloud layers with decreasing grid spacing. With fixed model grid spacing at 0.333 km, changing the model configuration from a boundary layer parameterization to a large-eddy-permitting scheme produced a more shear-driven and less unstable environment, a stronger vertical water vapor gradient below the cloud layers, and the wavelengths of the rolls decreased slightly. In this study, only the large-eddy-permitting simulation with gird spacing of 0.111 km was sufficient to model the observed roll clouds.

TI  - Sentinel surveillance strategies for early detection of coronavirus disease in fever clinics: experience from China
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel surveillance system plays a key role in screening and monitoring emerging and acute infectious diseases in order to identify the suspected cases in time. During SARS period in 2003, fever clinics emerged in many cities in mainland China with the purpose to screen the suspected SARS patients and to transfer the confirmed cases to designated hospitals for professional management. Shanghai city has reserved the fever clinics and the designated hospitals since then. Hence, clinicians in the front line are able to respond quickly to the emerging COVID-19 outbreak with their accumulated knowledge and experiences from the past. One hundred seventeen fever clinics distributed in various district areas in Shanghai have played a vital 'sentinel' role to fight against the COVID-19 epidemic. Most of suspected patients were identified in fever clinics and thereafter among these suspected patients the COVID-19 cases were confirmed and were isolated quickly to avoid the spread. We would like to share the sentinel roadmap for screening and diagnosis of COVID-19 to medical healthcare workers around the world, especially countries who are facing great challenges to cope with COVID-19 and meanwhile with limited medical resources. These sentinel surveillance strategies will certainly provide insight into the early detection and timely isolation of suspected cases from the others.

AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a key climate variable that has been studied mainly at the urban scale and in the context of urban heat islands. By analyzing the connection between LST and land cover, this study shows the potential of LST to analyze the relation between urbanization and heating phenomena at the regional level. Land cover data, drawn from Copernicus, and LST, retrieved from Landsat 8 satellite images, are analyzed through a methodology that couples GIS and regression analysis. By looking at the Italian island of Sardinia as a case study, this research shows that urbanization and the spatial dynamics of heating phenomena are closely connected, and that intensively farmed areas behave quite similarly to urban areas, whereas forests are the most effective land covers in mitigating LST, followed by areas covered with Mediterranean shrubs. This leads to key policy recommendations that decision-makers could implement to mitigate LST at the regional scale and that can, in principle, be exported to regions with similar climate and land covers. The significance of this study can be summed up in its novel approach to analyzing the relationship between LST and land covers that uses freely available spatial data and, therefore, can easily be replicated in other regional contexts to derive appropriate policy recommendations.

AB  - Barchan dune is a peculiar type of dune that forms in wind corridors at the Inner Zone of Parangtritis Sand Dune. Their existence is increasingly threatened by land-use changes, especially vegetation coverage. This research illustrates the dynamics of vegetation cover change at the Inner Zone with the NDVI value approach using Sentinel-2 imagery. We also conduct field surveys to determine the actual condition of barchan dunes and compare it to previous morphology data. We only used the slip face height as a parameter of the barchan morphometric. The result showed that the vegetation coverage changed annually in different parts of the Inner Zone from 2015 until 2019. This vegetation covers controlled by restoration program in 2015 and 2016. The vegetation density on the transport zone more significantly affected the morphology of barchan than vegetation density which grow on the barchan body. Based on field data, mostly barchan dunes (10 barchans) experienced a decrease of slip face height than increased slip face height (4 barchans). All of the decreased barchans located in the middle of the Inner zone. The most decreased slip face height as low as 29.3 meters.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier recession is a globally occurring trend. Although a rich body of work has documented glacial response to climate warming, few studies have assessed vegetation cover change in recently deglaciated areas, especially using geospatial technologies. Here, vegetation change at two glacier forefronts in Glacier National Park, Montana, U.S.A. was quantified through remote sensing analysis, fieldwork validation, and statistical modeling. Specifically, we assessed the spatial and temporal patterns of landcover change at the two glacier forefronts in Glacier National Park and determined the role of selected biophysical terrain factors (elevation, slope, aspect, solar radiation, flow accumulation, topographic wetness index, and surficial geology) on vegetation change (from non-vegetated to vegetated cover) at the deglaciated areas. Landsat imagery of the study locations in 1991, 2003, and 2015 were classified and validated using visual interpretation. Model results revealed geographic differences in biophysical correlates of vegetation change between the study areas, suggesting that terrain variation is a key factor affecting spatial-temporal patterns of vegetation change. At Jackson Glacier forefront, increases in vegetation over some portion or all of the study period were negatively associated with elevation, slope angle, and consolidated bedrock. At Grinnell Glacier forefront, increases in vegetation associated negatively with elevation and positively with solar radiation. Integrated geospatial and field approaches to the study of vegetation change in recently deglaciated terrain are recommended to understand and monitor processes and patterns of ongoing habitat change in rapidly changing mountain environments.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to use the partial least squares regression as a modeling method to establish the relationship between soil moisture and polarimetric decomposition parameters which are obtained by T3 matrix and H/A/alpha polarimetric decomposition with full-polarization RADARSAT-2 SAR image. The results show that the parameter set of T3 matrix have the minimum accuracy comparing with the other three decomposition ways of the H/A/alpha. The best results of the H/A/alpha is the Eigenvector parameter set. However, it is still lower than the inversion of parameter combinations with R-2 of 0.84 for calibration and R-2 of 0.77 for validation. It indicates that the polarimetric decomposition parameters can be used for mapping soil moisture in Huanghe Delta.

TI  - Deep Mixture Model-Based Land Surface Temperature Retrieval for Hyperspectral Thermal IASI Sensor
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - A deep mixture model was developed to retrieve land surface temperatures (LSTs) from infrared atmospheric sounding interferometer (IASI) observations. The IASI brightness temperature (Tb) data and the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer onboard MetOp (AVHRR/MetOp) LST data were randomly divided into training and test datasets, and a deep mixture model was constructed to simulate radiation transmission in order to invert the LST. The constructed model could evaluate dataset characteristics that included global features, local features, and time-domain predictions, covering most of the features of the satellite dataset. For the test datasets, the root mean square error (RMSE) indicated that the LST in Algeria and South Africa could be retrieved with an error of less than 2 K and 2.5 K, respectively. Compared with the AVHRR/MetOp LST product in March and December 2019 for Algeria and South Africa, the LST could be retrieved with the maximum RMSE of 2.5 K. The LST retrievals at nighttime had an RMSE of less than 2.0 K, which was superior to those retrieved during daytime for Algeria. This deep mixture model can be applied to time-series temperature prediction.

AB  - In this work, we present the ground deformation analysis of the Italian Peninsula carried out via the Sentinel-1 (S-1) Parallel Small BAseline Subset (P-SBAS) approach. In particular, we generate surface deformation time-series and the corresponding mean deformation velocity maps by considering the overall archive of S-1 data acquired from both ascending and descending orbits during the March 2015 - December 2018 period. Moreover, we perform a large-scale comparison of the retrieved results with the deformation measurements of the available GPS stations deployed on the Italian territory and provided by the Nevada Geodetic Laboratory at the University of Nevada, Reno, USA (UNR-NGL). Finally, we properly combine the ascending and descending deformation time-series in order to compute the vertical and east-west components of the retrieved surface displacements. The achieved results demonstrate the capability of the P-SBAS processing chain to efficiently process large S-1 datasets to investigate ground deformation dynamics of large portions of the Earth surface.

M3  - Article
AB  - Education gains importance in the constitution of society, influencing economic and power relations and, in the humanistic dimension, it contributes to the incorporation of ethical and sensitive principles, expanding a more inclusive and emancipatory worldview. However, respect for diversity is still a challenge and there is a need for school institutions whose projects operate in different perspectives, among them in the countryside. This article aims to present aspects of rural education, understanding its peculiarities and correlating them to the Pedagogical Political Project of a country school, unveiling what is established (or not) as the purpose of a rural pedagogical practice. The methodology is based on a qualitative analysis, with a bibliographic and documentary approach. The results show a conception of rural education that is attentive to the needs of the rural community and that the pedagogical project of the investigated College, in general, converges with this conception. It was concluded that school education in the countryside needs to ensure specificities in its pedagogical project, respecting practices typical of the daily life of these rural communities and, thus, carrying out a humanistic and emancipatory process of the subjects.

AB  - The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) CoastWatch/OceantNatchPolarWatch (a.k.a. "CoastWatch") aims to improve decision outcomes by facilitating the use of ocean satellite data in applications and research for understanding, managing and protecting ocean, coastal and inland water resources and for assessing impacts of environmental change in ecosystems, human health, weather, and climate. Earth observations from space have the advantage of broad spatial and repeating temporal coverage that complement in situ measurements.. CoastWatch satellite data products are free and open (publicly available without the need for registration), and include multiple environmental parameters such as sea surface temperature, ocean color (e.g. chlorophyll), sea surface height (altimetry), ocean winds, surface roughness (synthetic aperture radar), salinity and sea ice. CoastWatch also distributes outputs from environmental models which incorporate several of these basic physical parameters to derive more complex information. These products cover multiple spatial regions (global and regional coverage) and near real-time as well as delayed-mode, higher quality and longer term time series datasets. CoastWatch customizes, serves, and monitors ocean satellite data products from NOAA and other environmental satellite missions. CoastWatch is well positioned to link upstream ocean satellite data producers with downstream user needs for real life applications. Our central "hub" is colocated with the ocean satellite data scientists in College Park, MD and our "spokes" are our seven regional Nodes distributed geographically around the country and across NOAA mission line offices. Our Gulf of Mexico Node is co-located with the NOAA Office of Ocean and Atmospheric Research, in the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (NOAA/OAR/AOML) in Miami, FL. Our Central Pacific OceanWatch Node is co-located with the National Marine Fisheries Service at the Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (NOAA/NMFS/PIFSC). CoastWatch operates 1) interactive and interoperable data portals to facilitate search and discovery, multi-product visualization and customizable data downloading; 2) a central helpdesk which responds to everything from educating and guiding novice users, help with discovering data products for specific applications, code suggestions to setup routine queries and downloads, etc.; 3) routine data quality and availability services that enable the assessment of data products over time and in comparison with reference datasets; 4) inperson training courses along with evolving online tutorial and virtual training opportunities. CoastWatch Utilities is a software package that helps users analyze and visualize satellite data products on their own. Coastwatch also collaborates directly with users to provide satellite data expertise in the development of applications that solve user-specific problems. Some examples and short demonstrations of data products, discovery and access pathways, tutorials and several user applications will be presented with an emphasis on our Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean, and our Central Pacific products, services and application tools.Disclaimer: The views, opinions, and findings contained in this article are those of the authors and should not be construed as an official National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) or U.S. Government position, policy, or decision.

T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive plant species in eastern Africa severely impede rangeland and cropland productivity with dire consequences for livelihoods of agro-pastoralist communities. We produced the first occurrence and spread map of invasive plant species (Prosopis: Prosopis juliflora and Parthenium: Parthenium hysterophorus) for western Somaliland (a region of eastern Africa) using vegetation productivity and phenology trends from 250 m MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) time-series data (2001-2014). Binomial logistic regression models were created to predict the presence or absence of the invasive species from the MODIS EVI phenometrics and vegetation productivity trends. Model training pixels were extracted from a 30 m Landsat-based classification that mapped areas of propagation of the two invasive species between 2001 and 2015. Field observations collected during 2014 and 2015 were used as reference data for the Landsat classification. After optimization of the logistic regression models, a probability of occurrence map was produced and evaluated for each of the two invasive species. The probability maps predicted that the cropland-dominated areas in the southwestern part of Somaliland were considerably infested with Parthenium while Prosopis was most abundant in the peri-urban zones and the central and eastern regions. Vegetation amplitude (the seasonal cycle of vegetation between the vegetation peak and the trough) was most relevant and statistically significant for predicting the spread of Parthenium. This highlights the importance of vegetation seasonality variables for the wide-area mapping of herbaceous life forms in semi-arid biomes. Mann-Kendall trends based on annual summed EVI value and seasonal EVI peak value trends were the most relevant predictors for the occurrence of Prosopis. Phenometric trends show immense potential to map shifts in vegetation patterns in relation to the spread of invasive species as a consequence of global change effects, particularly in African drylands.

AB  - Recently developed methods to simulate very high-resolution (VHR) wind fields over complex urban terrain rely on highquality three-dimensional vector representations of building information. Unfortunately data of that kind is sparsely available on a worldwide scale. In this work, we investigate the applicability of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) on 2.5D digital surface models (DSMs) automatically generated by generative adversarial network (GAN) from globally available satellite data which includes photogrammetric DSMs and pan-chromatic (PAN) images The obtained results demonstrate that the GAN-based DSMs are reasonable alternatives to rarely available level of detail 2 (LoD2) vector data, promoting large coverage, continuous wind field derivation over complex terrain.

AB  - Modern agriculture is facing new challenges about food production for a growing population in a sustainable manner. Crop mapping at local and regional scale could provide valuable information in support of agricultural policy. This paper describes a field mapping investigation in a populated area in Tuscany (Italy). Satellite images from Sentinel-1 C-band and COSMO-SkyMed X-band SAR and Sentinel-2 optical sensors are input of classifiers based on deep learning and convolutional neural networks. Results pinpointed that the use of optical images allowed the best overall classification accuracy (99.7%), nevertheless X-band SAR imagery, providing an accuracy of 94.6%, could be a good substitute of optical indices in case of lack of cloud-free multispectral data.

TI  - TRENDS AND LAND SURFACE PHENOLOGICAL RESPONSES TO CLIMATE VARIABILITY IN THE ARGENTINA PAMPAS
T2  - CUADERNOS DE INVESTIGACION GEOGRAFICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the interaction between land surface and atmosphere processes is fundamental for predicting the effects of future climate change on ecosystem functioning and carbon dynamics. The objectives of this work were to analyze the trends in land surface phenology (LSP) metrics from remote sensing data, and to reveal their relationship with precipitation and ENSO phenomenon in the Argentina Pampas. Using a time series of MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data from 2000 to 2014, the start of the growing season (SOS), the annual integral of NDVI (i-NDVI, linear estimator of annual productivity) the timing of the annual maximum NDVI (t-MAX) and the annual relative range of NDVI (RREL, estimator of seasonality) were obtained for the Argentina Pampas. Then, spatial and temporal relationships with the Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI) and precipitation were analyzed. Results showed a negative trend in annual productivity over a 53.6% of the study area associated to natural and semi-natural grassland under cattle grazing, whereas a 40.3% of Argentina Pampas showed a significant positive trend in seasonality of carbon gains. The study also reveals that climate variability has a significant impact on land surface phenology in Argentina Pampas, although the impact is heterogeneous. SOS and t-MAX showed a significant negative correlation with the precipitation indicating an earlier occurrence. 23.6% and 28.4% of the study area showed a positive correlation of the annual productivity with MEI and precipitation, respectively, associated to rangelands (in the first case) and to both rangeland and croplands, in the second case. Climate variability did not explain the seasonal variability of phenology. The relationships found between LSP metrics and climate variability could be important for implementation of strategies for natural resource management.

TI  - Malignant adenomyoepithelioma of the breast: A case report
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Malignant breast adenomyoepithelioma (AME) is a rare subtype of breast cancer. AME is mostly a benign disease that uncommonly undergoes malignant transformation.PRESENTATION OF CASE: Here we present a case of a young, previously healthy female who initially presented with a painless breast lump. The patient underwent wide local excision for atypical cells with squamous metaplasia by core biopsy, but final histopathology showed AME with carcinoma. Thus, a mastectomy and a sentinel lymph node biopsy was undertaken. The patient had an uneventful recovery and no recurrence after the second surgery.DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Malignant transformation of adenomyoepithelioma is reported in a small number of cases. Benign AME may be treated with wide local excision as recurrence is rare locally. Whereas malignant AME tends to be treated with simple mastectomy with or without lymph node biopsy.

M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - This paper provides an overview on the application of satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technology in archaeology. The growing developments of space SAR technologies in terms of observational capabilities (spatial, spectral, radiometric, and temporal coverage) had made the use of these technologies very attractive for archaeological investigations. Although several achievements have been made in recent years on the basis of pioneering efforts addressed to the assessment of the potentiality of the L-, C-, and X-band SAR in archaeology, the full capability of these technologies for archaeological site detection is still incompletely evaluated until now. Moreover, significant advances are expected from the most recent satellite data available at 25 cm in X-band (TerraSAR) and at 1 m in multipolarized L-band (PALSAR). These enhanced characteristics, in terms of spatial resolution and radiometric quality, take the most recent SAR technologies to a new level for archaeological applications, addressed to object detection and target recognition.

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Vegetation patterns and plant communities associated with them are determined on the regional scale based on an analysis of remote sensing data and ground information. Three main vegetation patterns are described in dependence on ecological factors: geological substrate (loess vs. sand), relief, precipitation and warmness. The first two patterns are characterized by the same substrate (loess) but different relief and consist of dry grasslands in combination with birch forests. The first pattern on elevated plains with extensive gully systems looks at forest patches in the form of dendritic or amoeba-like contours in a matrix of steppes and arable land. The second pattern on low-lying plains with poor drainage is patchy with numerous rounded forest groves, locally called 'kolok' forests, embedded in a steppe matrix. The third one differs mostly by substrate (sand) and is represented by pine forests in combination with psammophytic steppes. Each pattern is composed of different vegetation types (forests and grasslands) and distributed more or less throughout all of the Kulunda area. Nine types of forest ecosystems and four types of grasslands could be distinguished by species composition and their ecological demands. Depending on local climate conditions, combinations of plant communities in each pattern change from west to east on the precipitation gradient and from south to north along the warmness gradient.

TI  - Land Cover Classification of Complex Agroecosystems in the Non-Protected Highlands of the Galapagos Islands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The humid highlands of the Galapagos are the islands' most biologically productive regions and a key habitat for endemic animal and plant species. These areas are crucial for the region's food security and for the control of invasive plants, but little is known about the spatial distribution of its land cover. We generated a baseline high-resolution land cover map of the agricultural zones and their surrounding protected areas. We combined the high spatial resolution of PlanetScope images with the high spectral resolution of Sentinel-2 images in an object-based classification using a RandomForest algorithm. We used images collected with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to verify and validate our classified map. Despite the astounding diversity and heterogeneity of the highland landscape, our classification yielded useful results (overall Kappa: 0.7, R-2: 0.69) and revealed that across all four inhabited islands, invasive plants cover the largest fraction (28.5%) of the agricultural area, followed by pastures (22.3%), native vegetation (18.6%), food crops (18.3%), and mixed forest and pioneer plants (11.6%). Our results are consistent with historical trajectories of colonization and abandonment of the highlands. The produced dataset is designed to suit the needs of practitioners of both conservation and agriculture and aims to foster collaboration between the two areas.

TI  - Predictors of correct interpretation of English and Bulgarian idioms by Russian speakers
T2  - RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF LINGUISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - During intercultural communication, it is crucial to interpret correctly and to use appropriately foreign idioms which are culturally marked and reflect linguistic and cultural identity of a speech community. Interlocutors should be aware of the cultural and historical precedents that gave rise to the primary image underlying idiomatic expressions and thus created their unique phraseological worldview. The aim of the research is to find out what is a better predictor of correct idiom interpretation - degree of proficiency in a foreign language or degree of genealogical kinship between the native and foreign languages. The topicality of the research is justified by the need for a deeper understanding of linguistic and cultural identity of native and foreign-language speakers, with a view to facilitate and enhance cross-cultural communication. The working hypothesis is that due to the close genealogical kinship between Russian and Bulgarian and the users' advanced level of English, the number of correctly interpreted idioms may vary within a statistically significant medium range. The total sample comprises 5000 idioms (2500 English and 2500 Bulgarian ones). The subsample used in the experiment comprises 60 idioms (30 English and 30 Bulgarian ones) selected from 'The Oxford Dictionary of Idioms' and 'Nov fraseologichen rechnik na bylgarskiya jezik' by means of stratified systematic sampling. The main methods used in the research include (1) comparative linguistic and cultural analyses, (2) scientific experimentation, (3) systematic and stratified sampling, and (4) a paired t-test. The experimental research and the paired t-test have proved our hypothesis and demonstrated that Russian participants correctly decode more Bulgarian than English idioms, with intergroup variation being statistically significant. Research findings have implications for cultural linguistics. Since translation loans (calques), isomorphic idioms, and idioms dating back to a common source are interpreted more quickly and more accurately than idioms which contain unique or culturally-loaded elements, such as old-fashioned words or proper names, access to cultural precedents that served as prototypes of set expressions contributes to a more seamless code-switching and enables communicants to penetrate deeper the mentality of a specific linguacultural community and thus become aware of the variability of cultural cognition and conceptualisation.

TI  - Nodal staging affects adjuvant treatment choices in elderly patients with clinically node-negative, estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.
T2  - Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Background: In response to Choosing Wisely recommendations that sentinel lymph node biopsy (slnb) should not be routinely performed in elderly patients with node-negative (cN0), estrogen receptor-positive (er+) breast cancer, we sought to evaluate how nodal staging affects adjuvant treatment in this population.Methods: From a prospective database, we identified patients 70 or more years of age with cN0 breast cancer treated with surgery for er+ her2-negative invasive disease during 2012-2016. We determined rates of, and factors associated with, nodal positivity (pN+), and compared the use of adjuvant radiation (rt) and systemic therapy by nodal status.Results: Of 364 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 331 (91%) underwent slnb, with 75 (23%) being pN+. Axillary node dissection was performed in 11 patients (3%). On multivariate analysis, tumour size was the only factor associated with pN+ (p = 0.007). Nodal positivity rates were 0%, 13%, 23%, 33%, and 27% for lesions preoperatively sized at 0-0.5 cm, 0.5-1 cm, 1.1-2.0 cm, 2.1-5.0 cm, and more than 5.0 cm. Compared with patients assessed as node-negative, those who were pN+ were more likely to receive axillary rt (lumpectomy: 53% vs. 1%, p < 0.001; mastectomy: 43% vs. 2%, p < 0.001), and adjuvant systemic therapy (endocrine: 82% vs. 69%; chemotherapy plus endocrine: 7% vs. 2%, p = 0.002).Conclusions: Of elderly patients with cN0 er+ breast cancer, 23% were pN+ on slnb. Size was the primary predictor of nodal status, and yet significant rates of nodal positivity were observed even in tumours preoperatively sized at 1 cm or less. The use of rt and systemic adjuvant therapies differed by nodal status, although the long-term oncologic implications require further investigation. Multidisciplinary input on a case-by-case basis should be considered before omission of slnb.

TI  - CULTURAL MECHANISMS OF INTEGRATING THE UKRAINIAN COSSACK ELITE INTO THE IMPERIAL NOBILITY
T2  - QUAESTIO ROSSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, the author explores the degree of effectiveness of cultural mechanisms implemented in the integration of the Ukrainian Cossack elite into the all-imperial nobility. According to the author, the mid-eighteenth century became a milestone in updating cultural integration mechanisms. Using multiple examples, the author demonstrates how the Cossack elite actively broke away from their cultural provincialism, sending their children to educational institutions of the imperial capitals, and subsequently replenished and formed the imperial noble intellectual elite. The author explains such changes by the influence of European ideological transfer, which led to the transformation of the worldview of the Russian ruling elite, and then, during the reign of Peter 1, to the transformation of the Russian imperial court into one of the leading courts of Europe. The result of the said sociocultural processes was the transformation of the capital's cultural and educational institutions into new centres for attracting leading Western professors and Ukrainian youth, who were looking for opportunities for creative and professional self-realisation, According to the author, another important incentive for the Cossack elite was the political ascent of two ordinary Ukrainian Cossacks, the brothers Alexei and Cyril Razumovsky. The Razumovsky brothers became a part of the new nobility, who ascended to power during the reign of Elizabeth Petrovna. For this reason, they became a key cultural channel of the new European worldview for the Cossack elite of Little Russia and an important resource for entering imperial educational institutions and forming the imperial nobility from the Cossack elite, Further, a debatable opinion is expressed in the text of the article, according to which the "Enlightenment discourse" characteristic of Russia and Europe of the time became the main cultural mechanism for the integration of the Cossack elite. According to this "Enlightenment Discourse", at the top of the hierarchy of rationality, there was an enlightened cosmopolitan, an imperial nobleman, a member of a supranational community The author maintains that the existence of such cultural mechanisms allowed the Cossack elite to break away relatively easily from their former Cossack identity

TI  - Y Comparison of viability and phagocytic responses of hemocytes withdrawn from the bivalves <i>Mytilus edulis</i> and <i>Dreissena polymorpha</i>, and exposed to human parasitic protozoa
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Bivalve molluscs are now considered indicator species of aquatic contamination by human parasitic protozoa. Nonetheless, the possible effects of these protozoa on the immune system of their paratenic hosts are poorly documented. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of two protozoa on hemocyte viability and phagocytosis from two mussels, the zebra mussel (freshwater habitat) and the blue mussel (seawater habitat). For these purposes, viability and phagocytic markers have been analysed on hemocytes from mussels without biological stress (control hemocytes), and on hemocytes exposed to a biological stress (Toxoplasma gondii and Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts). We report, for the first known time, the interactions between protozoa and hemocytes of mussels from different aquatic environments. Zebra mussel hemocytes showed a decrease in phagocytosis of fluorescent microbeads after exposure to both protozoa, while blue mussel hemocytes reacted only to T. gondii oocysts. These decreases in the ingestion of microbeads can be caused by competition between beads and oocysts and can be influenced by the size of the oocysts. New characterisations of their immune capacities, including aggregation, remain to be developed to understand the specificities of both mussels. (C) 2019 Australian Society for Parasitology.

TI  - Perverse heroism. Vyacheslav Ivanov's dialogue with Nietzsche
T2  - VESTNIK SANKT-PETERBURGSKOGO UNIVERSITETA-FILOSOFIYA I KONFLIKTOLOGIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the paper is to analyse the theoretical base of tragic culture in the writings of F. Nietzsche and V. I. Ivanov. The result of the proposed analysis is the comparison of similarities and differences concerning the cultural role of tragedy in the philosophy of mentioned authors. The philosophers - Nietzsche, the implacable enemy of the historical Christianity and Ivanov, the Christian philosopher of culture, philologist and translator - both postulate creating and preserving tragic culture. According to both authors, the main task of culture is to confront the human being with the most terrible aspects of life. This ruthless requirement allows us to claim that perverse heroism is a general mood and the most important imperative of Nietzsche's and Ivanov's philosophy of culture. The imperative to preserve the tragic principle in culture is in fact an imperative to become a superhuman. The starting point of the analysis is the theorem of Nietzsche who defines a tragic worldview as the opposite of a theoretical one. The essence of the theoretical approach is an overlooking of the tragic dimension of life, which allows man to establish a coherent, justified and safe picture of the world. The tragic approach, emphasizing the inevitability of suffering and the lack of metaphysical foundation, opposes the optimism of the theoretical one. Ivanov, as Nietzsche, was fascinated with Dionysian idea but he interpreted it quite differently. The Russian author accepted Dionysus not as the opposite, but as a prefiguration of Christ. Thus, he drew attention to the presence of the tragic moment in Christianity. The height of Ivanov's dispute with Nietzsche is a completely different interpretation of the idea of superhuman, which presents a totally different understanding of self-transgression and vastly different value systems.

TI  - Yoon dongju’s Hometown and Poetic Road
TI  - 윤동주의 ‘고향’과 시적 도정
T2  - 한국학연구
M3  - research-article
AB  - This article traces the transformation of Yoon Dongju's poems through the signifier or image of 'hometown'. Yoon Dongju is a poet who has used this experience as a material of poetry writing while studying abroad in Bukgando, Pyeongyang, Gyeongseong, and Japan during his short life of twenty-seven. Unlike the characteristics mentioned in diaspora literature, 'hometown' was not given to Yoon as a single experience, and he worried about the 'outside' of collectively universal consciousness of Bukgando immigrants and colonial Koreans and left traces of it all over the poetry. This study focuses on the fact that he is not passively experiencing the symbolic world of 'home' through his hometown Yongjeong, Joseon, and Japan, but in a unique way. At the same time, this paper examined the image of 'sky' as a Christian worldview and its imaginary representation as a reference frame that enables it.First, in the poems based on Yongjeong and Pyeongyang, the poet shows the wandering of the subject who is struggling in the discrepancy of territory and nationality through two hometowns and sky. At this time, the desire for 'rising' is connected to the cosmic world of 'another hometown' through the Christian faith in Yonhui College(Chosen Christian College). And Yoon dongju try to practice continuous reflection as an ontological method to reach the world. Finally, during his study abroad in the Empire, Yoon Dongju wrote a poetic event that confronts himself for the first time, limiting his desire for ascent extremely, as if he were breaking up with all the poetic roads that he wandered and restored his ‘hometown’ and wanted to go to ‘another hometown’. Yoon Dongju's poetic world is based on the imagination of seeking the relationship with his hometown in a multi-layered attitude, and it has gradually changed based on this. And the imagination was connected to the distinct future of the new era, which was waiting for 'shame' to be compulsively performed in poetry and reality based on faith.

TI  - Tracheo-Innominate Fistula in Children: A Systematic Review of Literature
T2  - LARYNGOSCOPE
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective: Tracheo-innominate fistula (TIF) is a rare but fatal complication of tracheotomy. To date, there is a paucity of literature regarding pediatric TIFs. The objectives of this study were to conduct a systematic review of literature on pediatric TIF following tracheotomy and describe three demonstrative cases from our institutional experience.Methods: We conducted a systematic review using MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Web of Science, and CINAHL. All studies with pediatric patients (under 18 years of age) who developed TIF following tracheotomy were included.Results: Fifty-four publications met inclusion criteria, reporting on 77 cases. The most common indication for tracheotomy was prolonged intubation and the need for ventilatory support (38.6%), with neurological comorbidities being the most common indication (72.7%). The mean time to TIF was 395.7 days (95% confidence interval, 225.9-565.5). Fifty-four patients (70.1%) presented with massive hemorrhage, whereas 18 patients (23.3%) presented with a sentinel bleeding event. The most common diagnostic interventions were computed tomography scan with or without contrast and bronchoscopy (55.8%). A substantial number of patients did not have any investigations (41.6%). Surgical management occurred in 70.1% of patients. Mortality was 38.6% in reported cases with variable follow-up periods.Conclusion: TIF may occur in long-term tracheostomy-dependent children, contrary to the conventionally described 3-week postoperative period. The mortality may not be as high as previously reported with timely intervention. Our results are limited by inherent risks of bias. Further research including well-designed cohort studies are needed to guide an evidence-based approach to TIF.

AB  - The COVID-19 from 2019 to 2010 is a global crisis what would change the modern history of human beings in terms of global public health and human civilization. As the coronavirus from China unprecedentedly attacked the European countries and the U.S., the existing disease worldview based on the West supremacy and ‘Orientalism’ has been seriously unsettled. This study attempts to examine how the visual coverage of the global news media has been changed as the Chinese outbreaks expanding to the ‘global pandemic’ and the serious Western disease crisis. For this purpose, this study analysed the news items of CNNI(CNN International) focusing on the visual aspects. Using both the quantitative and qualitative methods, this study closely examines 1) the structural elements, 2) visual thematic frame, 3) visual expressive style of 8 CNN world news items from 2020. 1.1 to 3.31. Research findings show that the coverage of Chinese Wuhan’s outbreak employs the narratives of disease ‘othering’ with the visual thematic frame of ‘emergency,’ and ‘cultural stereotypes’ On the other hand, the coverage of the U.S and Italy tends to use the narrative of ‘our disease’ using the visual frames of the ‘scientific control’ and ‘visualization of virus’ The social cultural implication of research findings are discussed.

AB  - It is agreed by most researchers that the absence of a clear record or a comprehensive system of pre-9th century East Slavic mythology, which can only be found in old and folk tales. Nevertheless, the research to restore the Eastern Slavans’ mythology and the world of their primitive imagination through oral and folktales has continued steadily. What is clear is that the oral texts, folk tales, and myths written by the East Slavans in their literal form have already been transformed from their original form in the Christian world order.The mythical femininity, which was important in the maternal order of the ancient East Slavans, changed from a male hero-centered narrative in the historical world. One of the most transformed symbols in the Logos-centered history was the image of a serpent/dragon associated with creative femininity. In the mythical world of East Slavans on the Black Sea influenced by the Scythian civilization, the serpent/dragon figure, symbolizing cosmic time and directly linked to the image of femininity and water, was also represented as a sacred being in the sky. However, the serpent/dragon shape has changed in a confrontation to highlight the heroism of the father-hero in the Christian order and is stuck with the image of a giant and powerful monster that is increasingly hard to defeat to highlight the hero’s greatness.This paper analyzed how the dragon figure in the East Slavic mythology is transformed to create a new current myth in the Russian fantasy film He is a Dragon, one of the highest-grossing Russian films abroad in 2016, declared the “Year of Russian Cinema.” In this film, the story of dragon and dragon is remarkably different from the image of dragon as a source of evil in East Slavic myths and folktales written since the adoption of Christianity as the state religion. In addition, in this film, ‘Dragon-Fire-Male’ is transformed into a new dimension that combines death and violence into a harmonious life, where the crucial role is the shape of ‘Bride-Water-Femininity’, a source of creative natural power in the ancient East Slavic worldview.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Endometrial carcinoma is the most common gynecological malignancy in developed countries. In early stage endometrial cancer, routine systemic pelvic lymphadenectomy showed no survival benefits and results in increased morbidity. The role of PET/CT imaging for the pre-operative detection of lymph node metastases in endometrial cancer is unclear. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping may reduce the surgical staging morbidity while maintaining prognostic information of the lymph node status. Recently, indocyanine green (ICG) SLN mapping has been utilized to detect nodal metastasis in endometrial cancer. Endosalpingiosis is defined as the presence of tubal-like epithelium outside of the fallopian tube and can sometimes be misinterpreted as cancer metastasis. Here, we discuss a patient with newly diagnosed endometrial cancer who had pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes with high glucose avidity on PET/CT, and ICG positivity on SLN mapping, suspected clinically to be metastatic adenocarcinoma, but with the pathological finding of endosalpingiosis only.

AB  - This paper attempts to identify the thoughts of prehistoric people by studying the hybrid motifs that appear on the petroglyphs of Daegok-ri and Cheonjeon-ri.The Daegok-ri petroglyphs present a worldview on change by showing the world as undifferentiated and differentiated and as phenomena brought about by the interaction between the undifferentiated and the differentiated, depicting the three aspects as being in a causal relationship.The Cheonjeon-ri petroglyphs depict the world of phenomena as the point of origin. They show how the world is divided into time and space through circles and squares and how letters are used to objectify time and space presenting a world detached from reality.Both petroglyphs demonstrate a worldview of change through the transformation of events and objects. Here, humans are at the center of the changing events and objects. The world of change is created by humans showing how humans, time, and space move from undifferentiated to differentiated, from differentiated to undifferentiated, and then back to being humans and objectified phenomena.

AB  - Okinawa's traditional faith is an animistic polytheistic religion based on ancient primitive naturalism and ancestralism that begins with human death. In Shioya Bay, which is formed by the sea and mountains, there is a deep understanding of Niraikanai's world view and Utaki belief, which originated from mountain worship, in the piousness of the sea. Ungami's residence in the sea is Niraikanai, Utaki from the mountains, and Kmiasagi from the village. With this worldview, Ungami in Shioya Bay has its origins in singing and is the main place for festivals. In addition to the various prayer sites in the village, you can see the diversity of the festival sites such as the palace, the head family, the beach, the riverside, the sea, and the village community center.However, the symbolic deity of Ungami is the sea god. This is due to Niraikanai's view of the world far away from the sea. Niraikanai means that the soul reborn as the root of the life in which a new life is born as well as the god of death that the dead go, is a baby, and the god reborn as an ancestor. In this respect, the various gods of Ungami need to recognize the existence of various gods, including not only the sea god who protects the sea but also the ancestral god. In particular, the sea god, who recognizes that Niraikanai is in the sea and comes through the sea, has the symbolic meaning of God in the consciousness of the residents of Kamaya. In other words, there are complex and diverse structures and characteristics of the Unkami Festival site and various gods in Shioya Bay. In this sense, this article focuses on the structure and characteristics of Ungami, a religious ritual of the village community in Kuriya Bay.

AB  - This paper deals with the semi-automatic SAR(Synthetic Aperture Radar) image land-cover labeling system. The term semi-automatic refers to a sequential process in which the input SAR image is automatically labeled through the GPS information and the open API provided by the nation, and the user can manually modify the labeling information with the annotation tool. Since there may be some differences from the actual land information, the label is finally corrected by manually modifying it with annotation tool. The semi-automatic labeling system proposed in this paper is made to label water/forest/farmland/building by using SAR image and latitude/longitude information as input, but it can also be used to develop a land-related image analysis system with different purposes. The entire pipeline system is tested with the Sentinel-1A(S1A) image, and found that it works well in an acceptable range.

AB  - Church education in Korean churches is facing a very serious crisis. This crisis is a negative perception of the church as viewed by the present society. The negative perception of the church has led to children, adolescents, young adults, and even adults leaving the church. There have been countless studies on the problem of Christian education and its alternatives. However, those problems still remain a matter of church education. The alternatives do not become viable and remain a problem. To solve these problems, a paradigm shift is required, and in order to overcome the crisis of the church, it is necessary to study alternatives and its method factors and find application points. Today's church education is absolutely influenced by postmodernism and informationalization. However, church education is education for Christian identity that transmits Christian faith. This Christian education is facing challenges and crises against its religious and academic identity. Christian education has a responsibility to be aware of this reality and to present alternatives to overcome various crises facing church education. Therefore, it is the task of church education to establish standards so that we can live a life where the Bible becomes the standard. In other words, it is to give them biblical faith. Furthermore, it is necessary to point out and understand Christian faith in the Korean church, which has been evaluated as insufficient. In addition, establishing a Christian worldview and realizing the Kingdom of God that practice justice and love in society are tasks that can be accomplished efficiently through Christian education. Therefore, the Korean church should actively seek ways to support the practice of Christian education as well as church education in forming ideal Christians which is the goal of Christian education.

AB  - Through the concept ‘Bulham’, Choi Nam-seon’s the theory of Bulham culture expresses the origin of Joseon(Korean) culture, its development, and its expansion into the world. Limit the discussion to the mythology, this paper aims at reviewing the acceptance and translation of Chinese Myths. Futhermore, based on this, the Chinese philosophy behind the acceptance of Chinese mythology is intended to be compared and reviewed in terms of worldview. The correlation between the theory of Bulham culture and the Chinese thoughts is arranged in the following two aspects: the first, Choi Nam-seon embraces Chinese mythology and uses it as a theoretical basis for the Bulham culture, and it borrow two mythological contents, the one is the theoretical opening of the mythical character of the creation of heaven and earth through the "Bango Myth," an open myth of ancient China, and the other is the function of the "axis of heaven and earth" or the "post of heaven" as a medium of communication between heaven and earth through the colorful depiction of mountains. As such, the theory of Bulham culture uses Chinese mythology and its thoughts as the basis for the spread of Buddhist culture, and the world view of ancient Chinese mythology and the acceptance of mythological thinking are both sufficient to gauge the mutual connection between the two. However, the relationship between ancient Chinese myths and Bulham culture, in the question of time before and after, remains a problem to be solved. The second, the creation of heaven and earth or the acceptance of open-wall mythology in the theory of Bulham culture reflects the flow of gradual transition from myth to philosophy thought in ancient Chinese. Choi Nam-sun refers to "Tai-yi" in Huainanzi, which means the foundation of "Tian-ming", it is a concept that encompasses myth and philosophical worldviews in the Huainamzi and is a chaotic differential as a possible mode that unfolds in all things. In this state of chaos, the world is formed through step-by-step processes. At this time, the "Dao" functions as an order and serves as a basis for the organic unity of the entire world. Such a "Dao" is the fundamental thinking for the idea of "ᄇᆞᆰPark" as the basis for the same culture as claimed by the Bulham Culture Theory. In addition to the etymological method emphasized by Choi Nam-sun in this regard, it is a theoretical monotonic approach.Choi Nam-sun's Bulham Culture Theory reflects the unique identity and speciality of Joseon(Korean) culture, and it emphasizes universality as the mobilization of different cultures. Based on the hypothesis that Bulham Culture Theory was established based on Chinese mythology and the philosophical worldview of ancient China, which is submerged within it, this article evaluates that Choi Nam-seon's way of thinking has some characteristics of coexistence of mythological and humanities reasons.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to subclassify and analyze the characteristics of ‘LIFE IS A JOURNEY’ in CCM (Contemporary Christian Music) in order to examine the features created by the conceptual metaphor in the perspective of Christian community. This study used the lyrics of 91 popular CCMs in Melon chart (the most frequently used music platform in South Korea) between 2017 and 2018.The results showed mapping of ‘LIFE IS A JOURNEY’ as follows: ‘Individuals are travelers’, ‘Phases in life are routes’, ‘The counselor is a guide’, ‘The moment of choice is a crossroad’, and ‘Living is walking.’ However the actual realization of this metaphor in CCM has three features. First, the ‘guide’ plays an essential role in the traveler’s life not only as a guide but also as a guardian and companion forming intimate relationships with travelers. Regarding the fact that counselors indicates God in the lyrics, it is inferred that God’s existence has been an indispensable part of Christians’ view of life. Secondly, various ‘routes’ that travelers encounter turn out to be classified into two types: the route they should follow and the other that they should not follow. This implies that, to Christians, the moment of decision making in their lives is not value-neutral. It is rather understood as the moment when they have to choose between right and wrong according to their religious conscience. Thirdly, while the ‘destination’ of journey was barely expressed in the lyrics, expressions related to ‘walking’ frequently appeared. It may be interpreted that people focus more on the present daily life than the future afterlife. However, relatively sparse occurrence of the expressions corresponding to ‘destination’ may be due to the fact that it is difficult to pick one adequate element of life which corresponds to ‘destination’ of journey. Therefore, the prototype of journey remains the subject of further study.Based on the above framework, this study found that Christians use conceptual journey metaphors as well, but by adding additional features to some elements and using some elements more or less, they are building their own cognitive system that conforms to their view of the world. This paper has a limitation that it analyzed the religious language only in the form of CCMs. However, it has an implication in doing metaphor research regarding social community sharing specific value and worldview. This research hopes to shed light on the expansion of cognitive linguistics research regarding social context so that it would deepen not only the understandings of metaphors but also understandings of others living at the same time, in the same society.

TI  - Tropical Cyclone Intensity Estimation Using Multi-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks from Geostationary Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - For a long time, researchers have tried to find a way to analyze tropical cyclone (TC) intensity in real-time. Since there is no standardized method for estimating TC intensity and the most widely used method is a manual algorithm using satellite-based cloud images, there is a bias that varies depending on the TC center and shape. In this study, we adopted convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which are part of a state-of-art approach that analyzes image patterns to estimate TC intensity by mimicking human cloud pattern recognition. Both two dimensional-CNN (2D-CNN) and three-dimensional-CNN (3D-CNN) were used to analyze the relationship between multi-spectral geostationary satellite images and TC intensity. Our best-optimized model produced a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 8.32 kts, resulting in better performance (35%) than the existing model using the CNN-based approach with a single channel image. Moreover, we analyzed the characteristics of multi-spectral satellite-based TC images according to intensity using a heat map, which is one of the visualization means of CNNs. It shows that the stronger the intensity of the TC, the greater the influence of the TC center in the lower atmosphere. This is consistent with the results from the existing TC initialization method with numerical simulations based on dynamical TC models. Our study suggests the possibility that a deep learning approach can be used to interpret the behavior characteristics of TCs.

AB  - Urban development increased heat island and flood damage due to a decrease in green space and an increase in impermeable layers. The purpose of this study is to construct a disaster prevention DB and to utilize urban environmental information using satellite images. The satellite images are used to prepare the Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Bare Soil Index (BI), and Land Surface Temperature (LST) using satellite images from 2008 and 2017 in Busan. Analysis of examine their correlations and changes in the Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Bare Soil Index (BI). As a result, LST and NDVI have a negative relationship, and LST, NDBI, and BI have a positive relationship. Also increasing NDBI and BI led to urbanization and decreasing NDVI to green areas. Urban changes were reviewed by analyzing areas where NDBI, BI, and LST increased and NDVI decreased. Changes were most frequent in Gangseo-gu and Gijang-gun, Busan. Using satellite imagery, it will be possible to predict urban change, establish disaster prevention DB, and utilize urban environmental information. And It is thought that the satellite image can be used for solution of urban heat island phenomenon, urban change prediction and urban management environment information.

AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has the advantage of operating regardless of the cloud cover or a lack of light. This makes SAR a potential substitution for optical sensors in various ways. SAR images have been effectively used for detecting the various terrain changes, particularly in comparing the terrain before and after natural disasters. In this paper, we compare SAR images to measure the forest loss rate before and after the fire. we analyze the Gangwon-do forest fire which occurred in 2019. SNAP (Sentinels Application Platform) is used in this paper to process Sentinel-1. Pre-processing, post-processing, color manipulation, cropping image was used in the program. Based on the calculated loss rate, we expect that it can be used for other researches such as flood or debris flow. It would be more accurate by using SAR images.

AB  - This paper examines two test statistics, namely, likelihood ratio statistic and Roy's largest eigenvalue, for detecting changes in multi-look bi-temporal ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 fully polarimetric data. The latter turns into the well-known intensity ratio when applying to single-polarization data. The experimental results showed a comparable good performance of both the statistics in change detection. A more comprehensive change map was obtained from the fully polarimetric data compared with the use of only single-polarization data.

AB  - Earth-observing data from the recent geostationary orbit satellites can be useful to retrieve the surface reflectance as well as aerosol properties including aerosol optical thickness (AOT). Implementing the algorithm to determine the geometry dependent surface reflectance based on the atmospheric correction with pre-defined atmospheric transmission function is an effective way to determine AOT. This study presents framework to integrate surface reflectance and aerosol retrieval processes by combining with the atmospheric correction, minimum reflection composite, and look-up table (LUT) application for the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) onboard Himawari-8 data. We discuss the algorithm's performance by applying test period datasets including a clear sky as well as anomalously high AOT values during the air pollution events. We also described results from a comparison with the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) operational products. Continuous observation data were used to derive surface reflectance at a given time and this geometry dependent surface reflectance were successfully applied to aerosol retrieval process. There were good agreements between retrieved AOT with sunphotometer-derived and MODIS AOTs, with a linear correlation coefficient (r) of 0.78 similar to 0.83 and mean bias of 0.07. These results suggest that the proposed method applied to the AHI data can accurately estimate continuous surface and aerosol properties. Moreover, aerosol retrieval results from the geostationary satellite are promising for monitoring air quality with its enhanced spatial and temporal resolution.

AB  - This study was carried out to classify country-wide areas of paddy rice cultivation using sentinel-1 SAR (syntheticaperture radar) imagery. Rice production with adequate level of area is important for decision making of ricesupply and demand policy. It is essential to grasp rice cultivation areas in advance for estimating riceproduction of the year. Time-series Sentinel-1A and 1B images acquired from early May to early July wereprocessed to convert into sigma naught (dB) images using SNAP (SeNtinel application platform) toolboxprovided by European Space Agency. Farm map and parcel map, which are spatial data of vector polygon,were used to stratify paddy field population for classifying rice paddy cultivation. To distinguish paddy ricefrom other crops grown in the paddy fields, threshold levels were determined for each image based on cropcalendar and backscattering coefficient range of paddy rice and other crops, and applied for the images tomake theme maps with “1” for rice and “0” for other crops. Theme map layers were stacked to make oneimage and the each threshold value was applied to the theme map for rice classification. The classified areas ofrice cultivation in 2020 under the stratification of three different paddy field population, 1) whole farm map,2) farm map with paddy and plastic film house, 3) parcel map edited by LX, were 716,683 ha, 621,778 ha, and641,679 ha, respectively. Reference data with spatial information need to be developed using farmhousemanagement and farmland boundary information. Image classification methods need to be attempted forfurther studies.

AB  - Synthetic aperture radar images from the Sentinel-1 program are obtained by interpreting signals from a non-uniform radiation pattern. Cross-polarized images in extra-wide mode show significant additive noise patterns that take the form of varying intensity and are independent of the ground targets. While Sentinel-1 provides a method for removing these noise patterns via noise-calibration files, there still remain significant issues in the transformed products, particularly from discontinuous changes among adjacent subswaths. In this work, we consider recalibration by assuming the noise-gain to be a power function of the platform's radiation pattern. We propose a method that estimates the scaling and exponent parameters of the power-function by applying linear programming to the log transform of the data and the radiation pattern intensity, alone with affine rescaling with least-squares estimation. Our method is able to rescale Sentinel-1 scenes to have amore consistent intensity profile among the subswaths of the image.

T2  - Korean Journal of Agricultural Science
M3  - research-article
AB  - Particulate matter (PM) is regarded as a major threat to public health and safety in urban areas. Despite a variety of efforts to systemically monitor the distribution of PM, the limited amount of sampling sites may not provide sufficient coverage over the areas where the monitoring stations are not located in close proximity. This study examined the capacity of using remotely sensed data to estimate the PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations in Seoul, South Korea. Multiple linear regression models were developed using the multispectral band data from the Moderate-resolution imaging spectro-radiometer equipped on Terra (MODIS) and Operational Land Imager equipped on Landsat 8 (Landsat 8) and meteorological parameters. Compared to MODIS-derived models (r2 = 0.25 for PM10, r2 = 0.30 for PM2.5), the Landsat 8-derived models showed improved model reliabilities (r2 = 0.17 to 0.57 for PM10, r2 = 0.47 to 0.71 for PM2.5). Landsat 8 model-derived PM concentration and groundtruth PM measurements were cross-validated to each other to examine the capability of the models for estimating the PM concentration. The modeled PM concentrations showed a stronger correlation to PM10 (r = 0.41 to 0.75) than to PM2.5 (r = 0.14 to 0.82). Overall, the results indicate that Landsat 8-derived models were more suitable in estimating the PM concentrations. Despite the day-to-day fluctuation in the model reliability, several models showed strong correspondences of the modeled PM concentrations to the PM measurements.

AB  - A full-Stokes vector model for microwave ocean surface emissivity based on two-scale theory and incorporating a wide range of published results is being developed for broadband microwave satellite data assimilation. The model is based on the six different modules such as ocean surface permittivity, Fresnel emission, omnidirectional wave height spectrum, small-scale perturbation, large-scale correction, and foam effect modules. The results showed that the calculated Full-stokes emissivities range in theoretically expected values and logically understandable variation with respect to incidence and azimuth angle. This model will be used for understanding of the emissivity uncertainties due to inputs of permittivity, ocean height distribution, and foam influences and for assimilation of fully-polarimetric satellite microwave radiances.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of mortality salience, cultural worldview threat and group membership(i.e., ingroup vs. outgroup) on donation and aggression using 3 experiments. To manipulate mortality salience, participants was asked to write a short essay about their own death. Participants in the corresponding control condition had to write a essay on their dental pain. Cultural worldview threat was manipulated by providing fictitious essays of other person which disparaged or praised Koreans and Korean culture. Group membership was manipulated by presenting a donation campaign scenario in which the beneficiary was an African child or a Korean child. Experiment 1 and 2 was to examine the effects of mortality salience and cultural worldview threat on aggression. As a result of experiment 1 and 2, the main effect of worldview threat was significant in Exp. 2, but the interaction effect of mortality salience and worldview threat was not significant in all two experiments. Exp. 3 examined the effects of mortality salience and group membership on donation. As a result of Exp. 3, the interaction effect of mortality salience and group membership was significant. That is, in the dental pain condition(i.e., control condition), participants tried to donate more money to the members of ingroup compared to the members of outgroup, but when their mortality became salient, participants tried not to donate their money to the members of ingroup and as a result the amount of money donated in the mortality salient condition was not significantly different depending on their group membership. The result of the Exp. 3 was compared with the result of Jonas et al. (2002) and possibile explanations were discussed.

AB  - Recently, the Arctic has been exposed to snow-covered land due to melting permafrost every year, and the Korea Geographic Information Institute(NGII) provides polar spatial information service by establishing spatial information of the polar region. However, there is a lack of spatial information on vegetation sensitive to climate change. This research used a multi-temporal Sentinel-2 image to perform land cover classification of the Ny-Alesund in Arctic Svalbard. In the pre-processing step, 10 bands and 6 vegetation spectral index were generated from multi-temporal Sentinel-2 images. In image-classification step is consisted of extracting the vegetation area through 8-class land cover classification and performing the vegetation species classification. The image classification algorithm used Random Forest to evaluate the accuracy and calculate feature importance through Out-Of-Bag(OOB). To identify the advantages of multi- temporary Sentinel-2 for vegetation classification, the overall accuracy was compared according to the number of images stacked and vegetation spectral index. Overall accuracy was 77% when using single-time Sentinel-2 images, but improved to 81% when using multi-time Sentinel-2 images. In addition, the overall accuracy improved to about 83% in learning when the vegetation index was used additionally. The most important spectral variables to distinguish between vegetation classes are located in the Red, Green, and short wave infrared-1(SWIR1). This research can be used as a basic study that optimizes input characteristics in performing the classification of vegetation in the polar regions.

AB  - In this paper, we attempted to find out the main features of Timothy Keller’s theology of work by analyzing the ‘faith and work’ ministry of the church.F&W is one of the five key ministries of the Redeemer Church. F&W ministry also consists of seven programs. Keller’s theology of work in this F&W ministry is fundamentally based on the Christian worldview. Keller developed and presented several important principles and propositions in each of the three stages of creation, corruption, and redemption. Keller, however, did not only attempt to explain everything in terms of the Christian worldview but also embrace much of the two kingdoms theory. This was possible because of Keller’s integrated view of church and cultural relations. In doing so, Keller was able to successfully establish the theology of work in terms of Reformed theology.

M3  - research-article
AB  - The purpose of this paper was to provide a possibility for communication by approaching the disagreements on poetry and life of Seo Jeong-ju. To this end, the backside of his poetry was analyzed by applying discourses on the worldview and ethics of shamanism.The shamanic experience of Seo Jeong-ju was the inner driving force that produced outstanding poetry. This is mainly related to the experience of initiation disease and possession, which are essential elements of the shamanistic admission process. Initiation disease is accompanied by schizophrenia, including visiual hallucinations, auditory hallucinations, and shouts in the pain of the body. In this state, the appearances of ghosts and the sound of divisions that emerged from Seo Jeong-ju were embodied with amazing truth. In this process, he went beyond the norms and consciousness of reality and found human figures struggling in inner hell. This renewed the meaning of human beings and instilled an unfamiliar power into the idea and expression of korean poetry.Seo Jeong-ju gradually internalized the worldview and ethics of shamanism, and pursued an imaginary plan in search of its historical origin. As a result, his poems merged with ancient shamanism, folklore, and Buddhist reincarnation. However, mid-term poetry reveals poetic loss due to the taste of ideas and secularity. This is a result of the shman's low moral consciousness that values ​​fortunate survival. His eternalism can thus be called secularism. Secularism produces an attitude of 'adaptation' and a theory of fate. It is judged that the conformism and the subordinate psalms of Seo Jeong-ju are fundamentally derived from this.The ‘irresponsibility’ and beauty of Seo Jeong-ju's poems are not separated. From the point where his attitude to take responsibility for the trials of existence has weakened, his poems tend to replicate themselves.

TI  - The <i>Lotus Sutra</i> and Christian Wisdom: Mutual Illumination in Interreligious Dialogue
T2  - BUDDHIST-CHRISTIAN STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - While the worldview of the Lotus Sutra is profoundly different from the Bible and the Christian tradition, much of the Buddha's analysis of the human predicament and many of the virtues that he recommends resonate strongly with Christian values as expressed in the traditional three stages on the spiritual path: via purgativa (purgative way), via illuminativa (illuminative way), and via unitiva (unitive way). Buddhist descriptions of the three poisons offer many points of contact and convergence with Christian analyses of sin in condemning ignorance, greed, and anger. Both Buddhist and Christian traditions describe breakthrough moments of illumination when persons come to see what they had not seen before. In the Lotus Sutra, as also in different ways in the Bible and the Christian tradition, learning wisdom is not mastering a concept but going through a process of transformation that one cannot adequately define but that one can display in compassion and charity. Like Pope Francis reflecting on the implications of the doctrine of creation for caring for the earth, many Buddhists have reflected on the implications of Buddhist teachings for ecological holism. In a time of ecological catastrophe, the Lotus Sutra and the Christian wisdom tradition join in calling us to acknowledge our ignorance and folly, awake from our delusions, and join together in acting with compassion to care for the earth and all its inhabitants.

TI  - An Experimental Evaluation of the Feasibility of Inferring Concentrations of a Visible Tracer Dye from Remotely Sensed Data in Turbid Rivers
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The movement of contaminants and biota within river channels is influenced by the flow field via various processes of dispersion. Understanding and modeling of these processes thus can facilitate applications ranging from the prediction of travel times for spills of toxic materials to the simulation of larval drift for endangered species of fish. A common means of examining dispersion in rivers involves conducting tracer experiments with a visible tracer dye. Whereas conventional in situ instruments can only measure variations in dye concentration over time at specific, fixed locations, remote sensing could provide more detailed, spatially-distributed information for characterizing dispersion patterns and validating two-dimensional numerical models. Although previous studies have demonstrated the potential to infer dye concentrations from remotely sensed data in clear-flowing streams, whether this approach can be applied to more turbid rivers remains an open question. To evaluate the feasibility of mapping spatial patterns of dispersion in streams with greater turbidity, we conducted an experiment that involved manipulating dye concentration and turbidity within a pair of tanks while acquiring field spectra and hyperspectral and RGB (red, green, blue) images from a small Unoccupied Aircraft System (sUAS). Applying an optimal band ratio analysis (OBRA) algorithm to these data sets indicated strong relationships between spatially averaged reflectance (i.e., water color) and Rhodamine WT dye concentration across four different turbidity levels from 40-60 NTU. Moreover, we obtained high correlations between spectrally based quantities (i.e., band ratios) and dye concentration for the original, essentially continuous field spectra; field spectra resampled to the bands of a five-band imaging system and an RGB camera; and both hyperspectral and RGB images acquired from an sUAS during the experiment. The results of this study thus confirmed the potential to map dispersion patterns of tracer dye via remote sensing and suggested that this empirical approach can be extended to more turbid rivers than those examined previously.

TI  - A new high spatial resolution low stratus/fog retrieval for the Atacama Desert
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Atacama Desert is considered as one of the driest places on Earth. At the coastline, however, small-scale fog oases harbor a specialized vegetation and fauna, living from moisture by fog, which is used by humans to feed water demands of industrial projects. To date, knowledge about fog and low stratus (FLS) clouds as well as their physical properties is limited in that only local observations or spatial products from satellites with coarse resolutions are available generally failing to capture local patterns resulting from the complex topography. Consequently, we provide the first climatology of FLS with 30 m spatial resolution based on over 400 Landsat scenes acquired since 1986. The new product provides valuable estimates of FLS optical and micro-physical properties. FLS over the Pacific Ocean featured cloud optical depth values around 13.5 declining over land to 4.2. Effective radii were around 5.3 mu m. Liquid water path was between 71.0 gm(-2) over the Ocean and 14.9 gm(-2) over land surfaces. The climatologies of the new Landsat product were successfully validated against those of the MODIS cloud property product over homogeneous surfaces. Over areas with heterogeneous topographies, the new product outperforms existing ones with coarse spatial resolutions if compared against in situ measurements. This shows the general need for cloud products with high spatial resolutions in areas where the development of small scale clouds is favored e.g., by a complex topography leading to systematical biases in existing retrievals.

TI  - Temporal and spatial distribution of <i>K</i><sub>d</sub>(490) and its response to precipitation and wind in lake Hongze based on MODIS data
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The diffuse attenuation coefficient K-d(lambda) is an important optical parameter that can be determined remotely. It plays a meaningful role in inland and coastal biogeochemical processes and aids in determining water quality. Four data-gathering expeditions were conducted in Lake Hongze (HZL), China, between 2015 and 2017. Based on the in situ optical and biological data, we constructed and evaluated a band ratio model for retrieving K-d (490) of HZL from MODIS/Aqua images between 2002 and 2016. Our results are as follows: (1) The developed algorithm, using the visible bands (R-rs (red)/R-rs(green)), performs robustly for K-d (490) estimation, with R-2 of 0.82 and p < 0.0001 for the modeling data. By validating with the in situ observed data, the mean absolute percentage error is determined to be 17.82%, and the root means square error is 1.52 m(-1). (2) The spatial distribution of K-d (490) strong relates with the input river that formed a cone-shaped distribution with the vertex at Huai River Estuary, decreasing from the southeast (RC) to the northern (NE) and western bays in HZL. The largest K d (490) value is in RC, with 7.10 +/- 3.03 m(-1), followed by NE and WL (wetland) with values of 6.10 +/- 2.58 m(-1) and 5.32 +/- 2.09 m(-1), respectively. (3) K-d (490) reaches high values in winter and low values in the summer although the variance is quite different in different lake areas. The seasonal distribution of K-d (490) in HZL is driven by the runoff produced by precipitation. (4) K-d (490) decreased systematically as the East Asian monsoon weakened from 2002 to 2012 that means wind has great influence on K-d (490) variation from year scale. However, human activity like sand-mining disrupted this trend, leading to the rise of K-d (490) during 2012 and 2016.

AB  - In this paper, we present a fast and intelligent routine for dense feature tracking with almost two orders of magnitude runtime improvement over conventional dense cross-correlation techniques. This routine consists of two novel modules: 1) "autoRIFT", an efficient and intelligent dense cross-correlater with nested grid design, sparse/dense combinative searching strategy and disparity filtering technique; 2) "Geogrid", the precise geocoding component that supports pointwise mapping between imaging coordinates (pixel location and displacement) and geographic Cartesian coordinates (geolocation and displacement velocity). autoRIFT can run on a grid in the native imaging coordinates (such as radar or map) and, when used in conjunction with the Geogrid module, on a user-defined grid in a geographic Cartesian coordinate system such as Universal Transverse Mercator or Polar Stereographic. Here we demonstrated its application in tracking ice displacement and validated with ESA's Sentinel-1A/B radar and NASA's Landsat-8 optical data.

TI  - Timing of Little Ice Age maxima and subsequent glacier retreat in northern Troms and western Finnmark, northern Norway
T2  - ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers are important indicators of climate change, and recent observations worldwide document increasing rates of mountain glacier recession. Here we present approximately 200 years of change in mountain glacier extent in northern Troms and western Finnmark, northern Norway. This was achieved through (1) mapping and lichenometric dating of major moraine systems within a subset of the main study area (the Rotsund Valley) and (2) mapping recent (post-1980s) changes in ice extent from remotely sensed data. Lichenometric dating reveals that the Little Ice Age (LIA) maximum occurred approximately 1814 (+/- 41 years), which is before the early twentieth-century LIA maximum proposed on the nearby Lyngen Peninsula but younger than LIA maximum limits in southern and central Norway (mid-eighteenth century). Between LIA maximum and 1989, a small sample of measured glaciers (n= 15) shrank a total of 3.9 km(2)(39 percent), and those that shrank by more than 50 percent are fronted by proglacial lakes. Between 1989 and 2018, the total area of glaciers within the study area (n= 219 in 1989) shrank by approximately 35 km(2). Very small glaciers (<0.5 km(2)) show the highest relative rates of shrinkage, and 90 percent of mapped glaciers within the study area were less than 0.5 km(2)in 2018.

TI  - Analysis of change in vegetation cover and land use in the north-central region of Mexico. The case of the lower basin of the Nazas river
T2  - ECOSISTEMAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation has an important impact on ecosystems, altering their capacity for providing environmental services, affecting particularly semiarid areas. The Parque Estatal Canon de Fernandez is located on the lower section of Nazas river, with 24936,6 ha and constitutes an important national and international natural protected area, because it supplies water to several cities in the north of Mexico and is recognized as a highly important habitat for aquatic birds. Nevertheless, the necessity of satisfying agricultural activities and a growing population has promoted land use and cover changes in the region. The aim of this research was to evaluate land cover and land use changes on the lower basin of Rio Nazas between 1990 and 2016. Based on visual interpretation of Landsat Tm and ETM images we generated digital data bases for land cover and land use. On 2016 the natural vegetation was composed by xeric shrub and riparian forest. In twenty six years deforestation affected 32.1% of the total area. There is a necessity to develop public policies for improving water sustainable use to preserve this xeric ecosystem.

TI  - Patient-reported outcomes after surgery for endometrial carcinoma: Prevalence of lower-extremity lymphedema after sentinel lymph node mapping versus lymphadenectomy
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To compare the prevalence of patient-reported lower-extremity lymphedema (LEL) with sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping versus comprehensive lymph node dissection (LND) for the surgical management of newly diagnosed endometrial carcinoma.Methods: Patients who underwent primary surgery for endometrial cancer from 01/2006-12/2012 were mailed a survey that included a validated 13-item LEL screening questionnaire in 08/2016. Patients diagnosed with LEL prior to surgery and those who answered <= 6 survey items were excluded.Results: Of 1275 potential participants, 623 (49%) responded to the survey and 599 were evaluable (180 SLN, 352 LND, 67 hysterectomy alone). Median BMI was similar among cohorts (P = 0.99). External-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) was used in 10/180 (5.5%) SLN and 35/352 (10%) LND patients (P = 0.1). Self-reported LEL prevalence was 27% (49/180) and 41% (144/352), respectively (OR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.25 - 2.74; P = 0.002). LEL prevalence was 51% (23/45) in patients who received EBRT and 35% (170/487) in those who did not (OR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.06-3.6; P = 0.03). High BMI was associated with increased prevalence of LEL (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.02-1.06; P = 0.001). After controlling for EBRT and BMI, LND retained independent association with an increased prevalence of LEL over SLN (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.22 - 2.69; P = 0.003). Patients with self-reported LEL had significantly worse QOL compared to those without self-reported LEL.Conclusions: This is the first study to assess patient-reported LEL after SLN mapping for endometrial cancer. SLN mapping was independently associated with a significantly lower prevalence of patient-reported LEL. High BMI and adjuvant EBRT were associated with an increased prevalence of patient-reported LEL. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Canine Toxocariosis: Its prevalence, incidence and occurrence in the Indian subcontinent
T2  - TOXOCARA AND TOXOCARIASIS
M3  - Review
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Toxocariosis is an important neglected tropical helminth disease of zoonotic significance for which canids are the definitive hosts. Dogs are also considered the sentinel host for the occurrence of T. canis infections in humans. Therefore, understanding its prevalence in canine population is imperative for any effective disease control in humans. A comprehensive review of literature on the prevalence of T. canis in canids was lacking from the Indian subcontinent which necessitated our efforts to compile available data published on this topic. Data on prevalence, incidence and occurrence of this helminths in canids were presented in this review as tabular format for easy comprehension. Moreover, the data were categorized based on the region where the studies were conducted with an aim to understand the spatial distribution of this parasite in the subcontinent. Factors influencing the regional prevalence/occurrence of T. canis such as type of canids (stray or pet), age, sex, breed, season and the choice of analytical methods were also discussed. In addition, data on the prevalence of T. canis in environmental samples and in zoo canids were also compiled and presented. We anticipate such an exhaustive review of literature available mostly in the journals published from the subcontinent would become a point source of information necessary for prioritizing future surveillance efforts in this region and for making informed policy decision to control this zoonotic helminth infection.

TI  - Weight-of-evidence approach to identify regionally representative sites for air-quality monitoring network: Satellite data-based analysis
T2  - METHODSX
M3  - Article
AB  - The methodology discussed in Lekinwala et al., 2020, hereinafter referred to as the 'parent article', is used to setup a nation-wide network for background PM2.5 measurement at strategic locations, optimally placing sites to obtain maximum regionally representative PM2.5 concentrations with minimum number of sites. Traditionally, in-situ PM2.5 measurements are obtained for several potential sites and compared to identify the most regionally representative sites [4], Wongphatarakul et al., 1998) at the location. The 'parent article' proposes the use of satellite-derived proxy for aerosol (Aerosol Optical Depth, AOD) data in the absence of in-situ PM2.5 measurements. This article focuses on the details about satellite-data processing which forms part of the methodology discussed in the 'parent article'. Following are some relevant aspects:High resolution AOD is retrieved from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments aboard NASA's Aqua and Terra satellite using Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm. The data is stored as grids of size 1200 x 1200 and a total of seven such grids cover the Indian land mass. These grids were merged, regridded and multiplied by conversion factors from GEOS-Chem Chemical Transport Model to obtain PM2.5 values. Standard set of tools like CDO and NCL are used to manipulate the satellite-data (*.nc files).The PM2.5 values are subjected to various statistical analysis using metrics like coefficient of divergence (CoD), Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) and mutual information (MI).Computations for CoD, MI are performed using Python codes developed in-house while a function in NumPy module of Python was used for PCC calculations.

AB  - Vegetation of Cameroon includes a variety of landscape types with high biodiversity. Ecological monitoring of Yaounde requires visualization of vegetation types in context of climate change. Vegetation Indices (VIs) derived from Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite image were analyzed in SAGA GIS to separate wetland biomes, as well as savannah and tropical rainforests. The methodology includes computing 6 VIs: NDVI, DVI, SAVI, RVI, TTVI, CTVI. The VIs shown correlation of data with vegetation distribution rising from wetlands, grassland, savanna, and shrub land towards tropical rainforests, increasing values along with canopy greenness, while also being inversely proportional to soils, urban spaces and Sanaga River. The study contributed to the environmental studies of Cameroon and demonstration of the satellite image processing.

TI  - Ecospirituality and sustainability transitions: agency towards degrowth
T2  - RELIGION STATE & SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - 'Sustainability transitions' has emerged as one of the most important and influential literatures on understanding the pathways towards a more sustainable future. Yet, most approaches in this literature privilege technological and regime-wide innovations, while people's agencies, grassroots innovations, and social factors more generally are often underrepresented. This article focuses on the role of ecospirituality as worldview, aiming to understand how spiritual and religious beliefs play an important role in practical, everyday sustainability transitions. In an extensive desk-based study, literature across disciplines is reviewed to explore connections between spirituality, pro-environmental behaviour, climate policy, and sustainability agencies. Showing the importance of ecospiritual practice, the purpose of this article is to make a case for the inclusion of ecospirituality, as worldview, in the study of sustainability transitions. We argue that ecospirituality is a significant dimension to understanding people's contemporary agencies that shift away from endless economic growth and resource efficiency mantras towards more radical worldviews of degrowth and different ways of achieving happiness and fulfilment in life.

TI  - Relatively Wild Urban Parks Can Promote Human Resilience and Flourishing: A Case Study of Discovery Park, Seattle, Washington
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE CITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Human interaction with nature is vital for physical health and mental well-being, and positions a community to be resilient to urban stressors. Yet urban development continues to put pressures on natural areas within urban boundaries. As a case in point, Seattle's largest park, Discovery Park, of over 500 acres, is often under threat of some form of development. The central question of this study was whether the benefits to visitors of Discovery Park depend, in no small measure, on the park's very size and relative wild landscape. Toward addressing this question, 320 participants provided written narratives (through our web portal) about the meaningful ways in which they interacted with nature at Discovery Park. Each individual narrative was then analyzed and coded using an Interaction Pattern (IP) approach, which provides characterizations of human-nature interaction that have ontogenetic and phylogenetic significance. Results revealed 520 Interaction Patterns (IPs). The most frequently occurring IPs clustered under the keystone IPs of Encountering Wildlife (27%), Following Trails (14%), Walking to Destination Spots in Nature (8%), Gazing out at the Puget Sound or Mountains (6%), Walking Along Edges of Beach or Bluffs (5%), and Walking with Dogs (4%). Results also revealed that visitors' meaningful interactions with nature in Discovery Park depended on the park's relative wildness. For example, (a) 77% of participants' IPs depended on Discovery Park's relative wildness; (b) of the participants who specified an especially meaningful experience with nature, 95% of them had an interaction that depended on Discovery Park's relative wildness; and (c) of the participants whose IPs were linked to other aspects of the nature in the park or to their own positive mental states, 95 and 96%, respectively, had an interaction that depended on Discovery Park's relative wildness. Discussion focuses on how human interaction with large and relatively wild urban parks helps reverse the trend of environmental generational amnesia, and a domination worldview, and thus should be prioritized in urban planning.

AB  - Landscape aesthetics, or scenicness, has been identified as an important ecosystem service that contribute to human health and well-being. Currently there are no methods to inventorize landscape scenicness on a large scale. In this paper we study how to upscale local assessments of scenicness provided by human observers, and we do so by using satellite images. Moreover, we develop an explicitly interpretable CNN model that allows assessing the connections between landscape scenicness and the presence of specific landcover types. To generate the landscape scenicness ground truth, we use the ScenicOrNot crowdsourcing database, which provides geo-referenced, human-based scenicness estimates for ground based photos in Great Britain. Our results show that it is feasible to predict landscape scenicness based on satellite imagery. The interpretable model performs comparably to an unconstrained model, suggesting that it is possible to learn a semantic bottleneck that represents well the present landcover classes and still contains enough information to accurately predict the location's scenicness.

AB  - The actuality of this article is caused by the information revolution at the present period of social development, where digitalization is becoming a key element. The position of completely different way of knowledge generation with a setting on effective use of knowledge via means of the individual system of competences, including competences of student's cognition in the digital world is defined. The authors reveal cognitive theories of teaching which act as psychological and pedagogical foundation for the didactic systems, realizing values of cognition and development of students' cognitive abilities.The purpose of the article is to consider the appearance of a new direction in education - "cognitive pedagogy", aimed at transforming processes of teaching and upbringing in the context of formation of human's cognitive and personal structures.The author's methodology, supporting the development of cognitive approach, has been proved: information-cognitive and social-cognitive approaches and human-conformity, chronotope, fractality, and iteration principles. The authors substantiate cognitive pedagogy as an integral unit of psychological and pedagogical sciences with person-oriented focus of education, and as a reference point on formation of a cultural and semantic basis of education subjects' worldview, and the generation of subject, pedagogical and scientific knowledge.Authors have substantiated "cognition" in all pedagogical aspects, such as human's development, didactics, university management, which acts as an ability to reprocess new information and generate knowledge.The practical value of the research results, presented in this article, is in the possibility of cognitive approach implementation, while solving problems of processing, reconfigurating of information and generation of knowledge, taking into consideration human's cognitive opportunities (perception, representation, cognition, understanding, explanation).The article is intended for researchers, teachers, psychologists, and students.

TI  - Artistic model of a female image in V. Mishanina's prose
T2  - VESTNIK UGROVEDENIYA-BULLETIN OF UGRIC STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: an unfailing interest of the writer in the problems of the formation of a woman's personality, her attitudes, values, variability of presented female images in fiction lead to the need for constant monitoring of literary approaches and means of depiction of a female character, which in turn actualizes new theoretical and methodological generalizations and conclusions. The relevance of the article is caused by the need for scientific understanding of the specifics of recreating the female image in the prose of the Mordovian writer V. Mishanina. The object of the research is the author's strategy of its artistic modeling.Objective: to analyze the forms and means of structuring of the female image in V. Mishanina's prose.Research materials: a number of stories ("Dymnoe utro" ("Smoky Morning"), "Koldunya" ("The Witch"), "Chelovek na doroge" ("Man On the Road") and V. Mishanina's novella ("Komok masla" ("Clot of Butter").Results and novelty of the research: the scientific novelty of the study is dictated by the lack of study of the interpretation of the female image in V. Mishanina's prose, as well as the inclusion of her novella "Komok masla" ("Clot of Butter") in the analytical field of Mordovian and Finno-Ugric literary studies.In the course of analyzing of V. Mishanina's stories and the novella, the author comes to the conclusion that the novelist uses both a complex of traditional means of representing the character sphere, and the author's methods of artistic modeling of the female image, due to the originality of the writer's creative manner and her worldview. The model of a female image is a set of multiple personal and psychological, spiritual and moral characteristics and signs of the nature of the heroines, among which we can distinguish emotionality, moral consistency, intimacy, maximum openness. The writer also prefers situations in which female characters experience a sense of loneliness.

T2  - EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEMS XXV
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXV
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - The radiometric calibration of OLI-2 for Landsat 9 uses two types of sources: pre-launch radiance-calibrated sphere sources and on-board flight solar diffuser panels. For both calibration articles the instrument contractor, Ball Aerospace Corp. assured the NIST scale transfer via laboratory measurements. The NIST reflectance scale transfer was conducted for the OLI-2 two flight diffusers at the University of Arizona Optical Sciences Center. In this report we present an approach in which the per detector information can be derived for the reflectance panel sources from their BRDF characterization. Using such information enables a cross-check of the as measured reflectance results during the prelaunch diffuser collects illuminated by a Heliostat. This information then enables a derivation of the uncertainty levels to allow assessment of the two radiometric calibration paths agreement.

TI  - The Concept of "Social Reality" as a Marker of the Constructivist Turn in Philosophy
T2  - VOPROSY FILOSOFII
M3  - Article
AB  - The article discusses the fundamental transformation of culture that occurred in the first half of the twentieth century and is associated with a rethinking of the nature and structure of reality. As a result, the concept of "social reality" is introduced into philosophical discourse to donate the area, which is accessible to the man. These cultural changes reflect changes in the worldview of a Western person, which are suggested to be called a "constructivist turn". It is shown that the content and scope of the central ontological categories of the main philosophical directions of the twentieth century coincide with the content and scope of the "social reality" of phenomenological sociology in their ontological part. It is proved that the new method of theming ontological knowledge and the underlying intentions of interaction with the world and adaptation in it imply not only the radicalization of the enlightenment-transforming position (ideology), but also give rise to the ideology of artificial restructuring of reality for given purposes. Reality depends on the social conditions of its production. Such an understanding opens wide opportunities for constructivist practices of dealing with reality, which should be recognized as determining ones for the present.

TI  - THE CULTURAL DIMENSION IN THE TRANSLATION OF FUNCTIONAL TEXTS
T2  - ROCZNIKI HUMANISTYCZNE
M3  - Article
AB  - The cultural shift, which has been noted and extensively described over the last few decades, can also be observed in translation studies, mainly, however, in literary translation. However, the present paper documents and discusses the cultural dimension as evidenced in translations of non-literary texts related to culture, the press, religion, research, diplomacy, film studies, and travel books. Special attention is devoted to the ways of construing those translations (which is the translator's task), as well as the quality of their reception. To this end, the concepts of a linguistic worldview and of precedential texts come in useful, as their implementation enables the author of this article to reveal the cultural dimension in translations of functional texts. The corpus for this analysis has been drawn from the experience of editing "Przeklad - Jezyk - Kultura" (UMCS Press, 2002-2018).

T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent advances in machine learning and computer vision have enabled increased automation in benthic habitat mapping through airborne and satellite remote sensing. Here, we applied deep learning and neural network architectures in NASA NeMO-Net, a novel neural multimodal observation and training network for global habitat mapping of shallow benthic tropical marine systems. These ecosystems, particularly coral reefs, are undergoing rapid changes as a result of increasing ocean temperatures, acidification, and pollution, among other stressors. Remote sensing from air and space has been the primary method in which changes are assessed within these important, often remote, ecosystems at a global scale. However, such global datasets often suffer from large spectral variances due to the time of observation, atmospheric effects, water column properties, and heterogeneous instruments and calibrations. To address these challenges, we developed an object-based fully convolutional network (FCN) to improve upon the spatial-spectral classification problem inherent in multimodal datasets. We showed that with training upon augmented data in conjunction with classical methods, such as K-nearest neighbors, we were able to achieve better overall classification and segmentation results. This suggests FCNs are able to effectively identify the relative applicable spectral and spatial spaces within an image, whereas pixel-based classical methods excel at classification within those identified spaces. Our spectrally invariant results, based on minimally preprocessed WorldView-2 and Planet satellite imagery, show a total accuracy of approximately 85% and 80%, respectively, over nine classes when trained and tested upon a chain of Fijian islands imaged under highly variable day-to-day spectral inputs.

AB  - Detecting the change of texture information is very important for landslide detection. In polarimetric SAR imagery, the landslides not only have typical polarimetric features but also have rich texture features. In this study, the texture feature extraction technique based on gray scale co-occurrence matrix was applied to process two SLC Sentinel-1A C-band SAR images and two COSMO-SkyMed X-band SAR images acquired before and after landslip for the landslide detection leading to the Jomda landslide event in 2018, Tibet of China and the Qinglong landslide in 2018, Guizhou of China. Several important characteristic parameters of the gray scale co-occurrence matrix were studied, and the optimal sliding window size and the optimal step size for landslide detection were obtained through rigorous analysis and comparison. The experimental results show that the analysis of the complex texture information can effectively detect the landslide in the mountain area with high accuracy.

AB  - Satellite laser altimetry is one of the most advanced information acquisition technologies in Earth observation system. It can provide high accuracy elevation information, however, due to the lack of detail intensity information, its planimetric accuracy is usually worse than the elevation accuracy. Gaofen 7 (GF-7) satellite scheduled for launch in 2019 will be equipped with laser altimeter, footprint camera, stereo mapping camera, etc. The laser altimeter together with the footprint camera was designed to provide high accuracy ground control point of satellite mapping. The laser altimeter can provide the high accuracy elevation information and the joint processing of footprint camera and stereo mapping camera can provide high-accuracy planimetric information. Therefore, this paper mainly studies the technology of extracting high accuracy control points based on GF-7 satellite's altimeter, footprint camera and stereo mapping camera using a simulated dataset extracted from Quickbird image and ICESat altimetric data.

AB  - To effectively further research the regional carbon sink, it is important to estimate forest aboveground biomass (AGB). Based on optical images, the AGB can be estimated and mapped on a regional scale. The Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) has, therefore, been widely used for regional scale AGB estimation; however, most studies have been based solely on peak season images without performance comparison of other seasons; this may ultimately affect the accuracy of AGB estimation. To explore the effects of utilizing various seasonal images for AGB estimation, we analyzed seasonal images collected using Landsat 8 OLI for a subtropical forest in northern Hunan, China. We then performed stepwise regression to estimate AGB of different forest types (coniferous forest, broadleaf forest, mixed forest and total vegetation). The model performances using seasonal images of different forest types were then compared. The results showed that textural information played an important role in AGB estimation of each forest type. Stratification based on forest types resulted in better AGB estimation model performances than those of total vegetation. The most accurate AGB estimations were achieved using the autumn (October) image, and the least accurate AGB estimations were achieved using the peak season (August) image. In addition, the uncertainties associated with the peak season image were largest in terms of AGB values <25 Mg/ha and >75 Mg/ha, and the quality of the AGB map depicting the peak season was poorer than the maps depicting other seasons. This study suggests that the acquisition time of forest images can affect AGB estimations in subtropical forest. Therefore, future research should consider and incorporate seasonal time-series images to improve AGB estimation.

AB  - Sentinel lymph node involvement is recognized as a prognostic factor in breast cancer staging and is essential to guide optimal treatment. The possibility of missed micrometastases by using conventional methods was estimated around 20-60% cases has created a demand for the development of more accurate approaches. A paired-agent imaging approach is presented by employing a control imaging agent to allow rapid, quantitative mapping of microscopic populations of tumor cells in lymph nodes to guide pathology sectioning. To test the feasibility of this approach to identify micrometastases, lymph node micrometastases biological tissue model was developed and were stained with targeted and control imaging agent solution to evaluate the binding potential of the agents of intact nodes. ABY-029, an EGFR specific affibody was labeled with IRDye-800CW(LICOR) as targeted agent and IRDye-700DX was hydrolyzed as control agent. Lymph nodes phantoms were stained for 60 min, followed by 60 min rinsing, and the fluorescence of whole lymph node phantoms were recorded to evaluate the spatial distribution of both agents in the entire phantom. Measured binding potential of targeted agent between micrometastases and control regions were 0.652 +/- 0.130 and -0.008 +/- 0.042 respectively (p < 0.0001). The results demonstrate the potential to enhance the sensitivity of lymph node pathology using paired-agent imaging in a whole human lymph node.

AB  - Deep belief network (DBN) is a generative learning strategy which has been proposed very early, similar to the rest deep learning algorithms, the complex network structure and the large size of parameters increase calculation cost greatly, the application is limited greatly. In order to solve this problem, a decision-level identification method named distributed DBN weighted Dempster-Shafer synthesis (DDWDS) is proposed for high-precision classification of remote sensing objects. Firstly, the low-dimensional features and a small number of samples are selected randomly, many distributed, independent and lean DBN networks are constructed and trained. Secondly, their classification results are used as a trust allocation function of the evidence focal element, and finally obtain the trust allocation function of each focal element based on weighted synthetic rules. With the multi-source remote sensing data of the light detection and ranging(LIDAR) system, the recognition accuracy of distributed DBNs which are constructed by 4 features and 20% samples is below 0.7, this situation shows great conflict, training cost decreases significantly, but the final classification recognition accuracy is raised to more than 0.9 with the proposed DD-WDS. The results show that the method can determine the scale of the network by itself, and achieves better performance.

AB  - Quickly and accurately obtaining fuel moisture content information is of great significance for diagnosing vegetation growth, improving agricultural irrigation efficiency, guiding agricultural production, monitoring the drought conditions of natural communities, and forecasting forest fires. Used the measured fuel moisture content in the southern California sample points and various vegetation indices extracted from MODIS remote sensing satellite images as the dataset for the fuel moisture content retrieving model. In this study, three machine learning methods--extreme learning machine (ELM), gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) were used for the fuel moisture content retrieving model. The results show that these three methods can achieve better accuracy than the traditional machine learning method support vector machine (SVM). The experimental results show that the XGBoost is able to achieve an acceptable accuracy, the average root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and coefficient of correlation (R) were 0.1552, 0.1243, and 0.7423 respectively, which is much better than the other models.

AB  - The investigation of submesoscale coastal eddies requires the products of high spatiotemporal resolution. MODIS color index (CI) products can improve spatial coverage in coastal regions to detect submesoscale signals, when observations of high-frequency radars are limited in small areas. In our study, a gradient parameter derived by CI images is used to identify submesoscale eddies by the eddy detection algorithm based on the vector geometry in the case of Subei Shoal. The results show that gradient parameters have the ability to detect submesoscale eddies. The mean radius values of anticyclonic and cyclonic eddies are 1.85 and 1.56 km, respectively. This method makes it potentially useful for investigations of ecosystem distributions in other coastal regions.

TI  - Robust Capsule Network Based on Maximum Correntropy Criterion for Hyperspectral Image Classification
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, deep learning-based algorithms have been widely used for classification of hyperspectral images (HSIs) by extracting invariant and abstract features. In our conference paper presented at IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium 2018, 1-D-capsule network (CapsNet) and 2-D-CapsNet were proposed and validated for HSI feature extraction and classification. To further improve the classification performance, the robust 3-D-CapsNet architecture is proposed in this article by following our previous work, which introduces the maximum correntropy criterion to address the noise and outliers problem, generating a robust and better generalization model. As such, discriminative features can be extracted even if some samples are corrupted more or less. In addition, a novel dual channel framework based on robust CapsNet is further proposed to fuse the hyperspectral data and light detection and ranging-derived elevation data for classification. Three widely used hyperspectral datasets are employed to demonstrate the superiority of our proposed deep learning models.

T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the development of earth observation technologies and the construction of earth observation systems, an increasing amount of remote sensing data are being obtained. These provide the datasets required for research on remote sensing monitoring across large areas. To compensate for the shortcomings of global and large-area temporal monitoring data, synergized computing using multi-source remote sensing data can improve the accuracy and temporal resolution of remote sensing monitoring. However, remote sensing data are drawn from multiple sources and multiple scales, and have a complex structure and large volume; in addition, the nested system architecture of multi-source synergized remote sensing products makes the design of large-scale multi-source synergized remote sensing monitoring systems difficult. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of a distributed parallel processing system for multi-source data synergized quantitative remote sensing based on a distributed cluster platform. The system integrates the algorithms normalizing more than 30 kinds of data sources and producing 40 quantitative remote sensing products. The system also connects a number of centers for satellite data, serves for several applications, and implements dynamic expansion integration for highly efficient quantitative remote sensing products. The system has produced approximately 50 TB of quantitative remote sensing products, and the application of these data to agriculture, forestry, the environment, and water conservation has resulted in very positive effects.

TI  - A Web-Based Remote Sensing Data Processing and Production System With the Unified Integration of Multi-Disciplinary Data and Models
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of Earth observation and navigation technology has enriched the methods and means of remote sensing data acquisition. With the increase in the data sources, data volume and data velocity, multi-disciplinary studies can use remote sensing data to solve problems in their individual fields, which, however, increases the heterogeneity of multi-source data and the complexity of multi-domain models. In this paper, we propose a Web-based framework of integrated data and models that allows the horizontal extension of the corresponding systems and effectively addresses the heterogeneity of the integration of multi-source data services and the complexity of multi-disciplinary model services. The interoperability of multi-disciplinary models becomes feasible with a unified interface design and Web service construction for interdisciplinary models. Moreover, a global unified geographic location framework and an active data service based on GeoHash optimized storage are designed to enable fast data retrieval and on-demand active service, which effectively solves the problem of the multi-source heterogeneity of remote sensing data. Ultimately, a global multi-source remote sensing data processing and production system with integrated data and models is implemented.

AB  - Spatial information of tree species composition of forest and urban vegetation is very important for forest protection and urban management. Tree species classification using remote sensing data is mainly conducted using such classification methods as SVM (Support Vector Machine) and Random Forest. Images used include multispectral/hyperspectral images, LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) data, or the combination of them. As a fast-growing and powerful tool having obtained state-of-the-art results in many remote sensing applications, Deep learning (DL) has a great potential in outperforming these existing classification methods and obtaining more accurate classification maps. In this work, three CNN models were employed for tree species classification at individual tree level, using the combination of high-resolution multispectral image (i.e., WorldView-2) and LiDAR data. Compared the traditional object-based classification using random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM), the 18-layer ResNet and the 40-layer DenseNet provided significant higher accuracies. The experimental results indicate the advantages of the two CNN models used for tree species classification.

T2  - SENSORS AND MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Using the principle of radar interferometry, we analyzed the temporal coherence changes of five typical ground features (residential areas, vegetation, bare soil, bridges, and factories and warehouses) in urban areas of Beijing using 29 images from Sentinel-1A equipped with a C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensor over one year. The results of the study showed the following. (1) Among the five typical ground features, the coherence of vegetation was the lowest. Owing to changes in its state and atmospheric conditions, the coherence of vegetation fluctuated sharply over the year. The coherence of factories and warehouses was the highest and relatively stable over the year. (2) Classifying the five typical ground features into artificial and natural features, we found that the artificial features of factories and warehouses, residential areas, and bridges maintained a high degree of coherence over the year. Among them, the coherence of residential areas was the most stable. The natural features of vegetation and bare soil were affected by the changes in their states and atmospheric conditions over the year. The research results can be used for the classification of land use types, the statistical analysis of urban green coverage, and the extraction of points with high coherence in long-term surface deformation inversion.

TI  - Pollution Trends in China from 2000 to 2017: A Multi-Sensor View from Space
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite sensors can provide unique views of global pollution information from space. In particular, a series of aerosol and trace gas monitoring instruments have been operating for more than a decade, providing the opportunity to analyze temporal trends of major pollutants on a large scale. In this study, we integrate aerosol products from MODIS (MODIS Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, all abbreviations and their definitions are listed alphabetically in Abbreviations) and MISR (Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer), the AAI (Absorbing Aerosol Index) product from OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument), column SO2 and NO2 concentrations from OMI, and tropospheric column ozone concentration from OMI/MLS (Microwave Limb Sounder) to study temporal changes in major pollutants over China. MODIS and MISR consistently revealed that column AOD (Aerosol Optical Depth) increased from 2000, peaked around 2007, and started to decline afterward, except for northwest and northeast China, where a continuous upward trend was found. Extensive negative trends in both SO2 and NO2 have also been found over major pollution source regions since similar to 2005. On the other hand, the OMI AAI exhibited significant increases over north China, especially the northeast and northwest regions. These places also have a decreased Angstrom exponent as revealed by MISR, indicating an increased fraction of large particles. In general, summer had the largest AOD, SO2, and NO2 trends, whereas AAI trends were strongest for autumn and winter. A multi-regression analysis showed that much of the AOD variance over major pollution source regions could be explained by SO2, NO2, and AAI combined, and that the SO2 and NO2 reduction was likely to be responsible for the negative AOD trends, while the AOD increase over NE and NW China may be associated with an increase of coarse particles revealed by increased AAI and decreased AE. In contrast to aerosols, tropospheric ozone exhibited a steady increase from 2005 throughout China. This indicates that although the recent emission control effectively reduced aerosol pollutants, ozone remains a challenging issue and may dominate future air pollution.

TI  - A Novel SUHI Referenced Estimation Method for Multicenters Urban Agglomeration using DMSP/OLS Nighttime Light Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The surface urban heat island (SUHI) of urban agglomeration has always been an important topic in the studies of urban heat island, especially with the development of satellite-based land surface temperature (LST) products. However, most studies are limited to the perspective of a single city, ignoring the impact of urban agglomeration and the changes of LST at day and night on the reference LST (RLST) (e.g., rural areas). Consequently, this article proposed a novel method about SUHI intensity estimation for the multicenters (mcSUHII) of urban agglomeration in Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GHMBay) using nighttime light (NTL) data (i.e., DMSP/OLS) obtained in October, 2010. The mcSUHII method considered the RLST of SUHII estimation based on multicenter structure, and was more flexible to adapt the impact of human activity intensity. The study showed that compared with other RLSTs, such as suburban and forest, mcSUHII mitigates the underestimation bias caused by ignoring the multicenter structure. Importantly, the change in SUHII for urban agglomerations is greater than for a single city. Moreover, it was illustrated that the variation of SUHII presented an obvious inverted U-shape along the gradient from the inland to the coastal cities. The highest SUHIIs in the delta cities at day and night are similar to 7.27 +/- 1.71 degrees C and similar to 4.46 +/- 1.42 degrees C, respectively. Additionally, NTL served as the dominator together with other factors that were capable of explaining more than 90% of the spatial variation in SUHII in GHMBay. Therefore, considering multicenters more in estimation of SUHII of urban agglomeration for the sustainable development.

TI  - Adjustment From Temperature Annual Dynamics for Reconstructing Land Surface Temperature Based on Downscaled Microwave Observations
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is crucial to wide varieties of environmental issues, whereas its low tolerance to cloud contamination greatly challenges its applications. Passive microwave (PMW) measurements are employed to retrieve LST due to its great capability of penetrating clouds. Despite great efforts from previous studies, their further applications are limited by coarse resolution of PMW, uncertainty from cloudy coverage, and less attention on large-scale applications. To address these problems, this article proposes a method combining adjustment from annual temperature circle to reconstruct LST based on downscaled microwave observations over mainland China. In order to conduct a comprehensive and solid accuracy evaluation, the proposed method is validated according to three strategies namely comparing with moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST, ground surface temperature, and in situ observations from the Heihe Watershed Allied Telemetry Experimental Research, respectively. In the strategy 1, mean root mean square error (RMSE) of predicted LST is 2.39 K and 1.33 K at day and night. According to the strategy 2, mean RMSE of MODIS, predicted and merged LST is 4.97 K, 5.07 K, and 4.93 K at daytime, and 2.32 K, 4.57 K, and 3.39 K at nighttime. In the strategy 3, they are 3.75 K, 3.90 K, and 2.87 K at day, and 2.80 K, 3.61 K, and 2.79 K at night. Furthermore, adjustments from annual temperature cycle are discussed. The proposed method is promising in future research for reconstructing LST with high spatiotemporal resolution at large scales thanks to its simple process, high accuracy, and seamless reconstruction.

T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban sprawl is a major factor that threatens the loss of arable landmass, and its evolving morphology has long interested numerous scholars. However, existing research on this study has not been concerned with the cases of ordinary cities, particularly their infra-urban land and urban sprawl. This study goes beyond mega-/super-cities and takes Zhuhai, an ordinary large city in China's Pearl River Delta (PRD) region, as a case. Through remote sensing and GIS technology, this research identifies the increasing built-up areas and its sub-typologies (infill, outlying and edge-expansion), distinguishes the reclamation area and the decreasing arable landmass and evaluates the rate of land-use inside its five districts from 1980 to 2015. The growth of urban areas and loss of arable landmass are uneven inside Zhuhai. The most uneven outlying and infill growth were observed from 1990 to 1995 and from 2013 to 2015, respectively. Edge-expansion is the least imbalanced typology and reached its minimum from 2010 to 2013. The extent of variability of the total urban sprawl generally accords with that of edge-expansion and imbalance of arable landmass loss that reached a peak from 2005 to 2008. However, policy, planning and other factors that matter in urban sprawl are also discussed.

TI  - Influences of anthropogenic factors on lakes area in the Golmud Basin, China, from 1980 to 2015
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes play a vital role in keeping the balance of regional ecosystems and biodiversity. In regions such as the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau with the fragile natural environment, lakes appear to be highly sensitive to climate changing. In the Golmud Basin, which is situated on the north edge of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the interactions among lakes area variations, climate change and anthropogenic interference have not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we analyzed lakes area variations in the Golmud Basin using Landsat-TM/ETM image data from 1980 to 2015. Within the study period, the lakes in the area have undergone two cycles with four stages: expansion in 1980-1990, shrinkage in 1990-2005, expansion in 2005-2010, and shrinkage in 2010-2015 again. In 2009, the Qarhan Salt Lake was basically enlarged and connected to the neighboring small lakes, while Dabuxun Lake had its maximum area in 2010. From 2011 to 2015, East Taijinaier Lake was shrinking and nearly dried up due to excessive water, mineral exploitation, and human blocking the connection among rivers and lakes. Climatic data were analyzed via the Mann-Kendall trend test, and both annual temperature and precipitation in the Golmud City increased considerably. The Landsat-TM/ETM images showed that the mountain glaciers around the basin retreated from 1980 to 2015, resulting in the expansion of the lake area. The land use transfer matrix was used to obtain the changes in land use types; increasing water consumption and population growth are the main factors associated with decreased lakes area and vegetation cover. As an essential part of the ecological environment, lakes have a direct impact on the change of the ecological environment. This study provides a scientific basis for the evaluation of the ecological environment quality of the Golmud Basin.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Remote-Sensing Image Fusion With Patch-Group Compressed Sensing
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Generally, it is difficult to acquire remote sensing data whose resolution is both highly spatial and highly temporal from a single satellite. In this paper, a novel compressed sensing (CS)-based spatiotemporal data fusion (CSBS) method is proposed to synthesize such high-spatiotemporal resolution images. With CSBS, a low-spatial resolution remote senisng image is treated as a sampling of the high-spatial resolution image. The down-sampling in the spatial domain of images is modeled as a CS measurement matrix in CSBS. Moreover, continuity constraints in the temporal domain are also introduced into the CSBS object function for CS reconstruction. To better represent the intrinsic features of the data, images are segmented into many small patches and clustered into several groups via K-means. Dictionary training, measurement matrix identification, and high-resolution prediction are carried out group-by-group. Based on features learned from patch groups, the transformational relationship between spatial-temporal images having different resolutions are easily identified. Compared with previous compressed sensing and dictionary learning methods, CSBS is characterized by: (1) the patch-group stratagem in dictionary learning and measurement matrix learning; (2) the combination of continuity in temporal domain and sparsity in spatial domain. The proposed method is then comprehensively compared with different methods using land-surface reflectance data. Experiment results validate the effectiveness and advancement of CSBS for spatiotemporal data fusion.

TI  - Dynamic monitoring of landscape vegetation coverage based on EM-MAP-NDVI fusion algorithm
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the complexity of the detection types of urban landscape vegetation, the existing methods have the problem of unclear image feature classification, which leads to the low accuracy of dynamic monitoring of landscape vegetation coverage. A dynamic monitoring method of urban landscape vegetation coverage based on EM-MAP-NDVI fusion algorithm is proposed. The multi-source remote sensing image feature data and vegetation dynamic characteristics of landscape vegetation are obtained. The expectation maximisation (EM) algorithm is used to estimate the vegetation coverage parameters. The problem of vegetation image feature classification is transformed into the problem of maximum posterior probability (MAP), and the dynamic monitoring results of vegetation coverage are calculated. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the accuracy of urban landscape vegetation feature extraction and achieve high-precision dynamic monitoring of urban landscape vegetation coverage, which has good application value.

AB  - The temporal and spatial change of land cover in Xichang City from 2002 to 2018 was analyzed in this paper. The current land cover maps of three different years were extracted based on the 2002, 2010 and 2018 Landsat remote sensing images, and the transfer Matrix model wasutilized to analyze the transformation among types of land. The results showed that from 2002 to 2018, the area of cultivated land and construction land in Xichang increased by 20.26% and 191.71% respectively, while the areas of forest land, unused land, grassland and water decreased by 9.36%, 83.27%, 4.48% and 10.45%, respectively. In terms of spatial pattern, the regions with obvious changes are mainly located around the Anning River Valley and Qionghai Lake. The construction land increased significantly, mainly along the Beijing-Kunming expressway to the north of the new urban area and the cultivated land distribution increased slightly on the slope of some low mountain fallow land. Land cover conversion is quite frequent between cultivated land, forestland and grassland. This study can provide a scientific basis for the sustainable utilization of land resources and ecological construction in Xichang city.

AB  - High-density flash-memory chips are under tremendous demands with the exponential growth of data. At the same time, the slow read performance of these high-density flash-memory chips becomes a new challenge. In this work, we analyze the high raw bit error rates (RBER) issue by characterizing the error behaviours of 3D QLC flash-memory chips. A preferred read voltage to a QLC cell could vary among layers and might even change in a short period of time due to the temperature. A sentinel-cell approach is thus proposed to utilize the error characteristics among cells. We propose to infer the optimal read voltages of a wordline based on errors introduced on sentinel cells. An on-line calibration procedure is further presented to resolve the problem of possible non-uniform error distribution on some wordlines. With optimal voltages being inferred, the number of read retries will be significantly reduced. Experiments show that optimal read voltages can be instantly obtained in 94% cases on average over the evaluated QLC flash memory with at most 2 read retries, and with merely 0.2% space overheads for adopting sentinel cells. The number of read retries could be reduced by 82% on average, and the read performance can be improved by 74% on average through a series of extensive experiments over 3D TLC and QLC flash-memory chips.

TI  - Change Detection of Soil Formation Rate in Space and Time Based on Multi Source Data and Geospatial Analysis Techniques
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatialization of soil formation rate (SFR) is always a difficult problem in soil genesis. In this study, the dissolution rate in karst areas of China during the period 1983-2015 was estimated on the basis of geospatial analysis techniques and detection of variation via the law of chemical thermodynamics in conjunction with long-term serial ecohydrology data. SFR at different lithological backgrounds was calculated on the basis of the content of acid-insoluble substances. Results showed that the spatial dissolution rate of carbonate rock ranges between 0 and 106 mm/ka, averaged at 22.51 mm/ka, and the SFR ranges between 10 and 134.93 t km(-2) yr(-1), averaged at 18.59 t km(-2) yr(-1). The dissolution rate and SFR exhibit a slight increasing trend with 0.04 mm/ka and 0.003 t km(-2) yr(-1), respectively. The risk for soil erosion was reevaluated on the basis of the SFR results, and the area with erosion risk and the ecologically safe area were corrected. Results indicated that the area with erosion risk is four times higher than the ecologically safe area. This study will hopefully instigate and facilitate the application and popularization of geospatial analysis technology to the research field of rock weathering and soil formation.

AB  - Optical and thermal infrared remote sensing images highly integrate spatial heterogeneity information (land surface soil, vegetation and water). This paper evaluated the capacity of Landsat-8 and Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remote sensing indices and empirical relationship models for soil moisture estimations at different depths. The results show that (1) compared with other Landsat-8 indices, shortwave infrared based Surface Water Capacity Index (SWCI) has higher correlation with 10-50 cm depth soil moisture. The comparison based on MODIS daily indices confirms that SWCI can monitor 20 cm soil moisture with more stability; (2) The quadratic polynomial model based on Land Surface Temperature (LST) and SWCI possessed highest accuracy among all empirical models. The average coefficient of determination (R-2) increases to 0.257 from 0.150 based on LST-NDVI linear model and 0.176 based on LST-SWCI linear model. Soil moisture analysis at both 30 m and 1 km spatial scale suggest that optical remote sensing could indirectly reflect soil moisture variation with higher precise and more stability in root layer rather than top-most layer.

AB  - Ensuring food security is a long-term and arduous task. Timely and accurate grasp of grain production capacity information can provide favourable data support for the nation to formulate macroeconomic plans and food policies. With the development of remote sensing technology, it has been widely used in crop yield estimation models. In this paper, the yield of spring maize in Da'an of Jilin province was estimated based on vegetation indexes calculated from Landsat-8 images. The results have shown that the fitting degree and estimation accuracy of yield estimation models at tasselling stage are significantly better than those at milk stage. Among these vegetation indexes, the model based on GNDVI has better fitting degree and estimation accuracy. This paper can provide reference for the post construction evaluation of high standard farmland in China.

TI  - Mapping Urban Impervious Surfaces by Using Spectral Mixture Analysis and Spectral Indices
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Impervious surface is the major component of urban areas, and it has been widely considered as the key for assessing the degree of urban sprawl. While the effectiveness of applying spectral mixture analysis (SMA) and spectral indices in mapping urban impervious surface has been proved, most studies have relied either on SMA or spectral indices without considering both. In this study, the SMA and spectral indices were integrated together to map impervious surfaces distributions in both Milwaukee County in the Wisconsin State and Fayette County in the Kentucky State. Specifically, spectral indices were used for identifying major land covers. Two-dimensional feature space plots were generated by calculated spectral indices images for endmember selection and extraction. Linear constrained SMA was finally applied to quantify the fractional impervious surfaces. Research results indicate that the proposed method has achieved a promising accuracy, and better performance was achieved in less developed areas than the developed areas. Moreover, a comparative analysis shows that the proposed method performs better than the conventional method in both the whole study area and the developed areas, and a comparable performance has been achieved in the less developed areas.

AB  - The summer phytoplankton bloom events have been recently investigated using remote sensing observations over several geographical areas of the Red Sea and changed our impression of its oligotrophic characteristic. However, only limited blooms events were recorded due to active dust storms limiting the observations. This work focuses on predicting the potential bloom events in the central region of the Red Sea, indicated by the chlorophyll-a values, through the machine learning models built from the simulated and observed oceanographical parameters. Four subregions showing active eddy activities are selected to generate modeling datasets in the Case-1 waters (water depth > 300 meters) for each region. Automated model selection and tuning are performed among different candidate supervised models including linear regression, trees models, ensemble models and deep neural networks (101 in total). The ensemble models (random decision forest and bootstrap decision forest) outperform others in showing effective performance in estimating chlorophyll-a values with (R-2 > 0.82) of the training and (R-2 > 0.73) of the testing processes, respectively. This work shows the potential applications to use a machine learning model to reconstruct missing ocean color observations, as well as revealing the oceanographical mechanism to induce phytoplankton growth in the Red Sea.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Since 2010, SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) retrievals of surface soil moisture (SM) and vegetation optical depth (VOD) have been produced through the inversion of the so-called Tau-Omega (TO) vegetation emission model. Tau-Omega is a 0th-order solution of the radiative transfer equations that neglects multiple scattering, conversely to 1st -order solutions as Two-Stream (2S). To date, very little is known about the compared retrieval performances of these emission models. Here, we inter-compared (SM, VOD) retrievals using the SMOS-IC algorithm running with the TO and 2S emission models. Retrieval performances obtained from TO and 2S were found to be relatively similar, except that a larger dry bias and a slightly lower SM unbiased RMSD were obtained with 2S and the VOD values of the two models vary over dense vegetation areas, both in terms of magnitude and seasonal variations. Considering this and the enhanced physical background of 2S that allows its implementation as a unified emission model for different applications, our study reveals the high interest of using Two-Stream in global retrieval algorithms at L-band.

TI  - A Remote-Sensing Image Pan-Sharpening Method Based on Multi-Scale Channel Attention Residual Network
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Pan-sharpening is a significant task that aims to generate high spectral- and spatial- resolution remote-sensing image by fusing multi-spectral (MS) and panchromatic (PAN) image. The conventional approaches are insufficient to protect the fidelity both in spectral and spatial domains. Inspired by the robust capability and outstanding performance of convolutional neural networks (CNN) in natural image super-resolution tasks, CNN-based pan-sharpening methods are worthy of further exploration. In this paper, a novel pan-sharpening method is proposed by introducing a multi-scale channel attention residual network (MSCARN), which can represent features accurately and reconstruct a pan-sharpened image comprehensively. In MSCARN, the multi-scale feature extraction blocks comprehensively extract the coarse structures and high-frequency details. Moreover, the multi-residual architecture guarantees the consistency of feature learning procedure and accelerates convergence. Specifically, we introduce a channel attention mechanism to recalibrate the channel-wise features by considering interdependencies among channels adaptively. The extensive experiments are implemented on two real-datasets from GaoFen series satellites. And the results show that the proposed method performs better than the existing methods both in full-reference and no-reference metrics, meanwhile, the visual inspection displays in accordance with the quantitative metrics. Besides, in comparison with pan-sharpening by convolutional neural networks (PNN), the proposed method achieves faster convergence rate and lower loss.

TI  - Generating High-Quality and High-Resolution Seamless Satellite Imagery for Large-Scale Urban Regions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban geographical maps are important to urban planning, urban construction, land-use studies, disaster control and relief, touring and sightseeing, and so on. Satellite remote sensing images are the most important data source for urban geographical maps. However, for optical satellite remote sensing images with high spatial resolution, certain inevitable factors, including cloud, haze, and cloud shadow, severely degrade the image quality. Moreover, the geometrical and radiometric differences amongst multiple high-spatial-resolution images are difficult to eliminate. In this study, we propose a robust and efficient procedure for generating high-resolution and high-quality seamless satellite imagery for large-scale urban regions. This procedure consists of image registration, cloud detection, thin/thick cloud removal, pansharpening, and mosaicking processes. Methodologically, a spatially adaptive method considering the variation of atmospheric scattering, and a stepwise replacement method based on local moment matching are proposed for removing thin and thick clouds, respectively. The effectiveness is demonstrated by a successful case of generating a 0.91-m-resolution image of the main city zone in Nanning, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China, using images obtained from the Chinese Beijing-2 and Gaofen-2 high-resolution satellites.

TI  - Improving Time Series Reconstruction by Fixing Invalid Values and its Fidelity Evaluation
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - MODIS time series data have been widely used in the research of regional and global ecosystems and climate change. For vegetation monitoring, vegetation indices such as NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index), EVI (enhanced vegetation index) and NBR (normalized burn ratio), are usually derived from MODIS reflectance data. However, noise usually makes it difficult to generate reliable time series of vegetation indices. Although some methods have been developed for reconstructing NDVI time series data, they still suffer from some limitations. First, there is no reliable approach for detecting and dealing with low-quality data, resulting in poor outcomes. Second, no effective evaluation of the fidelity of the corrected data to the original data has been discussed. For these reasons, we developed a new time series reconstruction approach, named Fixing Invalid Value (FIV) method. The proposed method assumes that the noise in surface reflectance data stems from invalid data, such as clouds, ice, and missing values. The FIV method first uses the spatially and temporally neighboring pixels to estimate the invalid values and then applies morphology operations to remove the residual noise. Finally, the Savitzky-Golay (S-G) filter is employed to generate the final results. The FIV method is tested on 8-day composite MODIS surface reflectance time series data from 2001 to 2012 in Jiangxi and Fujian provinces, China. The results show that the FIV method outperforms the conventional S-G filter and the HANTS method both in terms of visual inspection and quantitative evaluation. Furthermore, the fidelity evaluation reveals that the proposed FIV method produces high-quality time series data under all weather conditions.

TI  - Combining Kriging Interpolation to Improve the Accuracy of Forest Aboveground Biomass Estimation Using Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate estimation of forest biomass is very significant to the study of regional ecosystems. China's National Forest Continuous Inventory data and Landsat 8 data were used to establish a linear regression (LR) model for the estimation of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) based on forest type. The original results of the LR yielded upon conducting AGB estimation were insufficient. Therefore, an interpolation map of the residuals of the observed and predicted AGB was used to correct the error of the original LR model. There is a highly positive result of the accuracy of the corrected AGB map. First, the AGB estimation based on forest type could effectively improve its accuracy. For example, significant improvements were made in the estimations of broadleaf, coniferous, and mixed forests compared to that of the total vegetation conducted using the original LR model. Second, semivariance analysis should be conducted before spatial interpolation using the Kriging method to determine optimal semivariogram models and parameters. The optimal semivariogram model for broadleaf and total forests was the exponential model, while that for the coniferous and mixed forests was the spherical model. Third, combining Kriging interpolation predicted the AGB map effectively and reduced the under- and overestimation of AGB, although it did not fully eliminate this limitation. The R-2 values of broadleaf, coniferous, and mixed forests were improved to 0.897, 0.856, and 0.826, respectively. Overall, the methods used in this study provide an effective approach towards improving the accuracy of AGB estimations by reducing under- and overestimation based on remote sensing data and increasing the ability to monitor the forest ecosystem.

TI  - A Hierarchical Approach to Resource Allocation in Extensible Multi-Layer LEO-MSS
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Low earth orbit mobile satellite system (LEO-MSS) is the major system to provide communication support for mobile terminals beyond the coverage of terrestrial communication systems. However, the quick movement of LEO satellites and current single-layer system architecture impose restrictions on the capability to provide satisfactory service quality, especially for the remote and non-land regions with high traffic requirement. To tackle this problem, high-altitude platforms (HAPs) and terrestrial relays (TRs) are introduced to cover hot-spot regions, and the current single-layer system becomes an LEO-HAP multi-layer access network. Under this setup, we propose a hierarchical resource allocation approach to circumvent the complex management caused by the intricate relationships among different layers. Specifically, to maximize the throughputs, we propose a dynamic multi-beam joint resource optimization method in LEO-ground downlinks based on the predicted movement of LEO satellites. Afterwards, we propose the dynamic resource optimization method of HAP-ground downlinks when LEO satellites and HAPs share the same spectrum. To solve these problems, we use the Lagrange dual method and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions to find the optimal solutions. Numerical results show that the proposed architecture outperforms current LEO-MSS in terms of average capacity. In addition, the proposed optimization methods increase the throughputs of LEO-ground downlinks and HAP-ground downlinks with an acceptable complexity.

TI  - Forecast Based Handover in an Extensible Multi-Layer LEO Mobile Satellite System
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Low earth orbit mobile satellite system (LEO-MSS) is the major system to provide communication support for the regions beyond the coverage of terrestrial network systems. However, passive handover happens frequently caused by the quick movement of LEO satellites in LEO-MSS. It not only causes the waste of radio resource, but also makes it hard to guarantee the quality of service (QoS), especially for user groups in hot-spot regions. To tackle this problem, we propose an extensible multi-layer network architecture to reduce the handover rate, especially group handover rate by introducing high-altitude platforms (HAPs) and terrestrial relays (TRs) to this system. We then propose a multi-layer handover management framework and also design different handover procedures based on handover forecast for different kinds of handovers according to the proposed architecture and framework to reduce handover delay and signalling cost. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic handover optimization to reduce the dropping probability and guarantee the QoS of mobile terminals. Numerical results show that the proposed architecture reduces group handovers significantly. The proposed handover procedures also provide better performance on delay and signalling cost compared with traditional handover protocols. With the proposed dynamic handover optimization, the proposed handover procedures provide better performance on dropping probability and throughput. The proposed dynamic handover optimization has an excellent performance on dropping probability while guaranteeing the QoS of mobile terminals.

AB  - The tradeoff between spatial and temporal resolution in satellite observations substantially restrains the potential applications of Land Surface Temperature (LST) products. So far, many spatiotemporal fusion models have been developed to address the issue and a unified comparison in LST data fusion is still required. In this paper, four popular spatiotemporal fusion algorithms including Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM), Unmixing-based data fusion method, Flexible Spatiotemporal Data Fusion (FSDAF) and Spatio-Temporal Integrated Temperature Fusion Model (STITFM) were adopted to generate high spatial resolution LST using polar-orbiting and geostationary satellite data. The predicted LST was evaluated by the actual LST product and the result indicates that the overall accuracy of FSDAF is satisfied (about 2.87K) and the FSDAF algorithm is recommended to generate LSTs at high spatial and temporal resolution in heterogeneous area.

AB  - The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), a key instrument of the NASA Earth Observing System missions, has operated for over 20 years and 18 years onboard the Terra and Aqua satellites, respectively. Sixteen thermal emissive bands (TEBs) are distributed on two cold focal place assemblies with photovoltaic (PV) HgCdTe detectors for bands 20-25 and 27-30 and photoconductive (PC) HgCdTe detectors for bands 31-36. This paper evaluates the performance of the latest MODIS Collection 6.1 (C6.1) Level-1B products with a focus on the relative differences between the Terra and Aqua MODIS TEBs. The Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) onboard the Metop-A satellite serves as a reference. Observations obtained from the simultaneous nadir overpass between the Terra (or Aqua) and Metop-A satellites are used to track the brightness temperature differences between MODIS and IASI. The assessment is based on the temperature differences as a function of scene temperature and their trends in comparison with IASI from years 2007 to 2020. The results confirm that the calibration of Terra MODIS bands 27-30 significantly improved in C6.1 after implementing the electronic crosstalk correction. In spite of these corrections, Terra MODIS shows a larger drift in PV LWIR bands 27-30 than Aqua MODIS when compared to IASI. A sensitivity study is performed, where the center wavelength of the MODIS relative spectral response is shifted, and as a result some of these bands show a significant improvement in scene temperature dependency and their consistency with IASI measurements.

AB  - Two Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instruments are currently operating in space, one onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) satellite launched on October 28, 2011 and the other onboard the NOAA-20 satellite launched on November 18, 2017. The performance of the seven VIIRS thermal emissive bands (TEBs) is monitored via on-orbit calibration data, the analysis of Earth view observations, as well as inter-comparisons with other sensors. The Moon has been used as a unique invariant target for on-orbit sensor calibration because its surface property is considered extremely stable over time in spectra, radiometry, and geometry with a repeatable lunar phase. This paper presents the assessments of the S-NPP and NOAA-20 VIIRS TEB on-orbit calibration stability using near-monthly scheduled lunar observations over their respective missions. The methodology previously developed for MODIS is now applied to VIIRS to monitor the TEB long-term stability by extracting and trending the lunar brightness temperatures from selected unsaturated pixels. It includes a correction applied to reduce any impact from the Sun-Moon geometry (e.g. Sun-Moon distance variation). The results show that the mission-long brightness temperature trends from the lunar surface are stable for all VIIRS TEBs, despite noticeable seasonal variations in the lunar thermal emissive radiance.

AB  - With the rapid development of unmanned aerial vehicle technology and satellite communication technology, Aeronautical Ad-hoc Network (AANET) has gradually become a hot spot of current research. Statistical Priority-based Multiple Access (SPMA) protocol can be well applied to the MAC protocol of AANET because of its excellent performance. In this paper, we propose an improved backoff algorithm and analyze the performance of the algorithm in SPMA protocol. Combining the mathematical model and queuing theory, we get the mathematical expressions of successful transmission rate, delay and throughput of the protocol, which are verified by simulation. The results show that the improved backoff algorithm can significantly reduce the transmission delay when the traffic load is high. The protocol can support multi-priority services, while guaranteeing high-priority services with very high successful transmission rate and very low latency, and it still has good stability when the traffic load is high.

TI  - Preliminary Analysis on Ecological Landscape Pattern Changes in Baihe Nature Reserve.
T2  - Journal of Sichuan Forestry Science and Technology
M3  - Article
AB  - Baihe Nature Reserve is currently the largest, densest and most representative protected area of Sichuan golden snub-nose monkeys (Rhinopithecus roxellanae) in the Minshan Mountain Systems of Sichuan Province. Analysis of the ecological landscape pattern changes before and after the earthquake is beneficial to the protection of species resources. Based on the geographic information system and remote sensing data processing software platform, this study combined the key time nodes of the Wenchuan Earthquake in 2008 and the Jiuzhaigou Earthquake in 2017. From 2003 to 2018, every five years the remote sensing images of Landsat5 TM and Landsat8 OLI were selected. The ecological landscape pattern and landscape ecological index were used to analyze the ecological landscape pattern changes of the Baihe Nature Reserve on the horizontal level and the patch type horizontal scale during the 15 years before and after the two earthquakes. The results showed that Baihe Nature Reserve consisted of five landscape types: bare rock, grassland/shrub, temperate coniferous forest, mixed coniferous and broad-leaved forest and deciduous broad-leaved forest. Eight landscape indices were selected in Fragstats 4.2 to analyze the ecological landscape pattern of the protected areas from the plaque type level and landscape level. The preliminary analysis revealed that, at the plaque type level the main landscape types of Baihe Nature Reserve in 2003-2018 were mixed coniferous and broad-leaved forests, followed by temperate coniferous forests and deciduous broad-leaved forests. Both earthquakes resulted in a decrease in the area of major landscape types, an increase in the number of patches in each landscape type, a decrease in the average area of landscape types, and an increase in the fragmentation of the landscape. At the landscape level, both earthquakes led to a decrease in landscape diversity, a trend towards more complex landscape overall shape, a decrease in landscape spatial heterogeneity, an increase in the gap of each landscape type area proportion, and an imbalance in overall landscape development. Moreover, the present study provides scientific references for monitoring the ecological environment changes before and after earthquakes, ecological restoration and reconstruction after disasters, and habitat conservation of species resources, especially Sichuan golden snub-nose monkeys.

TI  - A CNN-Transformer Hybrid Approach for Crop Classification Using Multitemporal Multisensor Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multitemporal Earth observation capability plays an increasingly important role in crop monitoring. As the frequency of satellite acquisition of remote sensing images becomes higher, how to fully exploit the implicit phenological laws in dense multitemporal data is of increasing importance. In this article, we propose a CNN-transformer approach to perform the crop classification, in the model, we borrow the transformer architecture from the knowledge of NLP to dig into the pattern of multitemporal sequence. First, after unifying the spatial-spectral scale of each multiband data acquired from different sensors, we obtain the scale-consistent feature and position feature of multitemporal sequence. Second, with adopting multilayer encoder modules derived from the transformer, we mine deep correlation patterns of multitemporal sequence. Finally, the feed-forward layer and softmax layer serve as output layers of the model to predict crop categories. The proposed CNN-transformer approach is illustrated in a crop-rich agricultural region in central California, where 65 multitemporal profiles from multisensor Sentinel-2 & x00A0;A/B and Landsat-8 are obtained in 2018. Through multiband multiresolution fusion, sequence correlation extraction of multitemporal data and category feature extraction, the classification results show that the proposed method has a significant performance improvement compared with other traditional methods.

TI  - Study on the Relationship Between Apodization Function and Signal-to-Noise Ratio of Hyperspectral Spatial Interferogram
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The application of interferometric spectroscopy in many fields, such as atmospheric remote sensing, astronomical exploration and geophysical prospecting, is a research hotspot at home and abroad. Spectral reconstruction, as an important part of remote sensing data processing, is closely related to the detection accuracy. Interferogram due to limited optical path difference sampling results in frequency leakage in the restored spectrum. The apodization function can play a role in smoothing the spectrum, maintaining the spectral consistency of the interferometric spectroscopy and other spectroscopy techniques, but at the same time, the resolution (Full Width at Half Maximum, FWHM) of the reconstructed spectrum will be reduced. It has been shown that the apodization function does not improve the inversion accuracy, and the apodization function is not used in the ground data processing of several typical atmospheric remote sensing loads. Spatial heterodyne spectroscopy (SHS) has attracted wide attention at home and abroad due to its many advantages. Based on this technology, Anhui Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics of Chinese Academy of Sciences has successfully developed a prototype for atmospheric CO2 detection. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is one of the key indicators of spectrometer. This paper studies the influence of apodization function on spectral reconstruction of interferogram from the relationship between SNR, spectral resolution and detection accuracy. In view of the fact that the traditional apodization function does not achieve the optimal side-lobe suppression, this paper constructs ten apodization functions with different spectral extending based on Norton-Beer apodization function and the criterion of obtaining the maximum side-lobe suppression under the same resolution reduction. Radiative transfer Model of SCIATRAN was used to analyze the difference of atmospheric top radiance caused by different gas concentration in atmospheric CO2 remote sensing. The spectral SNR requirement of different spectral resolution meets the requirement of 1% detection accuracy under typical conditions was calculated. Based on the parameters of the laboratory prototype, the relationship between spectral resolution and SNR under different extending was analyzed by simulating interferogram and constructed apodization function in this paper. Finally, the experimental verification was carried out by using a prototype developed by the laboratory. The interferograms were obtained by observing the stable uniform integrating sphere, and the SNR was calculated without apodization, and the SNR was calculated after different apodization extending. The simulation and experimental results show that of the SNR is gradually increased due to the reduction of noise by apodization, and the spectral resolution is gradually reduced, while the requirement of SNR for detection accuracy is gradually increased due to the decrease of resolution. The spectral SNR requirement of detection accuracy is obviously higher than that under the apodization. The SNR of simulation data and measured data is lower than that of the requirement of detection accuracy when apodization extendings are greater than 1. 6 times and 1. 8 times, respectively. The need for the SNR of the instrument, that is, the white noise is dominant, is not conducive to the detection accuracy. The results of this paper can be used as a reference for spectral reconstruction, and the influence of inversion accuracy will be further analyzed in the future.

TI  - Effects of Land Cover Patterns on Land Surface Temperatures Associated with Land Use Types along Urbanization Gradients in Shanghai, China
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization has led to increased land surface temperature (LST) and severe urban heat islands (UHIs). The impacts of land use/land cover (LULC) on LST have been extensively studied. However, the differences between land use and land cover and their implications in an urban environment are often overlooked. Taking the example of Shanghai in China, this study aimed to study the effects from land use types and land cover patterns on LST along urbanization gradients. The LST and LULC data of the study area were obtained from a Landsat ETM+ image and Map world Shanghai, respectively. Then, landscape metrics were selected and calculated for analyzing the land cover patterns. Correlation analysis and regression analysis were undertaken to determine the relationship between LST and land cover patterns at the land use level. The results showed that it was inadequate to treat land cover as the single factor affecting LST. Furthermore, LST values did not simply decrease along the urbanization gradients at the land use level. Even though land cover patterns significantly affected LST, land cover variables related to LST varied greatly among the various land use types. The findings in our study provide additional knowledge for optimizing land cover patterns associated with different land use types, which may mitigate the adverse impacts of UHIs at a fine scale.

TI  - PHILOSOPHICAL ANALYSIS OF A PERSON'S SELF-REFLECTION IN THE CONTEXT OF INTERNAL DIALOGUE (BASED ON "THE DISPUTE OF A MAN WITH HIS BA")
T2  - ANTHROPOLOGICAL MEASUREMENTS OF PHILOSOPHICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. The study is aimed at considering self-reflection through an analysis of the features of internal dialogue in ancient texts (XXII-XXI centuries BC) in order to identify signs of human's mythological and philosophical thinking. Theoretical basis of the work is the contemplation of a person's self-reflection in the context of his internal dialogue, through which his own human existence, his subjective and creative comprehension of the world manifest. New meanings are created and shared with others in this mental space, in particular, in crisis periods of personal and social life. Therefore, the ancient Egyptian vision of man's nature, consciousnesses and dialogism of the Self is viewed through the prism of modern philosophical concepts and as the basis for the emergence of a philosophical worldview itself. Originality. The analysis from the viewpoint of the philosophical anthropology in the text "The Dispute of a Man with His Ba" showed the opportunity of considering it not only in the context of internal dialogue, but also as a confirmed internal dialogue, which expresses itself in external speech. Comparing the mythical thinking of a man in his cohesiveness with others and the philosophical thinking of a dialogical Self, the authors come to the conclusion that it is necessary to distinguish between internal dialogues with oneself and with the introjects of others, which can be either Double or Interlocutor. It has been revealed that internal dialogues in ancient times played an important role both in structuring social chaos and in overcoming personal crisis states (from existential to clinical states of altered consciousness). This is precisely from such self-reflection that philosophy emerges as a certain discourse and a new type of thinking. Conclusions. The analysis of the text "The Dispute of a Man with His Ba" speaks about the emergence of philosophical discourse in the XXII-XXI centuries BC, on the basis of which we can conclude concerning the earlier, in comparison with K. Jaspers's definition, the transition of mankind from the cognitive revolution to a new phase of the development.

TI  - Processing of Very High Resolution GF-3 SAR Spotlight Data With Non-Start-Stop Model and Correction of Curved Orbit
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel imaging algorithm is presented in this article for focusing the very high resolution spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data of spotlight mode. The long synthetic aperture time in spotlight mode brings new problems, such as Doppler spectrum aliasing and curved orbit. The imaging results will be filled with ambiguity and would suffer from resolution reduction if Doppler spectrum aliasing is not handled. The error introduced by curved orbit will degrade resolution of the target and introduces asymmetric sidelobes in azimuth direction. The start-stop approximation is no longer applicable, since it introduces two effect, e.g., "fast-time" effect and "slow-time" effect, which will cause defocusing and range-dependent azimuth shift, respectively if not handled. The proposed algorithm combines the two-steps processing approach (TSPA) and the backprojection algorithm (BPA). First, the initial step of TSPA is used to get a high azimuth sampling rate which is higher than pulse repetition frequency to avoid the Doppler spectrum aliasing. Then, the "fast-time" effect of start-stop approximation is corrected in the 2-D frequency domain. Finally, the BPA is used to correct the error introduced by the curved orbit and the "slow-time" effect of start-stop approximation. The experimental results of spaceborne SAR data acquired by Gaofen-3 (GF-3) SAR system demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed algorithm.

TI  - GDP spatialization in Ningbo City based on NPP/VIIRS night-time light and auxiliary data using random forest regression
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate spatial distribution information on gross domestic product (GDP) is of great importance for the analysis of economic development, industrial distribution and urbanization processes. Traditional administrative unit-based GDP statistics cannot depict the detailed spatial differences in GDP within each administrative unit. This paper presents a study of GDP spatialization in Ningbo City, China based on National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP)/Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) night-time light (NTL) data and town-level GDP statistical data. The Landsat image, land cover, road network and topographic data were also employed as auxiliary data to derive independent variables for GDP modelling. Multivariate linear regression (MLR) and random forest (RF) regression were used to estimate GDP at the town scale and were assessed by cross-validation. The results show that the RF model achieved significantly higher accuracy, with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 109.46 million China Yuan (CNY).km(-2) and a determinate coefficient (R-2 = 0.77) than the MLR model (MAE = 161.8 million CNY.km(-2), R-2 = 0.59). Meanwhile, by comparing with the estimated GDP data at the county level, the town-level estimated data showed a better performance in mapping GDP distribution (MAE decreased from 115.1 million CNY.km(-2) to 74.8 million CNY.km(-2)). Among all of the independent variables, NTL, land surface temperature (Ts) and plot ratio (PR) showed higher impacts on the GDP estimation accuracy than the other variables. The GDP density map generated by the RF model depicted the detailed spatial distribution of the economy in Ningbo City. By interpreting the spatial distribution of the GDP, we found that the GDP of Ningbo was high in the northeast and low in the southwest and formed continuous clusters in the north. In addition, the GDP of Ningbo also gradually decreased from the urban centre to its surrounding areas. The produced GDP map provides a good reference for the future urban planning and socio-economic development strategies. (C) 2019 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - A local thresholding approach to flood water delineation using Sentinel-1 SAR imagery
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Emergency response to floods requires timely information on water extents, which can be produced by satellite based remote sensing. As the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can emit and receive signal in nighttime or cloudy conditions, it is particularly suitable to delineate water extent during flood events. Thresholding SAR imagery is one of the most widely used approaches to delineate water extent for its effectiveness and efficiency. However, most thresholding methods rely on a single threshold to separate water and land without considering the complexity and variability of different land surface types in an image. To account for the heterogeneous surface characteristics, this paper proposes a new local thresholding method to water delineation with SAR images. Specifically, our method follows four major steps. First, a global threshold is applied to the SAR imagery to delineate initial water pixels, from which non-water pixels are further clustered into several land surface types. This divides the SAR imagery into one water cluster and several land clusters. Second, local thresholds are estimated at each subset of land cluster paired with water cluster by fitting Gamma distributions to the back-scatter intensities of the combined water/land pixels in each subset. Third, local water extents are delineated from each subset and then merged as the union of all subsets. The results are combined across multiple polarizations by taking an intersection operation to generate the global inundation extent. Finally, the flood water extent is further improved by imposing basic hydrologic constraints. This approach is fast and fully automated for flood detection. Our experiments using Sentinel-1 SAR imagery show that the proposed local thresholding approach could distinguish water from non-water with significantly higher accuracy (4-13% improvement in the harmonic mean of user's and producer's accuracy of water) than conventional global-thresholding methods.

TI  - Influence of Different Bandwidths on LAI Estimation Using Vegetation Indices
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is a valuable indicator used in vegetation growth monitoring. To optimize the index selection according to the type of remote sensing data and to improve the inversion accuracy of LAI, this article analyzes the influence of different bandwidths on the accuracy of the inversion model based on vegetation indices. First, the simulation dataset is generated by the PROSAIL model, and on this basis, 15 vegetation indices with high correlation coefficients with LAI. Then, by analyzing the sensitivity of these 15 indices to the variations in bandwidth, and to the coefficient of determination (R-2) of the LAI inversion model with the variations of bandwidth, the influence of different bandwidths on the accuracy of LAI estimation by each index is determined. The results show that bandwidth is one of the most important factors in determining the accuracy of LAI inversion, and the influence on different vegetation indices can be divided into the following three categories. First, narrowband vegetation index, the accuracy of inversion models built by vegetation indices decreases with the increase of bandwidth, including SR[800,680], OSAVI, MTVI2, SR[752,690], RDVI, NDCI, and NVI. Second, middleband vegetation index, the accuracy first increases and then decreases with the increase of bandwidth, including SR[700,670], Carte5, and SR[675,700]. Third, broadband vegetation index, the accuracy increases with the increase of bandwidth, including SPVI, Carte2, OSAVI2, MTVI1, and NDVI705. The study provides a scientific basis for vegetation index optimization in the process of LAI inversion.

AB  - Huynen-Euler (H-E) parameters are able to depict targets from multiple perspectives because of their explicit physical significance. This paper explores the potential of H-E parameters in the detection of disaster affected areas according to the change of scattering mechanism. A novel parameter, the absolute skip angle, is proposed to replace the original skip angle as an indicator of the number of bounces of the reflected signal, which effectively solves the ambiguity issue of identifying targets that differ only in absolute phase as different targets. Temporal PolSAR data obtained by ALOS PALSAR before and after the 2011 earthquake off the Pacific coast of Tohoku are employed to substantiate the efficacy of the proposals. Experimental results show that the radar target magnitude, polarizability angle, and absolute skip angle are sensitive to the collapsed buildings and flooded areas.

AB  - We use domestic and foreign meteorological satellite data to carry out the research of Operational Regional meteorology which can be used for optical imaging terminal guidances. Attacks on areas covered by clouds can be divided into the following two scenarios: 1. Clouds are medium-high clouds, because the cloud base height of this kind of cloud layer is relatively high, generally more than 2500 meters, it will not have much influence on the optical imaging terminal guidance; 2. With low cloud coverage but not completely covered, the cloud can be detected and segmented, avoiding the cloud to hit the target. We use machine learning algorithm training model to divide the cloud into multi-layer cloud and single-layer cloud, and the classification accuracy reaches 82.1%. Then for single-layer clouds, there are two methods to estimate the cloud bottom height: 1. We can use the MODIS data of the Aqua meteorological satellite to identify clouds of different attributes for cloud height estimation 2 The height of single layer clouds can be calculated directly by using the physical characteristics of clouds, the average calculation error is 16.5%.

CP  - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)

AB  - This paper assessed the accuracy of four passive microwave (PM) sea ice concentration (SIC) products in polar regions by using twelve scenes MODIS images under clear-sky conditions. The SIC products include the DMSP SSMIS with Arctic Radiation and Turbulence Interaction Study Sea Ice (ASI) algorithm (SSMIS/ASI), the GCOM-W AMSR2 with NASA Bootstrap (BT) algorithm (AMSR2/BT), the Chinese Feng Yun-3B with enhanced NASA Team (NT2) algorithm (FY3B/NT2), and the Chinese Feng Yun-3C with NT2 (FY3C/NT2). An adapted optimal threshold method (i.e., the Otsu algorithm) was adopted to automatically classify the MODIS images into sea ice and water which were then aggregated to compare with the PM SIC. The results show that the averaged bias of PM SIC (PM SIC minus MODIS) is less than 6% in Arctic and ranges from -8% to 1% in Antarctic, and the averaged root mean square error (RMSE) is less than 16% in the whole polar regions. Overall, the SSMIS/ASI product has better performance in Arctic, while the FY3/NT2 has lower bias and RMSE in Antarctic. Meanwhile, it is observed that the error metrics of PM SIC vary noticeably when compared to different MODIS images which may be caused by the diverse surface characteristics of different sea ice types.

AB  - Because of the influences of cloud cover, seasonal snow, and many other factors, time series of land surface parameters extracted from remote sensing data often suffer from discontinuities and missing data, which have seriously restricted the application of extracted land surface parameters to research in global change and other fields. This chapter introduces several different techniques for compositing, smoothing, and gap filling of remotely sensed time series data, which generate land surface parameter products that are temporally and spatially continuous.A multitemporal compositing method is designed to select the optimal remote sensing data as the pixel value in a composite time window, according to certain criteria. This is a common processing method used to obtain cloud-free and spatially continuous images. Section 3.1 of this chapter gives a detailed description of several commonly used compositing algorithms. Here, time series data smoothing and gap-filling methods are applied to reconstruct high-quality time series data with temporal continuity and spatial integrity, thereby eliminating the influences of cloud. Section 3.2 introduces several typical smoothing and gap-filling algorithms for time series data.

AB  - Quantitative remote sensing is an inevitable trend in the application of remote sensing in the 21st century. Its core role is to establish a quantitative relationship between the electromagnetic spectrum and the information obtained by the sensor and then use electromagnetic wave information to quantitatively detect all kinds of surface characteristic parameters. Quantitative remote sensing is based on the precise calibration of sensors and the atmospheric correction of remote sensing data. This chapter introduces the atmospheric effects on the process of remote sensing imaging and atmospheric correction to specifically discuss the utilization of atmospheric correction in processing remote sensing data. Section 1 presents the background of atmospheric effects. Section 2 discusses various algorithms for the estimation of aerosol properties, which are based on spectral, temporal, angular, spatial and polarization characteristics. Section 3 introduces the algorithms used for estimating atmospheric moisture content. Then, the influences of other atmospheric components and commonly used atmospheric correction models are illustrated. Finally, an application of atmospheric correction is presented.

AB  - Albedo is a key parameter that is widely used in land surface energy balance studies, mid-to-long-term weather prediction, and global climate change investigation. Remote sensing is an effective way to map the land surface albedo on both the regional and global scales. This chapter first presents the consideration of light incidence and reflection angles to the calculation of surface albedo. Then, the retrieval method of spectral albedo based on bidirectional reflectance models inversion and narrowband-to-broadband albedo conversion is discussed. The next section describes the direct-estimation approaches that retrieve surface broadband albedo directly from single-angle surface reflectance or top-of-atmosphere reflectance, which can be easily adopted in operational global albedo production. After that, the available global land surface albedo remote sensing products and application examples of phenology analysis based on global surface albedo products is briefly reviewed. In the end, a short discussion is given on the cutting-edge problems in global surface albedo estimation.

AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) indicates the amount of leaf area in an ecosystem. LAI is a critical parameter for understanding terrestrial ecological, hydrological, and biogeochemical processes. This chapter first introduces field methods for measuring LAI, including direct and indirect methods, which can be divided into contact methods and noncontact optical methods. LAI can be estimated from remote sensing data using either statistical or physical methods. The statistical methods use the empirical relationship between the LAI and surface reflectance or vegetation indices. The physical methods determine the LAI based on radiative light transfer processes within the canopy. Various retrieval methods, including neural network methods, genetic algorithms, Bayesian networks, and lookup table methods, are discussed. A real-time LAI estimation method that uses the data assimilation approach is introduced. The chapters describes how LAI is retrieved from the light detection and ranging technology based on a forest model. Some major global moderate-resolution LAI products, such as Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, GEOV1, GLASS, GLOBMAP, ECOCLIMAP, and CCRS, are illustrated. The global LAI climatology is presented at the end of the chapter.

M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) characterizes the energy absorption capacity of vegetation canopy. It is a basic physiological variable describing the vegetation structure and related material and energy exchange processes and is an important parameter for estimating the net primary production of terrestrial ecosystem using a remote sensingebased method. This chapter first discusses some related concepts and then introduces the principles and current status of FAPAR estimation. At present, the remote sensingebased methods for estimating FAPAR can be divided into two categories: empirical methods and methods using radiative transfer models or other physical models. Section 11.3 introduces FAPAR products as well as their intercomparison results. Case studies of the study area near the AmeriFlux sites are given in Section 11.4.

T2  - ADVANCED REMOTE SENSING: TERRESTRIAL INFORMATION EXTRACTION AND APPLICATIONS, 2ND EDITION
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Vegetation height and vertical structure are important ecosystem parameters because they are highly correlated with the ecological functions and biodiversity of the ecosystem. This chapter addresses the applications of synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) and light detection and ranging (lidar) in the estimation of vegetation height and vertical structures. The first section introduces the field measurement methods. According to the size of footprint, the lidar data can be divided into two categories, i.e., small footprint and large footprint lidars. The algorithms used to estimate forest height from these two types of lidar data are different and will be discussed in Sections 2 and 3. Lidars can directly measure vegetation height and vertical structure, but most lidars, especially the space-borne lidars, provide sampling rather than imagery data. Other imagery data, especially the interferometric SAR data (InSAR) are needed for regional mapping of vegetation height and vertical structure. Section 4 is devoted to the application of polarimetric InSAR technique in the estimation of vegetation height and vertical structures. The recent developments of computer vision bring new vitality to photogrammetry and are described in Section 5. Point cloud data can be generated with high density using dense matching technology, which can be used to extract vegetation height information. At last, a brief description of future perspectives is summarized.

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Vegetation, as the principal component of terrestrial ecosystem, plays an important role in sustaining global substance and energy cycle, adjusting carbon balance and alleviating the rise of atmospheric CO2 concentration and global climate change. Vegetation production of terrestrial ecosystem in particular relates to the process where atmospheric CO2 is absorbed by plants through photosynthesis and dry matter is accumulated by transforming solar energy to chemical energy. Vegetation production, as a major ecological index to estimate sustainable development of ecosystem, reflects the productivity of terrestrial ecosystem under natural conditions. Vegetation covers over 90% of total terrestrial area and its response to global change is very important in that the adjustment to climate change and the mitigation of the rise of atmospheric CO2 level mainly depend on vegetation's adjustment and feedback to climate change. Furthermore, about 40% of productivity of terrestrial ecosystem is utilized either indirectly or directly (Vitousek et al., 1997) by being transformed into the food and fuels used by human beings. Thus, terrestrial ecosystem provides the foundation for human survival and sustainable development.Vegetation production of terrestrial ecosystem has been one of the major subjects for the research on global change. The simulation accuracy of vegetation productivity directly determines the simulation precision of elements in subsequent carbon cycling (such as leaf area index [LAI], litter, soil respiration, and soil carbon). It is also associated with the accurate estimate of the bearing capacity of terrestrial ecosystem for sustainable development of human society. The research on vegetation productivity has undergone several stages of development, including the initial simple statistical model, the later process model driven by remote sensing data, and the current dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM). Remote sensing data, due to their capacity to provide spatially and temporally continuous vegetation change characteristics, occupy a nonsubstitutable position in regional estimation and prediction research. This chapter gives a systematic introduction of various models for estimating vegetation productivity of terrestrial ecosystem, and the role of remote sensing data and their development orientation are emphatically illustrated.

T2  - ADVANCED REMOTE SENSING: TERRESTRIAL INFORMATION EXTRACTION AND APPLICATIONS, 2ND EDITION
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - This chapter provides the theoretical basis for measurement and estimation of terrestrial evapotranspiration. It includes the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory (MOST) and the Penman-Monteith equation. We focus on the application of these theories to satellite remote sensing. Both the MOST and the Penmane Monteith equations are empirical in nature, and they require several assumptions to be met. Further parameterizations and assumptions are necessary to relate the satellite-derived land surface variables to terrestrial evapotranspiration. There is no difference in the physics between the two formulations as the Penman-Monteith equation is derived from MOST. However, there are important differences between the two formulations in their practical application: MOST-like methods use airesurface temperature differences and require accurate estimates of these terms. Therefore, MOST-like methods are sensitive to errors in these differences. This sensitivity is substantially reduced by the Penman-Monteith equation related methods, which use the available energy and stomatal conductance that can be empirically parameterized as a function of the vegetation index (leaf area index), incident radiation, and relative humidity. The accuracy of a given model is usually the first consideration in its development, but the required ancillary data and the method's suitability for different conditions are considerations for satellite remote methods as well. Satellite remote sensing can now reliably determine the spatial variability of land surface variables and terrestrial evapotranspiration; however, it still has difficulty in providing long-term, stable estimates.

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The amount of snow affects the energy, water, and carbon balance on the Earth's surface and the interactions between the land and the atmosphere. It is a key parameter for the numerical weather prediction and the long-term climate research. Therefore, it is very important to monitor snow water equivalent (SWE). This chapter describes the methods to measure SWE using both the ground-based and the remote sensing techniques, and introduces the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of the SWE and its application in the hydrological, meteorological, biological and economical fields. Microwave remote sensing has a strong physical basis to detect snow depth and SWE, due to the penetration ability of microwave and its sensitivity to the snow volume scattering. Therefore, we focus on the theories and algorithms using the passive and active microwave remote sensing. The optical remote sensing utilizes the snow cover fraction to build empirical relationship with SWE. The SWE can also be "reconstructed" by summing the snowmelt calculated by the snow cover fraction from the last to the current snow days. These methods are also briefly introduced, as an extension to the microwave remote sensing.

AB  - Urbanization is the inevitable phenomenon of social and economic development. The rapid growth of global urbanization not only leads to complex land cover changes but also affects the vegetation coverage, the surface albedo, the surface roughness of the city, and the surrounding area and then affects the circulation of the urban hydrological and ecological systems and changes the urban environment and the near ground climate. Remote sensing provides broad, precise, impartial, and easily available information for quantifying the scope of the city, monitoring the process of urban expansion, and analyzing the impact of urbanization. This chapter aims to describe how to use remote sensing data products to map urban areas and expansion areas (23.2), monitor urban ecological environment (23.3), and analyze the impact of urbanization on vegetation phenology, net primary productivity, surface parameters (vegetation coverage, surface albedo, and surface temperature) and air quality (23.4).

AB  - As the largest terrestrial ecosystem on Earth, forests are affected by climate change and human activities. In turn, forests influence the climate at local, regional, and global scales through physical, chemical, and biological processes. Forest cover change and its climatic effects are of considerable interest in land cover and land-use change studies. Remote sensing is a powerful tool used for monitoring forest cover change as it provides abundant spatial and temporal information. In this chapter, we describe how to apply remotely sensed data to detect and map the location, extent, and variability of forest cover change (Section 25.2) and quantify the climatic effects resulting from forest cover change (Section 25.3). Several examples, including deforestation in the Amazon and forest cover change in China, are given (Section 25.4) to better illustrate the causes and effects of forest cover change.

AB  - The deep blue (DB) algorithm is usually used for retrieval of AOD on high reflectivity surfaces, which cover complex surface types. However, due to low spatial resolutions, it shows limited information details in urban areas and cannot fully display the aerosol variation characteristics. Now, a new aerosol retrieval algorithm with a priori Land Surface Reflectance (LSR) database support (HARLS) is proposed for Landsat-8 (OLI) images at 1km spatial resolution to use the look-up table (LUT) method to retrieve AOD. The continental aerosol type defined in the 6S model is modified by AERONET single scattering albedo (SSA) parameter to correct the LUT for different seasons, and deep learning neural network is used to train the samples based on the corrected LUT and retrieve AOD. The retrieved AOD are then validated against the aerosol robotic network (AERONET) AOD ground measurements from five stations in Beijing and compared with MODO4 C6.1 10km AOD product. The overall results demonstrate that the AOD retrieved is highly consistent with the AOD derived from ground measurements.

TI  - Polarimetric Calibration Scheme Combining Internal and External Calibrations, and Experiment for Gaofen-3
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The parameters for polarization distortion of spaceborne polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) have range-dependence (or look-angle-dependence), which requires a polarimetric calibration to be performed at any look-angle. It is a huge endeavor to rely solely on ground experiments to obtain a polarimetric calibration at all look-angles. For SAR with phased array antennas we deduce, based on the model for the general polarimetric system, the model for fine polarization distortion described by the parameters of the radar device under the condition of high polarization isolation. We point out the mechanism that causes both variable and constant polarization distortions, and we deduce the correction algorithms for the two types of polarization distortion. Then we propose a polarimetric calibration scheme combining internal and external calibrations to calibrate the two types of polarization distortions for SAR with phased array antennas. The scheme uses the internal calibration data of the radar and the model of the antenna pattern established before satellite launch to invert the in-orbit antenna patterns to correct for the variable polarization distortion, and it needs only a small amount of calibration equipment to solve for the parameters for constant polarization distortion. The scheme no longer depends on the distributed target and improves the polarization precision of the data. It is applied to the calibration experiment for the data processing of the GaoFen-3 satellite and has achieved good results in applications.

M3  - Article
AB  - Freeman proposed a general polarimetric system model in 1991 for the characterization and calibration of fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems. The model contains three-channel imbalance parameters and four cross-talk parameters, which together describe the polarimetric distortion in a practical imaging radar more accurately than the conventional six-parameter model by including a third imbalance parameter, namely gamma. This parameter is independent of the others and represents the ratio of the product of the transfer functions of the copolarized channels to the product of the transfer functions of the cross-polarized channels. Nonnegligible errors may arise if this parameter is not estimated and corrected, but since this parameter was proposed, there has been very little research into calibration methods that account for gamma. In this article, based on the general polarimetric system model in the 2 x 2 matrix form, we propose a gamma-factor estimation method based on an active radar calibrator (ARC) or a dihedral corner reflector. We also propose a universal iterative polarimetric calibration algorithm based on three pieces of calibration equipment, which can be all ARCs, all corner reflectors (CRs), or a combination of ARCs and CRs. The convergence of this iterative algorithm is proven mathematically. These alternatives provide a variety of practical calibration method options for polarimetric SAR calibration under different conditions. Finally, the simple calibration method based on a single piece of calibration equipment and the iterative algorithm based on three pieces of calibration equipment are verified by the polarimetric calibration experiment data from the GaoFen-3 satellite.

TI  - Effectiveness of high-speed railway on regional economic growth for less developed areas
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Whether high-speed railway (HSR) can drive regional economic growth (REG) along the route is controversial, and the effectiveness of HSR connecting less developed and developed regions especially need to be further tested. The Guangdong-Guangxi-Guizhou High-Speed Railway (GGGHSR) has connected the most developed eastern region and the less developed western region in China, and it's a typical object to study the impact of HSR on less developed areas. This paper uses NPP-VIIRS remote sensing data from the period 2012-2017 to represent the level of regional economic growth along the route, and uses the PSM-DID method to analyze the impact of HSR in a quantitative way. The results show the following: Firstly, opening of the GGGHSR has led to an increase in light value along the route, but not produced a significant "corridor effect" along the route, with no significant REG in all counties along the route; Secondly, the effectiveness of the GGGHSR have spatial differences along the route, with a greater effect on less developed areas and areas far away from regional center city; Thirdly, the effectiveness of HSR driving less developed areas is mainly through "investment effect" and "industrial structure effect" these two mechanisms. The contribution of this study lies in the use of objective light data to study the relationship between HSR and REG, and select this typical GGGHSR project proving the driving role of HSR in the economic growth of less developed areas.

AB  - We map mangrove extents in Pongara National Park, Gabon using the Freeman-Durden Decomposition and InSAR Coherence derived from ALOS-2 imagery. Specifically, we obtain a land cover map derived from both this polarimetric decomposition and a 14-day repeat-pass coherence. Our classification model and results are highly interpretable based on a depth 2 decision tree. We further illustrate the correlation between InSAR coherence and height obtaining rough mangrove height estimates from TanDEM-X data. From our results, we observe that repeat-pass interferometric coherence provides invaluable information about mangrove extents and coastal forests. The clear identification of mangrove extents presents a significant opportunity for NISAR, which will provide 12-day repeat pass images over coastal areas globally.

AB  - The article considers the collection of the short stories “Desire” by Karelian writer Dmitry Novikov, one of the prominent representatives of the “new northern prose”. The followers of this direction consider themselves the successors of the tradition of Russian northern prose (B. Shergin, S. Pisakhov, F. Abramov and other) and define their creative credo with the concepts of “honesty, faith, beauty”.The book “Desire” is a cycle of short stories or, by the author’s definition “a novella in short stories”. The article explores the content and formal connections between the parts performing a cyclo-forming function. Among such values, the most important are the problems of the relation of the heroes to life and death, questions of personal liberty and responsibility. The unifying role plays the topos of the Russian North, which, according to mythopoetic tradition, is understood as a sacral space. The common structural components of short stories are the collision of individual consciousness with the irrational demonstration of being, the willing to freedom with the inert flow of existence. In the author’s artistic worldview, a proximity to the philosophy of life and existentialism come out, which is manifested in the interpretation of being as a chaotic stream, which can be realized only through experience (in Novikov, through passion); in particular with attention to borderline situations in which a person shows his true essence.Based on the analysis of the author’s position and the connection between the short stories, there is an attempt which is made to present a possible interpretation of the novella’s super plot.

AB  - Land surface temperature data from Landsat 8 and from MODIS on the Aqua and Terra satellites were compared with ground-based surface temperature data from five urban sites within a New York City neighborhood. The ground data validated the spatial heterogeneity of surface temperatures from Landsat 8; however, all three satellite sensors significantly underestimated the measured surface temperatures. The sensors reasonably matched the temperature of shaded areas, but they undervalued the overall temperature. These results suggest that, while Landsat 8 and other satellites are helpful tools for mapping urban temperature variations, the absolute temperature readings need validation, for they may not capture the high temperatures of sun-exposed urban areas.

Simulated water reflectance for the Sentinel-2 MSI sensor were computed using a semi-empirical water reflectance model. The models are evaluated in Four water types with various levels of CDOM, phytoplankton and suspended sediment. It was found that the power law applied to the band ratio of band 2 (443 nm) to band 4 (665 nm) has the best performance across all water types, except that the performance deteriorates for the water type with low CDOM but high chlorophyll content.

AB  - Sentinel-2A satellite imagery provides VNIR (Visible Near InfraRed) and SWIR (ShortWave InfraRed) wavelength bands, and it is known to be effective for land cover classification, cloud detection, and environmental monitoring. Greenhouse is one of the middle classification classes for land cover map provided by the Ministry of Environment of the Republic of Korea. Since greenhouse is a class that has a lot of changes due to natural disasters such as storm and flood damage, there is a limit to updating the greenhouse at a rapid cycle in the land cover map. In the present study, we utilized Sentinel-2A satellite images that provide both VNIR and SWIR bands for the detection of greenhouse. To utilize Sentinel-2A satellite images for the detection of greenhouse, we produced high-resolution SWIR bands applying to the fusion technique performed in two stages and carried out the detection of greenhouse using SVM (Support Vector Machine) supervised classification technique. In order to analyze the applicability of SWIR bands to greenhouse detection, comparative evaluation was performed using the detection results applying only VNIR bands. As a results of quantitative and qualitative evaluation, the result of detection by additionally applying SWIR bands was found to be superior to the result of applying only VNIR bands.

AB  - A river bed which is submerged in water at high flow and becomes part of the river at low flow, serves as a bridge between the river and the land. The channel bar creates a unique ecosystem with vegetation adapted to the particular environment and the water pool forms a wetland that plays a very important role in the environment. To evaluate anthropogenic impacts on the river bed in the Middle Yeongsangang River, the fluvial landforms in the stream channel were analyzed using multi-temporal remotely-sensed images. In the aerial photograph of 2005 taken before the construction of the large weirs, oxbow lakes, mid-channel bars, point bars, and natural wetlands between the artificial levees were identified.Multiple bars divided the flow of stream water to cause the braided pattern in a particular section. After the construction of the Seungchon weir, aerial photographs of 2013 and 2015 revealed that most of the fluvial landforms disappeared due to the dredging of its riverbed and water level control(maintenance at 7.5El.m). Sentinel-2 images were analyzed to identify differences between before and after the opening of weir gate. Change detection was performed with the near infrared and shortwave infrared spectral bands to effectively distinguish water surfaces from land. As a result, water surface area of the main stream of the Yeongsangang River decreased by 40% from 1.144km2 to 0.692km2. A large mid-channel bar that has been deposited upstream of the weir was exposed during low water levels, which shows the obvious influence of weir on the river bed. Newly formed unvegetated point bars that were deposited on the inside of a meander bend were identified from the remotely sensed images. As the maintenance period of the weir gate opening was extended, various habitats were created by creating pools and riffles around the channel bars. Considering the ecological and hydrological functions of the river bed, it is expected that the increase in bar areas through weir gate opening will reduce the artificial interference effect of the weir.

T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The opioid epidemic has necessitated increased attention to prescribing practices. This study seeks to prospectively quantify postoperative opioid use after breast operation.Methods: Consecutive patients undergoing breast operation at a single institution in 2018 prospectively tracked each dose of medication and completed a survey of perceptions regarding their opioid prescription.Results: Of 100 patients, 88 completed log, survey, or both. The tab quantity required to fulfill the needs of 80% of patients was: Partial mastectomy (PM) 3, PM with sentinel lymph node biopsy 6, PM with bilateral reduction 8, total mastectomy 34, and bilateral mastectomy 47. Of survey respondents, 51.2% felt they had been prescribed too much pain medication. Most (83.0%) had leftover tabs, and 67.9% indicated they kept them in their home.Conclusions: The majority of patients were overprescribed opioids after breast operation. A reduction could be achieved by targeting the needs of 80% of the population. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a novel six-axis force/moment (F/M) sensor was developed. The sensor has a novel ring structure comprising a cross-beam elastic body with sliding and rotating mechanisms to achieve complete decoupling. The unique sliding and rotating mechanisms can reduce cross-talk effects caused by minimized structural interconnection. The forces F-x, F-y, and F-z and moments M-x, M-y, and M-z can be measured for the six-axis F/M sensors according to the elastic deformation of strain gauges attached to the cross beam. Herein, we provide detailed descriptions of the mathematical models, model idealizations, model creation, and the mechanical decoupling principle. The paper also presents a theoretical analysis of the strain based on Timoshenko beam theory and the subsequent validation of the analysis results through a comparison of the results with those obtained from a numerical analysis conducted using finite element analysis simulations. The sensor was subjected to experimental testing to obtain the maximum cross-talk errors along the following six axes under different loadings (the errors are presented in parentheses): F-x under SMy (2.12%), F-y under SMx (1.88%), F-z under SMz (2.02%), M-x under SFz (1.15%), M-y under SFx (1.80%), and M-z under SFx (2.63%). The proposed sensor demonstrated a considerably improved cross-talk error performance compared with existing force sensors.

AB  - Two Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensors have been in operations for more than 8.5 and 2.5 years since they were launched in October 2011 on SNPP satellite and in November 2017 on NOAA-20 satellite, respectively. These are two satellites in the Join Polar Satellite System (JPSS) constellation, of which Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) is a risk reduction satellite and NOAA-20 is the first of four JPSS satellites (JPSS-1 became NOAA-20 after launch). Accurate geolocation is a critical element in data calibration for accurate retrieval of global biogeophysical parameters. In this paper, we describe the latest trends in the continuously improved geolocation accuracy in VIIRS Collection-1 (C1) and C2 re-processing. We implemented a VIIRS instrument geometric model update (VIGMU) for both sensors that correct for geolocation error oscilations in the scan direction. We borrowed code from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) geolocation software to correct for time-dependent pointing variations, that are particularly acute in NOAA-20 VIIRS, and some pointing anomalies in SNPP VIIRS. We developed a Kalman Filter using gyro data to correct for attitude errors due to the degradation of the star trackers performance from the SNPP satellite. We also present an improved ground control point matching (CPM) tool, in which the ground control point (GCP) chips library is refreshed using recently launched Landsat-8 images.

AB  - Fire is a major disturbance in Daxing'anling Mountain in China, affecting ecosystem carbon cycle significantly. However, the return of forest productivity at regional scale in high fire disturbance has not been well documented and understood. The objective of this paper was to evaluate remote sensing driven 3-PG model for simulating the forest recovery in high-intensity burnt areas. Differences in productivity among sites were accounted for by only changing the values of fertility rating and climate condition which calculated from remote sensing data. The adapted model performed well in the experimental plots, and accurately estimated above ground biomass and diameter growth. Then, a case study was conducted on the 2001 burnt area, and NDVI images simulation used for validating the effectiveness of the model in a large scale area.

AB  - Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) represents only 1% to 5% of all breast malignancies and is an extremely aggressive subtype. At time of diagnosis, up to 85% of patients will present with regional nodal metastases and up to 30 % will have metastasis to distant organs. There is limited medical literature describing treatment guidelines for IBC during gestation. The best diagnostic tools are core needle and full-thickness skin punch biopsies to assess presence of dermal lymphatic invasion. Breast Ultrasound is preferred to mammogram, but mammography could still be done with proper fetal shielding. Ultrasound and Magnetic resonance imaging are used for staging. Pregnant patients should be managed with special attention to the health of the fetus by a multidisciplinary team. Treatment based on current guidelines consist of a sequence of systemic chemotherapy followed by mastectomy with axillary dissection (modified radical mastectomy), and even if good clinical nodal response to neoadjuvant therapy is obtained, sentinel node biopsy is not recommended. Radiation therapy is to be given once the baby has been delivered. Chemotherapy is not recommended in the first trimester, and anti-estrogen hormonal therapy, as well as targeted Her2-neu therapies are contraindicated during the length of the pregnancy. There is no evidence that early termination improves the outcome. However, given the poor prognosis of IBC, patients should be fully counseled on the risks and benefits of continuing or terminating an early pregnancy.

TI  - Twenty years of Terra MODIS spatial performance using the Spectro-Radiometric Calibration Assembly
T2  - EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEMS XXV

CP  - Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXV
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument on-board the NASA's Earth Observing System Terra satellite has continued successful Earth-sensing operations for over 20 years. To aid in its mission in providing calibrated science data to the worldwide user community, the MODIS instrument is equipped with several on-board calibrators designed to measure changes in the instrument response over time. One such calibrator is the SpectroRadiometric Calibration Assembly (SRCA), which can provide a source signal for radiometric, spectral, or spatial characterization. When commanded into its spatial calibration mode, the SRCA is able to produce light across the MODIS band spectral range (0.412 mu m to 14.2 mu m) at a variety of signal levels thanks to several internal halogen lamps, an IR glow bar, and a neutral density filter. This signal, used in combination with commanded sub-sample measurements of the MODIS detectors, provides a basis for determining changes in the spatial performance of the MODIS spectral bands. This work summarizes the spatial calibration process using the SRCA and presents 20 years of Terra MODIS spatial performance characterized through co-registration between MODIS bands, detectors, and focal plane assemblies. Results from pre-launch testing using the Integration and Alignment Collimator and the SRCA are incorporated in the history of the Terra MODIS mission-long spatial performance. We also note modifications to the spatial characterization methodology brought on by changes to the SRCA's operational configuration and changes to the MODIS spectral band performance, particularly after the recovery from the safe-mode event in February 2016. Results are compared against the MODIS design specifications.

TI  - Measuring crosstalk in MODIS spectral bands on-orbit using the SRCA
T2  - EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEMS XXV
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXV
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Near-identical MODIS instruments launched on-board the Terra and Aqua spacecraft in 1999 and 2002, respectively. Each MODIS instrument has 36 spectral bands covering 0.41 to 14.2 mu m mounted among four focal plane assemblies, along with a series of on-board calibrators (OBCs) used to characterize the instrument performance on-orbit. One such OBC is the Spectro-radiometric Calibration Assembly (SRCA), which is a multi-function calibrator, able to provide calibration sources to measure spatial, spectral, or radiometric properties of the MODIS bands depending on its configuration. The MODIS instrument performance, including measurements of the signal cross-contamination (crosstalk) between bands, was measured on-orbit during early-mission characterization for both instruments. This crosstalk test used the SRCA in its spatial mode while utilizing the thin slit, which is normally used for spectral calibrations. A similar crosstalk test was recently performed for Terra MODIS. Since the Terra safe mode event in 2016, the PV LWIR bands specifically (6.7-9.7 mu m) have shown increased influence from crosstalk. The process involved in preparing and performing this crosstalk test is included in this work, as well as the findings from the recent and previous SRCA-based crosstalk characterizations.

AB  - The article explores the possibility of detecting signs of internal waves in the southern part of the Sea of Japan (East). An analysis of the motion of an internal wave packet in the southern part of the Sea of Japan (East) was carried out using medium-resolution satellite data from a GOCI radiometer installed on a COMS geostationary satellite. The spatiotemporal characteristics of internal waves are estimated with modeling of the corresponding vertical distributions of chlorophyll-a using oceanographic data and measurements. The approximate amplitudes of the internal waves and their comparative analysis are calculated with the additional use of data from the reanalysis of the HYCOM model.

TI  - Severe maternal morbidity among migrants with insecure residency status in Sweden 2000-2014: a population-based cohort study
T2  - JOURNAL OF MIGRATION AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Migrants with insecure residency status (i.e., undocumented migrants and asylum-seekers, who are denied or waiting for authorized residency) often experience social and psychosocial adversities and limited access to health care. Nonetheless, they have not been profiled on the risk of severe maternal morbidity (SMM), a sentinel measure of maternal health and maternity care.Methods: A cohort study on all births recorded in the Swedish Medical Birth Register from 2000-2014 (N = 1,570,472). Lacking a maternal personal identification number was used as an indicator for insecure residency status (1.3% of all births). We used Poisson regression models to estimate risk ratios of SMM in migrant women with insecure residency status compared to the Swedish-born or migrant women with long-term residency, adjusting for the calendar year of birth, maternal age, and parity.Results: Overall SMM rate among migrant women with insecure residency status was 21.5/1000 and 14.7/1000 among Swedish-born women. Compared to Swedish-born, migrants with insecure residency status had 50% higher risk of overall SMM (adjusted risk ratio (aRR)= 1.54 [1.37-1.74]) and over 80% higher risk of SMM excluding transfusion-only cases (aRR= 1.88 [1.37-2.57]). When compared to migrant women with long-term residency, migrant women with insecure residency also had a higher risk of SMM (overall SMM aRR = 1.42 [1.26,1.61]; SMM excluding transfusion only cases aRR= 1.43 [1.04,1.97]), suggesting that insecure residency conferred additional risks of SMM beyond migration.Conclusion: Migrant women with insecure residency status had increased risk of severe maternal morbidity.

TI  - An Assessment and Error Analysis of MOD10A1 Snow Product Using Landsat and Ground Observations Over China During 2000-2016
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The MOD10A1 daily snow cover product offers a fine temporal resolution, which is particularly important for time-critical applications. Although the reliability of this product was mostly verified by ground measurements before use, the inadequate representativeness of point-scale observations may lead to errors in the assessment of MOD10A1. In this study, based on the Google Earth Engine, MOD10A1 was thoroughly evaluated by a total of 20 131 binary snow maps generated from 30 m Landsat imagery for the 2000-2016 snow seasons in three typical snow regions across China. The three typical snow regions included Northern Xinjiang, Northeast China, and the Tibetan Plateau. In general, the accuracy of MOD10A1 under clear sky conditions is 86.5% based on ground observations from meteorological stations and 90.3% based on Landsat imagery. Compared with ground measurements, snow cover derived from Landsat images is in better agreement with MOD10A1 due to a better spatial match. The error analyses also indicate that 1) compared with land cover, topography has larger effects on the accuracy of MOD10A1 over the three snow regions with statistically significant negative relationships, particularly in Northern Xinjiang (R = -0.604, P < 0.05); and 2) MOD10A1 shows a relatively lower accuracy of 81.8% from 2006 to 2008 due to the decrease in snow depth during this period (R = 0.58, P < 0.05) based on the Mann-Kendall test.

TI  - A Multi-Level Analysis of the Effects of Independent Living Programs on Educational Attainment, Employment, and Housing Outcomes of Youth Aging Out of Foster Care
T2  - CHILD WELFARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Youth aging out of foster care system normally face multiple disadvantages in terms of educational attainment, employment, housing, financial stability, and life skills compared with children in the general population. About two-thirds of eligible youth in care receive Independent Living Programs (ILPs), which are designed to support youth and ensure a successful transition to adulthood. The objective of this paper is to examine whether ILPs are effectively promoting better outcomes (e.g., educational attainment, employment, housing) for youth aging out of foster care. Using data from the National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD), this study used Hierarchical Generalized Linear Models (HGLM) to investigate how different services from ILPs impact the educational attainment, employment, and homelessness of youth aging out of foster care across all 50 states in the United States. The study sample included youth in foster care from a FY 2014 cohort (N= 5633) on Wave 3 at age 21. Controlling for all the covariates, youth who received post-secondary educational support, budget and financial management, and financial assistance for education were more likely to achieve higher educational attainment. Youth who received post-secondary educational support and supervised independent living were more likely to get employed. The results indicated that certain types of ILPs services were associated with positive outcomes in terms of education, employment and housing. Post-secondary educational support service was found to be the most effective type of service for improving all the outcomes. The findings suggest the importance of providing ILPs to youth aging out of foster care. In addition, variation in service delivery and implementation fidelity across states must be taken into consideration.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - It is difficult to detect ports in polarimetric SAR images due to the complex components, the variety of contours and the complicated coastal terrains background. A novel port detection method is proposed by extracting the specific water area in port based on three-component decomposition. Firstly, the double-bounce and volume scattering components of terrains are obtained by a modified three-component decomposition. The scattering components of port water are compared with that of normal water. Then water and land are separated by thresholding the volume scattering power. Port water and normal water regions are separated by thresholding a proposed polarimetric parameter related to the doublebounce scattering power. Finally, ports are detected by placing the boundary and thresholding the average doublebounce power of the land in the detected port water region. Three RADARSAT-2 polarimetric SAR data covering the regions of Dalian, Zhanjiang and Fujian in China respectively are used to test the port detection method. Experimental results show that all ports are correctly and fast detected by the proposed method.

TI  - Annual large-scale urban land mapping based on Landsat time series in Google Earth Engine and OpenStreetMap data: A case study in the middle Yangtze River basin
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Long time series (e.g. 30 years) urban land observations from remote sensing images are important for urban growth modeling as well as for the goal of sustainable urban development. However, updates to regional and even global maps are infrequent due to the cost and difficulty of collecting representative training data and the requirement for high-performance computation in processing large amounts of images. In this study, a semiautomatic large-scale and long time series (LSLTS) urban land mapping framework is demonstrated by integrating the crowdsourced OpenStreetMap (OSM) data with free Landsat images (similar to 13,218 scenes) to generate annual urban land maps in the 317,000 km(2) middle Yangtze River basin (MYRB) from 1987 to 2017 facilitated by Google Earth Engine (GEE). Random training samples for latest year were generated based on the updated OSM land use data after a manual topological conflict processing and uploaded to GEE for automatic image classification. For each historical year, training samples were obtained with a proposed transferring schema by which only the unchanged were selected through a change detection analysis. The annual spectral indices and texture feature maps acquired from the surface reflectance dataset were also added to the original bands. Finally, the classified maps were downloaded from GEE and a spatial-temporal consistency checking was further performed. Based on independent samples, the overall accuracies and kappa coefficients of all years ranged from 98% to 99% and 0.65 to 0.85, respectively. Our product when compared with current 30 m land-cover products showed similar accuracies but more spatial details. The characteristics of pattern, traces, and hotspots of urban expansion were further explored. This study provides a more convenient procedure for LSLTS urban land mapping especially for areas where large-scale field sample-collection is difficult and little historical crowdsourced datasets are available. The resultant dataset is expected to provide consistent details about the spatial distribution of urban land in MYRB. We highlight the potential use of this proposed framework to be applied and validated to other parts of the world to help better understand and quantify various aspects of urban-related problems.

TI  - An approach for broad-scale predictive soil properties mapping in low-relief areas based on responses to solar radiation
T2  - SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In low-relief areas, easily observed landscape features such as terrain and vegetation often do not spatially co-vary with soil conditions to the level that they can be effectively used in predictive soil mapping. This paper proposes an approach to predicting soil spatial variation over such areas at a coarse resolution by constructing environmental covariates from the dynamic feedbacks of land surface in response to solar radiation. These feedbacks are captured by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MOD'S) land surface temperature observations as a time series of four temperatures per day (1:30 AM, 10:30 AM, 1:30 PM, 10:30 PM) converted into five covariates representing the features of the time series. The approach is demonstrated by mapping sand, silt, soil organic matter (SOM), and pH over a 12,000-km(2) low-relief area of Jiangsu Province, China, using a random forest model trained on 144 soil observations. The model was built and evaluated for 13 single days. For the non-winter days with relatively high solar radiation, the covariates were strongly correlated with the soil properties, so that their use in predictive mapping gives good results for soil texture and useful results for SOM and pH. We also present plausible physical interpretations for the action of the covariates based on thermal properties of soils. We conclude that, despite the coarse resolution of the MODIS-derived covariates, the proposed approach is a feasible solution for predictive soil mapping over large areas of low relief and should be investigated at finer resolutions.

TI  - Spatial and temporal dynamics and its driving factors of vegetation cover before and after the establishment of Poyang Lake Eco-economic Zone
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Poyang Lake Eco-economic Zone is one of the accelerating poles of growth in central China. Understanding vegetation changes will provide support for more reasonable regulation and control of economic development and ecological protection in the Eco-economic Zone. Based on MODIS NDVI from 2000 to 2017, we explored the temporal and spatial characteristics of NDVI before and after the establishment of the Eco-economic Zone by using the slope of least square method and quantitatively examined the effects of climate and human factors on NDVI changes by means of correlation analysis. The results showed that before (2000-2008) and after (2009 2017) the establishment of the Zone, the overall vegetation showed an increasing growth trend. The NDVI growth showed a trend of 0.052 10 a(-1) (P<0.05) and 0.025 10 a(-1) (P<0.05) before and after the establishment of the Eco-economic Zone, respectively. After the establishment of the Eco-economic Zone, the growth of NDVI slowed down. Spatially, vegetation degradation occurred around prefectural cities and the provincial capital before the establishment of Eco-economic Zone, which intensified after its establishment. Furthermore, after the establishment of the Zone, vegetation degradation expanded to area around the lake, northern region and southern farming areas. In terms of influencing factors, on the regional scale, climatic factors were the dominant factors for NDVI change, with the influence of temperature on NDVI being greater than that of precipitation. In areas where NDVI changed significantly, human activities were the main factors affecting NDVI changes. Before the establishment of the Eco-economic Zone, the acceleration of urbanization was the main human factor causing the regional vegetation degradation. After the establishment of the Eco-economic Zone, vegetation degradation in the farming and lake areas, non-agricultural construction land occupation of other types of land, and rural homestead occupation of grassland were important anthropogenic factors inducing regional vegetation degradation.

TI  - URBAN BLUE GROUND OBJECT EXTRACTION BY USING A NEW SPECTRAL INDEX FROM WORLDVIEW-2
T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Blue ground objects are typical ground objects in the urban environment, and the extraction of this type of ground objects is of great significance in urban environmental monitoring. To quickly extract blue ground objects from remote sensing images, this study takes WorldView-2 data as an example through the difference operation between some key bands, accumulates the difference image and performs ratio processing, enhances the information of blue ground objects and weakens the information of other ground objects in the newly generated image. A spectral index that can extract blue ground objects is then created. After the creation of the blue ground objects spectral index, an appropriate threshold is used to extract the blue ground objects in the image. Experimental results show that the new spectral threshold method can effectively detect blue ground objects in the urban image of WorldView-2 with high extraction accuracy, simple process and fast speed.

TI  - Concomitant Radiation Recall Dermatitis and Organizing Pneumonia following Breast Radiotherapy: A Case Report
T2  - CASE REPORTS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose:Radiation recall dermatitis (RRD) is a rare complication that occurs after completion of radiation therapy (RT) and initiation of a precipitating agent, most commonly chemotherapeutic medications. Various theories attempt to explain the mechanism, including activation of the body's inflammatory pathways through nonimmune activation. Likewise, radiation-induced organizing pneumonia (RIOP) is an infrequent but potentially life-threatening complication of RT that, while not fully understood, is suspected to be partly an autoimmune reaction.Patient:We present the case of a 71-year-old female with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, interstitial cystitis, and osteoarthritis who presented with clinical stage T1N0M0 ER+/PR-/HER2- invasive ductal carcinoma of the lower outer quadrant of the left breast, for which she underwent left segmental mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy followed by completion axillary lymph node dissection. Her final pathologic stage was T1N1M0.Result:The patient developed RRD and later RIOP following receipt of radiation and chemotherapy, which resolved with steroid administration.Conclusions:The rarity of both RRD and RIOP occurring in a patient, as in our case, suggests a shared pathophysiology behind these two complications. As both reactions involve some degree of inflammation and respond to corticosteroids, it seems likely that the etiologies of RRD and RIOP lie within the inflammatory pathway. However, further investigation should evaluate the frequency, duration, and triggering of concomitant RRD and RIOP.

AB  - Accurate mapping of fast ice deformation can effectively characterize the rheological behavior of fast ice and subsequently improve sea ice model. This study used the Sentinel-1A descending and ascending orbits data to detect the deformations of fast ice in the Baltic Sea. A method for automatically obtaining fast ice edge line by combining interferometric coherence image and SAR amplitude image was proposed. Then, the deformations of fast ice were detected from different incidence angles with the descending and ascending orbits data. The results showed that the deformations in radar line of sight obtained from the descending and ascending orbits data were 38cm and 37cm respectively within the fast ice region of 960km(2) in the study area. The continuous strong southwest wind was the principal reason for the deformation, and the deformation direction was dominated by east to west. Moreover, the inner fast ice kept stable and its deformation was smaller due to the protection of outer consolidated ice. The experimental results in this paper showed that the deformation trend and characteristics of fast ice can be better understood by InSAR technology with multi-orbits SAR data.

TI  - Crop Yield Estimation in the Canadian Prairies Using Terra/MODIS-Derived Crop Metrics
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluated the utility of Terra/MODIS-derived crop metrics for yield estimation across the Canadian Prairies. This study was undertaken at the Census Agriculture Region (CAR) and the Rural Municipality (RM) of the province of Saskatchewan, in three prairie agro-climate zones. We compared MODIS-derived vegetation indices, gross primary productivity (GPP), and net primary productivity (NPP) to the known yields for barley, canola, and spring wheat. Multiple linear regressions were used to assess the relationships between the metrics and yield at the CAR and RM levels for the years 2000 to 2016. Models were evaluated using a leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) approach. Results showed that vegetation indices at crop peak growing stages were better predictors of yield than GPP or NPP, and EVI2 was better than NDVI. Using seasonal maximum EVI2, CAR-level crop yields can be estimated with a relative root-mean-square-error (RRMSE) of 14-20% and a Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE) of 0.53-0.70, though the exact relationship varies by crop type and agro-climate zone. LOOCV showed the stability of the models across different years, although interannual fluctuations of estimation accuracy were observed. Assessments using RM-level yields showed slightly reduced accuracy, with NSE of 0.37-0.66, and RRMSE of 18-28%. The best performing models were used to map annual crop yields at the Soil Landscapes of Canada (SLC) polygon level. The results indicated that the models could perform well at both spatial scales, and thus, could be used to disaggregate coarse resolution crop yields to finer spatial resolutions using MODIS data.

TI  - Glacial changes in the Gangdise Mountains from 1970 to 2016
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the revised First Chinese Glacier Inventory (FCGI), the Second Chinese Glacier Inventory (SCGI) and Landsat OLI images for 2015-2016, we analyzed the spatial-temporal variation characteristics of glaciers in the Gangdise Mountains from 1970 to 2016. The results showed that there were 3953 glaciers with a total area of 1306.45 km(2) and ice volume of similar to 58.16 km(3) in the Gangdise Mountains in 2015-2016. Glaciers with sizes of 0.1-5 km(2) and <0.5 km(2) accounted for the largest area and the most amounts of glaciers in the Gangdise Mountains, respectively. Over the past five decades, the area of glaciers in the Gangdise Mountains decreased by 854.05 km(2) (-1.09%a(-1)), accounting for 39.53% of the total glacier area in 1970. The increase in temperature during the ablation period was the most important cause for glacier retreat. Compared to other mountains in western China, the Gangdise Mountains have experienced the strongest glacial retreat, and the rate of recession has increased in recent years. The decrease of glacier area was mainly concentrated at elevations of 5600-6100 m, and no change in glacier area was observed at elevations above 6500 m. The number and area of glaciers decreased in all orientations in the Gangdise Mountains except for south- and southeast-oriented glaciers. Among them, north-oriented glaciers suffered the largest loss of glacier area, while glacier retreat saw the fastest in northwest-oriented glaciers. The rate of glacier retreat increased from west to east in the Gangdise Mountains. The relative rate of glacier area change was the highest in the eastern section of the Gangdise Mountains (-1.72%a(-1)), followed by the middle section (-1.67%a(-1)) and the western section (-0.83%a(-1)).

TI  - Volcanic Ash Cloud Diffusion From Remote Sensing Image Using LSTM-CA Method
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring of volcanic ash cloud is conducive to the disaster prevention and mitigation and public safety. To tackle of large amount and various types of data and continuous changes of volcanic ash cloud monitoring, in this paper, a new long short term memory (LSTM) and cellular automaton (CA) (i.e., LSTM-CA) collaborative computing method for volcanic ash cloud diffusion is proposed via neural networks. Based on diffusion characteristics of volcanic ash cloud, a CA model of volcanic ash cloud in the three-dimensional spaces was first constructed. And then the constantly changing sequential characteristics of volcanic ash cloud was learned by LSTM neural network and further treated as the evolution rule of the CA diffusion model of volcanic ash cloud in three-dimensional space. Next, simulation experiments and analysis were conducted in terms of wind direction, wind speed, step size and the number of cell. Finally, the proposed LSTM-CA collaborative computing method was tested and verified in the actual Etna ash cloud diffusion case. The experimental results show that: (1) in the two-dimensional space, the proposed LSTM-CA method can obtain a good initial simulation effect of volcanic ash cloud diffusion, and the total accuracy of volcanic ash cloud identification reached 96.1%; (2) in the three-dimensional space, the proposed LSTM-CA method can exact simulate the horizontal and vertical diffusion trends of volcanic ash cloud; (3) the proposed LSTM-CA method can significantly reduce the modeling complexity of volcanic ash cloud and improve the calculation efficiency of spatiotemporal data. It seems to provide a new idea to identify and simulate the volcanic ash cloud in complex environments.

TI  - Development and evaluation of a new merged sea surface height product from multi-satellite altimeters
T2  - CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite altimetry data has been a backbone of global oceanography research since the early 1990s. Because a satellite altimeter measures sea surface height (SSH) at the nadir point, it produces a one-dimensional profile of SSH. Along the track, an altimeter provides SSH sampling at an interval of about 7 km. However, the distance between adjacent tracks is larger than 100 km, and satellites have repeat times of 10-30 d. These characteristics limit the usefulness of altimetry data from a single satellite for scientific analysis of the space-time structure of ocean circulation. During the past two decades, there have usually been three to four altimeters in orbit at any one time. Mapping along-track measurements from multiple altimeters onto a uniform grid has been a major research theme. A popular merged data product, known as AVISO. has been developed and extensively applied to a wide variety of ocean research.One of key properties of a merged data product is its effective resolution. The effective resolution represents the minimum spatial size of an eddy or other mesoscale circulation that the data product can resolve. The AVISO data product has an effective resolution of 300 km in equatorial regions to 100 km in high latitudes. Nowadays, there are more than five satellite altimeters in orbit. including the Chinese HY-2A that was launched in 2011. and thus the density of the tracks has been much improved. However. the effective resolution of the AVISO data product has not increased accordingly.Effective resolution of mapped data is closely related to the background error correlation coefficient scale in the mapping scheme. The effective resolution is no more than twice the correlation coefficient scale even when the amount of satellite altimeter is more than 5. As the background fields contains the correct large scale information the meso-scale or small-scale information in the background error will play a dominant role and the background error correlation coefficient scale becomes even smaller. Therefore. The option of background determines the effective resolution of mapped data. The above theory is the basement of our new proposed mapping scheme, which effectively improved the effective resolution. Another key technique is how to deal with the observation errors: to reduce time-smoothing by introducing evolution errors in observation errors and effectively mapping multi-mission satellite altimeters from different times.In this study, a new mapping system has been developed, aiming to maximize the effective resolution of the mapped data product. The formulation is based on a variational method and optimal estimation theory. The system has been applied to the South China Sea region. The product uses a regular grid with spacing of 0.08 degrees, in comparison to 0.25 degrees for AVISO. The product merged data from five satellites, Sentinel-3A, Jason-3, Cryosat-2, Saral/AltiKa and HY-2A. Systematic evaluations show that this new product has an effective resolution of 125 km, whereas the AVISO data product an effective resolution of 240 km for the same region. The accuracy is also significantly improved.The new proposed mapping scheme is important in the application of satellite altimeters on the study of meso-scale ocean eddies. In addition, the option of background fields and the processing method of observation error are strictly general and can be used in other schemes of high-resolution data mapping.

TI  - A Disease Index for Efficiently Detecting Wheat Fusarium Head Blight Using Sentinel-2 Multispectral Imagery
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid, non-destructive detection of wheat Fusarium head blight (FHB) is an important tool for disease control. Red-edge (RE) is a prominent spectral feature for determining crop conditions with the potential to enhance the accuracy of monitoring FHB regionally. This study explored the potential of RE for FHB monitoring based on Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) data. The novel red-edge head blight index (REHBI) was developed to detect FHB at a regional scale. Hyperspectral data at the canopy scale was integrated to simulate Sentinel-2 multispectral reflectance using the relative spectral response (RSR) function of the sensor. Then, many differential and ratio combinations of Sentinel-2 bands that were sensitive to FHB severity were selected. REHBI was established based on these basic vegetation indexes (VIs), and the model developed from REHBI performed best in monitoring FHB severity (R-2 = 0.82, RMSE = 10.1). Additionally, the infected canopies with disease index (DI) values between 10 and 50 were classified as slightly diseased canopies. Ordinary least square (OLS) was used to test the performance of REHBI and two conventional VIs, i.e., OSAVI and RDVI, in monitoring slightly diseased canopies; REHBI outperformed these alternatives (R-2 = 0.69, RMSE = 3.6). To approximate real agricultural conditions, Poisson noise was added to the simulated Sentinel-2 multispectral data and generalized performance of VIs was evaluated again; REHBI still had the highest R-2 and lowest RMSE values (0.74 and 12.6, respectively). Finally, to validate REHBI's ability to detect FHB infection in agricultural production, it was applied to monitoring FHB in the wheat planting areas of Changfeng and Dingyuan counties from Sentinel-2 imagery. Generally, REHBI performed better in disease monitoring than OSAVI and RDVI. The overall accuracy was up to 78.6%, and the kappa coefficient was 0.51. Experimental results demonstrate that REHBI can be used to monitor FHB.

TI  - Feasibility of Burned Area Mapping Based on ICESAT-2 Photon Counting Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately mapping burned areas is crucial for the analysis of carbon emissions and wildfire risk as well as understanding the effects of climate change on forest structure. Burned areas have predominantly been mapped using optical remote sensing images. However, the structural changes due to fire also offer opportunities for mapping burned areas using three-dimensional (3D) datasets such as Light detection and ranging (LiDAR). This study focuses on the feasibility of using photon counting LiDAR data from National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) mission to differentiate vegetation structure in burned and unburned areas and ultimately classify burned areas along mapped ground tracks. The ICESat-2 mission (launched in September 2018) provides datasets such as geolocated photon data (ATL03), which comprises precise latitude, longitude and elevation of each point where a photon interacts with land surface, and derivative products such as the Land Water Vegetation Elevation product (ATL08), which comprises estimated terrain and canopy height information. For analysis, 24 metrics such as the average, median and standard deviation of canopy height were derived from ATL08 data over forests burned by recent fires in 2018 in northern California and western New Mexico. A reference burn map was derived from Sentinel-2 images based on the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) index. A landcover map based on Sentinel-2 images was employed to remove non-forest classes. Landsat 8 based dNBR image and landcover map were also used for comparison. Next, ICESat-2 data of forest samples were classified into burned and unburned ATL08 100-m segments by both Random Forest classification and logistic regression. Both Sentinel-2 derived and Landsat 8 derived ATL08 samples got high classification accuracy, 83% versus 76%. Moreover, the resulting classification accuracy by Random Forest and logistic regression reached 83% and 74%, respectively. Among the 24 ICESat-2 metrics, apparent surface reflectance and the number of canopy photons were the most important. Furthermore, burn severity of each ATL08 segment was also estimated with Random Forest regression. R-2 of predicted burn severity to observed dNBR is 0.61 with significant linear relationship and moderate correlation (r = 0.78). Overall, the reasonably high accuracies achieved in this study demonstrate the feasibility of employing ICESat-2 data in burned forest classification, opening avenues for improved estimation of burned biomass and carbon emissions from a 3D perspective.

TI  - Calibration of a multichannel millimeter wave radiometer of FY-4M based on the real-time brightness temperature along the lunar equator
T2  - CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE
M3  - Article
AB  - Chinese FY-4M is a new-generation geosynchronous satellite, which will be launched in the near future. It is equipped with multichannel millimeter wave radiometers, which operate in the range of 50-430 GHz. This satellite will increase revisit time and significantly improve the monitoring and weather variation forecasting capabilities. Calibration is an important issue for the quantitative analysis and application of brightness temperature observations. Calibration is first conducted in a thermal/vacuum chamber prior to the launch. A hot target onboard the satellite is used to provide relative irradiance for onboard calibration, and the cold cosmos is used as a cold target. However, complicated space conditions may result in many uncertainties and instabilities during calibration. A new method is required to evaluate the performance of the instruments during long-term operation. Because of the non-existence of atmospheric and other environmental interferences, the lunar surface maintains its physical and chemical stability. Thus, it is an ideal source for thermal calibration.The earliest ground-based observation of thermal microwave emission of the Moon dates back to the early 1940s. At that time, the temperature profile and dielectric constant of the lunar surface had not been studied in detail. Thus, interpreting the observed microwave brightness temperature was difficult. In recent years, many studies of the lunar surface have been performed owing to the advances in satellite-borne remote sensing programs. The Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment onboard the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter investigated the global solar reflectance and mid-IR irradiance. These infrared measurements contribute to the quantitative description of the thermophysical properties of the superficial lunar regolith media. Chinese probes, Chang'e-1 and Chang'e-2, carried four-channel microwave radiometers to observe the microwave thermal emission of the lunar regolith media, which may provide information on superficial dielectric properties of the lunar surface. These advances created a foundation for the millimeter channel observation of the lunar surface.In this study, a real-time model of the sub-solar position and total irradiance of the lunar surface was developed. The altitude of FY-4M is 35800 km. The distance between the Moon and the Earth is between 363400 km (perigee) and 405400 km (apogee). This large distance enables nadir observation from the FY-4M radiometer toward the center region of the lunar equator. The observation beam angle ranges from 0.097 degrees to 0.027 degrees. The diameters of the observation regions at different channels are 750 km (55 GHz), 480 km (89, 118 GHz), 300 km (166, 183 GHz), and 210 km (425 GHz) at apogee. Based on the surface albedo derived from the Clementine data and the constrained thermophysical parameters of the lunar regolith media obtained from the Diviner infrared brightness temperature, the one-dimensional thermal transfer equation is solved to obtain the physical temperature profile of the lunar regolith media. Using the 37-GHz brightness temperature from Chang'e-2 observations, the loss tangent of the regolith media is inverted. Using the fluctuation dissipation theorem, the brightness temperature of the lunar surface in FY-4M millimeter channels is calculated. The thermophysical profile of the regolith can be validated using the Diviner infrared brightness temperature data. The calculated temperature at a depth of 1.3 m is consistent with the measurements obtained in the Apollo heat flow experiment. The surface temperature and millimeter brightness temperature on the lunar equator (0 degrees N, 0 degrees E) during the entire year of 2010 are simulated. The peak value of the brightness temperature is attained after that of the surface physical temperature peak value. In the low frequency channel, the penetration depth increases, its peak value is typically small, and the peak appears later. This study thus presents an effective model for FY-4M calibration and data analysis.

AB  - Mapping the qhasi-circhlar vegetation patches (QVPs) is the most basic and necessary step for sthdying the mechanisms of vegetation pattern formation, spontaneohs plant colonization, and ecosystem maintenance and degradation in the Yellow River Delta (YRD), China. It is well known that the hse of mhlti-seasonal image data may be expected to obtain better reshlts for mapping the vegetation than the hse of a single date image becahse of vegetation phenology and the contrasts between vegetation and backgrohnd. Althohgh the spring GF-1 images have been hsed to detect the QVPs, the potential of mhlti-seasonal fhsed GF-1 mhltispectral images for mapping the QVPs has not been well explored. With the objective to fill this gap, we evalhated the potential of the winter, spring, shmmer, and ahthmn fhsed GF-1 mhltispectral images for mapping the QVPs with object-based example-based feathre extraction with shpport vector machine classification method to hnderstand the seasonal effect on the QVPs mapping acchracy. The reshlts showed that classification based on the spring data acqhired on 6 April 2014 (OA=99.8%, kappa=0.988) was more acchrate than the classification base on the other tree seasonal images. The lowest classification acchracy was obtained from the ahthmn data acqhired on September 21 2015 (OA=93.1%, kappa=0.885). We recommend the he spring and winter images to map the QVPs in the YRD. In the fhthre, more machine learning techniqhes shohld be applied to classify and compare the potential of the different seasonal fhsed GF-1 mhltispectral images for mapping the QVPs.

TI  - An improved combined vegetation difference index and burn scar index approach for mapping cropland burned areas using combined data from Landsat 8 multispectral and thermal infrared bands
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate extraction of agricultural burned area is essential for fire-induced air quality models and assessments of agricultural grain loss and wildfire disasters. The present study provides an improved approach for mapping uncontrolled cropland burned areas, which involves pre-classification using a difference vegetation index model for various agricultural land scenarios. Land surface temperature was analysed in burned and unburned areas and integrated into a previous burn scar index (BSI) model, and multispectral and thermal infrared information were combined to create a new temperature BSI (TBSI) to remove background noise. The TBSI model was applied to a winter wheat agricultural region in the Haihe River Basin in northern China. The extracted burned areas were validated using Gaofen-1 satellite data and compared with those produced by the previous BSI model. The producer and user accuracy of the new TBSI model were measured at 92.42 and 95.31% respectively, with an overall kappa value of 0.92, whereas those of the previous BSI model were 83.33, 87.30% and 0.86. The results indicate that the new method is more appropriate for mapping uncontrolled winter wheat burned area. Potential applications of this research include trace gas emission models, agricultural fire management and agricultural wildfire disaster assessment.

TI  - A novel fire index-based burned area change detection approach using Landsat-8 OLI data
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Change detection from multi-temporal remote sensing images is an effective way to identify the burned areas after forest fires. However, the complex image scenario and the similar spectral signatures in multispectral bands may lead to many false positive errors, which make it difficult to exact the burned areas accurately. In this paper, a novel-burned area change detection approach is proposed. It is designed based on a new Normalized Burn Ratio-SWIR (NBRSWIR) index and an automatic thresholding algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated on three Landsat-8 data sets presenting various fire disaster events worldwide. Compared to eight index-based detection methods that developed in the literature, the proposed approach has the best performance in terms of class separability (2.49, 1.74 and 2.06) and accuracy (98.93%, 98.57% and 99.51%) in detecting the burned areas. Simultaneously, it can also better suppress the complex irrelevant changes in the background.

TI  - Long Term Stability Monitoring of Aqua MODIS Thermal Emissive Bands through Radiative Transfer Modeling
T2  - EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEMS XXV
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXV
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Aqua has been in operation providing continuous global observations for science research and applications since 2002. The long-term stability of thermal emissive bands (TEBs) of Aqua MODIS was monitored through inter-comparisons with measurements by hyperspectral infrared sensors, such as AIRS on Aqua and IASI on MetOp satellite, or through long term vicarious monitoring over cold targets, such as DomeC and deep convective clouds (DCC). In this paper, a radiative transfer modeling-based simulation model using Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM) is developed to perform the long- term monitoring of the stability of TEBs of Aqua MODIS. CRTM is a fast-radiative transfer model for calculations of radiances for satellite infrared radiometers and is able to output infrared radiance and brightness temperature at spectral bands of MODIS. Long term European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) global atmospheric reanalysis data, such as temperature and humidity profiles, are used as inputs to the CRTM simulation. By confining the area of interest to be over low to middle latitude ocean, the long-term stabilities of selected Aqua MODIS TEBs are monitored through Observation-Background (O-B) brightness temperature (BT) bias between MODIS measurements and BT retrieval from CRTM simulation. The consistency and relative stability between Aqua MODIS and ECMWF reanalysis data for surface channels of MODIS are evaluated. In addition, the radiative transfer modeling with CRTM enables us to evaluate the impacts of long term variation of global CO2 distribution on the O-B BT biases for CO2 channels of Aqua MODIS through comparison of simulations with constant or long term variable CO2 as inputs. The O-B analysis with RTM show that Aqua MODIS surface channels are all radiometrically stable with yearly BT bias drift less than 0.004K/year for B20, B22, B23 and similar to 0.01K/year for B31 and B32. The CO2 absorption channels of Aqua MODIS, e.g. B33-B36, are stable with BT bias drift < 0.005K/year.

AB  - An Mw 6.6 earthquake struck the eastern Iburi area of Hokkaido, Japan, on September 6, 2018. Due to the strong shaking, more than 3000 landslides occurred around Atsuma Town and killed 36 people. In this study, two pre-event and one post-event ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 images were used to extract landslides in Abira, Atsuma and Mukawa Towns. The characteristics of landslides were investigated using the backscattering coefficient, the coherence and the slope of elevation. Then the landslides in the target area were extracted by the optimal threshold values. A procedure using both the difference of backscattering coefficient and the difference of coherence was proposed to extract landslides. Finally, the result was verified by comparing with a post-event optical satellite image and a landslide distribution map by the GSI.

TI  - Factors Influencing Activity of Xiwang Road Ground Fissure Based on Time-series Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar and Detection of Land Cover Changes Using Optical Imaging
T2  - SENSORS AND MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, small baseline subsets interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SBAS-InSAR) was used to monitor the surface deformation of an area of 88 km(2) centered on the Xiwang Road ground fissure in Shunyi District, Beijing, to clarify the relationship between the surface deformation and the factors affecting the ground fissure activity. To reduce the errors due to overlap and contraction caused by radar-side looking imaging, we used a combination of ascending and descending orbit data to carry out the inversion of surface deformation in the study area. Thirty-seven images of Sentinel-1 ascending data from May 2017 to May 2020 and 12 images of descending data from December 2018 to December 2019 were selected. We also selected two Landsat 8 OLI images to detect the land cover changes in the study area based on support vector machine (SVM)-supervised classification, so as to examine the effects of human engineering activities on the ground fissure displacement activity. Finally, combining the results of SBAS-InSAR and land cover change detection, we explored in detail the factors affecting the activity of the Xiwang Road ground fissure to provide a scientific basis and technical reference for the prevention and treatment of ground fissures.

T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Heifangtai loess terrace in northwest China is a well-known area to study loess landslides because of its frequent occurrence, various types, and complex trigger factors. The determination of loess landslide type and failure mode is of great significance for the landslide risk assessment, hazard mitigation, and prevention. In this study, ascending and descending Spot-mode TerraSAR-X datasets are employed to analyze the deformation patterns and failure modes of loess landslides in Xinyuan landslide group, Heifangtai terrace, by using multidimensional small baseline subsets (MSBAS) technique. First, the locations of three active landslides are delineated by independent InSAR observations from both ascending and descending TerraSAR-X datasets. Then, two-dimensional deformation rates and time series results in both vertical and horizontal east-west directions of the identified landslides are calculated using MSBAS technique. Finally, the deformation types and failure modes of landslides in the study sites are analyzed by jointly using the two-dimensional deformation rates and time series results, topographic map, remote sensing images, and previous studies on the loess landslide failure modes. With the aid of complementary data including topographic map, remote sensing image, previous studies on the loess landslide failure modes, and field investigations, two-dimensional deformation results derived from ascending and descending SAR images are compatible with three typical failure modes of loess landslide including loess-bedrock planar slide, retrogressive failure, and loess slide. Furthermore, the two-dimensional deformation derived from InSAR technique can give much detailed deformation characteristics and movement of loess landslide.

TI  - Evaluation of net shortwave radiation over China with a regional climate model
T2  - CLIMATE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The regional climate model RegCM version 4.6, developed by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis, was used to simulate the radiation budget over China. Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) satellite data were utilized to evaluate the simulation results based on 4 radiative components: net shortwave (NSW) radiation at the surface of the earth and top of the atmosphere (TOA) under all-sky and clear-sky conditions. The performance of the model for low-value areas of NSW was superior to that for high-value areas. NSW at the surface and TOA under all-sky conditions was significantly underestimated; the spatial distribution of the bias was negative in the north and positive in the south, bounded by 25 degrees N for the annual and seasonal averaged difference maps. Compared with the all-sky condition, the simulation effect under clear-sky conditions was significantly better, which indicates that the cloud fraction is the key factor affecting the accuracy of the simulation. In particular, the bias of the TOA NSW under the clear-sky condition was <+/- 10 W m(-2) in the eastern areas. The performance of the model was better over the eastern monsoon region in winter and autumn for surface NSW under clear-sky conditions, which may be related to different levels of air pollution during each season. Among the 3 areas, the regional average biases overall were largest (negative) over the Qinghai-Tibet alpine region and smallest over the eastern monsoon region.

TI  - Large-Scale Crop Mapping From Multisource Remote Sensing Images in Google Earth Engine
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale crop mapping is vitally important to agriculrural monitoring and management. However, traditional methods cannot well meet the needs of large-scale applications. Therefore, this study proposed a method for large-scale crop mapping based on multisource remote sensing images. To be specific, 1) harmonic analysis was conducted on normalized difference vegetation index time-series derived from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer images and synthetic aperture radar backscattering coefficient time-series derived from Sentinel-1 data, respectively, extracting harmonic-derived phenological features and harmonic-derived backscattering features, and then combined with spectral features from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 images to construct the final multisource feature set for crop classification; 2) it employed prior constraints of crop dominance and cropland distribution to reduce misclassifications in large scale crop mapping; and 3) the whole process was conducted on the Google Earth Engine online platform, which can reduce the computational burdens caused by the spatiotemporal data. In the experimental study, we evaluated three crops, including wheat, rapeseed, and corn in Qinhai in 2018, based on the classification and regression tree classifier. The results show that the Jeffries-Matusita distances between crop samples are close to 2, and the overall accuracy is 84.25%. Furthermore, this study found that the distribution of the crops in Qinghai is associated with climate, topography, and cultivation habits.

AB  - With the development of multi-sensor imaging technology, constructing a multi-branch network model has become an important requirement for fusion decision. In the literature, many two-branch networks are proposed to interpret multi-sensor data and also get the satisfactory results. In this paper, we divide these models into two types and study them by mining changes in data and features. The main method used is analysis the correlation between the features of the same layer from the first branch and the second branch. The task of dual-source image classification serves as a means of experimentation. When the classification network is trained, the features of each layer are extracted for experimental analysis. Extensive experiments and analysis on the dataset IEEE_grss_dfc_2017 show that the analysis is meaning-ful. It is found that the correlation of the features from the low level to the high level is more and more consistent, a quantitative analysis is given in this paper.

AB  - ContextHuoxueJiangtang decoction (ZY) is a traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of diabetes.ObjectiveThe protective effect of ZY on renal injury in diabetic nephropathy rats was investigated in this study.Materials and methodsFifty 4-week-old SPF Wistar male rats were selected to construct diabetic nephropathy model rats (DN) group by continuous high-fat feeding for 4 weeks, followed by a tail vein injection of 30 mg/kg streptozotocin for 1 week. The experimental rats were divided into six groups of 10 rats: normal (control), DN, DN + ZY, DN + metformin, DN + metformin + ZY, and DN + metformin + captopril (positive control) groups. Among the groups, 6.25 g/kg ZY, 250 mg/kg metformin, and 17.5 mg/kg captopril were given to the rats by gavage once a day for 16 weeks. Blood glucose, dietary behaviour, biochemical indicators, and gene expression changes were measured in each group.ResultsMetformin + ZY treatment significantly lowered blood glucose, water intake, urine total protein, urine albumin, urine volume, serum triglyceride, and serum cholesterol levels in the DN group. The pathological changes of kidney tissue showed that the DN + metformin + ZY group had a protective effect on kidney tissue damage. And ZY and metformin + ZY treatments repaired the expression of genes in the DN group.Discussion and conclusionThe ZY and metformin combined treatment showed a clear therapeutic effect on kidney damage in DN. This study provides a potential mechanism for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy with ZY combined with metformin.

AB  - Mesoscale eddies are circular flowing currents that can retain and transport salt, heat, and nutrients all around the ocean. Mesoscale eddies can be detected on remote sensing images, i.e., sea surface height (SSH) images, sea surface temperature (SST) images, chlorophyll concentration images, etc. Most existing automatic eddy detection algorithms are developed based on one kind of remote sensing data. There is a lack of an automatic eddy detection algorithm that can make full use of multi-source remote sensing data to ensure the accuracy and efficiency of eddy detection. The paper proposes a multi-modal U-Net model, a deep neural network-based framework for eddy detection from multi-source remote sensing images. Compared with the previous eddy detection methods, the newly proposed method improves the accuracy and efficiency of eddy detection by using fusion data of SSH and SST.

TI  - A constrained small baseline subsets (CSBAS) InSAR technique for multiple subsets
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - During the Small Baseline Subsets (SBAS) InSAR processing, the interferograms are often separated into multiple independent subsets, which results inevitably in a rank deficiency problem. Singular value decomposition (SVD) or linear interpolation based least squares (LS) is generally adopted, which causes systematically biased deformation estimation. Therefore, we presents a constrained SBAS method, which takes the period of the time series deformation detected by frequency-spectrum analysis as constraints to solve the rank deficiency problem. This method is illustrated with simulated data in detail. The results of the SVD, LS and our methods are in agreement with the true value in the first subset, but biased in the second subset with the magnitudes of 17.39 cm, 15.90 cm and -0.53 cm, respectively, where our method is the best one. Lastly, the new method is successfully verified using the real SAR data over Southern California from 2003 to 2006. The averaged STD of the differences between our method and GPS observations in four stations are 5.0, 3.62, 6.31 and 5.87 mm/year, respectively, which is much better than those from SVD and LS methods. This outcome confirms the validity of the newly proposed method.

AB  - High-resolution spaceborne P-band SAR has broad prospects in the future due to its penetrating capabilities. However, conventional imaging methods are no longer suitable for high-resolution P-band SAR because of ionospheric effects including dispersion and scintillation. In this paper, an imaging compensation scheme with modified Chirp Scaling (CS) has been proposed, correcting ionospheric effects by a new spectrum segmentation method and Phase Gradient Autofocus (PGA). The effectiveness of the proposed compensation scheme for high-resolution P-band SAR has been verified by point target and scene simulation with ALOS-PALSAR data.

TI  - SAR Image Restoration From Spectrum Aliasing by Deep Learning
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The diversity and the space-variance of the spectrum-aliasing effects in SAR bring challenges to the available model-driven restoration methods. In this paper, a hybrid data-driven and model-driven deep learning scheme is innovatively proposed to deal with this problem. In this scheme, the SAR image restoration is realize via a U-shaped deep neural network (DNN). Meanwhile, the model of the SAR echo data is used to generate the training data to learn the weighting parameters of the network. The DNN in this method is designed to suit the SAR spectrum-aliasing application. Due to the general SAR echo mathematical model is employed for training data construction, the spectrum aliasing features in different SAR systems can be accommodated and learned. Hence, the proposed method can work well for various SAR configurations. Simulation results using the real Radarsat-1 data as well as the synthetic data prove the effectiveness as well as the robustness of the proposed method.

T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Yellow River delta (YRD) is regarded as one of the most rapid sedimentation deltas in the worldwide and the youngest land in China. Existing studies more focused on evolutions of river mouth region, thus provided limited knowledge on the evolution of the entire YRD and its corresponding trajectories of shrinkage and expansion. Here, we used 1984-2018 Landsat images and the change detection analysis algorithm to track annual area change trajectories of present YRD with the help of Google Earth Engine cloud platform. Results showed that entire YRD area documented a significantly shrinking trend with slope of -18.5 km(2)/decade (p < 0.05) at the past 35 years. Particularly, this study found muddy coast in northern and southeastern YRD exhibited severely coast erosion with the slopes of -29.3 km(2)/decade (p < 0.01) and -13.1 km(2)/decade (p < 0.01). Their mean coast erosion distance ranged from 2 to 4 km in 1984-2018. Area changes in the two regions contributed more to shrinkage of entire YRD. Besides, the expanding rate of current river mouth region was gradually slowdown due to decreases of sediment discharges, although area of new river mouth was still seemingly expanding. The significantly shrinking phenomena of the present YRD should be paid more attention.

TI  - Soil Moisture Index Model for Retrieving Soil Moisture in Semiarid Regions of China
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - There have been some limitations in acquiring an accurate representation of remotely sensed data-derived soil moisture. Here, we propose a simplified thermal inertia model (STIM). This model requires only the albedo and surface maximum temperature easily obtained from satellite imagery, such as that of the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS). In this study, we defined a soil moisture index (SMI) using the MODIS imagery to obtain a simplified thermal inertia-ratio vegetation index spectral feature space. SMI results from STIM were validated at several locations in the study area of western Inner Mongolia and compared with those from the apparent thermal inertia (ATI) model. Our results showed that our SMI model could explain 71% of the variance in the surface soil moisture, approximately 5% higher than that of the ATI model. In a comparison of field-measured soil moisture data with data simulated using two methods, the SMI and ATI, the SMI showed better retrieval accuracy by lessening the effective error due to the vegetation by 4.2%-10.8%, whereas soil moisture data simulated with ATI showed an effective error of 4.5%-17.0%. The SMI model was also used to map soil moisture; a relative root-mean-square error of 7.67% was recorded for the region, implying the ability of the model to map soil moisture over large areas. Here, the proposed SMI model was proven to be more suitable for estimating soil moisture in locations in which the vegetation index values ranged from 0 to 3. Thus, the proposed SMI model provides a new approach using remote sensing thermal inertia methods to quantify soil moisture at the regional scale.

TI  - A Framework for Correcting Ionospheric Artifacts and Atmospheric Effects to Generate High Accuracy InSAR DEM
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Repeat-pass interferometric synthetic aperture radar is a well-established technology for generating digital elevation models (DEMs). However, the interferogram usually has ionospheric and atmospheric effects, which reduces the DEM accuracy. In this paper, by introducing dual-polarization interferograms, a new approach is proposed to mitigate the ionospheric and atmospheric errors of the interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data. The proposed method consists of two parts. First, the range split-spectrum method is applied to compensate for the ionospheric artifacts. Then, a multiresolution correlation analysis between dual-polarization InSAR interferograms is employed to remove the identical atmospheric phases, since the atmospheric delay is independent of SAR polarizations. The corrected interferogram can be used for DEM extraction. Validation experiments, using the ALOS-1 PALSAR interferometric pairs covering the study areas in Hawaii and Lebanon of the U.S.A., show that the proposed method can effectively reduce the ionospheric artifacts and atmospheric effects, and improve the accuracy of the InSAR-derived DEMs by 64.9% and 31.7% for the study sites in Hawaii and Lebanon of the U.S.A., respectively, compared with traditional correction methods. In addition, the assessment of the resulting DEMs also includes comparisons with the high-precision Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) altimetry data. The results show that the selection of reference data will not affect the validation results.

TI  - Temporal Anomalies in Burned Area Trends: Satellite Estimations of the Amazonian 2019 Fire Crisis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forests are known for hosting about half of the global biodiversity, and therefore are considered to be a fundamental part of the Earth System. However, in the last decades, the anthropogenic pressure over these areas has been continuously increasing, mostly linked to agricultural expansion. This has created great international concern, which has crossed the limits of national policies. A clear example was the last crisis suffered this year (2019) in the Amazon, and in general, in tropical South America (SA), due to the increasing fire activity in the region, which is strongly linked to deforestation and forest degradation. International media extensively informed the world about fire activity based upon active fire data, which provided quick but incomplete information about the actual fire-affected areas. This short paper compares fire occurrence estimations derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data of active fires and from burned area products for the first 10 months of 2019 in SA. Results show a significant increase in fire activity over the full-time series (2001-2018) in Bolivia, Paraguay and Venezuela, while Brazil shows a much higher BA than in 2018, but with values around the average burned area of the whole time series.

TI  - A spatio-temporal active-fire clustering approach for global burned area mapping at 250 m from MODIS data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the generation of a global burned area mapping algorithm using MODIS hotspots and near-infrared reflectance within ESA's Fire_cci project. The algorithm is based on a hybrid approach that combines MODIS highest resolution (250 m) near-infrared band and active fire information from thermal channels. The burned area is detected in two phases. In the first step, pixels with a high probability of being burned are selected in order to reduce commission errors. To do that, spatio-temporal active-fire clusters are created to determine adaptive thresholds. Finally, a contextual growing approach is applied from those pixels to the neighbouring area to fully detect the burned patch and reduce omission errors. The algorithm was used to obtain a time series of global burned area dataset (named FireCC151), covering the 2001-2018 period. Validation based on 1200 sampled sites covering the period from 2003 to 2014 showed an average omission and commission errors of 67.1% and 54.4%. When using longer validation periods, the errors were found smaller (54.5% omission and 25.7% commission for the additional 1000 African sampled sites), which indicates that the product is negatively influenced by temporal reporting accuracy. The inter-comparison carried out with previous Fire_cci versions (FireCC141 and FireCC150), and NASA's standard burned area product (MCD64A1 c6) showed consistent spatial and temporal patterns. However, the new algorithm estimated an average BA of 4.63 Mkm(2), with a maximum of 5.19 Mkm(2) (2004) and a minimum of 3.94 Mkm(2) (in 2001), increasing current burned area estimations. Besides, the new product was found more sensitive to detect smaller burned patches. This new product, called FireCC151, is publicly available at: http://cci.esa.int/data, last accessed on September 2019.

TI  - ATMOSPHERIC GRAVITY WAVES AMONG OTHER PHYSICAL MECHANISMS OF SEISMIC-IONOSPHERIC COUPLING
T2  - SPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-KOSMICNA NAUKA I TEHNOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a comparison of several basic mechanisms of influence on the ionosphere from below discussed in the literature: the propagation of low-frequency electromagnetic radiation; the short circuits of electric currents through the ionosphere; the penetration of neutral atmosphere waves. It is shown that atmospheric gravity waves (GW) are the most likely candidate for the role of a carrier of seismic-ionospheric interaction, which allows one to explain (i) the transport of significant energy fluxes into the ionosphere, (ii) the weak dependence of the intensity of ionospheric disturbance on the magnitude of the earthquake, (iii) the shift of ionospheric disturbances per thousand kilometers horizontally relative to the earthquake; (iv) and the generation of an ionospheric electromagnetic response. A detailed review of the theoretical and experimental data on GW is given. Simple analytical expressions are written that allow one to calculate the parameters of GW in specific experimental situations. The processes of amplitude amplification and dissipation of GW with height are investigated, the mechanism of generation of electromagnetic perturbations when GW passes the dynamo-layer is described, and the quantitative characteristics of perturbations are determined. The experimental part of the work presents the study of GW global distribution at ionospheric heights according to DE-2 satellite data and statistical analysis of GW relations with earthquakes. The results of the DE-2 are backed up by comparison with the published data from the DEMETER mission.

T2  - IMAGE AND SIGNAL PROCESSING FOR REMOTE SENSING XXVI
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Image and Signal Processing for Remote Sensing XXVI
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Satellite imagery provides information crucial for remote sensing applications. However, the images themselves can suffer from systematic and random artefacts which reduce the utility and accuracy of datasets. In particular, radiometric miscalibration due to temporal variation of the detector response may result in stripe noise. We report a method for suppressing striping in remote sensing images by use of a Fourier filter shaped like a super-Gaussian function. In comparison to both established 'traditional' and deep-learning-based destriping techniques, our method demonstrates superior destriping performance for both remote sensing images with native striping as well as those with stripes added to them. Our method simultaneously meets the three criteria of fidelity, speed and flexibility, enabling an efficient improvement in the radiometric accuracy of images from a wide range of satellite sources.

TI  - Analysis of disease free survival in cutaneous melanoma patients subject to sentinel lymph node biopsy
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Cutaneous melanoma is estimated for 2% of malignant neoplasms occurring in humans. It is characterized by a high level of malignancy and low sensitivity to cytostatic drugs. The incidence of cutaneous melanoma is increasing in Poland. The lymphatic system is the most common route of dissemination of this neoplasm. The appearance of a sentinel node biopsy technique has made it possible to identify patients with a regionally advanced disease. It is a minimally invasive method with a small percentage of complications.Aim: Analysis of disease free survival (DFS) in cutaneous melanoma patients with sentinel lymph node biopsy.Material and methods: The analysis included 222 patients with cutaneous melanoma treated in the Department of Oncological Surgery in 2010-2015, who underwent a sentinel node biopsy. The study group consisted of 136 women and 86 men, the average age of patients was 59 years. Patients were qualified for sentinel node biopsy based on clinical evaluation and ultrasound of regional lymph nodes. The average follow-up was 25.1 months. About 2 hours before surgery, patients received a radioisotope, then lymphoscintigraphy SPECT was performed. Additionally, they were administered the Patent Blue dye in the operating room.Results: The sentinel node was identified in 217 patients (98%), and the average sentinel nodes were 2.25. Twenty-seven patients (12%) had a metastasis in sentinel nodes. In this group, the duration of symptom free survival was significantly shorter. Sentinel node status and age of the patient were independent factors affecting the prognosis of disease free survival.Conclusions: Sentinel node biopsy is a precise method to identify patients with cutaneous melanoma who have metastasis to regional lymph nodes, as well as the most important prognostic factor.

TI  - EYES IN THE SKY, BOOTS ON THE GROUND: ASSESSING SATELLITE- AND GROUND-BASED APPROACHES TO CROP YIELD MEASUREMENT AND ANALYSIS
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the determinants of agricultural productivity requires accurate measurement of crop output and yield. In smallholder production systems across low- and middle-income countries, crop yields have traditionally been assessed based on farmer-reported production and land areas in household/farm surveys, occasionally by objective crop cuts for a sub-section of a farmer's plot, and rarely using full-plot harvests. In parallel, satellite data continue to improve in terms of spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution needed to discern performance on smallholder plots. This study evaluates ground- and satellite-based approaches to estimating crop yields and yield responsiveness to inputs, using data on maize from Eastern Uganda. Using unique, simultaneous ground data on yields based on farmer reporting, sub-plot crop cutting, and full-plot harvests across hundreds of smallholder plots, we document large discrepancies among the ground-based measures, particularly among yields based on farmer-reporting versus sub-plot or full-plot crop cutting. Compared to yield measures based on either farmer-reporting or sub-plot crop cutting, satellite-based yield measures explain as much or more variation in yields based on (gold-standard) full-plot crop cuts. Further, estimates of the association between maize yield and various production factors (e.g., fertilizer, soil quality) are similar across crop cut- and satellite-based yield measures, with the use of the latter at times leading to more significant results due to larger sample sizes. Overall, the results suggest a substantial role for satellite-based yield estimation in measuring and understanding agricultural productivity in the developing world.

Here we present a summary of recent work to extend pixel-level (30 m) maps of corn and soy areas and yields back to 1999 across the entire Corn Belt of the United States. We find consistent performance back in time, as judged by comparison with county level statistics. The approaches presented here can be readily extended to other regions and to incorporate other sensors.

TI  - Sight for Sorghums: Comparisons of Satellite- and Ground-Based Sorghum Yield Estimates in Mali
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The advent of multiple satellite systems capable of resolving smallholder agricultural plots raises possibilities for significant advances in measuring and understanding agricultural productivity in smallholder systems. However, since only imperfect yield data are typically available for model training and validation, assessing the accuracy of satellite-based estimates remains a central challenge. Leveraging a survey experiment in Mali, this study uses plot-level sorghum yield estimates, based on farmer reporting and crop cutting, to construct and evaluate estimates from three satellite-based sensors. Consistent with prior work, the analysis indicates low correlation between the ground-based yield measures (r = 0.33). Satellite greenness, as measured by the growing season peak value of the green chlorophyll vegetation index from Sentinel-2, correlates much more strongly with crop cut (r = 0.48) than with self-reported (r = 0.22) yields. Given the inevitable limitations of ground-based measures, the paper reports the results from the regressions of self-reported, crop cut, and (crop cut-calibrated) satellite sorghum yields. The regression covariates explain more than twice as much variation in calibrated satellite yields (R-2 = 0.25) compared to self-reported or crop cut yields, suggesting that a satellite-based approach anchored in crop cuts can be used to track sorghum yields as well or perhaps better than traditional measures. Finally, the paper gauges the sensitivity of yield predictions to the use of Sentinel-2 versus higher-resolution imagery from Planetscope and DigitalGlobe. All three sensors exhibit similar performance, suggesting little gains from finer resolutions in this system.

T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Cotijuba Island, in Northern Brazil (1 degrees 14.249'S, 48 degrees 32.806'W), has typical characteristics of Amazon lowlands, such as low and smooth topography and the presence of cliffs surrounding its river-estuarine beaches. The beach environment on this island has morphological variations determined by hydrodynamics of the Para River estuary (mesotides and mean annual outflow of 104 m(3)s-1), climatic seasonality in the region, and anthropogenic changes. Thus, it was investigated how coastal morphological changes occur on the beaches of Cotijuba Island at different temporal scales, considering regional seasonality. The polygons methodology was used based on Landsat satellite images taken in 1987, 1998, 2008, and 2017, and on in situ measurements of morphological variations of the beaches in 2018 using topographic profiles taken with a digital level GEOMAX ZDL 700, covering 8.7 km of beaches that are bathed by the Para River estuary. Cotijuba Island seems to have little or no influence from long-term climatic conditions, as the ENSO phenomena. Although climatic influence is evident at short-term temporal scales, it is worth emphasizing that the physiographic features of the beaches, such as the presence of perennial and temporary channels, and of rocky outcrops, also affect morphodynamic changes on the beaches, especially at a small temporal scale.

TI  - Applying Fully Convolutional Architectures for Semantic Segmentation of a Single Tree Species in Urban Environment on High Resolution UAV Optical Imagery
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposes and evaluates five deep fully convolutional networks (FCNs) for the semantic segmentation of a single tree species: SegNet, U-Net, FC-DenseNet, and two DeepLabv3+ variants. The performance of the FCN designs is evaluated experimentally in terms of classification accuracy and computational load. We also verify the benefits of fully connected conditional random fields (CRFs) as a post-processing step to improve the segmentation maps. The analysis is conducted on a set of images captured by an RGB camera aboard a UAV flying over an urban area. The dataset also contains a mask that indicates the occurrence of an endangered species called Dipteryx alata Vogel, also known as cumbaru, taken as the species to be identified. The experimental analysis shows the effectiveness of each design and reports average overall accuracy ranging from 88.9% to 96.7%, an F1-score between 87.0% and 96.1%, and IoU from 77.1% to 92.5%. We also realize that CRF consistently improves the performance, but at a high computational cost.

T2  - HAUTARZT
M3  - Article
AB  - Malignant melanoma is an aggressive skin cancer that originates from cells of the melanocytic lineage and is associated with an invasive growth pattern and early spread. Besides endogenous risk factors such as fair skin type or genetic disposition for the formation of multiple nevi, exposure to ultraviolet light is the most important exogenous risk factor. Treatment of patients with primary tumors includes the complete excision of the primary lesion with appropriate safety margins and in patients with an increased risk of metastasis sentinel lymph node excision. Prognostically significant parameters are the Breslow invasion depth, ulceration of the primary lesion, and sentinel lymph node status. Systemic therapy plays an important role in the adjuvant setting and for inoperable tumors. Depending on the indication and the molecular profile of the tumor tissue, immune checkpoint inhibitors or targeted kinase inhibitors can be used and may result in a significant prolongation of survival times.

AB  - The article discusses the philosophical and methodological aspects of the relationship between learning and creativity with the process of becoming a person as an active creative agent of evolution. The evolutionary mechanisms connecting creative development with the evolution of language and thinking are shown. The role of human creative potential in its development and realisation is indicated. In this study, language is seen as a means for learning and creativity. The basis of the creative activity of consciousness through the mechanism of displaying and vision involved in learning is revealed, which characterizes the possibility of the formation of multidimensional perception and the formation of a creatively full-fledged personality. It is shown how the creative act is maintained at the level of neurophysiological mechanisms developed in the evolutionary process, which makes it possible to use them in the process of learning. The authors argue that the realization of higher creative abilities is characterized by a constant transcendental movement towards renewal in knowledge, through which, as the evolutionary approach of Karl Popper shows, there is a mutual enrichment of both man and the "third world", the world of knowledge. The paper justifies the need to increase the intention to comprehend the new in the learning process that promotes the development of heuristic and creative potential as well as self-educational competencies. The formation of the value aspect in the worldview coupled with the comprehension of new knowledge subsequently leads to self-transcendence as the highest manifestation of a person's creative identity. The actualization of creative development in the learning process today is important in connection with scientific and technological progress that frees a person from routine technical tasks. At the same time, the digitalization of education reveals additional risks in terms of the creative personality formation. The authors conclude that the free creative activity of man is inextricably correlated with the realization of his inner potential and the fulfillment of mission in the general evolutionary process of life.

AB  - The urban heat island (UHI) in Moscow was for the first time studied not only at the ground air level, but also at different heights, depths and on the surface using stationary, radiosonde and satellite data. Long-term dynamics of the UHI intensity in the ground air layer has been estimated since the end of the 19th century both as traditional 'maximal intensity' (the difference between the city centre and rural zone), and as 'average intensity' (the difference between all urban and all rural stations). In recent years they have been 2.0 and 1.0 degrees C, respectively. The quasi-stabilization of both parameters in the second half of the 20th century was probably the result of extensive city growth at that time; the new increase in the UHI intensity seems to be connected with the densification of urban development and heat sources in the last 20 years. The mean daily vertical extension of the UHI in the atmosphere is approximately 300 m. In the upper soil layer (up to 160 cm deep) the maximal UHI intensity was about 1.6-1.7 degrees C half a century ago. The average UHI intensity at the field of the surface temperature in recent years is 2.7 degrees C.

AB  - Data fusion methodologies have been implemented in agricultural applications with different types of sensors. One of the problems in delineating cultivation areas is the mixture of spectral signatures due to the transitions between the types of cultivation, built areas, and other natural covers. In order to improve discrimination and identification of crop types, structure data fusion techniques were evaluated. This article aims at showing the potential of using satellite data from the European Space Agency, both optical and SAR, in order to improve land cover classification of agricultural land located in Mexico. To achieve this, an analysis of the spectral, spatial and textural data was performed. Specifically, two classification algorithms were used and compared. The first is based on vector support machines and the second one on Random Forests. The methodology was applied for the study of 4 types of crops in 2017 in the municipality of Villa de Arriaga located in the state of San Luis Potosi. As final results, maps were obtained with the areas with a kappa greater than 0.80.

TI  - Modeling of Aboveground Biomass with Landsat 8 OLI and Machine Learning in Temperate Forests
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Review
AB  - An accurate estimation of forests' aboveground biomass (AGB) is required because of its relevance to the carbon cycle, and because of its economic and ecological importance. The selection of appropriate variables from satellite information and physical variables is important for precise AGB prediction mapping. Because of the complex relationships for AGB prediction, non-parametric machine-learning techniques represent potentially useful techniques for AGB estimation, but their use and comparison in forest remote-sensing applications is still relatively limited. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the performance of automatic learning techniques, support vector regression (SVR) and random forest (RF), to predict the observed AGB (from 318 permanent sampling plots) from the Landsat 8 Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensor, spectral indexes, texture indexes and physical variables the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico. The result showed that the best SVR model explained 80% of the total variance (root mean square error (RMSE) = 8.20 Mg ha(-1)). The variables that best predicted AGB, in order of importance, were the bands that belong to the region of red and near and middle infrared, and the average temperature. The results show that the SVR technique has a good potential for the estimation of the AGB and that the selection of the model hyperparameters has important implications for optimizing the goodness of fit.

AB  - The present study investigates the microclimatic effect of trees in agroforestry systems in Dodoma region, Tanzania. A pixel-based analysis of Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Tree Canopy Cover (TCC) was performed on aerial imagery obtained with an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and on satellite data. UAV orthomosaic maps and satellite scenes were elaborated with a suite of Geographical Information Systems and the resulting data were statistically analyzed through linear regression, the Kruskall-Wallis test and the Dunn test. Results showed that the TCC of the surveyed areas was 5,1%, and a significant decrease in LST of 1,32 degrees C (p<0,01) was only found in areas with the highest TCC, during the late dry season. From these preliminary analyses, we suggest that a threshold of 10% TCC should be reached to have an ameliorated microclimate, in terms of temperature, in this agroecological zone. Considering the average plant phenotype characteristic to the area, it corresponds to a tree density of 50 trees per hectare.

AB  - ESA initiated in 2018 an architectural design study to prepare the development of the next generation of the optical component of the current Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 observation functions i.e. Sentinel-3 without the SAR altimeter and related payloads. The aim of this activity was to analyse and trade-off different architectural options for the next-generation of the Copernicus Space Component optical imaging missions, with an implementation in the 2032-time horizon. A holistic approach was taken to assess architectural option to secure the respective observation capabilities in future, not only extrapolating the current scenario, but to openly assess e.g. the merging of observation functions of different instruments as well as to consider potential data flows from third part missions and service providers, institutional as well as commercial. The outcome of the analysis, taking technological as well as programmatic aspects into account, resulted in the conclusion that Sentinel-2 MSI NG as well as Sentinel-3 OLCI NG together with SLSTR NG on the same platform, are most efficiently implemented as free flyers, with dedicated instruments. The data flow of these two missions will be ideally supplemented by the Land Surface Temperature Mission (LSTM) and the Hyperspectral Mission (CHIME), which are going to be implemented in the frame of the High Priority Candidate Missions (HPCMs) of Copernicus. Those operational data flows, building the backbone of the operational services, can benefit significantly by including the data flows of reliable sources e.g. as from the Landsat series of satellites. The needs for very high resolution (VHR) imaging data, can best be served by data from third party missions, as currently implemented in the Copernicus framework; a Sentinel VHR mission is currently not baselined.

T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Solanum mauritianum is a highly destructive and resourceful plant invader, resulting in severe economic and ecological damage. Detecting and mapping the spatial distribution of S. mauritianum is a priority for effective management of commercial forest plantations. Therefore, image texture computed from a 2 m WorldView-2 image with sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis (SPLS-DA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) were developed and applied to detect and map co-occurring S. mauritianum within a commercial forest plantation. The results indicated that SPLS-DA successfully performed simultaneous variable selection and dimension reduction to yield an overall classification accuracy of 77%. In contrast, the PLS-DA model in conjunction with variable importance in the projection (VIP) yielded an overall classification accuracy of 67%. The most significant texture parameters selected by the SPLS-DA model were correlation, homogeneity and second moment, which were predominantly computed from the red, red edge and NIR bands. Overall, this study validates the potential of image texture integrated with SPLS-DA to effectively detect and map co-occurring S. mauritianum in a commercial forest plantation.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - International Conference on Geomatics in Civil Engineering (ICGCE)
CL  - Roorkee, INDIA
AB  - Groundwater, which is in aquifers below the surface of the Earth, is one of the most important natural resources. Due to the increased population, drought, improper irrigation practices, and pollution, depletion of groundwater takes place more rapidly. With the advent of remote sensing data and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and integrating SWAT with MODFLOW model, estimation of groundwater recharge became much easier. The HRU's in the SWAT model are exchanged with MODFLOW cells by using SWAT-MODFLOW interface to simulate the groundwater head distribution and groundwater recharge rates. The study is conducted in Chintalapudi village, which is located inWest Godavari district, Andhra Pradesh. To estimate spatiotemporal distribution of groundwater recharge, it requires DEM, LULC map, Soil map, rainfall data, aquifer parameters such as aquifer thickness, hydraulic conductivity, and specific yield. Model results are shown by month and year to determine seasonal and decadal trends in groundwater recharge rates. The SWAT-MODFLOW was calibrated and validated using groundwater levels and streamflow data.

TI  - Assessment of pine aboveground biomass within Northern Steppe of Ukraine using Sentinel-2 data
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study offers the results of the spectral characteristics, calculated vegetative indices and biophysical parameters of pine stands of the Northern Steppe of Ukraine region obtained using Sentinel-2 data. For the development of regression models with the prediction of the biomass of pine forests using the obtained spectral characteristics, we used the results of the assessment of the aboveground biomass by the method of field surveys. The results revealed the highest correlation relations between the parameters of the general and trunk biomass with the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) and transformed vegetation index (TVI) vegetative indices and the fraction of absorbed photosynthetic active radiation (FARAP) and fraction of vegetation cover (FCOVER) biophysical parameters. To generate the models of determining the forest aboveground biomass (AGB), we used both the single- and two-factor models, the most optimum of which were those containing the NDVI predictor separately and in combination with the FCOVER predictor. The predicted values of the total AGB for the mentioned models equalled 32.5 to 236.3 and 39.9 to 253.4 t.ha(-1). We performed mapping of the AGB of pine stands of the Northern Steppe using multi-spectral Sentinel-2 images, particularly the spectral characteristics of their derivatives (vegetative indices, biophysical parameters). This study demonstrated promising results for conducting an AGB-mapping of pine woods in the studied region using free-access resources.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to present an operational approach for mapping soil moisture at high spatial resolution over agricultural areas with vegetation cover. The developed approach uses the neural network (NN) technique based on coupling Sentinel-1 radar data and Sentinel-2 optical data. The neural networks were developed and validated using synthetic and real databases, To operationally map the soil moisture, the developed NN uses the C-band SAR signal in VV polarization, SAR incidence angle, and the Normalized Differential Vegetation Index "NDVI" as the inputs. To optimize the automatic production of soil moisture maps a pipeline using the Orfeo Toolbox is implemented.

M3  - Article
AB  - Objective A continuous survey on influenza was conducted in Hulunbuir, China from January 2010 to May 2019 to reveal epidemiological, microbiological and air pollutants associated with laboratory-confirmed influenza cases. Methods Influenza-like illness and severe acute respiratory infection subjects were enrolled from a sentinel hospital in Hulunbuir during the study period for epidemiological and virological investigation. The association between air pollutants and influenza-positivity rate was assessed by a generalised additive model. Results Of 4667 specimens, 550 (11.8%) were tested positive for influenza. The influenza-positivity was highest in the age groups of 5-14 years, 50-69 years and > 70 years. We found that the effect of particulate matter <= 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) concentrations on the influenza-positivity rate was statistically significant, particularly on day lag-4 and lag-5. Genetic characterisations showed that (H1N1) pdm09 strains belonged to subclade 6B.1 and that influenza B isolates belonged to subclade 1A-3Del, with significant substitutions in the haemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins compared with those in the WHO-recommended vaccine strains. Conclusions Elderly individuals and school-age children were at high risk for influenza infection. PM(2.5)concentrations showed significant effects on influenza-positivity rate in Hulunbuir, which could be considered in local influenza prevention strategies.

AB  - High-quality precipitation data are vital for hydrological applications and climate change research. In this study, we evaluated two satellite-based precipitation products from Chinese Fengyun (FY) 2G (G is one of the third batch of operational geostationary satellites in the Chinese FY-2 series) and the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) against the rain gauge-based precipitation data, respectively, over the Yunnan-Kweichow Plateau, China, at different temporal scales (e.g., monthly, daily, and hourly). And the main findings of this study were as follows: (1) FY2G Quantitative Precipitation Estimation (QPE) and Integrated Multisatellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) shared similar spatial precipitation patterns with those of rain gauge data, while the FY2G QPE general underestimated the precipitation (bias, -30%-0%), and IMERG obviously overestimated the precipitation (bias, 0%-60%) at monthly scale over the Yunnan-Kweichow Plateau; (2) the FY2G QPE correlated significantly better (Correlation coefficient, CC, 0.80) than IMERG (CC 0.20) against rain gauge data at daily scale, meanwhile, the average daily bias value of IMERG (30%) was around 6 times larger than that of FY2G QPE (5%); (3) The FY2G QPE (CC 0.7, bias - 8%, root-mean-square error 2.0 mm/hr, mean absolute error 0.6 mm/hr) also generally outperformed the IMERG (CC 0.1, bias 13%, root-mean-square error 3.0 mm/hr, mean absolute error 1.0 mm/hr), at hourly scale; (4) The FY2G QPE significantly underestimated the precipitation in the period between 16:00 and 20:00 with the probability of detection (POD) decreased from 0.8 to 0.5, while the IMERG significantly overestimated the precipitation in the period between 4:00 and 12:00, at diurnal scale; and (5) one of the reasons resulting the significant overestimations of IMERG might due to its weak abilities in detecting the precipitation events with POD 0.2 and false alarm ratio (FAR) 0.7 at diurnal scale, which performed worse than those of the FY2G QPE (POD 0.8 and FAR 0.4). These findings would provide valuable recommendations for using these satellite-based precipitation products in various application fields, such as hydrology, agriculture, and meteorology over the YKP, and also for improving the algorithms of GPM.

TI  - Building 3-D Reconstruction With a Small Data Stack Using SAR Tomography
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) tomography (TomoSAR) has been well established for the 3-D reconstruction of urban buildings. Many methods have been proposed in the literature for TomoSAR inversion. These methods usually require fairly large data stacks (more than 20 images) for reliable reconstruction. Hence, they cannot be applied to the 3-D reconstruction of urban buildings using Gaofen-3 (GF-3) data directly, because there are few images available on average in each city. This article proposes a novel workflow for the 3-D reconstruction of high-rise buildings using small data stacks. In this workflow, we combine the methods of contour line extraction (CLE) and reference-elevation multilooking relaxation (RM-RELAX) for the 3-D reconstruction of high-rise buildings. The CLE method extracts contour lines of buildings relying on a data-driven approach and does not need to rely on any external data, which can provide prior knowledge for subsequent processing. The RM-RELAX method is an extension of RELAX, which can obtain more precise 3-D inversion with multilooking and reject outliers with the reference elevation (which can be obtained by the prior knowledge of contour lines) of each pixel. The applicability of this workflow is demonstrated by using simulated data and real data with six SAR images acquired by the GF-3 satellite over an area in Beijing, China.

TI  - Monitoring Seasonal and Diurnal Surface Urban Heat Islands Variations Using Landsat-Scale Data in Hefei, China, 2000-2017
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The surface urban heat island (SUHI) is one of the most common effects of the urban ecological environment, and its long-term diurnal and seasonal fine-scale analysis remains poorly understood. This article utilized a modified reconstruction model and spatiotemporal fusion model to generate twice daily (day and night) and seasonal Landsat-scale (30 m) land surface temperature (LST) data using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat images in Hefei, China, from 2000 to 2017. The diurnal and seasonal characteristics of SUHI variations and the complex interrelationships between SUHI and landscape patterns were analyzed. The result shows that fine-scale SUHI varied diurnally and seasonally, with a great deal of spatial heterogeneity. The fine-scale SUHI phenomenon was obvious in spring and summer during the daytime (average annual intensity of the heat island is 5.05 degrees C in summer, 3.26 degrees C in spring, 2.08 degrees C in autumn, and 1.90 degrees C in winter), and appeared at nighttime throughout the year (average annual intensity of the heat island is 2.85 degrees C in summer, 2.75 degrees C in spring, 2.69 degrees C in autumn, and 2.30 degrees C in winter). The change characteristics of landscape pattern indices in different SUHI zones reveal that construction land has an amplifying effect for SUHI, while areas dominated by vegetation and water weaken the effects of SUHI. The mitigation effect of vegetation on SUHI during the day is better than that at night.

TI  - 3-D Channel and Spatial Attention Based Multiscale Spatial-Spectral Residual Network for Hyperspectral Image Classification
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of aerospace and various remote sensing platforms, the amount of data related to remote sensing is increasing rapidly. To meet the application requirements of remote sensing big data, an increasing number of scholars are combining deep learning with remote sensing data. In recent years, based on the rapid development of deep learning methods, research in the field of hyperspectral image (HSI) classification has seen continuous breakthroughs. In order to fully extract the characteristics of HSIs and improve the accuracy of image classification, this article proposes a novel three-dimensional (3-D) channel and spatial attention-based multiscale spatial-spectral residual network (termed CSMS-SSRN). The CSMS-SSRN framework uses a three-layer parallel residual network structure by using different 3-D convolutional kernels to continuously learn spectral and spatial features from their respective residual blocks. Then, the extracted depth multiscale features are stacked and input into the 3-D attention module to enhance the expressiveness of the image features from the two aspects of channel and spatial domains, thereby improving the accuracy of classification. The CSMS-SSRN framework proposed in this article can achieve better classification performance on different HSI datasets.

AB  - The MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) product plays an important role in the eco-environmental monitoring of natural disasters. However, its validation has been a long standing and important scientific problem. The paper proposed a method to integrate accurate classification information for medium-high spatial resolution remote sensing images to improve the traditional Chen NDVI scale conversion model and perform MOD13 Q1 validation. The authors had verified the method in the research area of Xiamen, Fujian Province, China, and the experimental results proved its effectiveness. This paper focuses on the availability research of the model in different experimental areas. Taking Fuzhou City of Jiangxi Province, China, as the study area, the MOD13 Q1 validation experiment was implemented. The conclusions are obtained from the experimental results: the Chen NDVI scale transformation model is not robust, and in some experimental areas there is significant transformation error when the conversion factor is too large (such as eightfold from 30 m OLI NDVI to 240 m up-scaled NDVI). In these bad cases, other more robust scale transformation models should be elected for the validation of the low- resolution land surface parameter images.

AB  - Batam Island has topographical characteristics including elevation, and coastal ecosystems that are considered complete include coral reefs, macroalgae, seagrasses, and mangroves. Tanjung Piayu waters are found in the southern part of Batam Island, which is adjacent to the Barelang bridge that connects the other islands to Batam. The water of Tanjung Piayu have the potential to develop into a marine tourism hub, saltwater fish farming, fishing, and many more. In this study, the classification and correction of water columns were carried out using the Lyzenga formula, to see benthic habitats in the waters of Tanjung Piayu. This research uses a remote sensing method with Landsat-8 image data. This study purpose was to determine and classify the distribution of benthic habitats in the waters of Tanjung Piayu. The results of this study obtained four classes in the classification of shallow-water benthic habitats with an area of coral reefs 199.50 Ha, seagrass and sand 496.90 Ha, land 2987.18 Ha, and waters 1603.97 Ha, and with the percentage of coral reefs 3.77%, Seagrass and Sand 8.88%, and waters 30.33% The Lyzenga algorithm is able to identify benthic habitats and determine the area size according to the class in benthic habitats.

TI  - Reconceptualizing Urbanism: Insights From Maya Cosmology
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE CITIES
M3  - Review
AB  - Sustainable practices in the present are typically designed to mitigate immediate concerns over decadal timespans. In the face of exponential population growth, overuse of resources, and global climate change, this time span is inadequate; longer, more resilient and sustainable options need to be implemented. Here, we tackle the intersection of human behavior and the urban environment by taking a holistic approach-that is, a non-anthropocentric approach critical to ensure the longevity, or even survival, of the planet. We thus approach urbanism as we would any ecosystem, with the broad understanding that the urban, the rural, humans, and non-humans are all interdependent. One cannot understand cities without an understanding of the surrounding rural or non-center areas, thus making critical an appreciation of urban-rural interdependence (URI). The holistic model is based on insights from the ancient Maya of Central America-a tropical society where farmers practiced widespread, sustainable agriculture for 4,000 years without denuding the landscape. The Classic Maya accomplished this feat in large part due to their sustainable URI and cosmocentric worldview (CWV)-that is, a cosmology of conservation, or merged existence, where people, animals, plants, rivers, stones, clouds, etc., each played a role in maintaining the world. Their CWV was also expressed in urban planning through manifestations of traditional knowledge, multi-purpose designs, and local resource networks. Insights from the Maya indicate that diversity is fundamental-across all scales; diverse strategies are flexible, spread risk, and are resilient in the face of change. As such, we present past lessons from Maya kings and farmers who built cities with reservoirs, causeways, monumental constructions and other urban features that integrated the built into the existing environment, ultimately resulting in green cities interspersed with farmsteads and managed biodiverse forests. In brief, our holistic model suggests possibilities for the re-integration of nature and culture, with the goal of a resilient URI.

TI  - Mapping Public Urban Green Spaces based on OpenStreetMap and Sentinel-2 imagery using Belief Functions: Data and Source Code
T2  - heiDATA Dataverse Network
M3  - Data study
AB  - Public urban green spaces are important for the urban quality of life. Still, comprehensive open data sets on urban green spaces are not available for most cities. As open and globally available data sets the potential of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and OpenStreetMap (OSM) data for urban green space mapping is high but limited due to their respective uncertainties. Sentinel-2 imagery cannot distinguish public from private green spaces and its spatial resolution of 10 meters fails to capture fine-grained urban structures, while in OSM green spaces are not mapped consistently and with the same level of completeness everywhere. To address these limitations we propose to fuse these data sets under explicit consideration of their uncertainties. The Sentinel-2 derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index was fused with OSM data using the Dempster-Shafer theory to enhance the detection of small vegetated areas. The distinction between public and private green spaces was achieved using a Bayesian hierarchical model and OSM data. The analysis was performed based on land use parcels derived from OSM data and tested for the city of Dresden, Germany. The overall accuracy of the final map of public urban green spaces was 95\%, which was mainly influenced by the uncertainty of the public accessibility model.

AB  - Environmental degradation, economic and political threats along with ideo-logical extremism necessitate a global redirection toward sustainability and well-being. Since the survival of all species (humans, animals, and plants) is wholly dependent on a healthy planet, urgent action at the highest levels to address large-scale interconnected problems is needed to counter the thinking that perpetuates the "folly of a limitless world."Paralleling critical societal roles played by universities - ancient, medieval, and modern - throughout the millennia, this chapter calls for all universities and higher education institutions (HEIs) generally - estimated at over 28,000 - to take a lead together in tackling the pressing complex and intractable challenges that face us. There are about 250 million students in tertiary education worldwide rising to about 600 million by 2040. Time is not on our side. While much of the groundwork has been done by the United Nations (UN) and civil society, concerns remain over the variable support given to the UN-2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially in light of the negative impact of global biodiversity loss on achieving the UN-2030 SDGs.Ten propositions for global sustainability, ranging from adopting the SDGs at national and local levels to ensuring peaceful uses of technology and UN reforms in line with global socioeconomic shifts, are provided for consideration by decisionmakers. Proposition #7 calls for the unifying One Health & Well-Being (OHWB) concept to become the cornerstone of our educational systems as well as societal institutions and to underpin the UN-2030 SDGs.Recognizing the need to change our worldview (belief systems) from human-centrism to eco-centrism, and re-building of trust in our institutions, the chapter argues for the re-conceptualization of the university/higher education purpose and scope focusing on the development of an interconnected ecological knowledge system with a concern for the whole Earth - and beyond.The 2019 novel coronavirus has made clear that the challenges facing our world cannot be solved by individual nations alone and that there is an urgency to committing to shared global values that reflect the OHWB concept and approach. By drawing on our collective experience and expertise informed by the UN-2030 SDGs, we will be in a much stronger position to shape and strengthen multilateral strategies to achieve the UN-2030 Transformative Vision - "ending poverty, hunger, inequality and protecting the Earth's natural resources," and thereby helping "to save the world from itself."

TI  - Modelling and analyzing spatial clusters of leptospirosis based on satellite-generated measurements of environmental factors in Thailand during 2013-2015
T2  - GEOSPATIAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study statistically identified the association of remotely sensed environmental factors, such as Land Surface Temperature (LST), Night Time Light (NTL), rainfall, the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and elevation with the incidence of leptospirosis in Thailand based on the nationwide 7,495 confirmed cases reported during 2013-2015. This work also established prediction models based on empirical findings. Panel regression models with random-effect and fixed-effect specifications were used to investigate the association between the remotely sensed environmental factors and the leptospirosis incidence. The Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) statistics were also applied to detect the spatial patterns of leptospirosis and similar results were found (the R-2 values of the random-effect and fixed-effect models were 0.3686 and 0.3684, respectively). The outcome thus indicates that remotely sensed environmental factors possess statistically significant contribution in predicting this disease. The highest association in 3 years was observed in LST (random-effect coefficient -9.787, p<0.001; fixed-effect coefficient = -10.340, p = 0.005) followed by rainfall (random-effect coefficient = 1.353, p <0.001; fixed-effect coefficient = 1.347, p <0.001) and NTL density (random-effect coefficient = -0.569, p = 0.004; fixed-effect coefficient = -0.564, p = 0.001). All results obtained from the bivariate LISA statistics indicated the localised associations between remotely sensed environmental factors and the incidence of leptospirosis. Particularly, LI SA's results showed that the border provinces in the northeast, the northern and the southern regions displayed clusters of high leptospirosis incidence. All obtained outcomes thus show that remotely sensed environmental factors can be applied to panel regression models for incidence prediction, and these indicators can also identify the spatial concentration of leptospirosis in Thailand.

TI  - High-resolution multispectral mapping facies on glacier surface in the Arctic using WorldView-3 data
T2  - CZECH POLAR REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers are important and sensitive part of our environment which can be used as indicator of global warming and climate change. Glacier facies represent distinct regions of a glacier surface characterized by near surface structure and density that develop as a function of spatial variations in surface melt and accumulation. The facies mapping aids in delineating different zones of the glacier, which are useful in computing glacier mass balance and modeling. In this study we tested traditional and advanced classification techniques on the Edithbreen glacier situated in Ny-Alesund, Svalbard, using WorldView-3 and Landsat 8 OLI. The comparison of the accuracy was conducted using error matrices. Six measures of accuracy were derived from the error matrices and were compared with each other to find the method delivering the most adequate output for facies mapping. The pixel-based approach applied to Landsat-8 data yielded higher accuracies (>80%) when compared to that. The object-oriented classification revealed a much better accuracy and high kappa coefficient for both low and high-resolution datasets. The study clearly indicates that the object-oriented classification provides better results for glacier facies classification when high spatial resolution is used, but for lower spatial resolution, pixel-based methods are adequate.

AB  - Fall armyworm (FAW) is a polyphagus pest with a preference for young maize leaves that relocates to the cob during cob development and can devastate maize yields. Time series anomaly change detection and first derivative growth pattern analyses were conducted under the hypothesis that, if unimpeded and occurring during the vegetative growth stage, FAW presence will result in a reduction of the LAI or total green biomass (NDVI) of the crop. We have conducted observations NDVI/LAI at three different scales from continental to field scales., (i) Sentinel-2 a+b and (ii) micro-satellite Planet Scope, (iii) multispectral camera. Correlations between LAI and (i) NDVI of (i,ii,iii) were R-2 0.60, 0.66 and 0.35, respectively. The NDVI time series and first derivative were then compared to the FAW damage recorded using a mobile app.

T2  - POLITICS AND RELIGION JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The main thesis of the article is that the matter of religious tolerance in the works by a concrete author shall be researched in a wider context of his world-view. An author's worldview can be reconstructed at the basis of his texts, and the consistency in the main notions' propositions can unveil the consistency of his thought. The research is based mainly on the works by one of the most prominent medieval Persian Sufi writers - Mahmud Shabistari (1288-1321). For the matter of religious tolerance is a very important part of his worldview, the research of general logic of his worldview structure will help us to see the reason of his special approach to interpret the matter of faith and infidelity. Hence, in the first part of the paper we show the propositions that link the main notions of Shabistari's worldview together and reconstruct in general the consistence of his worldview on the basis of the researched notion system. In the second part of the paper, we use the obtained results to interpret the poet's idea of the faith and infidelity relation in the context of his worldview.

The sources of the article are publications of domestic and foreign authors, as well as materials from his archive.The first section of the article is devoted mainly to the fate of Chernetsov's home scientific archive. After the scientist's death, his widow V.I. Moshinskaya gave the archive to the Tomsk University. The history of the archive's receipt to the University is briefly described. These are the editions of archival materials on the ethnography of the Mansi people, prepared by N.V. Lukina and O.M. Ryndina. The author considers a complex way of searching for opportunities for publishing folklore texts in the Mansi language. The article notes the important role of the abstracts of texts in Russian language prepared by the Hungarian folklorist E. Schmidt in this search.The author also reports about the articles by Z.P. Sokolova and G.P. Kharyuchi devoted to the personality of Chemetsov and his contribution to the study of the Ob Ugric and Nenets peoples. The article considers the project specifically devoted to Chernetsov, it is performed at the Tomsk University (2019-2021).The second section of the article analyzes the research carried out on the subject of V.N. Chemetsov after his death. The Bear's Holiday of the Ob Ugrians was chosen as the theme for the analysis. About thirty publications were reviewed, the authors of which are R.K. Bardina, V.S. Ivanova, N.V. Lukina, Timofey A. Moldanov, Tatyana Moldanova, N.I. Novikova, N.K. Partanov, E.V. Perevalova, S.A. Popova, E.I. Rombandeeva, Z.P. Sokolova, E. Schmidt. Archived texts of Mansi folklore are also considered.The works of these authors contain descriptions of modem sporadic Bear's Holidays. They are complemented by information of Chernetsov about the religious center Vezhakary and about the structure of the group Yalpus Makhum, which organizes here periodic Bear rites. The article gives different explanation of some episodes of these rites. New places of periodic Bear rites have been identified in the Mansi. All authors refer to Chernetsov's materials and ideas, but there is also a critical attitude to some of his judgments.Conclusions. After the death of V.N. Chernetsov (1970), his contribution to the study of the peoples of the North was enriched thanks to the updating of the scientific archive of the scientist. Analysis of publications about the Bear's Holiday of the Ob Ugric peoples over the past half-century has shown the predominance of works about a sporadic Holiday with less attention to periodic rites. The researches represent a great interest to the Bear cult as part of the traditional worldview of the Ob Ugric peoples, with little attention to the problem of the origin of the Bear's Holiday.

M3  - Article
AB  - The shear volumes of data generated from earth observation and remote sensing technologies continue to make major impact; leaping key geospatial applications into the dual data and compute-intensive era. As a consequence, this rapid advancement poses new computational and data processing challenges. We implement a novel remote sensing data flow (RESFlow) for advancing machine learning to compute with massive amounts of remotely sensed imagery. The core contribution is partitioning massive amounts of data into homogeneous distributions for fitting simple models. RESFlow takes advantage of Apache Spark and the availability of modern computing hardware to harness the acceleration of deep learning inference on expansive remote sensing imagery. The framework incorporates a strategy to optimize resource utilization across multiple executors assigned to a single worker. We showcase its deployment in both computationally and data-intensive workloads for pixel-level labeling tasks. The pipeline invokes deep learning inference at three stages; during deep feature extraction, deep metric mapping, and deep semantic segmentation. The tasks impose compute-intensive and GPU resource sharing challenges motivating for a parallelized pipeline for all execution steps. To address the problem of hardware resource contention, our containerized workflow further incorporates a novel GPU checkout routine and the ticketing system across multiple workers. The workflow is demonstrated with NVIDIA DGX accelerated platforms and offers appreciable compute speed-ups for deep learning inference on pixel labeling workloads; processing 21 028 TB of imagery data and delivering output maps at area rate of 5.245 sq.km/s, amounting to 453 168 sq.km/day-reducing a 28 day workload to 21 h.

TI  - Combining Spectral and Texture Features for Estimating Leaf Area Index and Biomass of Maize Using Sentinel-1/2, and Landsat-8 Data
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) and biomass are important indicators that reflect the growth status of maize. The optical vegetation indices and the synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) backscattering coefficient are commonly used to estimate the LAI and biomass. However, previous studies have suggested that spectral features extracted from a single pixel have a poor ability to describe the canopy structure. In this paper, we propose a method for estimating LAI and biomass by combining spectral and texture features. Specifically, LAI, biomass and remote-sensing data were collected from the jointing, trumpet, flowering, and filling stages of maize. Then we formed six remote-sensing feature matrices using the spectral and texture features extracted from the remote sensing data. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to remove noise and to reduce and integrate the multi-dimensional features. Multiple linear regression (MLR) and support vector regression (SVR) methods were used to build the estimation models. Tenfold cross-validation was adopted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experimental results show that using the texture features of both optical and SAR data improves the estimation accuracy of LAI and biomass. In particular, SAR texture features greatly improve the estimation accuracy of biomass. The estimation model constructed by combining spectral and texture features of optical and SAR data achieves the best performance (highest coefficient of determination (R-2) and lowest root mean square error (RMSE)). Specifically, we conclude that the best window sizes for extracting texture features from optical and SAR data are 3 x 3 and 7 x 7, respectively. SVR is more suitable for estimating the LAI and biomass of maize than MLR. In addition, after adding texture features, we observed a significant improvement in the accuracy of estimation of LAI and biomass for the growth stages, which have a larger variation in the extent of the canopy. Overall, this work shows the potential of combining spectral and texture features for improving the estimation accuracy of LAI and biomass in maize.

TI  - Hydrological impacts of interannual variations in surface soil freezing processes in the upper Nu-Salween River basin
T2  - ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The upper Nu-Salween River basin in the Tibetan Plateau is mainly covered with seasonal frozen soils. We used daily surface freeze-thaw states, detected from Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) daily brightness temperature data, to analyze the variations in surface freeze-thaw states and the relationship with air temperature. We also examined baseflow to explore the influences of interannual variations in the start time of soil freezing on hydrological processes. The results showed that (1) interannual air temperature fluctuations led to differences in the area and start time of surface freezing. When surface soil froze, flow was mainly dependent on existing groundwater storage. (2) The interannual variation in the surface freezing time directly affected the flow generation processes. When soil water froze and remained in the frozen layer, it was hard to generate surface flow, so flow mainly consisted of baseflow, causing the proportion of the baseflow in the total flow to gradually increase. (3) The surface freeze-thaw states obtained from the passive microwave remote sensing data may be applied to support further research on the hydrological impacts of freeze-thaw cycle variations in plateau mountain basins.

TI  - Comparative analysis on landsat image enhancement using fractional and integral differential operators
T2  - COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, Landsat image enhancement based on the fractional and integral differential methods is compared. Enhancement techniques used in remote sensing are based on the traditional integral order differential mask operators, such as Sobel, Prewitt and Laplacian operators. Other techniques involve the fractional calculus and general masks using Grunwald-Letnikov with eight directions. Notably, it is crucial to perform fractional filtering of I weight (intensity or brightness) in color space of (hue, saturation, intensity or brightness) according to the filtering rule. We study the quantitative analysis of enhancement performance via the gray-scale histogram and information entropy. Finally, we demonstrated that fractional differential operator is capable of enhanced performance superior to that of the integral differential operators. The optimal fractional order for image enhancement of Landsat Thematic Mapper is 1.15, 1.4, and 0.6 based on the (3 x 3), (5 x 5), and (7 x 7) masks, respectively.

AB  - Aiming at the technical requirements of modern urban traffic survey for macroscopic, visual, and dynamic monitoring, this paper proposes a method for monitoring and analyzing urban traffic based on commercial video satellite and intelligent image processing technology. Firstly, the video satellite-based monitoring method was introduced based on the surveillance ability analysis of the commercial video satellites. Then, the calculation method of the traffic density, speed, and flow based on the video satellite data is developed. Finally, a case study of eastern area of Changchun City was performed. 11x4.5 square kilometer of urban traffic was observed by video satellite. The work of data acquisition, information extraction, and traffic analysis were conducted within a week and the labor costs were reduced greatly by using the intelligent image processing technology; moreover, the traffic flow calculation errors are reduced by 10% compared with the highway traffic flow statistical data.

TI  - Application of satellite remote sensing methods in mineral prospecting in Kosovo, area of Selac
T2  - GOSPODARKA SUROWCAMI MINERALNYMI-MINERAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional methods of mineral exploration are mainly based on very expensive drilling and seismic methods. The proposed approach assumes the preliminary recognition of prospecting areas using satellite remote sensing methods. Maps of mineral groups created using Landsat 8 images can narrow the search area, thereby reducing the costs of geological exploration during mineral prospecting. This study focuses on the identification of mineralized zones located in the southeastern part of Europe (Kosovo, area of Selac) where hydrothermal mineralization and alterations can be found. The article describes all the stages of research, from collecting in-situ rock samples, obtaining spectral characteristics with laboratory measurements, preprocessing and analysis of satellite images, to the validation of results through field reconnaissance in detail. The authors introduce a curve-index fitting technique to determine the degree of similarity of a rock sample to a given pixel of satellite imagery. A comparison of the reflectance of rock samples against surface reflectance obtained from satellite images allows the places where the related type of rock can be found to be determined. Finally, the results were compared with geological and mineral maps to confirm the effectiveness of the method. it was shown that the free multispectral data obtained by the Landsat 8 satellite, even with a resolution of 30 meters, can be considered as a valuable source of information that helps narrow down the exploration areas.

M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Neoplastic disease has multifactorial etiology and insidious evolution which make it unlikely to be detected in early stages and very difficult to treat at later times. The effectiveness of standard therapeutic approaches is limited by severe adverse effects, metastasis, and tumor capacity to develop multidrug resistance.The success of inorganic nanomaterial-based therapeutic agents depends on the degree to which these nanostructures satisfy general requirements for drug safety regarding biocompatibility, biodegradability, and stability and on their antitumor efficacy. Fabrication of such nanomedicines requires adequate assessment and engineering of nanomaterial physicochemical characteristics like particle size, specific surface area, surface charge, hydrodynamic size, and magnetic, optical, and photocatalytic properties. Together with surface functionalization and delivery method, these properties dictate the in vivo "biological identity" of the nanomaterial and its fate with respect to cellular uptake and distribution/accumulation inside the body.We reviewed recent literature on interdisciplinary studies regarding applications of inorganic nanomaterials in the treatment of cancer. The major functions that inorganic nanomaterials can play in cancer therapy are:1. Nanocarriers for therapeutic agents and active targeting ligands for molecules overexpressed on tumor tissues as well as for altered signal transduction pathways. Inorganic nanomaterial-based therapeutic agents are able to reduce tumor growth acting on neoplastic vasculature (by inhibiting angiogenesis, vasculogenesis, and vasculogenic mimicry) or on malignant cells (blocking activation of overexpressed receptors and their specific signaling pathways, inducing oxidative stress, and reducing multidrug resistance). Moreover, inorganic nanomaterials are able to inhibit tumor invasiveness and metastasis by reducing degradation of extracellular matrix, exosome secretion, and cell proliferation at the secondary site.2. Contrast agents and medical adhesives in cancer surgery:(i). Vital staining of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) where the first metastasis appears - the use of carbon nanoparticles, single-walled and multilayer carbon nanotubes, or superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles was associated with a significantly higher number of harvested SLNs in breast and cervical tumors, lung cancer, papillary thyroid carcinoma, and prostate carcinoma.(ii). Nanoparticle-based medical adhesives used for surgical wound closure aqueous suspensions of iron oxide and silicon dioxide nanoparticles were shown to rapidly connect highly vascularized tissues (e.g., liver).3. Inorganic sensitizers for radiotherapy - gold nanoparticles were reported to significantly enhance the efficiency of ionizing radiation and induce targeted cancer cell apoptosis, tumor growth inhibition, and increases of survival rates in tumor-bearing mice.4. Antitumor agents based on specific material properties like surface plasmon resonance (photothermal heating), magnetic responsiveness (magnetic hyperthermia), and photocatalysis (photodynamic therapy) - heat generated by plasmonic (gold-based) or magnetic (iron oxide-based) nanomaterials exposed to laser light or alternating magnetic fields, respectively, was shown to efficiently destroy tumors in mouse models or leads to promising results in clinical trials; the antitumor action of photoactivated TiO2-based nanomedicines was assessed in numerous in vitro and several in vivo studies.5. Adjuvant therapy (iron replacement therapy) - iron oxide colloids (IOC) are more efficient than free iron in treating iron-deficient anemia associated with cancer.Overall, inorganic-organic therapeutic nanoplatforms provide enhanced treatment efficiency, reduced adverse effects, multiple antitumor action mechanisms, facile cell internalization, and diminished multidrug resistance.

AB  - Most glaciers in Patagonia have been rapidly shrinking during the past decades in response to ongoing global warming. To extend techniques to monitor their dynamics is crucial to understand individual glacier response to climate change and its consequences. In that context, our study aims to investigate recent dynamic behaviour of two near-site outlet glaciers placed at the Southern Patagonian Icefield (Tyndall and Grey glaciers) with the usage of simple and cheap remote sensing techniques. Sentinel-1 images were used to estimate surface velocity by using the Offset-tracking algorithm, while Sentinel-2 images were used to estimate area change in the ice front. Moreover, climatic variables (e.g., accumulated precipitation and air temperature) were analysed in order to assess its influence on glacier dynamics. Our results indicates that precipitation rather then temperature changes has been playing a major role in both glaciers retreat. While Tyndall tends to stabilize its retreat, Grey exponentially enhances retreat by its east tongue. Additionally, mean ice speed was of 0.448 +/- 0.242 m.day(-1) for Grey and 0.439 +/- 0.245 m.day(-1) for Tyndall, which agrees with literature. However, high ice speeds near the ice front indicated by previous work could not be captured here. Our results also suggests that ice flow is a delayed response of precipitation in the accumulation zone, and that may be the cause of decrease in Tyndall's retreat. Overall, Offset-tracking is an useful tool for studying time series of Patagonian glaciers dynamics. It should be used carefully, however, around high dynamical regions such as the glacier terminus.

AB  - The use of Sentinel-1 SAR images for snow behavior monitoring and its parameters estimation is one of the most studied applications, but due to the high temporal and spatial heterogeneity of this media, is quite challenging. The presence of reference targets in the observed areas is of main concern both for amplitude and interferometric based techniques, but in a typical scenario as snow covered slopes or glaciers there is a lack of stable natural targets; this can demand the installation of Corner Reflectors. In this study, the design and the first test of an active corner reflector (ACR) operating at 5.405 GHz 50 MHz band, designed to be used in support to ESA Sentinel-1 spaceborne SAR images analysis and processing, is reported. The system here described was designed aiming at a tradeoff among low cost, simple functioning, easy and rugged hardware, to be deployed also in sites, as snow covered areas and glaciers. Using off-the-shelf components, one of the most challenging issue is to obtain a device with an adequate phase stability over long temporal interval.

AB  - Aerosol plays an important role in global climate effect, and Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), as one of its important parameters, can not only monitor the turbidity of the atmosphere, but also is an important index of atmospheric correction quality in remote sensing. Urban agglomeration in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River is a key national-level urban agglomerations in China, and its rapid urbanization leads to the aggravation of urban diseases such as disorderly development of cities, waste of resources and environmental pollution, and the research on ecological environment problems of urban agglomerations is also the current key project.In view of the above problems, this paper studies the AOD inversion and its spatial and temporal distribution in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, in order to provide important scientific materials for environmental monitoring and satellite atmospheric correction quality inspection.

AB  - In this paper, a Generative Adversarial Network(GAN) is proposed for data augmentation of remote sensing images abstracted from Jiangsu province in China, i.e., D-sGAN(Deeply-supervised GAN). At First, to modulate the layer activations, a down-sampling scheme is designed based on the segmentation map. Then, the architecture of the generator is UNet++ with the proposed down-sampling module. Next, the generator of this net is deeply supervised by the discriminator using deep Convolutional Neural Network(CNN). This paper further proved that the proposed down-sampling module and the dense connection characteristics of UNet++ are significantly beneficial to the retention of semantic information of remote sensing images. Numerical results demonstrated that the images generated by D-sGAN could be used to improve accuracy of the segmentation network, with a better Fully Convolutional Networks Score(FCN-Score) compared to the GoGAN, SimGAN and CycleGAN models.

TI  - Anthropological turn in worldview studies: Theoretical and practical aspects
T2  - VESTNIK SANKT-PETERBURGSKOGO UNIVERSITETA-FILOSOFIYA I KONFLIKTOLOGIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - The concept of worldview is quite ambiguous in modern humanities. Philosophers and scholars insist that there is such a spiritual or cognitive basis of each people, person or language, which finds its expression in the way they behave, think, or speak. Current Russian-speaking colleagues hold that there are different levels or types of worldview (such as mythological, religious, and scientific). All this testifies that the term of worldview lacks preciseness either in Russian and in foreign discourse. The main task of the article is to justify the possibility of a different approach to the study of worldview as a special phenomenon. The question can be raised of what exactly we analyze when dealing with worldview. The author is convinced that it would be better to work with the concept of worldview not as "what", but rather as "how". In developing his argument, the author focuses on three main aspects of the issue: (1) the accuracy in describing and conceiving worldview as the issue of philosophy; (2) the historical and contemporary examples of the worldview typology; (3) the refutation of such a dichotomy of "science - worldview" and the proposal of an integrated approach to the issue. The alternative way advocated by modern and classical authors is to turn to a more theoretically fruitful method of studying worldviews, that is, to the anthropological perspective.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Existing studies have suggested that internet-based participatory surveillance systems are a valid sentinel for influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance. However, there is limited scientific knowledge on the effectiveness of mobile-based ILI surveillance systems. Previous studies also adopted a passive surveillance approach and have not fully investigated the effectiveness of the systems and their determinants.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the efficiency of a mobile-based surveillance system of ILI, termed FluMob, among health care workers using a targeted surveillance approach. Specifically, this study evaluated the effectiveness of the system for ILI surveillance pertaining to its participation engagement and surveillance power. In addition, we aimed to identify the factors that can moderate the effectiveness of the system.METHODS: The FluMob system was launched in two large hospitals in Singapore from April 2016 to March 2018. A total of 690 clinical and nonclinical hospital staff participated in the study for 18 months and were prompted via app notifications to submit a survey listing 18 acute respiratory symptoms (eg, fever, cough, sore throat) on a weekly basis. There was a period of study disruption due to maintenance of the system and the end of the participation incentive between May and July of 2017.RESULTS: On average, the individual submission rate was 41.4% (SD 24.3%), with a rate of 51.8% (SD 26.4%) before the study disruption and of 21.5% (SD 30.6%) after the disruption. Multivariable regression analysis showed that the adjusted individual submission rates were higher for participants who were older (<30 years, 31.4% vs 31-40 years, 40.2% [P<.001]; 41-50 years, 46.0% [P<.001]; >50 years, 39.9% [P=.01]), ethnic Chinese (Chinese, 44.4% vs non-Chinese, 34.7%; P<.001), and vaccinated against flu in the past year (vaccinated, 44.6% vs nonvaccinated, 34.4%; P<.001). In addition, the weekly ILI incidence was 1.07% on average. The Pearson correlation coefficient between ILI incidence estimated by FluMob and that reported by Singapore Ministry of Health was 0.04 (P=.75) with all data and was 0.38 (P=.006) including only data collected before the study disruption. Health care workers with higher risks of ILI and influenza such as women, non-Chinese, allied health staff, those who had children in their households, not vaccinated against influenza, and reported allergy demonstrated higher surveillance correlations.CONCLUSIONS: Mobile-based ILI surveillance systems among health care workers can be effective. However, proper operation of the mobile system without major disruptions is vital for the engagement of participants and the persistence of surveillance power. Moreover, the effectiveness of the mobile surveillance system can be moderated by participants' characteristics, which highlights the importance of targeted disease surveillance that can reduce the cost of recruitment and engagement.

AB  - Contemporary 3D dynamical atmosphere models include the mesosphere as an essential element of simulation framework. Though thousands of elementary chemical processes are included as well as horizontal and vertical transport processes the quality of models is unsatisfied from the radiowave propagation point of view. Below we consider additional physical mechanism to be included in simulation. It is of solar-terrestrial links nature, namely the background processes caused by X-rays, hard X-rays and gamma rays fluxes from Sun. The reanalysis of satellite data proves that within the period of high solar activity the aforementioned fluxes exceed the C-flare level in a continuous manner. We present the satellite evidence and compare the present ionizing block with additional data from solar radiation

TI  - Detection of Changes in Terrestrial Ecosystems of Ukraine Using Remote Sensing Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY GEOGRAPHY AND GEOECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, Ukraine has been affected by climate change. This has led to frequent extreme weather events (heavy / high rains, floods, droughts, squalls). As a result of droughts, desertification is one of the most dangerous and transient consequences of modern climate change. The research is devoted to the diagnostic assessment of the modern climate of Ukraine. Remote sensing data and instrumental observations of 30 weather stations of Ukraine were used. Temperature increase was registered in the study area by all stations, which significantly affected the level of precipitation. At the moment there is not enough moisture for the Earth's surface. Precipitation in Ukraine is currently characterized by an uneven distribution. It leads to accelerated processes of soil degradation and it's fertility loss. The aim of the study was to identify areas prone to desertification using satellite imagery and meteorological observations. Over the past 17 years (2000-2017), the average air temperature in Ukraine has increased by 1.5 degrees C. Particularly anomalous warming has been recorded in recent years, starting in 2015. During the XXI century, a slight decrease in precipitation was observed in Ukraine. Both a decrease in precipitation and an increase in temperature may lead to a decrease in soil moisture levels. According to ground meteorological data, the tendency of dryness in Ukraine was confirmed. Lack of water leads to prompt manifestation of this process. Water indexes were used to estimate the moisture content of surface soils. It is possible to assess the susceptibility of the desert area to climate change. Relevant quantitative information on water availability in Ukraine is provided. Two water indices (Normalized Difference Infrared Index NDII and Ratio Drought Index RDI) have been taken estimate the moisture content. It can be estimated from the MODIS MOD13C2 product data obtained from the MODIS satellite sensor and used for regional research. The main conclusion of this study is to determine the changes in natural terrestrial ecosystems in Ukraine. This was shown on the basis of temperature and humidity. Such trends may lead to changes in the biodiversity of the territory and loss of natural soil properties.

TI  - Diagnostic accuracy of an app-guided, self-administered test for influenza among individuals presenting to general practice with influenza-like illness: study protocol
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionDiagnostic tests for influenza in Australia are currently only authorised for use in clinical settings. At-home diagnostic testing for influenza could reduce the need for patient contact with healthcare services, which potentially could contribute to symptomatic improvement and reduced spread of influenza. We aim to determine the accuracy of an app-guided nasal self-swab combined with a lateral flow immunoassay for influenza conducted by individuals with influenza-like illness (ILI).Methods and analysisAdults (>= 18years) presenting with ILI will be recruited by general practitioners (GP) participating in Australian Sentinel Practices Research Network. Eligible participants will have a nasal swab obtained by their GP for verification of influenza A/B status using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test at an accredited laboratory. Participants will receive an influenza test kit and will download an app that collects self-reported symptoms and influenza risk factors, then instructs them in obtaining a low-nasal self-swab, running a QuickVue influenza A+B lateral flow immunoassay (Quidel Corporation) and interpreting the results. Participants will also interpret an enhanced image of the test strip in the app. The primary outcome will be the accuracy of participants' test interpretation compared with the laboratory RT-PCR reference standard. Secondary analyses will include accuracy of the enhanced test strip image, accuracy of an automatic test strip reader algorithm and validation of prediction rules for influenza based on self-reported symptoms. A post-test survey will be used to obtain participant feedback on self-test procedures.Ethics and disseminationThe study was approved by the Human Research and Ethic Committee (HREC) at the University of Adelaide (H-2019-116). Protocol details and any amendments will be reported to https://www.tga.gov.au/. Results will be published in the peer-reviewed literature, and shared with stakeholders in the primary care and diagnostics communities.Trial registration numberAustralia New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry (U1111-1237-0688).

M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this reconnaissance is an attempt to reconstruct a historical portrait of one of the brightest participants of the World War II - Ivan Kozhedub. The research methodology based on the principles of historicism, the use of techniques of historical biography and military history, as well as the modern conceptual apparatus with which they operate. The novelty of the text determined by the involvement of tittle-known archival sources, statistical statements from foreign publications, which allowed not only to reproduce interesting details of the biography of the famous pilot, but also to determine the place of this figure among the best pilots of World War II. The refusal to glorify and idealize the main character made it possible to actualize other contexts related to his life trajectories and military affairs. Conclusions. I.Kozhedub personality formed under the influence of the realities of the time: party dictatorship, ideological indoctrination of society - on the one hand, and difficult social and living conditions - on the other. These circumstances defined his worldview and hardened his character, encouraging self-improvement and learning, developing the ability to make decisions independently and be responsible for their consequences, as well as the ability to appreciate people with whom he shared all the trials of wartime. Based on statistical data analyzed by domestic and foreign experts, it is safe to say that I.Kozhedub became the most effective pilot in the armed forces of the Anti-Hitter coalition. It stated that the military merits of this man and warrior properly reflected in mnemonic practices.

TI  - The Temporal Analysis of Regional Cultivated Land Productivity with GPP Based on 2000-2018 MODIS Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatiotemporal change characteristics of Cultivated Land Productivity (CLP) are imperative for ensuring regional food security, especially given recent global warming, social development and population growth. Based on the hypothesis that the Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) is a proxy of land productivity, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data with 500-m spatial resolution and 8-day temporal resolution was employed by the Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM) to calculate GPP in Jilin Province, China. We explored the level of CLP using the GPP mean from 2000 to 2018, and analyzed the changing trend and amplitude of CLP in the whole study period using both Theil-Sen median trend analysis and the Mann-Kendall (MK) test, and forecasted the sustainability of CLP with the Hurst exponent. The trend result and the Hurst exponent were integrated to acquire the future direction of change. The results revealed that: (1) The CLP level was generally high in the southeast and low in the northwest in cultivated land in Jilin, China. The area with the lowest productivity, located in the northwest of Jilin, accounted for 15.56%. (2) The majority (84.77%) of the area showed an increasing trend in 2000-2018, which was larger than the area that was decreasing, which accounted for 3.97%. (3) The overall change amplitude was dominated by a slightly increasing trend, which accounted for 51.48%. (4) The area with sustainability accounted for 33.45% and was mainly distributed in the northwest of Jilin. The area with anti-sustainability accounted for 26.78% and was mainly distributed in the northwest and central Jilin. (5) The Hurst exponent result showed that uncertain variation of CLP is likely to occur in the future over the entire region, and the central region is prone to display degeneration. Therefore, the results of this study indicated that quality improvement policy could be implemented for the middle-to-low yield fields in northwest Jilin, and dynamic monitoring and protection measures could be implemented for the areas with uncertain future changes and decreasing sustainability.

T2  - FOURTEENTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CORRELATION OPTICS
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 14th International Conference on Correlation Optics
CL  - Chernivtsi, UKRAINE
AB  - Laser speckle has received extensive studies in its basic properties and wide applications. In the majority of research on speckle phenomena, these random optical fields have been treated as scalar optical fields, and the main interest has been in the statistical properties together with applications of the intensity distribution of the speckle patterns. In recent years, increasing attention has been paid to the statistical properties of random electric vector fields referred to as polarization speckle with spatially varying polarization state. Statistical phenomena of random electric vector fields with their close relevance to the theories of speckles, polarization and coherence theory have come to attract emerging interest due to their importance in a variety of areas for practical applications such as biomedical optics, remote sensing, astronomical observation and optical metrology.In this paper, we investigate the dynamic polarization speckle generated by a moving rough-surfaced retardation plate and present an exact analytical expression for the space-time lagged correlation for the stochastic fields within the framework of ABCD matrix theory (Canonical Transforms). General expressions are derived for the spot size, the mean polarization speckle size, the temporal coherence length, and the peak shift of the temporal correlation. Some interesting phenomena associated with dynamic polarization speckle have been predicted including polarization speckle boiling and polarization speckle translation. A general description of these phenomena has been given for arbitrary complex-valued ABCD optical systems.

TI  - Spectral Index Fusion for Salinized Soil Salinity Inversion Using Sentinel-2A and UAV Images in a Coastal Area
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate and rapid inversion of soil salinity in regions based on the fusion of multisource remote sensing is not only practical for the treatment and utilization of saline soil but also the main trend in the development of quantitative soil salinization remote sensing. In this paper, the use of a numerical regression method to fuse spectral indexes based on high-spatial-resolution unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images and low-spatial-resolution satellite images was proposed to deeply assess the internal relationships between different types of remote sensing data. An inversion model of soil salt content (SSC) was constructed based on high-spatial-resolution UAV images, and the spectral indexes involved in the fusion were selected from the model. Then, a quadratic polynomial fusion function describing the relationship between the spectral indexes based on the two images was established to correct the spectral indexes based on the low-spatial-resolution satellite image (from Sentinel-2A). Then, scenario 1 (the best model based on Sentinel-2A used for the unfused Sentinel-2A spectral index), scenario 2 (the best inversion model based on UAV used for the unfused Sentinel-2A-based spectral index), and scenario 3 (the best inversion model based on UAV used for the fused Sentinel-2A-based spectral index) were compared and analyzed, and the SSC distribution map was obtained through scenario 3. The results indicate that the scenario 3 had highest accuracy, with the calibration R-2 improving by 0.078-0.111, the root mean square error (RMSE) decreasing by 0.338-1.048, the validation R-2 improving by 0.019-0.079, the RMSE decreasing by 0.517-1.030, and the ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) improving by 0.185-0.423. Therefore, this method can improve the accuracy of SSC remote sensing inversion, which is conducive to the accurate and rapid monitoring of SSC.

TI  - Safety Events and Privilege Utilization Rates in Advanced Practice Physical Therapy Compared to Traditional Primary Care: An Observational Study
T2  - MILITARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionThe general practitioner shortage in the United States coupled with a growing number of Americans living with disability has fueled speculation of non-physician providers assuming a greater role in musculoskeletal healthcare. Previous physician shortages have been similarly addressed, and expanding physical therapy (PT) scope of practice may best serve to fill this need. Resistance to expanding PT practice focuses on patient safety as PTs assume the roles traditionally performed by primary care providers. While studies have shown advanced practice PT to be safe, none have compared safety events in advanced practice PT compared to primary care to determine if there are increased patient risks. Therefore, the purpose of our study is to examine the rate of safety events and utilization of services in an advanced practice PT clinic compared to a primary care clinic. A secondary aim of our study was to report safety events associated with spinal manipulation and dry needling procedures.Materials and MethodsProductivity and safety data were retrospectively collected from Malcolm Grow Medical Center from 2015 to 2017 for the Family Health Clinic (FHC) and an advanced practice Physical Therapy Clinic (PTC). Chi-square tests for independence, risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%) were used to compare the relationship between the frequency of (1) patient encounters and clinical procedures and (2) clinical procedures and safety events.ResultsSeventy-five percent (12/16) of safety events reported in the PTC were defined as near misses compared to 50% (28/56) within the FHC (RR 1.5; 95% CIs: 1.0 to 2.2). Safety events were more likely to reach patients in the FHC compared to the PTC (RR 1.9; 95% CIs: 0.8 to 4.7). Safety events associated with minor harm to patients was n = 4 and n = 3 in the FHC and PTC respectively. No sentinel events, intentional harm events, nor actual events with more than minor harm were reported in either clinic. Significant relationships indicated that prescriptions, laboratory studies, imaging studies and referrals, were all more likely to be ordered in the FHC than the PTC (p < 0.01). The PTC ordered one diagnostic imaging study for every 37 encounters compared to one in every 5 encounters in the FHC. The PTC similarly referred one patient to another healthcare provider for every 52 encounters, fewer than the one per every 3 encounters in the FHC. There was a significant relationship between encounters and diagnoses, indicating a higher number of diagnoses per encounter in the FHC, though the difference of 0.31 diagnoses per encounter may not be clinically meaningful (p < 0.01). A total of 1,818 thrust manipulations and 2,910 dry needling procedures were completed without any reported safety events.ConclusionThese results suggest advanced practice PT has a similar safety profile to primary care. The authority to order musculoskeletal imaging and refer to other clinicians were among the most commonly utilized privileges and may be of primary importance when establishing an advanced practice PT clinic. These results support research showing advanced practice PT may lead to reductions in specialty referrals, diagnostic imaging, and pharmaceutical interventions.

AB  - Ovid's version of the armorum iudicium is a grand verbal aristeia and notable site for literary-generic debate where competing aesthetic positions are played off against each other. When Ajax-epic heavyweight, simplicitas rudis personified, advocate of deeds over words-disparages Ulysses as frivolous and unworthy contender (Met. 13.103-112), he conspicuously (mis)appropriates and turns against his 'lesser' adversary some signature literary-critical tropes used by Roman neoterics to resist those same epic values (natural inability, elegiac propriety, the excessive burden). As stylistic characterization, this ironic mismatch between discourse and speaker connects the debate with current literary polemic, signals Ovid's creative generic transgressions, and self-consciously calls attention to the genre-defying poetics of Metamorphoses. The poetological dimension is reinforced through the elaborate contrast with the 'modernist' Ulysses, figured symmetrically as cultural and generic foil to Ajax and the archaic worldview.

AB  - The automatic registration of multisensor remote sensing images is a highly challenging task due to the inherently different physical, statistical, and textural properties of the input data. In the present paper, this problem is addressed in the case of optical-SAR images by proposing a novel method based on deep learning and area-based registration concepts. The method integrates a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN), an area-based cross-correlation-type l(2) similarity metric, and the COBYLA constrained maximization algorithm. Whereas correlation-type metrics are typically ineffective in the application to multisensor registration, the proposed approach allows exploiting the image translation capabilities of cGAN architectures to enable the use of an l(2) similarity metric, which favors high computational efficiency. Experiments with Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data suggest the effectiveness of this strategy and the capability of the proposed method to achieve accurate registration.

AB  - Catchment land cover is one of the important factors that influence the conversion of rainfall into runoff. It provides information on the infiltrability of the soil and the ability of the catchment to store and release rainwater. In the Philippines, particularly in Cebu Island, flooding incidences have been experienced at present for rainfall events of magnitude that happened in the past but did not create flooding then. This phenomenon has a connection to changes in land cover especially from vegetation to pavement. This research utilizes satellite images from Landsat-5, Landsat-7, and Landsat-8 in generating historical land cover maps from 1993-2019. The study area was the Butuanon river catchment located in Central Cebu, which has been significantly altered by urbanization in the past two decades. Mosaiced images were made from the said satellite imageries to produce a clear image of the catchment. To achieve this, pansharpening and atmospheric correction were applied to improve image quality, while clouds which came with the images were removed with the QGIS Cloud Masking Plugin. The resulting voids from the masking process were filled in with the temporally closest masked images. Land cover classification was performed with eCognition Developer 9.0, with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) as the primary parameters used. Maps were then processed and created using ArcMap 10.3.1, and the percentages for bare soil, vegetated, and developed areas were determined. Five complete images were formed, composing of data from 1993-1995, 2001-2002, 2007-2011, 2014-2016, and 2019, respectively. It was found that for the duration specified, the percent land developed rose over time, with the biggest increase (8.062%) happening earlier this decade. On the other hand, the vegetated areas had a generally decreasing trend, with the exception of the earliest years, where the opposite occurred. Lastly, bare soil areas had no specific pattern to its changes. Manual digitization was then performed on a 1-square km sample area to validate the results of the classification from eCognition. It is recommended that the land classification procedures used be improved to include more land cover types. This study did not deal with tree cover, but doing so would make the results much more accurate.

AB  - The problem of interaction of end users with the system of remote aerospace monitoring of the Earth's surface (hereinafter referred to as the System) when solving monitoring problems in the context of an object-oriented approach is discussed in the article. We consider such aspects of interaction as setting the task, interpreting the task in the internal representation of the System, solving the task, providing the resolution results to the Task Manager. Special attention is paid to the problem of solving task, which is considered as the ability of the System to dynamically build schemes for solving the task in dialogue with the Task Manager on the base of formal language of interaction. A generalized technique of the task setting is presented. The example of the task setting of measuring the surface temperature of the pointed out object - an agricultural field by satellite data in thermal range is also considered.

AB  - Determining the efficacy of analytics at scale, especially when considering remote sensing imagery, provides unique challenges that the community has only recently been able to explore. The need for scaled analytics has become acute with the broad availability of geospatial platforms and the inability for classic modeling analytics to keep scale. In this paper, we discuss ongoing efforts to address this gap as it pertains to data correction. We illustrate the usage of a metric that takes into account the variation between scenes to create an unsupervised measurement of improved cloud masking performance. It is used to illustrate 46.7% relative improved performance of a deep learning based cloud mask on Sentinel-2 imagery as measured against the vendor provided cloud mask.

TI  - Investigating the Relationship Between High-Latitude Dust and Precipitation
T2  - 2020 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIG DATA (BIG DATA)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 8th IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - The effect of dust on precipitation at high latitudes has not been adequately explored as most of this research has been restricted to mid- and low-latitude regions. Even so, at these lower latitudes the relationship between dust and precipitation still has not been distinctly established. The purpose of this study is to act as a starting point for understanding the role dust plays in precipitation processes at high latitudes. Knowledge of the effects dust can have on precipitation will allow for better prediction and forecasting through an improvement of regional and global climate models. In order to investigate this relationship, we looked at instances of high-latitude dust and precipitation amounts specifically in regions of Alaska, Iceland and Patagonia. The precipitation data were separated in terms of days where dust was present, versus absent (binary basis). Most of the precipitation averages were low with the highest precipitation amounts seen only on days without dust. The data were also separated into four specific days surrounding the dust event (4-day basis); the day before the dust event, the day of, one day after and two days after. The day of and one day after were limited to having lower levels of precipitation whereas the day before and two days after exhibited a broader range of precipitation levels, which included the highest amounts. These initial observations indicated more of a negative relationship between the high-latitude dust events and precipitation. Two classifications of precipitation intensity were created and tested for the purpose of this study. After which, correlation analyses (Chi-Square Test, Fisher's Exact Test and Rank Correlations) and classification modeling (Decision Tree modeling) were applied. The p-values from the correlation analyses were less than 0.05 suggesting that there is likely a statistically significant relationship between the high-latitude dust events and precipitation, and this relationship again appears to be slightly negative. The classification models were able to predict the precipitation amounts for the days surrounding the dust events using the two classifications. However, they were not specifically able to distinguish between each of the categories for the classifications as most of the data were in the lower categories.

TI  - Rates and Correlates of HIV Incidence in Namibia's Zambezi Region From 2014 to 2016: Sentinel, Community-Based Cohort Study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Direct measures of HIV incidence are needed to assess the population-level impact of prevention programs but are scarcely available in the subnational epidemic hotspots of sub-Saharan Africa. We created a sentinel HIV incidence cohort within a community-based program that provided home-based HIV testing to all residents of Namibia's Zambezi region, where approximately 24% of the adult population was estimated to be living with HIV.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate HIV incidence, detect correlates of HIV acquisition, and assess the feasibility of the sentinel, community-based approach to HIV incidence surveillance in a subnational epidemic hotspot.METHODS: Following the program's initial home-based testing (December 2014-July 2015), we purposefully selected 10 clusters of 60 to 70 households each and invited residents who were HIV negative and aged ≥15 years to participate in the cohort. Consenting participants completed behavioral interviews and a second HIV test approximately 1 year later (March-September 2016). We used Poisson models to calculate HIV incidence rates between baseline and follow-up and multivariable Cox proportional hazard models to assess the correlates of seroconversion.RESULTS: Among 1742 HIV-negative participants, 1624 (93.23%) completed follow-up. We observed 26 seroconversions in 1954 person-years (PY) of follow-up, equating to an overall incidence rate of 1.33 per 100 PY (95% CI 0.91-1.95). Among women, the incidence was 1.55 per 100 PY (95% CI 1.12-2.17) and significantly higher among those aged 15 to 24 years and residing in rural areas (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 4.26, 95% CI 1.39-13.13; P=.01), residing in the Ngweze suburb of Katima Mulilo city (aHR 2.34, 95% CI 1.25-4.40; P=.01), who had no prior HIV testing in the year before cohort enrollment (aHR 3.38, 95% CI 1.04-10.95; P=.05), and who had engaged in transactional sex (aHR 17.64, 95% CI 2.88-108.14; P=.02). Among men, HIV incidence was 1.05 per 100 PY (95% CI 0.54-2.31) and significantly higher among those aged 40 to 44 years (aHR 13.04, 95% CI 5.98-28.41; P<.001) and had sought HIV testing outside the study between baseline and follow-up (aHR 8.28, 95% CI 1.39-49.38; P=.02). No seroconversions occurred among persons with HIV-positive partners on antiretroviral treatment.CONCLUSIONS: Nearly three decades into Namibia's generalized HIV epidemic, these are the first estimates of HIV incidence for its highest prevalence region. By creating a sentinel incidence cohort from the infrastructure of an existing community-based testing program, we were able to characterize current transmission patterns, corroborate known risk factors for HIV acquisition, and provide insight into the efficacy of prevention interventions in a subnational epidemic hotspot. This study demonstrates an efficient and scalable framework for longitudinal HIV incidence surveillance that can be implemented in diverse sentinel sites and populations.

AB  - Satellite altimeters provide sea level measurements along satellite track. A mean profile based on the measurements averaged over a time period is then subtracted to estimate the sea level anomaly (SLA). In the spectral domain, SLA is characterized by a power spectral density of the form f(-alpha) where the slope a is a parameter of great interest for ocean monitoring. However, this information lies in a narrow frequency band, located at very low frequencies, which calls for some specific spectral analysis methods. This paper studies a new parametric method based on an autoregressive model combined with a warping of the frequency scale (denoted as ARWARP). A statistical validation is proposed on simulated SLA signals, showing the performance of slope estimation using this ARWARP spectral estimator, compared to classical Fourier-based methods. Application to Sentinel-3 real data highlights the main advantage of the ARWARP model, making possible SLA slope estimation on a short signal segment, i.e., with a high spatial resolution.

TI  - Comparing Mouse Health Monitoring Between Soiled-bedding Sentinel and Exhaust Air Dust Surveillance Programs
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR LABORATORY ANIMAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - To monitor rodent colony health in research facilities, soiled-bedding sentinel (SBS) animals have traditionally been used. SBS can be tested by various methods, which may include serology, PCR analysis, and necropsy. Several pathogens are unreliably detected by using SBS or transmitted poorly through soiled bedding, and collection and evaluation of SBS samples can be time-intensive. Recently, exhaust air dust (EAD) testing through PCR analysis has emerged as an adjunct or replacement method for rodent colony health monitoring. EAD monitoring may provide a more efficient, sensitive, and humane method for monitoring health status. Using both EAD and SBS health monitoring, we evaluated colony health over the course of 1 y in 3 research barrier rooms in which mice were housed exclusively on IVC racks. Three pathogens-Helicobacter spp., Rodentibacter spp. (previously Pasteurella pneumotropica), and murine norovirus (MNV)-were not excluded in 2 of the rooms, and we expected that these mice would test positive with some regularity. EAD monitoring was significantly more sensitive than SBS for detection of the bacterial agents. SBS failed to detect Helicobacter spp. at time points when EAD had 100% detection in the rooms that did not exclude the bacteria. The detection of MNV did not differ between health monitoring systems at any time point. The findings suggest that EAD is especially valuable in detecting bacteria poorly transmitted through soiled bedding. In addition, the corresponding results with MNV detection suggest that EAD surveillance can reliably be implemented as an alternative to SBS monitoring in a facility in which mice are housed exclusively on IVC racks.

AB  - The development of urban areas in Sleman Regency occurs continuously along with an increase in population, encourages changes in any kind of land cover to be built-up area to meet the needs of citizen housing. The objectives of this study were to analyse changes in land cover and its correlation with Land Surface Temperature (LST) and to determine the direction of regional development that occurs in Sleman Regency. The methods used in this research were multispatio-temporal data analysis that contained spectral transformations and supervised classification of Maximum Likelihood on Google Earth Engine, statistical analysis of Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS imagery from 2014 to 2019, and accuracy assessments to determine the accuracy of the results. The results showed there were the increase in built-up area by 1713.374 ha from 2014 to 2019 and supported by the increase in population density of 2038 inhabitants/km2. There was an increase in LST in the converted areas from 2014 to 2019 with an estimated increase of 2.73 degrees C. The distribution of built-up area that indicated as the direction of urban area development has a tendency to head north and northeast of Sleman regency, such as to Ngemplak sub-district, Kalasan sub-district, and Berbah subdistrict. The correlation between building density and LST showed the correlation coefficient of 0.61 which was considered as a strong correlation and the determination coefficient of 0.38 also regarded as significant, based on the t-Test. The accuracy assessment was done on the land cover map, generating the overall accuracy of 88.42%.

AB  - The advanced microwave radiometer-climate quality (AMR-C) is a part of the European Sentinel-6A/B series, a collaboration between ESA and NASA, of two Earth-observing satellites, which will be launched in 2020 and 2025. Compared to its predecessor, Jason-3, the two AMR-C radiometer instruments have an external calibration system which enables higher radiometric stability accomplished by moving the secondary mirror between well-defined targets. Sentinel-6 allows continuing the study of the ocean circulation, climate change, and sea-level rise for at least another decade. Besides the external calibration for the AMR heritage radiometer (18.7, 23.8, and 34 GHz channels), the AMR-C contains a high-resolution microwave radiometer (HRMR) with radiometer channels at 90, 130, and 168 GHz. This subsystem allows for a factor of 5x higher spatial resolution at coastal transitions. This article presents a brief description of the instrument and the measured performance of the completed AMR-C-A and AMR-C-B instruments.

TI  - Sonapani Glacier Recession over a Century from 1906-2016, Chandra Basin, Himachal Himalaya
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the changes in snout and area of Sonapani glacier located in Chandra river valley, Himachal Himalaya has been studied over a century from 1906 to 2016. The study used a Survey Map (1906), Corona KH4-B (1971), Landsat 5 TM (1989), Landsat 7 ETM+ (2000) and Google Earth (2016) data images. In order to validate the satellite data images and other field studies, field work was carried out during 2014 in this area. The Survey Map (SM) of the Glacier was prepared by the Geological Survey of India (GSI) in 1906 and hence, demarcated its earliest snout position. Thus, the SM has been used as the base map for overall change detection studies. The study indicated a total glacier retreat of 1820 m at a rate of 16.5 ma(-1) over a time period of century from 1906 to 2016. During the different time intervals, the SG has indicated variable recessional patterns. For instance, the glacier has retreated by 991 m at a rate of 15 ma(-1) during 1906-1971, 202 m at a rate of 11.2 ma(-1) during1971-1989, 31 m at a rate 2.8 ma(-1) during 1989-2000 and 596 m at rate of 37.3 ma(-1) during 2000-2016. During the recent time period from 2000 to 2016, the rate of recession has increased rapidly. Due to this rapid recession of the glacier a major tributary towards the lower left side has also detached from it. The glacier also indicated an area loss of 29.7% (6.85 km(2)) from 1906 (23.9 km(2)) to 2016 (17.09 km(2)).

AB  - Systematically discovering semantic relationships in text is an important and extensively studied area in Natural Language Processing, with various tasks such as entailment, semantic similarity, etc. Decomposability of sentence-level scores via subsequence alignments has been proposed as a way to make models more interpretable. We study the problem of aligning components of sentences leading to an interpretable model for semantic textual similarity. In this paper, we introduce a novel pointer network based model with a sentinel gating function to align constituent chunks, which are represented using BERT. We improve this base model with a loss function to equally penalize misalignments in both sentences, ensuring the alignments are bidirectional. Finally, to guide the network with structured external knowledge, we introduce first-order logic constraints based on ConceptNet and syntactic knowledge. The model achieves an F1 score of 97.73 and 96.32 on the benchmark SemEval datasets for the chunk alignment task, showing large improvements over the existing solutions.

TI  - Land cover mapping using Sentinel-1 SAR and Landsat 8 imageries of Lagos State for 2017
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - For several years, Landsat imageries have been used for land cover mapping analysis. However, cloud cover constitutes a major obstacle to land cover classification in coastal tropical regions including Lagos State. In this work, a land cover appearance for Lagos State is examined using Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Land Satellite 8 (Landsat 8) imageries. To this aim, a Sentinel-1 SAR dual-pol (VV+VH) Interferometric Wide swath mode (IW) data orbit for 2017 and a Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) for 2017 over Lagos State were acquired and analysed. The Sentinel-1 imagery was calibrated and terrain corrected using a SRTM 3Sec DEM. Maximum likelihood classification algorithm was performed. A supervised pixel-based imagery classification to classify the dataset using training points selected from RGB combination of VV and VH polarizations was applied. Accuracy assessment was performed using test data collected from high-resolution imagery of Google Earth to determine the overall classification accuracy and Kappa coefficient. The Landsat 8 was orthorectified and maximum likelihood classification algorithm also performed. The results for Sentinel-1 include an RGB composite of the imagery, classified imagery, with overall accuracy calculated as 0.757, while the kappa value was evaluated to be about 0.719. Also, the Landsat 8 includes a RBG composite of the imagery, classified imagery, but an overall accuracy of 0.908 and a kappa value of 0.876. It is concluded that Sentinel 1 SAR result has been effectively exploited for producing acceptable accurate land cover map of Lagos State with relevant advantages for areas with cloud cover. In addition, the Landsat 8 result reported a high accuracy assessment values with finer visual land cover map appearance.

TI  - "Let Your Lamps Be Ready": Individual Destiny and Collective Identity in Eschatological Perspective (the Case of the Moscow Spiritist Circle)
T2  - GOSUDARSTVO RELIGIYA TSERKOV V ROSSII I ZA RUBEZHOM
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study is to highlight the links between eschatological ideas and social/ethical beliefs of the Moscow spiritist circle who viewed their fellowship as a religious eschatological community. Eschatological doctrine of the group could be characterized both as "catastrophic" and "progressive" millennialism. Eschatological social project suggested the elimination of the border between the earthly and heavenly realms and a shift towards egalitarian social model through a total renewal of the present world. The analysis of the documents demonstrates that the circle members considered themselves as active participants of the eschatological process. According to the catastrophic worldview of the circle's members, the final battle of Good and Evil, which involves both human and spirits, is already in progress. In advance of the Apocalypse, ethical questions were crucial, because the realization of the ethical ideal was a key to salvation. The members of the circle perceived the outside world as a hostile environment and tended to redraw the boundaries between the community and the "infected" world.

TI  - Cree Relationship Mapping: <i>nehiyaw kesi wahkotohk</i> - How We Are Related
T2  - FIRST PEOPLES CHILD & FAMILY REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - nehiyaw kesi wahkotohk (how we are related) is a relationship mapping resource based in the nehiyaw (Cree) language and worldview. The relationship map was developed incrementally through a five-year process of connecting nehiyaw worldviews of child and family development with the wisdom and teachings from nehiyaw knowledge-holders. Over time, in ceremony and with many consultations with wisdom-keepers, the authors began connecting the nehiyaw teachings into a resource that would allow (mostly non-Indigenous) human service providers working with nehiyaw children, families, and communities a means to understand and honour the relational worldview and teachings of the nehiyaw people. This kinship map came to include nehiyaw kinship terms and teachings on wahkomitowin (all relations) in order to recognize all the sacred roles and responsibilities of family and community. In addition, the vital role of isihcikewin (ceremony) and the Turtle Lodge Teachings (nehiyaw stages of individual, family, and community development) became embedded within this resource, along with the foundational teachings that create balance and wellbeing that enable one to live miyo pimatisiwin (the good life).

AB  - Based on NASA's 40 years of satellite data, earth has experienced drastic climatic changes in the form of sea-level rise, an increase in oceanic and atmospheric temperatures, depletion of the Ozone layer, and decrease in sea ice and snow cover. These observations point to the fact that the world is getting warmer, which significantly impacts humans and ecological systems. Forecasting global land temperature could help to identify the extent of devasting consequences on the natural habitat and shed light on the impact of policies, designed to mitigate them. Previous studies have attempted to forecast regional temperatures using traditional machine learning models. This paper uses a standard multi-layer perceptron, a simple Recurrent Neural Network, and a Long Short-Term Memory network to forecast next month's global land temperature. Our results show that deep learning outperforms traditional machine learning models, including decision tree, random forest, and ridge regression.

TI  - Monitoring urban growth and land use changes using GIS and remote sensing: A case study of Tehsil Burewala
T2  - JOURNAL OF HIMALAYAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Geospatial data is being extensively used to monitor the changes in an urban environment and assists as a decision-making tool for sustainable urban growth of the towns and cities. Intermediate and small cities of Pakistan are also getting urbanized day by day due to population growth and infrastructure development. The tehsil Burewala is one of the intermediate tehsil of Punjab province with Burewala city as Headquarter. Burewala city is included in medium sized cities of Pakistan presenting a kind of social and economic interaction. Urban growth of the city has extended beyond the municipal limits converting peri-urban vegetation into built up land. This study is aimed to focus on analyzing the urban growth of tehsil Burewala from 1981 to 2011 using Geo-spatial techniques. The land use changes and urban growth of the tehsil were analyzed using Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) and Thematic Mapper (TM) data. The results of land cover classification revealed that built up area of the tehsil increased from 3.3% in 1981 to 4.7% in 2011. Likewise, vegetation cover of the tehsil is also increased from 66% in 1981 to 81% in 2011. The change detection analysis further depicted the conversion of barren land into agriculture in four rural areas of the city, while peri-urban agriculture is converted into built up assisted by residential and commercial development of the tehsil. The urban growth of the city is increased at the rate of 4.2% from 1981 to 2001 and 2% from 2001 to 2011. GIS based analysis of land use maps also revealed an increase in built up from 29% in 1981 to 62% in 2011. Remote sensing and GIS based analysis of urban growth of intermediate cities can be proved as basis of urban planning and management for decision makers.

TI  - CARTESIAN PERSONAL METAPHYSICS
T2  - ANTHROPOLOGICAL MEASUREMENTS OF PHILOSOPHICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. To consider the personal nature of Cartesian metaphysics. Its implementation involves: a) outlining methodological changes in the philosophy of the twentieth century; b) analysis of ways to interpret anthropological component of philosophizing in Descartes studies; c) appeal to Descartes' texts to clarify the authentic form of his interpretation of metaphysics. Theoretical basis. I base my view of Descartes' legacy on the conceptual positions of phenomenology, existentialism and hermeneutics. Originality. Based on Descartes' own concept of teaching, the author substantiates the personal nature of Cartesian metaphysics. Important prerequisites for its comprehension are attention to the ethical motive as the driving force of philosophizing and recognition of the importance of the poetic worldview. The idea of the basic role of poetics finds its meaningful confirmation in the texts of the philosopher, who interprets the main areas of philosophy (science, morality and medicine) as the forms of art. Conclusions. Based on his own vision of anthropology and metaphysics as the forms of completion of the revolution initiated by Copernicus, the author defends the idea of the constitutive presence of personality in Descartes' metaphysics. In the process of studying the research literature, methodological guidelines are outlined in the form of the importance of personal determination of the search for truth, the key role of ethical motive and art as components of philosophizing. The thesis about the poetic form of presentation of metaphysics by Descartes as a form of fixation of its personal dimension is substantiated.

TI  - ASSESSING INTER-SEASONAL VARIATIONS OF VEGETATION COVER AND LAND SURFACE TEMPERATURE IN THE NCR USING MODIS DATA
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Complex land use/land cover (LULC) patterns were investigated in the National Capital Region, India (NCR). India have a major impact on prevailing surface temperature circumstances. Various studies have been undertaken to establish the relationship between Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) in various geographic regions and ecosystems over the past two decades. However, studies aiming to understand the seasonal variation of environmental conditions, especially the thermal environment at the regional level are missing in NCR. This study employs MODIS satellite imagery to assess the temporal relationship between land surface temperature mechanics for LULC and vegetation cover in the NCR over five seasons. Results showed that concerning the scrubland/fallow land areas and agricultural land, the difference between the maximum and minimum temperature is the highest for all seasons, largely corresponding to NCR Cities' peripheral areas. The LST plays a significant role in NDVI related to vegetation vigour and growth in the NCR. The study shows that the seasonal distribution of LST needs to be overcome with cover and some other measures.

AB  - The changes observed in forest line, have recently drawn much interest, in part because forest line altitude may be used as an indicator of environmental changes.Forest line ecotone located in the zone between closed forest and to treeless herbaceous vegetation, are transitional areas are widely used as indicators for the observation of landscape response to climate change. The objective of this study was to evaluate the changes in time of the forest line at six mountains in mainland Greece from 1945 to 2019. Aerial, remote-sensing data acquired in 1945 and 2007 were processed for information extraction through a visual interpretation approach. Subsequently, the 2007 forest line and canopy cover maps served as reference for developing a modelling procedure based on freely satellite data and extrapolate the forest line predictions over 2019.Spectral and texture predictor variables were extracted from Landsat 5 imagery captured in summer 2007 and used as input to Random Forest models. All models for the various scenes resulted a coefficient of determination of more than 0.6 for tree canopy cover density estimation.The developed RF models for tree canopy cover estimation were applied to Landsat-8 surface reflectance scenes covering the respective geographical extent. Finally, the forest line and tree canopy cover maps, were overlaid within a GIS environment and changes were detected. The change detection procedure revealed both an upslope shift of the forest line as well as an increase in the tree canopy cover in these areas. From these changes, significant implications for ecosystem functioning and ecosystem services provision are likely to occur.

TI  - RECEPTION OF AUSTRIAN EXPRESSIONISM IN CZECH POETRY
T2  - KNJIZEVNA SMOTRA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Austrian expressionist poet Georg Trakl (1887-1914) had a significant influence on the twentieth-century Czech literature, especially thanks to the early translations of his poetry into Czech by Bohuslav Reynek (1917 and 1924) and later by Ludvik Kundera (1965 and 1995). Numerous translators and poets dealt with Trakl's poetry. At the center of the inquiry is the question of the dissemination of this influence among the Moravian poets - in whose poems and in what way Trakl's work finds its reflection. In the early 1930s collections of young Moravian poets appeared that responded to the previous literary era of poetism, which was characterized by carefree and optimistic worldview. For these poets - Frantipek Halas, Vilem Zavada and Jan ZahradniEek - the motifs of autumn, mourning and death were of great importance. These poets had either a direct or indirect effect (mediated by Bohuslav Reynek's translations) of Trakl's work - similar motifs of doom appear, the same ghostly atmosphere and sometimes literal quotations. Trakl's strongest influence on Czech literature can be found in the second collection of poetry by Frantipek Halas Kohout plapi smrt (The Rooster Shuns Death, 1930). Even in the 1960s, one still speaks of a "traditional atmosphere", such as B. in the book of poems MetliEky (The Rods, 1968) by Jan Skacel. The drama Trakl (from 1998, realized as a radio play in 2002) by the young playwright Marek HoropEak has a special position. It turns out that Trakl's work has a firm place in Czech literature and still radiates to the present day.

For the individual, cultural identity is a source of social cohesion in a specific group, as the culture that is shared by its members, i.e., language, religion, tradition, customs as well as history of the group, provides them with a sense of identity, unity, bond, and togetherness. The question is: What is Korean cultural identity? Out of the vast array of elements that constitute culture, which one is the most important in understanding Korean cultural identity? Answers to the latter question may be inspired by insights from Korean philosophy, religion, literature, art, music or even food, but this paper argues that it is Korean values which form the core of Korean cultural identity. In particular, the paper argues that Korean values which derive from shamanism and Confucianism, such as this-worldliness, belief in fortune-telling, filial piety, ancestor worship, collectivism, education, and emphasis on hierarchy, still exert a strong influence on shaping Korean cultural identity. As the most important repository of Korean culture, the values of these two traditional religions reveal the time-honored patterns of thought and behavior that still define the Korean character, their worldview, mindset and collective consciousness. These values also bring to light the ideals with which how they make sense of the world and their lives. In exploring the Korean values-cultural identity nexus, the paper refers to the relevant literature as well as various survey data on Korean values.

TI  - Fusion of Sentinel-1 data with Sentinel-2 products to overcome non-favourable atmospheric conditions for the delineation of inundation maps
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - 729Sentinel-1 data are an alternative for monitoring flooded inland surfaces during cloudy periods. Supervised classification approaches with a single-trained model for the entire image demonstrate poor accuracy due to confusing backscatter conditions of the inundated areas in relation with the prevailing land cover features. This study follows instead a pixel-centric approach, which exploits the varying backscatter values of each pixel through a time series of Sentinel-1 images to train local Random Forest classification models per 3x3 pixels, and classifies each pixel in the target Sentinel-1 image, accordingly. Reference training data is retrieved from the timely close Sentinel-2-derived inundation maps. This study aims to identify the furthest mean day difference between the target Sentinel-1 image and available Sentinel-2 high accurate inundation maps (kappa coefficient-k > 0.9) that allows for the estimation of credible inundation maps for the Sentinel-1 target date. Various combinations of Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 training datasets are examined. The evaluation for eight target dates confirms that a Sentinel-1 inundation map with a k of 0.75 on average can be generated, when mean day difference is less than 30 days. The increment of the considered Sentinel-2 maps allows for the estimation of Sentinel-1 inundation maps with higher accuracy.

AB  - In UAE, the habitat land use land cover (LULC) map is currently available only for Abu Dhabi emirate. This work aims to develop a generic workflow for producing maps for the entire UAE and also the basis of updating the land cover classification maps for entire region of UAE very frequently. Experiments are presented using temporal images acquired front Worldview-2 for detailed habitat sub-type classification in a small region of Abu Dhabi and Sentinel-2 imagery for habitat type classification for extending the work towards the Northern Emirates. In the proposed approach, we first perform an automatic change detection using statistical methods such as principal component analysis. Then we make use of Random Forest algorithm applied on the Fully-Connected features obtained front AlexNet framework using the inputs front unchanged locations. The training labels are thus generated using the baseline classified maps of Abu Dhabi. Eventually, our aim is to develop a robust classification approach based on automatic change detection to update the baseline maps for the entire country in short time intervals. The ultimate objective is to conduct this experiment using high resolution WorldView-2 satellite imagery but in this work, we apply our idea to Sentinel-2 imagery for higher level habitat type classification for the Northern Emirates. This paper presents the updates in the project which is expected to complete in 2020.

TI  - A Study of Local Climate Zones in Abu Dhabi with Urban Weather Stations and Numerical Simulations
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In many cities that have experienced rapid growth like Abu Dhabi, urban microclimate scenarios evolve rapidly as well and it is important to study the urban thermal dynamics continuously. The Local Climate Zone (LCZ) classification considers factors related to the physical properties like surface cover and surface structure of the city which allow to analyze urban heat flows. Abu Dhabi city is rapidly expanding and is characterized by highly heterogeneous types of built forms that comprise mainly of old mid-rise and modern high-rise buildings with varied degrees of vegetation cover in different parts of the city. The fact that it is a coastal city in a desert environment makes it quite unique. This paper presents an approach of studying urban heat flows in such heterogeneous setup. First, the city is classified into local climate zones using images acquired by Landsat Satellite. Numerical simulations are performed in the designated LCZs using a computational fluid dynamics software, Envi-met. The results of Envi-met are calibrated and validated using in-situ measurements across all four seasons. The calibrated models are then applied to study entire Abu Dhabi island across different seasons. The results indicate a clear presence of urban heat island (UHI) effect when averaged over the full day which is varying in different zones. The zones with high vegetation do not show large average UHI effect whereas the effect is significant in densely built zones. The study also validates previous observations on the inversion of UHI effect during the day and in terms of diurnal response.

TI  - Cross-Comparison between Landsat 8 (OLI) and Landsat 7 (ETM+) Derived Vegetation Indices in a Mediterranean Environment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat 8 is the most recent generation of Landsat satellite missions that provides remote sensing imagery for earth observation. The Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images, together with Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared sensor (TIRS) represent fundamental tools for earth observation due to the optimal combination of the radiometric and geometric images resolution provided by these sensors. However, there are substantial differences between the information provided by Landsat 7 and Landsat 8. In order to perform a multi-temporal analysis, a cross-comparison between image from different Landsat satellites is required. The present study is based on the evaluation of specific intercalibration functions for the standardization of main vegetation indices calculated from the two Landsat generation images, with respect to main land use types. The NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index), LSWI (Land Surface Water Index), NBR (Normalized Burn Ratio), VIgreen (Green Vegetation Index), SAVI (Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index), and EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) have been derived from August 2017 ETM+ and OLI images (path: 188; row: 32) for the study area (Basilicata Region, located in the southern part of Italy) selected as a highly representative of Mediterranean environment. Main results show slight differences in the values of average reflectance for each band: OLI shows higher values in the near-infrared (NIR) wavelength for all the land use types, while in the short-wave infrared (SWIR) the ETM+ shows higher reflectance values. High correlation coefficients between different indices (in particular NDVI and NDWI) show that ETM+ and OLI can be used as complementary data. The best correlation in terms of cross-comparison was found for NDVI, NDWI, SAVI, and EVI indices; while according to land use classes, statistically significant differences were found for almost all the considered indices calculated with the two sensors.

TI  - Elucidating the phenology of the Sundarbans mangrove forest using 18-year time series of MODIS vegetation indices
T2  - TROPICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests are the most carbon-rich ecosystems in the world however, baseline information on its phenology is poor. Information on seasonal changes in canopy greenness, which reflects the level of photosynthetic activity, is helpful for understanding seasonal patterns of carbon uptake by mangrove forests. To elucidate the periodicity, timing, and length of the active photosynthetic season, we examined temporal patterns in enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from 18-year (2001-2018) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer images for four major forest types in the Sundarbans, Bangladesh. We identified a dominant cycle for the time-series of EVI and NDVI after Fourier transformation. We also estimated four phenological dates among the forest types: the start of the season (SOS), time of maximum greenness (MaxGreen), end of the season (EOS), and length of the season (LOS). Fourier analysis revealed that both the NDVI and EVI exhibited distinct cycles per year for all forest types, suggesting that there are annual cycles of canopy greenness. The SOS as estimated using the EVI and NDVI was consistently from late May to mid-June across forest types. However, the MaxGreen, EOS and LOS estimated varied between the two indices. Because EVI-based phenological dates match better with phenological information at the ground level than do NDVI-based dates, the EVI would be better than the NDVI for depicting changes in canopy greenness. The results of this study provide baseline information for future phenological changes in the Sundarbans.

TI  - Nomadic Livestock Breeding in Kalmyk Folklore
T2  - NOVYI FILOLOGICHESKII VESTNIK-NEW PHILOLOGICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with the elements of livestock breeding culture present in Kalmyk folklore. Livestock breeding has traditionally been a key source of livelihood for nomadic populations. The former largely included the four species, such as cattle, sheep, horses, and camels. Livestock breeding experiences and related rites and customs have been preserved in the folklore tradition, and constitute an essential stratum of nomadic culture. The article seeks to analyze some understudied aspects of nomadic practices, economic patterns, the four livestock species and their characteristics traced in Kalmyk fairy tales, Jangar epic, ceremonial and aphoristic poetry. The work shows that the concept of 'nomadism' (Kalm nyp, Rus. Kotteebe) is multicomponent enough, which is due to constant migrations of nomads Another aspect of the concept implies slow movement of horsemen and others nested in wheel yurts or carts next to flocks and herds, with occasional stops; nomadic migration is compared to vanishing of silhouettes, cessation of any movement within eyesight, 'empty' space being a sign of desolation. In Turko-Mongolian folklore, livestock serves as a symbol of wealth and prosperity. Over centuries, the Kalmyks have accumulated most extensive livestock breeding experiences. Their nomadic worldview, centuries-old practices, observations, thoughts and wisdom preserved in folklore attest to the fact that this used to be their main occupation.

TI  - WINDTHROW IDENTIFICATION WITH C-SAR TIME SERIES
T2  - GEODETSKI VESTNIK
M3  - Article
AB  - A strong windthrow affected many forests in Slovenia and northern Italy on the night of the 29th and the 30th of October, 2018. In this paper, we propose a new methodology for windthrow identification, comprising two new indexes, PCA-CI for evaluating change detection and PCA-WI for the identification of windthrows by analysing the time series of C-SAR Sentinel-1 data. The proposed methodology, unlike the previous studies on the identification of windthrows, does not subtract the values of dual and single polarised VH-VV data combinations, but proposes a new approach with a multivariate transformation of dimensionality reduction of the time series of the dual and single polarised data in two different time frames.

TI  - Performance evaluation of urban corridors using the speed profile data of automobiles
T2  - TRAVEL BEHAVIOUR AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The macroscopic traffic flow parameters derived as the aggregate outcome of traffic conditions over a period appears inadequate for capturing the variations in quality of service experienced by the users (TRB, 2010). Hence, the objective of the study reported here is to develop the Automobile Level of Service (ALOS) criteria for the heterogeneous two-lane undivided urban corridors, considering the manoeuvrability of individual automobiles. The speed profiles of the motorised two-wheelers, three-wheelers, and cars were collected from the urban corridors of Kerala, India, using GPS based mobile application. From the speed profile data, the speed and time variation characteristics were studied in detail. The microscopic parameters depicting the quality of travel were identified as speed ratio (SR), coefficient of variation of speed (CV), and congestion index (CI). Conventional linear regression models were developed with a 95% confidence interval for predicting the quality measures and validated with 20% of the collected data. K-means clustering technique was applied to define the threshold values of the ALOS classes. Six specific ALOS classes were identified and validated with silhouette coefficient values. The criterion values estimated for the heterogeneous traffic condition were significantly differing from the homogeneous traffic values given by HCM 2010. Hence this method can be used for assessing the performance of heterogeneous two-lane undivided urban corridors from the individual drivers' point of view.

AB  - VideoSAR is the latest technology, where the radar system enables continuous data collection and processes SAR imagery as a sequence of images continuously when the radar platform either flies by or circles the region of interest. In this paper, the Synthetic Aperture Radar video is generated from Strip map mode and Spot light mode of SAR images. In case of strip map images to video conversion, the continuous image sequence is formed by mosaicing of multiple image strips and or by overlapping of batches. In spot mode, the target of interest is fixed and platform with radar flies by or in circular path and looks at same region of interest. Two to five spot images are considered per second to form the Spot video for 24 frames per second. Interpolation techniques are performed in between the spot images to make it into 24 frames. The results of the airborne Strip map and Spot mode SAR videos are given in the paper. The frame rates also analyzed for the airborne radar of the different velocities, ranges and resolution of images to produce better SAR video.

AB  - The study area lies in the Northeastern part of the Gavilgrah fault vicinity, which is one of the essential tectonic elements of the Son-Narmada-Tapti lineament, trending ENE-WSE direction. In this study field, data and satellite data observation are used for drainage characteristics of Wan river sub-basins. The course of Wan River is mostly controlled by the Gavilgrah fault and associated tectonic elements. The Wan River, which crosses the North's fault, exhibits two river terraces that rise and continue downstream, where the river flows on the down-thrown block. The drainage characteristics of the study area were investigated by using the LISS-III satellite data. The study of neotectonism is based on field evidence and drainage pattern. The nature of the drainage pattern in the study area shows dendritic, rectangular, and parallel together and shows evidence of neotectonic activity in the study area. The longitudinal river profile, the shape of the basin, gradient fluctuations, and valley incision, and their result also indicate neotectonic activities in the study area.

TI  - Lymphatic filariasis in Fiji: progress towards elimination, 1997-2007.
T2  - Tropical medicine and health
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a major public health problem in the Pacific Region, including in Fiji. Through transmission by the mosquito vector Aedes, Fiji has suffered the burden of remaining endemic with LF despite efforts at elimination prior to 1999. In the year 1999, Fiji agreed to take part in the Pacific Programme for Elimination of LF (PacELF) and the Global Programme to Eliminate LF.METHODS: This study reviewed and collated past data on LF in Fiji between 1997 and 2007. Sources included published papers as well as unpublished PacELF and WHO program meeting and survey reports. Records were held at Fiji's Department of Health and Medical Services, James Cook University and the WHO office in Suva, Fiji.RESULTS: Baseline surveys between 1997 and 2002 showed that Fiji was highly endemic for LF with an estimated 16.6% of the population antigen positive and 6.3% microfilaria positive at that time. Five rounds of annual mass drug administration (MDA) using albendazole and diethylcarbamazine commenced in 2002. Programmatic coverage reported was 58-70% per year, but an independent coverage survey in 2006 in Northern Division after the fifth MDA suggested that actual coverage may have been higher. Monitoring of the program consisted of antigen prevalence surveys in all ages with sentinel and spot check surveys carried out in 2002 (pre MDA), 2004, and 2005, together with knowledge, attitude, and practice surveys. The stop-MDA survey (C survey) in 2007 was a nationwide stratified cluster survey of all ages according to PacELF guidelines, designed to sample by administrative division to identify areas still needing MDA. The national antigen prevalence in 2007 was reduced by more than a third to 9.5%, ranging from 0.9% in Western Division to 15.4% in Eastern Division, while microfilaria prevalence was reduced by almost four-fifths to 1.4%. Having not reached the target threshold of 1% prevalence in all ages, Fiji wisely decided to continue MDA after 2007 but to move from nationwide implementation to four (later five) separate evaluation units with independent timelines using global guidelines, building on program experience to put more emphasis on increasing coverage through prioritized communication strategies, community participation, and morbidity alleviation.CONCLUSION: Fiji conducted nationwide MDA for LF annually between 2002 and 2006, monitored by extensive surveys of prevalence, knowledge, and coverage. From a high baseline prevalence in all divisions, large reductions in overall and age-specific prevalence were achieved, especially in the prevalence of microfilariae, but the threshold for stopping MDA was not reached. Fiji has a large rural and geographically widespread population, program management was not consistent over this period, and coverage achieved was likely not optimal in all areas. After learning from these many challenges and activities, Fiji was able to build on the progress achieved and the heterogeneity observed in prevalence to realign towards a more stratified and improved program after 2007. The information presented here will assist the country to progress towards validating elimination in subsequent years.

AB  - The quite recent availability of satellite stereo pairs allows users to extract three-dimensional data that can be used in different domain of applications, such as urban planning, energy, emergency management, etc. This research paper aims to extract digital surface models (DSM) from satellite stereo pairs acquired by three different satellites (Deimos-2, Pleiades-1 and WorldView-3) over the area of the city of Turin (Italy). The results are then assessed in term of geometric accuracy comparing them with a cadastral point height dataset, used as benchmark. The comparison, in terms of difference height values (between the DSM and the benchmark), is calculated on a set of sample points. Just two of the generated DSM guaranteed a high height accuracy level useful for the domain of application, such as existing cartography update, emergency management, building damage assessment, roof slope and solar incoming radiation assessment. Further developments will investigate different blending techniques and software that could provide more accurate results.

T2  - BOSQUE
M3  - Article
AB  - In southeastern Mexico, forest fires threaten the biodiversity in tropical rainforests. The aim of this work was to analyze the spatial and temporal distribution of burned areas in Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve and its area of influence over three years: 1998, 2003 and 2015. The Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) and the Burnt Area Index for MODIS (BAIM) were extracted from near-infrared and shortwave-infrared Landsat imagery; their accuracy was validated with ASTER images. As a result, 1,628 polygons of burned areas larger than 10 ha were delimited, covering 86,500 ha and representing 11.2 % of the study area: 7.7 % in 1998, 3.2 % in 2003 and 0.4 % in 2015. Burned areas of under 50 ha are of common occurrence each year, whereas the largest polygons (1,000 - 3,000 ha) are considered exceptional and are present only under the severe influence of El Nino weather phenomenon. The highest proportion of burned areas (54.7 %) affected agricultural lands, followed by secondary vegetation (34 %), tropical forests (7.6 %), temperate forests (2.1 %), savannah (1 %) and tular marshlands (0.6 %). Regarding burned areas, 20 % occurred within the protected area. The decreasing tendency of burned areas confirms their relationship with the intensity of ENSO. Cartographic representation of burned areas is an effective means of evaluating the effects of fire management programs and biodiversity conservation of tropical rainforests in protected areas.

TI  - Atmospheric Correction of Satellite Ocean Color Remote Sensing in the Presence of High Aerosol Loads
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The coverage of valid pixels of remote-sensing reflectance (Rrs) from ocean color imagery is relatively low due to the presence of clouds. In fact, it is also related to the presence of high aerosol optical depth (AOD) and other factors. In order to increase the valid coverage of satellite-retrieved products, a layer removal scheme for atmospheric correction (LRSAC) has been developed to process the ocean color data. The LRSAC used a five-layer structure including atmospheric absorption layer, Rayleigh scattering layer, aerosol scattering layer, sea surface reflection layer, and water-leaving reflectance layer to deal with the relationship of the components of the atmospheric correction. A nonlinear approach was used to solve the multiple reflections of the interface between two adjoining layers and a step-by-step procedure was used to remove effects of each layer. The LRSAC was used to process data from the sea-viewing wide field-of-view sensor (SeaWiFS) and the results were compared with standard products. The average of valid pixels of the global daily Rrs images of the standard products from 1997 to 2010 is only 11.5%, while it reaches up to 30.5% for the LRSAC. This indicates that the LRSAC recovers approximately 1.65 times of invalid pixels as compared with the standard products. Eight-day standard composite images exhibit many large areas with invalid values due to the presence of high AOD, whereas these areas are filled with valid pixels wusing the LRSAC. The ratio image of the mean valid pixel of the LRSAC to that of the standard products indicates that the number of valid pixels of the LRSAC increases with an increase of AOD. The LRSAC can increase the number of valid pixels by more than two times in about 33.8% of ocean areas with high AOD values. The accuracy of Rrs from the LRSAC was validated using the following two in situ datasets: the Marine Optical BuoY (MOBY) and the NASA bio-Optical Marine Algorithm Dataset (NOMAD). Most matchup pairs are distributed around the 1:1 line indicating that the systematic bias of the LRSAC is relatively small. The global mean relative error (MRE) of Rrs is 7.9% and the root mean square error (RMSE) is 0.00099 sr(-1) for the MOBY matchups. Similarly, the MRE and RMSE are 2.1% and 0.0025 sr(-1) for the NOMAD matchups, respectively. The accuracy of LRSAC was also evaluated by different groups of matchups according to the increase of AOD values, indicating that the errors of Rrs were little affected by the presence of high AOD values. Therefore, the LRSAC can significantly improve the coverage of valid pixels of Rrs with a similar accuracy in the presence of high AOD.

TI  - Accelerated retreat of coastal glaciers in the Western Prince William Sound, Alaska
T2  - ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Analyzing historical maps and Landsat imagery indicates that coastal glaciers in the western Prince William Sound (PWS) have retreated since the end of the Little Ice Age, exhibiting accelerated retreat after the mid-2000s. A multitemporal inventory of 43 glaciers was developed using historical field observations, topographic maps, and Landsat imagery. Area and length measurements are derived from digitized outlines, and center lines are derived from a semi-automatic, geographic information systems (GIS)-based algorithm. Land-based glaciers retreated at a peak rate of 48 m a(-1) from the mid-2000s to 2018, more than doubling the average rate of retreat (22 m a(-1)) for the preceding fifty-year period. From similar to 1950 to 2018, the total area of land-based glaciers decreased by 228 km(2), with 36 percent of the glacier loss occurring after the mid-2000s. Simple upscaling of area and volume changes to unmeasured glaciers across the entire PWS resulted in an estimated aggregate glacier mass loss of 379 Gt, equivalent to a 1.047 mm rise in sea level from the 1950s to 2018. Tidewater glaciers respond asynchronously with differing periods of peak area and length loss and lower average rate of retreat compared to land-based glaciers. Glacier retreat correlates with increased summer and winter temperatures and decreased winter precipitation.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy with intraoperative touch imprint cytology (TIC) in breast cancer: experience of a mild-volume center
T2  - GIORNALE DI CHIRURGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Although considered the gold standard in treatment of EBC, sentinel node biopsy still remains a debated issue. What to do in case of positive sentinel node and the need of intraoperative histological examination are the most topics under discussion. In this study we have retrospectively evaluate our case series of 359 sentinel node biopsy in the managing of breast cancer from January 2011 to December 2018, focusing on the TIC technique for performing intraoperative examination. It results in 12,8% "FALSE NEGATIVE" rate, in which only 4,2% in macrometastases, with an overall sensitivity of 68,4% (macrometastases: 86%; micrometastases: 11%), overall specificity of 98,7% and an overall accuracy of 89,7%. The intraoperative examination of SLN allows to reduce delayed surgery procedures and greater therapeutic safety in case of mastectomy. The TIC method can be considered valid, simple and rapid in identifying macrometastases, also allowing to avoid under-staging. The low sensitivity for micrometastases is not a limit, considering that recent evidence has drastically reduced the indications for ALND in these cases. Further ongoing trials and the possible validation of NOMOGRAMMS and SCORE are necessary to identify low risk cases in which to definitively omit the ALND and/or even the SLNB itself.

TI  - A Survey of Rate-Optimal Power Domain NOMA With Enabling Technologies of Future Wireless Networks
T2  - IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS AND TUTORIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - The ambitious high data-rate applications in the envisioned future beyond fifth-generation (B5G) wireless networks require new solutions, including the advent of more advanced architectures than the ones already used in 5G networks, and the coalition of different communications schemes and technologies to enable these applications requirements. Among the candidate communications schemes for future wireless networks are non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) schemes that allow serving more than one user in the same resource block by multiplexing users in other domains than frequency or time. In this way, NOMA schemes tend to offer several advantages over orthogonal multiple access (OMA) schemes such as improved user fairness and spectral efficiency, higher cell-edge throughput, massive connectivity support, and low transmission latency. With these merits, NOMA-enabled transmission schemes are being increasingly looked at as promising multiple access schemes for future wireless networks. When the power domain is used to multiplex the users, it is referred to as the power domain NOMA (PD-NOMA). In this paper, we survey the integration of PD-NOMA with the enabling communications schemes and technologies that are expected to meet the various requirements of B5G networks. In particular, this paper surveys the different rate optimization scenarios studied in the literature when PD-NOMA is combined with one or more of the candidate schemes and technologies for B5G networks including multiple-input-single-output (MISO), multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO), massive-MIMO (mMIMO), advanced antenna architectures, higher frequency millimeter-wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz) communications, advanced coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmission and reception schemes, cooperative communications, cognitive radio (CR), visible light communications (VLC), unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted communications and others. The considered system models, the optimization methods utilized to maximize the achievable rates, and the main lessons learnt on the optimization and the performance of these NOMA-enabled schemes and technologies are discussed in detail along with the future research directions for these combined schemes. Moreover, the role of machine learning in optimizing these NOMA-enabled technologies is addressed.

TI  - [The importance of the extracapsular extension of the sentinel node metastasis in the surgical treatment of breast cancer].
T2  - Magyar sebeszet
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Introduction: The introduction of sentinel node biopsy (SNB) has led to a significant decrease of axillary lymph node dissections (ALND). The importance of the extracapsular extension (ECE) in the sentinel lymph node (SN) remains unclear. Method: The data of 635 patients with T1-T2N0M0 invasive breast cancer who underwent SNB between 2014 and 2018 were retrospectively analysed. 25% of the SNB patients (158) had metastasis in the SNs. These patients were grouped based on the presence or absence of ECE. The main objective of our study was to analyse the occurrence of massive (>3) node metastasis in the case of ECE negative and ECE positive patients, where ALND was performed. Results: There were 91/158 patients (58%) in the ECE negative group and 67/158 patients (42%) in the ECE positive group. ALND was performed in 42% of the ECE negative and in 69% of the ECE positive patients. There were no significant differences in the mean age of the patients; size, histological type and grade of the tumours, presence of lymphovascular invasion and proportion of hormone and HER2 receptor positivities. In the ECE negative ALND group, pN1 involvement was 82%, pN2+pN3 involvement represented 18% of cases. In the ECE positive ALND group, pN1 involvement was 60%, pN2+pN3 involvement was found in 40% of cases. The presence of ECE was associated with greater axillary disease burden. These results show a significant difference (p = 0.038). Conclusions: ECE of the SN is an important predictor for non-sentinel lymph node involvement. These data suggest, when ECE is confirmed, it is a further factor to be considered in deciding about ALND.

TI  - Large-scale two-phase estimation of wood production by poplar plantations exploiting Sentinel-2 data as auxiliary information
T2  - SILVA FENNICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Growing demand for wood products. combined with efforts to conserve natural forests, have supported a steady increase in the global extent of planted forests. Here, a two-phase sampling strategy for large-scale assessment of the total area and the total wood volume of fast-growing forest tree crops within agricultural land is presented. The first phase is performed using tessellation stratified sampling on high-resolution remotely sensed imagery and is sufficient for estimating the total area of plantations by means of a Monte Carlo integration estimator. The second phase is performed using stratified sampling of the plantations selected in the first phase and is aimed at estimating total wood volume by means of an approximation of the first-phase Horvitz-Thompson estimator. Vegetation indices from Sentinel-2 are exploited as freely available auxiliary information in a linear regression estimator to improve the design-based precision of the estimator based on the sole sample data. Estimators of the totals and of the design-based variances of total estimators are presented. A simulation study is developed in order to check the design-based performance of the two alternative estimators under several artificial distributions supposed for poplar plantations (random, clustered, spatially trended). An application in Northern Italy is also reported. The regression estimator turns out to be invariably better than that based on the sole sample information. Possible integrations of the proposed sampling scheme with conventional national forest inventories adopting tessellation stratified sampling in the first phase are discussed.

T2  - NATIVA
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this work was to map the areas susceptible to the occurrence of fires at the Taim Ecological Station, Rio Grande do Sul. In order to obtain the static and dynamic variables, Landsat 8 satellite images and Radar images were used to determine the topography of the study area. As dynamic variables were used the precipitation, temperature and land use and coverage, while static variables were hypsometry, slope and distance of roads. Each variable was stratified and numerically weighted as to its susceptibility to fire occurrence. The dynamic and static variables generated were integrated using a weighted equation resulting in fire risk for the study area. The central region of the Taim Ecological Station presented higher susceptibility to fires, encompassing the high risk class, totaling 4,219.56 ha (41.61%), while the peripheral regions had a very low risk of occurrence of fires, covering 5,419.35 ha (53.44%). The variables of greatest contribution to the occurrence of fires corresponded to the land use and land cover and the temperature, being the areas of greater risk in the central region and near the roads, in which they are occupied by the native field. Thus, these sites should have greater attention and resources to combat possible fires.

TI  - Archaeology and Dams in Southeastern Turkey: Post-Flooding Damage Assessment and Safeguarding Strategies on Cultural Heritage
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDITERRANEAN ARCHAEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The construction of dams is an ever-growing threat to cultural heritage, particularly in an age of climate change and narrowly focused development policies. In analyzing as a case study three major reservoirs in the Middle Euphrates river valley in southeastern Turkey (Ataturk, Birecik and Karkamis), we developed a Post-Flooding Damage Assessment (PFDA) to evaluate the impact of dams on archaeological sites. Our PFDA, consisting of an analysis of cross-correlations between multi-temporal Landsat imagery, geographical spatial datasets and archaeological data from surveys and excavations, provides an unprecedented detailed overview of the loss of especially significant cultural landscapes, and also highlights the limited accuracy of pre-flooding archaeological surveys and excavations. We conclude with recommendations for improving how rescue archaeological projects targeting endangered cultural landscapes are designed, with an immediately achievable target of better documenting cultural heritage threatened by dams.

Importantly, until the discovery of toll-like receptors (TLRs), a role of neutrophils in adaptive immunity was limited to the effector stage of humoral response and phagocytosis of opsonried antigens. Moreover, in common opinion, neutrophils, as well as the entire innate immune system, were not functionally associated with adaptive immunity. At the time we demonstrated protein chlorination by HOCI, the major product of neutrophil MPO-halide system enhances protein immunogenicity. Based on this discovery, we proposed, as the first, a new role for neutrophils as APC-accessory cells involved in the induction stage of adaptive immunity. Thereafter, we developed our theory concerning the role of neutrophils as the cells which link innate and adaptive immunity. We proposed that protein modification by HOCI may act as a neutrophildependent molecular tagging system, by which sentinel dendritic cells can faster recognise pathogen-derived antigens. Contemporaneously, it was demonstrated that taurine, the most abundant free amino acid in neutrophil cytosol and the major scavenger of HOCI, is a part of the oxidant antioxidant network and is responsible for the regulation and termination of acute inflammation. Moreover, it has been described, that taurine chloramine (TauCI), the physiological products of the reaction of HOC1 with taurine, show anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory properties.In this review, the role of HOCI, taurine and TauCI in innate and adaptive immunity will he discussed.

AB  - The inference quality of machine learning solutions based on neural networks is highly related with the quality and quantity of training data. This paper proposes and experiments a set of algorithms and techniques to enhance the quality and quantity of training data based on satellite images. The results show that the algorithms can eliminate noise from different areas of interest, providing viable data for further processing. The achievements are assessed by the soil classification techniques on local Transylvanian areas.

T2  - EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEMS XXV
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXV
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Landsat 9 is currently undergoing testing at the integrated observatory level in preparation for launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base in 2021. Landsat 9 will replace Landsat 7 in orbit, 8 days out of phase with Landsat 8. Landsat 9 is largely a copy of Landsat 8 in terms of instrumentation, with an Operational Land Imager (OLI), model #2 and a Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS), model #2. The TIRS-2 is more significantly changed from TIRS with increased redundancy, as well as changes to the telescope baffling to improve stray light control and a revised scene select mirror encoder mechanism. Data quality of the Landsat 9 instruments is comparable to, or better than the Landsat 8 ones, with an increase to 14 bits of data transmitted and more detailed pre-launch characterization for OLI-2, and with more detailed characterization of the TIRS-2 pre-launch, in addition to the improved stray light control. The performance of the two instruments is summarized and compared to that of the Landsat 8 instruments.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy in clinically node negative patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUON
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: The incidence of histologically proven lymph node metastases (LNM) in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) reaches 80%. According to different guidelines surgical management in clinically N0 (cN0) patients with PTC remains controversial. The purpose of this study was to investigate if sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNb) using methylene blue dye is accurate in the detection of LNM in the lateral neck compartment in cNO patients with PTC.Methods: Enrolled were 153 cN0 patients with PTC. All underwent total thyroidectomy with central neck dissection and SLNb in the lateral neck compartment, using methylene blue dye as marker. Selective modified radical neck dissection was performed in cases of metastatic SLNs.Results: Neck LNMs were histologically verified in 40.9% of the cases. Predictive factors for LNM were: males, younger than 45 years, tumors greater than 1cm, capsular and vascular invasion. The central neck compartment of LNM was predictive for lateral LNM in 80.5% of the cases. LNM were confirmed in 24% of SLNs in the lateral neck compartment, which were over 56% predictive of LNM to other dissected lateral LN. SLN identification rate (IR) was 91.8%. Sensitivity, specificity, positive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were 85.7, 96.7, 88.3 and 95.9%, respectively. The overall accuracy of the method was 94.3%, with probability of 91.2% (ROC AUC, 95% CI; 84.2-98.3).Conclusion: The proposed method of SLN biopsy using methylene blue dye is feasible, safe and accurate in the detection of LNM in the lateral neck compartment and may help in the decision to perform selective modified radical neck dissection in cN0 patients with PTC.

AB  - Profile of dielectric constant of a substance or a surface indicates its electromagnetic parameters. The profile is associated with electric polarization, permeability with magnetic polarization, and conductivity with an electric current field. In the practice, the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and the Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) are commonly utilized to determine how much velocity of a substance and its scattering profiles. However, information about the profile radar scattering mechanisms in tropical peatland is still limited. Therefore, we evaluated dielectric constant from the field using GPR and estimated its spatial variation from a dual-polarization Sentinel-1A type C-band SAR in Ogan Komering Ilir, South Sumatera Province, Indonesia. We measured dielectric constant at the two major types of land use, namely oil palm and acacia. Results indicated that the dielectric constant derived from SAR Sentinel-1A and GPR are affected by peat moisture. It increases as the peat moisture increases. Results show that during peat dry conditions, the profiles of dielectric constant derived from dual-pol Sentinel-1A images are relatively similar to the dielectric constant of peat in Siak Regency. It ranges between 31.78 and 59.3. The dielectric constant derived from GPR ranges between 69 and 70.

AB  - We propose a framework to estimate high above ground biomass (AGB) from L-band SAR imagery leveraging space-borne lidars such as GEDI or ICESat-2 and repeat-pass coherence. Our results indicate we are able to overcome model saturation typically associated with purely backscatter methodologies. We validate our approach using lidar-derived AGB maps from the AfriSAR datasets at Mondah, Ogooue, and Lope. We apply our framework to UAVSAR and ALOS-2 imagery to obtain 50 meter resolution biomass maps. We obtain < 60% nRMSE (in some cases much better) with negligible relative bias using a multiscale random forest model. We illustrate that the inclusion of coherence can significantly improve high AGB estimation particularly at the coastal site Mondah.

TI  - Temporal Patterns in Illumination Conditions and Its Effect on Vegetation Indices Using Landsat on Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation indices (VI) describe vegetation structure and functioning but they are affected by illumination conditions (IC). Moreover, the fact that the effect of the IC on VI can be stronger than other biophysical or seasonal processes is under debate. Using Google Earth Engine and the latest Landsat Surface Reflectance level 1 data, we evaluated the temporal patterns of IC and two VI, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) in a mountainous tropical forest during the years 1984-2017. We evaluated IC and VI at different times, their relationship with the topography and the correlations between them. We show that IC is useful for understanding the patterns of variation between VI and IC at the pixel level using Landsat sensors. Our findings confirmed a strong correlation between EVI and IC and less between NDVI and IC. We found a significant increase in IC, EVI, and NDVI throughout time due to an improvement in the position of all Landsat sensors. Our results reinforce the need to consider IC to interpret VI over long periods using Landsat data in order to increase the precision of monitoring VI in irregular topography.

TI  - Evaluation of the LSA-SAF gross primary production product derived from SEVIRI/MSG data (MGPP)
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study is to describe a completely new 10-day gross primary production (GPP) product (MGPP LSA-411) based on data from the geostationary SEVIRI/MSG satellite within the LSA SAF (Land Surface Analysis SAF) as part of the SAF (Satellite Application Facility) network of EUMETSAT.The methodology relies on the Monteith approach. It considers that GPP is proportional to the absorbed photosynthetically active radiation APAR and the proportionality factor is known as the light use efficiency epsilon. A parameterization of this factor is proposed as the product of a epsilon(max), corresponding to the canopy functioning under optimal conditions, and a coefficient quantifying the reduction of photosynthesis as a consequence of water stress. A three years data record (2015-2017) was used in an assessment against site-level eddy covariance (EC) tower GPP estimates and against other Earth Observation (EO) based GPP products. The site-level comparison indicated that the MGPP product performed better than the other EO based GPP products with 48% of the observations being below the optimal accuracy (absolute error < 1.0 g m(-2) day(-1)) and 75% of these data being below the user requirement threshold (absolute error < 3.0 g m(-2) day(-1)). The largest discrepancies between the MGPP product and the other GPP products were found for forests whereas small differences were observed for the other land cover types. The integration of this GPP product with the ensemble of LSA-SAF MSG products is conducive to meet user needs for a better understanding of ecosystem processes and for improved understanding of anthropogenic impact on ecosystem services.

AB  - A parabolic reflectarray antenna has been proposed to generate a complete cellular coverage in transmission to provide broadband services from a communication satellite in Ka-band. Two different approaches have been evaluated to design a parabolic reflectarray able to generate four spaced beams per feed in four different combinations of frequency and polarization. A 1.8 m parabolic reflectarray has been simulated when it is illuminated by a feed block of 27 horns. The results show the capacity to generate 108 spot beams in good agreement with the requirements imposed in satellite communications. The proposed concept could be used to reduce the number of on-board antennas and feed chains required to generate a multispot coverage in Ka-band.

AB  - In order to support disaster management activities related to flood situations, an automatic system for near-real time mapping of flood extent and duration using multi-sensor satellite data is developed. The system is based on four processing chains for the automatic derivation of the inundation extent from Sentinel-1 and TerraSAR-X radar as well as from optical Sentinel-2 and Landsat data. While the systematic acquisition plan of the Sentinel-1/2 and Landsat satellites allows a continuous monitoring of inundated areas at an interval of a few days, the TerraSAR-X processing chain has to be triggered on-demand over the disaster-affected areas. Beyond flood extent masks, flood duration products are generated to indicate the temporal stability and evolution of flood events. The flood monitoring system is demonstrated on a severe flood situation in Mozambique related to cyclone Idai in 2019.

TI  - Correlation of Field-Measured and Remotely Sensed Plant Water Status as a Tool to Monitor the Risk of Drought-Induced Forest Decline
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Increased frequency of tree mortality and forest decline due to anomalous drought events calls for the adoption of effective monitoring of tree water status over large spatial and temporal scales. We correlated field-measured and remotely sensed plant water status parameters, to test the possibility of monitoring the risk of drought-induced dehydration and hydraulic failure using satellite images calibrated on reliable physiological indicators of tree hydraulics. The study was conducted during summer 2019 in the Karst plateau (NE Italy) in a woodland dominated by Fraxinus ornus L.; Sentinel-2 images were acquired on a seasonal scale on the same dates when absolute water content (AbWC), relative water content (RWC), and minimum water potential (Psi(min)) were measured in the field. Plant water status parameters were correlated with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI and NDVI 8A), normalized difference water index (NDWI), and soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI). Significant Pearson and Spearman linear correlations (alpha < 0.05) emerged between all tree-level measured variables and NDWI, while for NDVI, NDVI 8A, and SAVI no correlation was found. Our results suggest the possibility of using the NDWI as a proxy of tree water content and water potential.

TI  - Coconut Tree Stress Detection as an Indicator of Red Palm Weevil (RPW) Attack Using Sentinel Data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUILT ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The red palm weevil (RPW) is one of the worst destructive pests of palms in the world. This study focuses for the first time on the coconut tree stress detection and discrimination among different stages of red palm weevil (RPW) stress-attacks using vegetation indices (VI) and the percentage of accuracy assessed. Different spectral indices were assessed using Sentinel 2A data of year 2018. Based on field identification, four classes of coconut tree were considered and evaluated using visual maps of VI: severe, moderate, early and healthy coconut trees. Results showed that the vegetation indices Normalized Differenced Vegetation Index (NDVI), Renormalized Difference Vegetation Index (RDVI), SQRT (IR/R), Difference Vegetation Index (DVI) and Green Vegetation Index (GVI) are sensitive to coconut trees caused by RPW attacks. They discriminated among the considered classes with more than 50% accurate from census data of field observation compared with remote sensing data of Sentinel 2A image. Nevertheless, they express the healthiness of tree stress between 0.308 - 0.673 range with 55% to 91% accurate. According to these results, it was concluded that remote sensing technique using Sentinel 2A data is a promising alternative for RPW detection based on VI.

AB  - The activities of coastal and small islands communities can have an impact on the condition of the adjacent aquatic ecosystems. The magnitude of the impact depends on the type and intensity of the activities carried out. One ecosystem that is prone to be affected is the seagrass ecosystem due to its presence in shallow waters and proximity to the coast. The study was conducted to examine changes in seagrass carbon uptake on Bonebatang Island over a period of 16 years from 2001 to 2017. Estimation of carbon uptake of seven species of seagrasses, i.e., Enhalus acoroides, Thalassia hemprichii, Cymodocea rotundata, Halodule uninervis. Halophila ovalis, Halophila minor, and Syringodium isoetifolium were carried out using the oxygen change method that utilized clear bottles. The percentage of seagrass coverage was calculated using a 50cm x 50cm plot. The average composition of seagrass species from all plots and the capability of each seagrass species to uptake carbon was used as a basis to estimate the capability of seagrass to uptake the carbon per unit area. Changes in carbon uptake were determined using an approach that estimates changes in the seagrass bed areas. Landsat image analysis was used to estimate the area of seagrass in 2001, 2009, and 2017. The results showed that the area of seagrass beds in the period of 2001-2017 decreased by 8.62 ha, from 37.08 ha in 2001 to 28.46 ha in 2017 or decreased by approximately 1.54% per year. As a result of this diminishing in the area, carbon uptake by seagrasses was estimated to decrease by 19.67 MgCO2 per year from 79.62 MgCO2 per year in 2001 to 59.95 MgCO2 per year in 2017. The average decrease in a year reached 1.23 MgCO2.

TI  - Emissivity-based vegetation indices to monitor deforestation and forest degradation in the Congo Basin rainforest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING FOR AGRICULTURE, ECOSYSTEMS, AND HYDROLOGY XXII
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing for Agriculture, Ecosystems, and Hydrology XXII held at SPIE Remote Sensing Conference
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Vegetation stress is a major widespread problem in many countries because of climate change and anthropogenic activities. Deforestation and forest degradation phenomena may be caused for several reasons such as infrastructure development, agriculture, collection of wood energy, forest exploitation. Over the last decade, a severe decline in vegetation was observed in the Congo Basin rainforest, the second-largest tropical forest in the world, behind the Amazon. Therefore, actions are required to monitor and detect vegetation stresses to mitigate their negative impacts on human life, wildlife, and plant communities. Vegetation stress can be estimated using three different methods: field measurements, meteorological data, and remote sensing. The present study is mainly focused on satellite remote sensing. The main objective is to develop and test new indices of vegetation-soil dryness based on the surface emissivity. Until now, the problem has been attacked through indices such as the normalized differential vegetation index (or NDVI). The problem of NDVI is that it is a greenness index and is not capable to distinguish bare soil from senescent vegetation, whereas this distinction is important especially when forest degradation followed by eventual regeneration occurs and when dealing with semi-arid regions, where we could have desert sand. We propose to follow the strategy of using surface emissivity (epsilon), which is more closely related to surface type and coverage. By properly using surface emissivity in the infrared we can define a set of channels that are particularly sensitive to bare soil, green, and senescent vegetation. From these emissivity channels, we can derive a suitable emissivity contrast index or ECI, which is sensitive to green vegetation, senescent vegetation, and bare soil, therefore overcoming the NDVI limitation concerning its capability to distinguish bares soil from senescent vegetation. The analysis is performed with CAMEL (Combined ASTER and MODIS Emissivity for Land) database from 2000 to 2016.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditionally the history of remote sensing began during the First World War when aerial photography became a valuable reconnaissance tool. However, moving back more than a thousand years, the real pioneers of remote observation were probably the Nasca, a pre-Hispanic civilization living in southern Peru, between 100BC and 700 AD. They used 'earth observation' as a mean of cultural expression drawing the geoglyphs (known as Nasca Lines) only visible from above. These drawings were made on flat desert surface of the Pampa by removing or clearing sand or stones, to create paths for ritual functions to please the gods and create harmonious relationships between man and environment. In this paper, the Nasca geoglyphs in Pampa de Atarco, are object of remote sensing based investigations with the twofold aim to identify and characterize them as well as to analyse and monitor their fragile state of conservation, threatened mainly by vandalism and off road vehicles. The approach herein proposed includes the integration and reuse of diverse remote sensing dataset, from multispectral satellite to Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based ISAR data and close range photogrammetry. In particular, a multidate (2002-2013) very high resolution (VHR) optical satellite dataset has been processed in the spatial and temporal domain using textural indicators, including Skewness, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and automatic classification tools which allowed us to enhance the visibility of disturbance features and to automatically extract them. The best results in terms of enhancement and automatic extraction capability of disturbance features have been obtained by Skewness. Moreover, the reuse of UAV L SAR-based correlation map, available free of charge from NASA, provided useful information on the state of disturbance from 2013 to 2015, widening the observation time window of the VHR satellite data set from 2002 to 2013. Finally, the integrated use of satellite VHR data with UAV-based photographs and DTMs, processed using structure from motion (SfM), allowed us to characterize, identify and reconstruct the relative chronological sequence of geoglyphs thus providing new insights and opening new perspectives for archaeological studies.

TI  - Remote and ground-based observations of land cover restoration after forest reclamation within a brown coal basin
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY GEOGRAPHY AND GEOECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Semyonovsky-Golovkovsky brown-coal deposit is located within the boundaries of the Dnieper basin geological group and is located in the Alexandria mining region on the watershed of the Ingulets and Beshka rivers. Overburden rocks are loess like, red-brown and glauconite-containing loams, kaolin and carbonaceous clays quartz, glauconite-containing and carbonaceous sands. The total area of reclaimed land was about 1006 hectares, of which 39 % was used for agriculture, 2 % was pasture and 59 % under forest reclamation. Geomorphologic assessment of the studied area was performed using Sentinel-1 satellite radar interferometry. Multispectral imagery of Sentinel-2 satellite system was used for remote assessment within the study area. We assessed the state of the Robina pseudoacacia plants growing under various forest conditions, in plantations created on the reclaimed landscapes of the Semenovsky-Golovkovsky brown coal basin. The processes of self-regulation and restoration of fertility on the reclaimed lands at the first stages of their biological development were slowed down. This significantly reduced the resistance of phytocenoses, both pure and mixed, to the conditions of the environment to which they were exposed. A comparison of the inventory stem wood of the black locust showed the superiority of monoculture plantations to mixed stands of pine-black locust and maple-black locust. The forest-forming process progresses with age. Remote assessment of the territories was conducted to assess the future prospects of biological conservation of reclaimed lands. The influence of the anthropogenic factor is observed throughout the section and is manifested in the man-made formation of the relief, reshaping of dumps, removal to the surface of overburden rocks. It is established that the height values can vary from 85 m to 213 m. 82.8 % of the surveyed area has not undergone significant changes in relief. About 15.5 % of the territory was under the influence of alluvial-diluvia processes. There have been corresponding changes in the share of vegetation according to vegetation cover fraction (VCF) over the past three years. The highest moisture content at the level of 0.2-0.3 relative units in 2015 was recorded in the territory occupying 78.4 %. Meanwhile, the shares of land cover with this level of humidity increased by almost 9% during the following 3 years to 2018. The highest density of vegetative cover was recorded in the North-Western part of the study area of forest reclamation. Thus, considering the potential suitability of the area for forest reclamation, we should note the important role of geomorphological, geological and water resources for the growth and development (formation) of plant communities

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar radiation ground data is available in poor spatial resolution, which provides an opportunity and demonstrates the necessity to consider solar irradiance modeling based on satellite data. For the first time, solar energy monitoring in near real-time has been performed for India. This study focused on the assessment of solar irradiance from the Indian Solar Irradiance Operational System (INSIOS) using operational cloud and aerosol data from INSAT-3D and Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS)-Monitoring Atmospheric Composition Climate (MACC), respectively. Simulations of the global horizontal irradiance (GHI) and direct normal irradiance (DNI) were evaluated for 1 year for India at four Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) stations located in urban regions. The INSIOS system outputs as per radiative transfer model results presented high accuracy under clear-sky and cloudy conditions for GHI and DNI. DNI was very sensitive to the presence of cloud and aerosols, where even with small optical depths the DNI became zero, and thus it affected the accuracy of simulations under realistic atmospheric conditions. The median BSRN and INSIOS difference was found to vary from -93 to -49 W/m(2) for GHI and -103 to -76 W/m(2) for DNI under high solar energy potential conditions. Clouds were able to cause an underestimation of 40%, whereas for various aerosol inputs to the model, the overall accuracy was high for both irradiances, with the coefficient of determination being 0.99, whereas the penetration of photovoltaic installation, which exploits GHI, into urban environments (e.g., rooftop) could be effectively supported by the presented methodology, as estimations were reliable during high solar energy potential conditions. The results showed substantially high errors for monsoon season due to increase in cloud coverage that was not well-predicted at satellite and model resolutions.

TI  - Delineation of Agricultural Field Boundaries from Sentinel-2 Images Using a Novel Super-Resolution Contour Detector Based on Fully Convolutional Networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Boundaries of agricultural fields are important features necessary for defining the location, shape, and spatial extent of agricultural units. They are commonly used to summarize production statistics at the field level. In this study, we investigate the delineation of agricultural field boundaries (AFB) from Sentinel-2 satellite images acquired over the Flevoland province, the Netherlands, using a deep learning technique based on fully convolutional networks (FCNs). We designed a multiple dilation fully convolutional network (MD-FCN) for AFB detection from Sentinel-2 images at 10 m resolution. Furthermore, we developed a novel super-resolution semantic contour detection network (named SRC-Net) using a transposed convolutional layer in the FCN architecture to enhance the spatial resolution of the AFB output from 10 m to 5 m resolution. The SRC-Net also improves the AFB maps at 5 m resolution by exploiting the spatial-contextual information in the label space. The results of the proposed SRC-Net outperform alternative upsampling techniques and are only slightly inferior to the results of the MD-FCN for AFB detection from RapidEye images acquired at 5 m resolution.

AB  - The aim of this study is to apply an object-based approach using multi-time series of high (Spot-5 images) and medium (ETM of Landsat, OLI TIRS of Landast and MSS of Landsat images) spatial resolution to characterize Land Cover of a heterogeneous territory, called Loukkos river basin which is a part of the western area of the Rifean belt. The images segmentation tests regarding several combinations between color levels (0.1-0.9) and scales (0-255) have confirmed a strong relationship among the spectral values of images radiance, with respect to the number of objects. Indeed, the authors have concluded that this relationship, is more strongly related to the values of the Standard Deviation of the images. The "Map difference" used to assess the accuracy of mapping is made less complicated and more accurate to the classical probabilistic methods. Furthermore, the overall accuracy of the Object-Oriented Classification was 80.20%. The study has shown that farmlands have been undergone more changes than urban classes, followed by wetlands and grasslands those have been converted to agricultural lands and lastly the transformation of forests to farmland and natural vegetation.

CL  - Tataouine, TUNISIA
AB  - In this paper, mass Movements hazard (MMH) was evaluated by using weights of evidence model (WOE). The Bab region (Central Rif, Morocco) is known as one of the most areas prone to mass movements (MM). High resolution remote sensing data interpretation and a systematic field survey were performed in order to obtain an inventory of MM. A total of 247 MM of the following types: landslides (45%), rock-falls (48%) and debris flows (7%) were identified, which covered an area of 20 km(2) and accounting for 3% of the study area (630 km(2)). Then, nine conditioning parameters characterizing topographical, geological, and environmental conditions were mapped, hierarchized and integrated as the main parameters, controlling the occurrence of MM. To eliminate the causal dependency a strategy based on the establishment of three neo-predictive variables (NPV) with a geomorphological significance from the parameters responsible for the conditional independency violation was implemented. Several simulations with several combinations of parameters were performed in order to examine the influence of each variable on the predictive power of MMH. The prediction capability of each model is determined by the area under the curve value and the best combination model was selected to generate the MMH map.

AB  - In this paper the authors try to use time series of NDVI index, interpretation of thermal bands of images acquired by the Landsat 5 and 7, and object-based classification, to reveals the geo-biophysical causes observed that explains changes in vegetation greenness and globally in land cover evolution in the study area defined between Wadi Law and the northern Mediterranean coast of the Tinjitane peninsula (North of Morocco). The study area is a vast mountainous field, with rivers and agricultural patterns, forests and artificial surfaces. The combination of multi-sources data was crucial when establishing a classification within heterogeneous data in complexes landscapes. The object-based classification helped to best categorize the land cover classes in the study area. We observed clearly a global decreasing of forest areas between 1973 and 2015, and in parallel an increasing of the surface of Agriculture and natural vegetation class. The post-classification change vector detection is an optimal method to describe the evolution of the land cover in the context of this study.

T2  - Journal of forest and environmental science
M3  - research-article
AB  - Satchari National Park is one of the most biodiverse forest in Bangladesh and home of many endangered flora and fauna. 206 tons of CO2 per hectare is sequestrated in this national park every year which helps to mitigate climate issues. As people living near the area are dependent on this forest, degradation has become a regular phenomenon destroying the forest biodiversity by altering its forest cover. So, it is important to map land cover quickly and accurately for the sustainable management of Satchari National Park. The main objective of this study was to obtain information on land cover change using remote sensing data. Combination of unsupervised NDVI classification and supervised classification using maximum likelihood is followed in this study to find out land cover map. The analysis showed that the land cover is gradually converting from one land use type to another. Dense forest becoming degraded forest or bare land. Although it was slowed down by the establishment of ‘National Park’ on the study site, forecasting shows that it is not enough to mitigate forest degradation. Legal steps and proper management strategies should be taken to mitigate causes of degradation such as illegal felling.

Object-based image analysis (OBIA) was performed to pan-sharpened the Landsat 8 images. Four different burned areas, namely Kumluca, Adrasan, Anamur, and Alanya, were used as study areas. Kumluca, Anamur, and Alanya regions were used as training areas, and Adrasan region was used as the test area. Obtained results were evaluated with confusion matrix and statistically significant analysis. According to the results, FT and RotF produced more accurate results than other algorithms. Also, the results obtained with these algorithms are statistically significant.

TI  - Monitoring spatio-temporal dynamics of urban and peri-urban land transitions using ensemble of remote sensing spectral indices-a case study of Chennai Metropolitan Area, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-use/land-cover change is the most vulnerable factor in any developing urban environment. Increased infrastructure and population density tend to alter the land features which in turn will have an impact on climate change and will increase the impervious layer. Study of trends in land-use/land-cover change is required for analyzing the possible ways of managing the natural system. In this study, the spatial and temporal changes of the urban and peri-urban landscape of the Chennai Metropolitan Area (CMA), Tamil Nadu, India, were analyzed using satellite images. Imageries from Landsat 5 (TM) and Landsat 8 (OLI/TIRS) sensors were taken for the years 1988, 1997, 2006, and 2017. Ensembles of remote sensing spectral indices (NDVI, MNDWI, NDBI, and NDBaI) were calculated for the land-use/land-cover classification. The confusion matrix was used for assessing the accuracy for the year 2017. The overall accuracy of the LULC classification obtained was 91.76% with the kappa coefficient of 0.84. The results show that during the period of February 1988 to February 2017, the agriculture/fallow land, barren/semi-barren, vegetation, and water bodies/wetlands have decreased by 53.62%, 1.45%, 58.99%, and 30.59%, respectively. This decrease has contributed to an increase of 173.83% in built-up area. About 26,881 ha of agriculture/fallow land, 10,482 ha of vegetation land, and 2454 ha of water bodies/wetlands were converted to built-up and other land-use over the period. This essentially meant that CMA has changed from predominantly an agricultural area (42.21%) in 1988 to built-up area (48.72%) in 2017.

TI  - Quizzing the 'Social' in Social Work: Social Work in Africa as a System of Colonial Social Control
T2  - JOURNAL OF PROGRESSIVE HUMAN SERVICES
M3  - Article
AB  - Social work is generally presumed as an embodiment of social justice and human dignity as well as a solution to the many social ills unraveling modern societies. However, a dialectical-historical investigation of forces and events that shaped social work in Africa reveals how the profession was produced within the dynamics of the modern capitalist system as a direct response to social challenges of the modern era with a prime object of maintaining social order and sustaining coloniality. Through critical interrogation of the question of the social, the article demonstrates how western social work as a colonial instrument in the form of a helping profession institutionalized the subjection of Africans through the systematic destruction of indigenous ways of solving problems and their replacement with alien and vaunted Euro-North American systems of psychosocial care. The article uncovers the underlying ethical indictment of western social work linked to its historic failure to embody and address the inherent and prevailing challenges of social and cognitive justice within itself. Thus, the article reaffirms the need to 'work and research back' to the African roots as a way of stemming the tide and addressing the coloniality embedded in social work and the devastating effects of coloniality on the African social fabric and its inherent systems of psychosocial support.

TI  - Evaluating Snow in EURO-CORDEX Regional Climate Models with Observations for the European Alps: Biases and Their Relationship to Orography, Temperature, and Precipitation Mismatches
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate models are important tools to assess current and future climate. While they have been extensively used for studying temperature and precipitation, only recently regional climate models (RCMs) arrived at horizontal resolutions that allow studies of snow in complex mountain terrain. Here, we present an evaluation of the snow variables in the World Climate Research Program Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (EURO-CORDEX) RCMs with gridded observations of snow cover (from MODIS remote sensing) and temperature and precipitation (E-OBS), as well as with point (station) observations of snow depth and temperature for the European Alps. Large scale snow cover dynamics were reproduced well with some over- and under-estimations depending on month and RCM. The orography, temperature, and precipitation mismatches could on average explain 31% of the variability in snow cover bias across grid-cells, and even more than 50% in the winter period November-April. Biases in average monthly snow depth were remarkably low for reanalysis driven RCMs (<approx. 30 cm), and large for the GCM driven ones (up to 200 cm), when averaged over all stations within 400 m of altitude difference with RCM orography. Some RCMs indicated low snow cover biases and at the same time high snow depth biases, and vice versa. In summary, RCMs showed good skills in reproducing alpine snow cover conditions with regard to their limited horizontal resolution. Detected shortcomings in the models depended on the considered snow variable, season and individual RCM.

AB  - The Brazilian Savannah, also known as Cerrado Biome, is a hotspot for the Brazilian biodiversity and is also important for this country water supply. One of the most active Brazilian agricultural frontiers, the region has a history of primary vegetation suppression. Accurately map this phenomenon is an important step to inform and enable government conservation programs. In this work, we used a Long Short-Term Memory network to generate a deforestation map for the Cerrado. The PRODES deforestation inventory was used as ground truth during training and evaluation. We used as inputs a dense Landsat 8 time series composed by 6 spectral bands and 3 vegetation indices, as well as the SRTM terrain slope. The methodology was tested on an area comprising about 31,450 km 2 , achieving approximately 98.5% global accuracy.

AB  - The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (herein after UAVs) as a tool in forage crop management is discussed. Overfertilizing has negative effects on water quality and affects health of animals and human beings, who use it. The author conducted experiments aimed at reducing fertilizer consumption. The analysis of two different images taken before and after the harvest period clearly shows a highlighted portion of the test area that might be overfertilized. UAVs equipped with cameras using both the RGB portion of the visible light spectrum and the near infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum (780-2500 nm) take Blue Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (BNDVI: blue band is near infrared portion in this research) images. Comparing the images can detect possible overfertilized areas. This data can then be used to adjust future fertilizer application rates. Experiments conducted in 2017 and 2018 and upcoming experiments in 2019 are discussed. Adjusting the analysis for BNDVI intensity and comparing UAV sourced images with satellite remote sensing data began in 2018.

AB  - In Japan, a feed-in tariff was introduced to promote and expand the renewable energy ratio to 22-24% by FY 2030. Biomass is one of important renewable energy. Recently, several biomass projects for not only fluidized bed boilers, but also pulverized coal fired boilers, are being planned around the world to reduce CO2 emissions as the main reason. The required particle size of woody biomass for combustion in a pulverized coal fired boiler is around 1mm, while that of coal is several tens of mu m. Woody biomass particles grinded by a mill are sent to burners via a fuel pipe by air. It is important to measure the particle size distribution in order to understand combustibility and grindability. However, it was unknown whether the particle size distribution could be measured by the same sampling method for pulverized coal. We conducted sampling tests of woody biomass particles in a fuel pipe using the isokinetic sampling method. As a result, we observed that the flow of woody biomass particles in the pipe was significantly non-uniform to the influence of the upstream elbow. It is necessary for woody biomass to measure at a pitch of at least 45 degrees in order to obtain the particle size distribution in a fuel pipe.

AB  - OBJECTIVE : The aim of this supplemental study of a sentinel node (SN) biopsy (SNB) trial for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) was to assess the effectiveness in identifying micrometastasis and determining whether elective neck dissection (END) is necessary.MATERIALS AND METHODS : Twenty-three patients with pathologically positive SNs were included. The sizes of the metastatic lesions in positive SNs (SMSNs) were classified and the rates of occult metastasis of non-SNs were compared.RESULTS : The patients were divided according to the SMSN : <0.2 mm (group A, n=3); 0.2 mm to <2.0 mm (group B, n=7); and >= 2.0 mm (group C, n=13). The rates of occult metastasis in groups A, B, and C were 0% (0/3), 14% (1/7) and 23% (3/13), respectively.CONCLUSION : Rare cancer cell distribution to nodes other than SNs was observed in the patients with SN metastatic lesions of at least smaller than 0.2 mm in size, suggesting the possibility of defining SN micrometastasis in N0 OSCC.

AB  - The operation of an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) under predictable receiver mobility is investigated. We develop a continuous time system model for multipath channels and discuss the optimal IRS configuration with respect to received power, Doppler spread, and delay spread. It is shown that the received power can be maximized without adding Doppler spread to the system. In a numerical case study, we show that an IRS having the size of just two large billboards can improve the link budget of ground to Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite links by up to 6 dB.

AB  - This paper describes a surface soil moisture (SSM) product at "field scale" resolution derived from Sentinel-1 (S-1) and Sentinel-2 (S-2) data. The retrieval exploits a short term change detection (STCD) approach that is applied to time series of S-1 observations, S-2 NDVI data are integrated to overcome, or largely mitigate, some limitations of the STCD approach, which are discussed in the paper. Some examples of prospective applications at "field scale" are also discussed.

TI  - SOCIO-POLITICAL MEANINGS OF THE PARTIES TO THE SPAIN-CATALAN CONFLICT THROUGH THE PRISM OF TWITTER COMMUNICATIONS
T2  - SRAVNITELNAYA POLITIKA-COMPARATIVE POLITICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study is to analyze the social meanings of the network communicative activity of the parties of the Spanish-Catalan conflict in a specific direction - in discussions about tweets of leading EU politicians. The relevance of the presented study is determined, on the one hand, by the increased influence of social media on political life, and, on the other hand, by the need to understand political conflicts not only as conflicts of interest, but also as conflicts of social meanings and ideas. The article discusses and interprets the meanings of two social communities - supporters of the independence of Catalonia and supporters of the unity of Spain, implied in the communication carried out using the social network Twitter. The analysis is based on an empirical study of twitter messages by the method of quantitative and qualitative content analysis. The main socio-political attitudes of the parties to the conflict, expressed in remarks on tweets of representatives of the EU leadership, are examined. The time interval of the study covers two years - from May 2017 to June 2019. Based on an analysis of the level of communication activity of network users, it was revealed that the supporters of the independence of Catalonia act as a more active and cohesive social community, compared with the supporters of the unity of Spain. They have clear ideas about the political situation in the country and the region, as well as expressed ideological principles. This allows us to conclude that there is a narrative of independent Catalonia formed in public opinion. However, the meanings concerning the problems of social relations in the country and the region, arising in the light of the requirements of independence, remain in the shadow of communication. The passive nature of the participation of supporters of the unity of Spain in network communication in this area, as well as the content of their remarks, indicates the absence of a formed social base of supporters of unity, both among the inhabitants of Catalonia and among the rest of the Spanish citizens. This may be due to ideological lag, in which supporters of the country's unity are guided by outdated ideological stereotypes that are not able to unite them into a real social community with a certain political worldview. According to the findings of the study, it is precisely the ideas of the parties to the conflict about social relations in the country that are their weak link that does not allow reaching a new level of political compromise or consensus.

TI  - CHIGIRIN FREETHINKERS IN SEARCH OF THE PEASANT TRUTH
T2  - QUAESTIO ROSSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - This article examines one of the most important events in the lives of S. Shutenko and F. Chepurnoy, two ordinary peasants of Chigirin uyezd, Kiev province, in the nineteenth century. The Chigirin freethinkers' drama was connected with peasant unrest in left-bank Ukraine between the 1870s and 1880s. A number of comprehensive works have turned to their biographies (B. G. Litval and D. P. Poida), in this article, the peasants' views are analysed through the prism of their tragic lives and dreams about the peasant truth, which resulted in their exile to Siberia. They served their first exile together in Yenisei province from 1882 to 1887, Chepurny served another exile in Irkutsk province from 1895 to 1900. There is little information about Shutenko's later life. The research refers to unpublished archival documents from the funds of the State Archive of the Russian Federation and the state archives of Irkutsk, Tomsk and Krasnoyarsk. The author mostly focuses on judicial and investigation materials, as well as official correspondence between different state bodies, Also, the author refers to the memoirs of such revolutionaries as L. G. Deutsch and V. D. Debogory-Mokriyevich, both of whom were involved in peasant unrest in Chigirin. The reason for peasant unrest was discontent with the agrarian reforms in former state properties in right-bank Ukraine. Peasants perceived the agrarian reforms through the prism of their traditional worldview. They did not doubt the good intentions of the tsar, who granted the true peasant will. They treated the content of the agrarian reforms as treason on the part of officials and landowners, who they blamed for distorting the tsar's will. The intentions themselves seemed to comply with peasants' interests. As a result of peasant unrest, the religious teaching of Stundism gained in popularity, The article demonstrates how Stundism significantly influenced peasant estimation of agrarian changes on state properties in the southwestern part of the Russian Empire. The author concludes that Shutenko and Chepurnoy's tragic destinies may be viewed as a result of peasant unrest in the post-reform Ukrainian village.

AB  - Soil moisture(SM) estimation in agricultural area using microwave data is still a challenging task; due to numerous sources of signal contributors present other than soil dielectric like vegetation, soil roughness, etc. For minimization of the effect of these sources, there is a requirement for fully polarized SAR data or multi-sensor data, i.e., optical and microwave. But the optical data is not easily available in cloudy season, and fully polarized SAR data is less available in comparison to dual-polarized data like Sentinel-1, which is available with a high revisit cycle. Therefore in this paper, an attempt is made to use Sentinel-1 data to estimate SM by minimizing the effect of other signal contributors. Also, for the minimization of SM error, a complete wheat crop cycle is considered, and by using constrained nonlinear multivariable optimization technique, optimum values of WCM parameters and soil roughness are estimated. Obtained results are compared with ground truth SM. Results show that the retrieved SM is very close to ground truth SM.

TI  - Impact of ice formations on the shore and bottom areas of shallow seas and large lakes of middle and subarctic latitudes
T2  - LED I SNEG-ICE AND SNOW
M3  - Article
AB  - Ice formations affect linear and coastal structures not only in the Arctic, but also in the subarctic and middle latitudes. Most of the seas, lakes and bays, such as the Gulf of St. Lawrence, the Baltic, Black, Caspian Seas, and Sea of Japan, freeze partially or completely every year. Inland and northern lakes and seas of the Subarctic, such as the White Sea, the Gulf of Bothnia and the Sea of Okhotsk are characterized by the most severe ice conditions. Remote sensing methods are used to detect ice ridges and grounded hummocks. A side-scan sonar survey and echo sounding, along with the diving surveys, are used to detect the ice scours/furrows on the bottom. To study the ice-exaration relief on the exposed bottoms, remote sensing data and materials obtained by means of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are used, along with field surveys. The pressure impact of ice on the land results in the formation of ice piles on shores up to 3-5 m high. This causes an intensification of the processes of destruction of the coast and the restructuring of the processes of relief formation. The ice pressure ridges up to 2-3 m high are widely distributed along the coasts. At the bottoms, typical ice scours (plowing furrows) have a dip along the central axis, as well as side and pressure rollers at the ends of the furrows. At the edge of the fast ice, multiple scours/furrows form a so-called << comb >>, usually oriented along the normal to the shoreline. The length of the largest furrows exceeds several kilometers; the width of individual ones reaches the first tens of meters, the systems of furrows - hundreds of meters; the depth of them can be down to 2 m. The maximal depth of the sea or lake at which impacts are possible can reach 30 m. Relic forms of ice and iceberg impact have also been studied in the middle latitudes. Traces of impacts of ice formations in the temperate zone have a low degree of preservation and are often concealed by sediments. The distribution of traces of ice impacts down to a depth of 30 m as well as to several hundred meters inland shows the scale of the process in temperate and subarctic climates. Ice heaps and thrusts are more common in mid-latitudes than in the Arctic.

TI  - Improvement in Land Cover and Crop Classification based on Temporal Features Learning from Sentinel-2 Data Using Recurrent-Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN)
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the use of current land cover, along with monitoring change over time, is vital for agronomists and agricultural agencies responsible for land management. The increasing spatial and temporal resolution of globally available satellite images, such as provided by Sentinel-2, creates new possibilities for researchers to use freely available multi-spectral optical images, with decametric spatial resolution and more frequent revisits for remote sensing applications such as land cover and crop classification (LC&CC), agricultural monitoring and management, environment monitoring. Existing solutions dedicated to cropland mapping can be categorized based on per-pixel based and object-based. However, it is still challenging when more classes of agricultural crops are considered at a massive scale. In this paper, a novel and optimal deep learning model for pixel-based LC&CC is developed and implemented based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) in combination with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) using multi-temporal sentinel-2 imagery of central north part of Italy, which has diverse agricultural system dominated by economic crop types. The proposed methodology is capable of automated feature extraction by learning time correlation of multiple images, which reduces manual feature engineering and modeling crop phenological stages. Fifteen classes, including major agricultural crops, were considered in this study. We also tested other widely used traditional machine learning algorithms for comparison such as support vector machine SVM, random forest (RF), Kernal SVM, and gradient boosting machine, also called XGBoost. The overall accuracy achieved by our proposed Pixel R-CNN was 96.5%, which showed considerable improvements in comparison with existing mainstream methods. This study showed that Pixel R-CNN based model offers a highly accurate way to assess and employ time-series data for multi-temporal classification tasks.

AB  - Objective: Phenomenography is a qualitative research method used to explore the different ways individuals experience phenomena. Over the last few decades, use of the research method grew in various higher education disciplines; however, use of the method for nursing education research was limited until early in the 21st century.Therefore, the purpose of this article is to describe the main ideas of phenomenography methodology and provide a simplified integrative review of the contributions to nursing education research.Methods: Whittemore and Knafl (2005) five-step integrative review process was used to guide the literature search and evaluate findings of published works between 2009 and 2019.Results: Thirteen articles, including one comprehensive literature review, were identified in the literature search.Conclusion: Findings illustrated phenomenography methodology was used to evaluate and improve teaching and learning principles, complex faculty and student issues, curriculum and professional development, and educational practices within nursing education. Phenomenography research can be instrumental in providing a more realistic worldview of individual differing experiences of nursing education phenomena.

AB  - Across the world, many coastal tidal regions are unsafe to navigate due to shifting mud and sand pushed by water currents. Ability to regularly map the current location of a channel will aid safe passage for commercial, leisure and rescue craft. This work investigates the use of synthetic aperture radar data derived from satellites to provide accurate mapping of moving channels in coastal regions. As images must be collected at low tide, data availability is assessed considering the relationship between the orbital motion of the satellites and the tides. Change detection methods are applied to suitable images to map changes in the location of navigable channels. Pixels that undergo similar changes over time (e.g. from water covered to exposed sand) are grouped together by examining the principal component of the covariance matrix, for a vector composed of pixel values from the same location at different times. The Solway Firth in Great Britain is selected as a trial site as it is exposed to some of Europe's fastest tidal movements and ranges, and hence is one of Great Britain's most treacherous stretches of coastline.

AB  - Identifying changes on the Earth's surface is one of the most fundamental aspects of Earth observation from satellite images. Historically, the predominant form of analysis has measured change at a pixel level. Here, we present a new strategy that conducts the analysis based on objects. The objects are placed inside a random forest regressor. We have tested our approach in Queensland, Australia using Sentinel data. We find that the use of object-based approach either outperforms or is comparable to alternative approaches.

AB  - A Sumerian Hypothesis is developed to explain the origin of the large amount of Mesopotamian material appearing in the primeval history of Genesis 1-11 (found throughout all parts of the primeval history). Various features of the primeval history are considered and compared with Sumerian/Akkadian features, including worldview, motifs, and stories as well as the literary style and historiography of the genealogies. The author argues that this Mesopotamian material can be traced back to pre-Old Babylonian sources and shows no influence from developments in Babylon thereafter. The Mesopotamian source material used in the primeval history may thus have been written down as early as in Abrahamic times.

AB  - The article is devoted to linguosemiotic analysis of Spanish riddles about animals and birds. The article discusses the means of language expressiveness in Spanish animal puzzles and analyzes their cognitive parameters and linguosemiotics. The animal world can be considered as an integral and semiotically important part of the geographical space of an ethnos. The study of perception and verbalization of a fragment of the worldview which is associated with the "zoomorphic code" in folklore texts is of particular interest, due to the fact that zoonyms and ornithonyms are categories where features of folklore understanding of reality by an ethnos are traditionally fixed and this is how people get a feeling that they belong to one culture. Linguosemiotic analysis of riddles about the fauna allows us to reconstruct folklore characters of zoonyms and ornithonyms and, based on the typology of these characters, describe animals and birds prototypical for the Spanish language personality.

TI  - Investigation of bovine abortion and stillbirth/perinatal mortality - similar diagnostic challenges, different approaches.
T2  - Irish veterinary journal
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - This pracademic paper reviews current bovine foetopathy (abortion and stillbirth) case definitions, reporting and triage, and causes and time-of-death and proposes veterinary practitioner-focused investigative standard operating procedures (SOPs). Issues of under- and over-triage and intra-institutional SOP harmonisation are also discussed. It is proposed that an 'observable abortion' (120-260days of gestation) is a more practitioner-friendly definition of abortion for reporting and benchmarking purposes and that the term 'peristillbirth' can replace stillbirth and perinatal mortality. Diagnosis of bovine foetopathy involves an investigative triad of the farmer, veterinary practitioner and the veterinary diagnostic laboratory. However, the poor sensitivity of abortion reporting undermines the value of currently adopted scanning/passive surveillance; parallel active surveillance/sentinel herd models should also be employed. The approach to abortion investigation differs from that of peristillbirth. The former should include collecting a herd and case history, examination and sampling of dam and cohorts and sampling of the foetus and placenta. A sample selection decision tree is provided to assist test selection. In peristillbirths, non-infectious and periparturient causes-of-death are more important hence the anamnesis must focus on peristillbirth risk factors and calving management. The foetopsy, while including the sampling menu appropriate to aborted foetuses, must also include a detailed internal and external examination of the carcass for lesions indicative of periparturient causes-of-death. In addition, for aborted foetuses the time-of-death is not important as the foetus is generally not viable; however, for the peristillbirth the time-of-death is critical as it provides useful information for the farmer to address modifiable risk factors and to alter their perinatal management. Reporting of the ultimate cause-of-death is more useful to prevent future abortions and peristillbirths though the proximate cause-of-death is often reported in the absence of a complete clinical anamnesis. Finally, the common reasons for diagnosis not reached (DNR) and the limitations of current investigative approaches are discussed.

TI  - Susceptibility of swine cells and domestic pigs to SARS-CoV-2
T2  - EMERGING MICROBES & INFECTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in an ongoing global pandemic with significant morbidity, mortality, and economic consequences. The susceptibility of different animal species to SARS-CoV-2 is of concern due to the potential for interspecies transmission, and the requirement for pre-clinical animal models to develop effective countermeasures. In the current study, we determined the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to (i) replicate in porcine cell lines, (ii) establish infection in domestic pigs via experimental oral/intranasal/intratracheal inoculation, and (iii) transmit to co-housed naive sentinel pigs. SARS-CoV-2 was able to replicate in two different porcine cell lines with cytopathic effects. Interestingly, none of the SARS-CoV-2-inoculated pigs showed evidence of clinical signs, viral replication or SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses. Moreover, none of the sentinel pigs displayed markers of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These data indicate that although different porcine cell lines are permissive to SARS-CoV-2, five-week old pigs are not susceptible to infection via oral/intranasal/intratracheal challenge. Pigs are therefore unlikely to be significant carriers of SARS-CoV-2 and are not a suitable pre-clinical animal model to study SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis or efficacy of respective vaccines or therapeutics.

AB  - This paper presents a case study of flood mapping in Panamaram village, Wayanad, Kerala, India using SAR dataset. Rapid flood mapping can prove to be critical in decision making during flood due to high socio-economic loss associated. In this study, ground range detected (GRD) images of Sentinel-1 mission, which are substantially less utilized, are exploited. Pre-event and post-event GRD images arc analyzed in Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) and extent of flooded area is mapped in GIS framework. The generated results are further validated by comparison of cumulative rainfall data during the flood period provided by Indian Meteorological Department, Thiruvananthapuram. Overall, study looks promising in developing flood maps subject to availability of real-time images.

TI  - The Concept of the Social Contract in the Shi'a Gnostic Tradition: A Case Study of Qu?b al-Din Nayrizi
T2  - JOURNAL OF SHIA ISLAMIC STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The 'social contract' is a Modern political term that originated from Enlightenment thought in Europe. According to the Modern interpretation of the theory of the social contract,1 the function of the government is confined to protecting the rights of individuals. As members of society, individuals are the contracting parties of the social contract. After the contract has been established, the governor will oversee the government's action and the contract outcome, as one side of the contract. By omitting the role of God from the scene of politics, the Modern social contract in the eighteenth century arose as an alternative to the political philosophy of Christian scholars. Modern philosophers who advocated the social contract, such as Thomas Hobbes (d. 1679), John Locke (d. 1704), and Jean -Jacques Rousseau (d. 1778), did not give God a role in their theory of the social contract, as though society had devolved into a sphere empty of God.Contrary to the Medieval notion of politics, the secular concept of the social contract that developed in the Enlightenment Era exiled God to the private sphere, arguing that the public sphere belongs to the will of the individual. The underlying premise was that the will of the individual and divine will could not coexist. Nevertheless, Qu?b al-Din Nayrizi (1688-1759), an ascetic who lived before Hobbes, harmonised divine will, and the will of the individual in his theory of the social contract. He presents a Gnostic social contract in which God continues to exist. Based upon his Gnostic worldview, nowhere in the world and beyond is empty of the presence of God, and an exemplary social contract cannot neglect the role of God. This article aims to evaluate Nayrizi's position as a Shi'a Gnostic regarding the theory of the social contract.

TI  - Navigating for a Place in the Museum: Stories of Encounter and Engagement between the Old and the New from the Highlands of Papua New Guinea
T2  - CONTEMPORARY PACIFIC
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, I describe two exhibitions that were developed and shared in order to recognize and value Indigenous ways of seeing and experiencing the world: Ples Namel, held at the Queensland Art Gallery in 1996, and the award-winning Rituals of Seduction: Birds of Paradise, held at the Australian Museum in 2011. In these art gallery and museum spaces, source communities engaged in conversation and dialogue with the institutions and their collections. In order to enable audiences to experience Pacific environments, the exhibitions' collaborators established the moka pena, or center space, from the Mogei community in Mount Hagen, Papua New Guinea. In each event, individual experiences, recollections, and knowledge were brought together in a social encounter in this center space-the ples namel. In the Mogei worldview, this ples namel is at the same time a physical presence and an imaginary one, a duality similarly reflected in Indigenous communities' and audience members' participation in the two exhibitions. The natural environment, the accoutrements adorning the body, and the performing bodies all came together in a volatile, dynamic, and productive political and cultural space of meaning making. There were opportunities for unsettlement and disruption of knowledge. Such negotiations or acceptance of the new in the unsettled and disrupted space of performance may realign and rewrite history-experienced personally and realized socially.

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Chapter 5 questions why the 'memory activists' are so committed to the past and what the emotional rupture narrative means to them. Their friendship ties with former nationalists and martyrs and their fears for modernity, make them long for a politically strong yet emotional history. They perceive a pluralist or settled, constructive narrative to create citizens who become unreceptive to danger. Citizens need to be prepared to fight for their nation, guarantee democracy, and ensure that history will not be repeated. Despite their seemingly radical worldview, the memory activists occupy a rather legitimized and credible position in society, due to their historical roots in human rights activism, their political ties, and the moderates among them who function as a bridge.

TI  - Global Evaluation of the Suitability of MODIS-Terra Detected Cloud Cover as a Proxy for Landsat 7 Cloud Conditions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds limit the quality and availability of optical wavelength surface observations from Earth Observation (EO) satellites. This limitation is particularly relevant for the generation of systematic thematic products from EO medium spatial resolution polar orbiting sensors, such as Landsat, which have reduced temporal resolution compared to coarser resolution polar orbiting sensors such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). MODIS on the Terra satellite is in the same orbit as Landsat 7 with an approximately 30 minute overpass difference. In this study, one year of global Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) image cloud fractions over land are compared with collocated MODIS cloud fractions, generated by combining the MODIS-Terra global daily cloud mask product (MOD35) with the Landsat 7 ETM+ image footprints and acquisition calendar. The results show high correlation between the MODIS and Landsat 7 ETM+ cloud fractions (R-2 = 0.83), negligible bias (median difference: <0.01) and low dispersion around the median (interquartile range: [-0.02, 0.06]). These results indicate that, globally, the cloud cover detected by MODIS-Terra data can be used as a proxy for Landsat 7 ETM+ cloud cover.

AB  - Remote sensing is considered as an increasingly important technology for maritime surveillance. The process of maritime surveillance for safety is critical for every country. The need for information on migrant movements by sea using different sizes and types of vessels is of paramount significance. Such information is essential for the search and rescue (SaR) operations of unauthorised migrants. The aim of this paper is to show how to detect migrant vessels in the Cyprus Region using freely available Sentinel-1 SAR data. The comparison was made using open source available migrant data and Sentinel-1 SAR acquisitions. Sentinel-1 SAR images were used to investigate three Areas of Interest (AoI). The main AoI is located at the Northwest coasts, whilst the second area includes the Southeast coasts of Cyprus. The results indicate that the Sentinel-1 SAR data can provide decisionmakers with effective results and spatial information on migration routes.

AB  - Maritime surveillance is of critical importance for threat prevention and maintenance of national security and safety. Maritime traffic comprises worldwide navigation of millions of vessels. In this sense, the geostrategic position of Cyprus entails the need for effective monitoring of marine traffic. Remote Sensing is a technique, which enables maritime surveillance by means of space-based detection and identification of marine traffic. The advent of new satellite missions, such as Sentinel-1, enabled the acquisition of systematic datasets for monitoring vessels. Using the Copernicus Open Access Hub service, it is now feasible to access satellite data in a fully automated and near real-time mode and deliver vessel information through a web portal interface. Nevertheless, there is still a great need to understand the full potential of the information acquired from such sensors. In this paper, an overview of vessel tracking techniques using Sentinel acquisitions is carried out. Consequently, vessel detections via space imagery could be authenticated against Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, which provide the location and dimensions of ships that are legally operating in the Cyprus region.

TI  - GEOLOGICAL AND GEOMORPHOLOGICAL DETERMINANTS FOR CHOOSING THE PLACE OF TRANSPORT CROSSING "CONTINENT-SAKHALIN"
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE TOMSK POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY-GEO ASSETS ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The geostrategic position of Russia in the Asia-Pacific region is determined by the level of economic, social and political development on the territory of Far East. The prospects for its improvement in view of modern realities and trends cannot be imagined without the development of transport and economic connections between the subjects, including Sakhalin Island and the mainland. The transcontinental transport market within the international transport corridors is huge positive potential for development of the regions of the Far East, Siberia and the whole Russia. The decision to develop the transport infrastructure of the outskirts at the level of the Government of the Russian Federation will demonstrate the State attitude to its Far Eastern territory and outline its positions in the Asia-Pacific region.The relevance of the research is caused by the need to develop design solutions for selection of possible options for organization of sustainable year-round transport links between the mainland and Sakhalin for development of the resource potential of adjacent territories. The final choice of the location and type of construction, which will ensure uninterrupted transportation by rail and road through the Tatar Strait, can be made only after thorough analysis of the advantages of any of them, depending on natural conditions.The aim of the research is to analyze the results of geological and geomorphological studies in the Nevelskogo Strait (narrowest part of the Tatar Strait) to select the location of the transport crossing.Materials and methods of the research. The information basis for the study was cartographic materials, earth remote sensing data, seismic profiles, other data obtained as a result of engineering and scientific research, in which the authors participated, as well as information from literary sources. Mapping in the geographic information environment allowed updating geological maps, applying new data on faults, clarifying the boundaries of stratigraphic strata. In geomorphological studies, a system-morphological approach was used, which makes it possible to assess the geomorphological risk. The available information was used to model the processes in the Strait applying GIS technologies. The authors performed geological work for study of the leading line "Novy" in 2001. The most part of the information is published for the first time.As result of the studies of geological structure of the coastal territory and the bottom of the Nevelsky Strait, conducted during the research to justify the project of a bridge or tunnel transition from the mainland to Sakhalin (including those with the participation of the authors), it was revealed that the rift structure of the Nevelsky Strait consists of blocks of the earth's crust, dissected by deep faults. The territory is classified as an area where seismic shocks are possible at 7-8 points on the MSK-64 scale. The retreat of the mainland coast is highly dependent on the strength of the rocks. The intensity of abrasion of Nevelsky Cape, established according to the space surveys, did not exceed 1 m per 100 years, so leading line of the designed facilities on the construction shore is advisable to start from the coastal ledges (cliffs), which are composed of lava and pyroclastic deposits of basalt and andesite composition with massive texture (Nevelsky, Ekaterina, Muravyov capes etc.). On the Sakhalin coast, the construction can be brought to the coastal ledge of Lakh Cape (it is least susceptible to erosion). Preliminary results of the study of geological conditions have shown that the construction of a bridge of class I seismic resistance across the Strait is possible. The most calm in seismic respect is the leading line "Novy" (Nevelsky Cape - Lakh Cape). The obtained geomorphological data indicate that in this range the erosion of coastal ledges is minimal - first centimeters per year (during the observation period of 1 cm/year). Geological-geomorphological conditions will not have serious obstacles in the construction of the object along the line between these capes.

T2  - Marine Biological Journal
M3  - Article
AB  - In the second half of the XX century, Black Sea ecosystem has undergone significant changes: a number of storm winds and upwellings decreased, precipitation abundance increased, coastal waters salinity decreased, temperature increased; moreover, ctenophores invaded. As a result, in the late 1980s, Black Sea pelagic ecosystem abruptly got restructured. This research is based on the studies performed in 1965-1966 and 2007-2012 near Sevastopol (Western Crimea) using the remote sensing data. Analysis of satellite data over the past 20 years showed the presence of positive dynamics in surface water temperature in Sevastopol water area. In the mid-1960s, the annual bioluminescence was characterized by seasonal peaks of dinophytes luminescence. In recent years, this rhythm has changed due to ctenophores invasion. The increase in Mnemiopsis leidyi abundance leads to a decrease in bioluminescence of luminous microalgae being consumed by these ctenophores. Due to Beroe ovata invasion and reproduction, M leidyi biomass decreased; as a result, bioluminescence increased.

T2  - REVISTA DE GEOGRAFIA NORTE GRANDE
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite available models and scientific evidence on climate change on a global scale, the planning and management of urban territories in Latin America has failed to consider it above its economic, social and political constraints. By selecting surface temperature and ventilation as critical climate variables, the case of Santiago de Chile is analyzed as an example of the contradictions between policies and official declarations and the real transformations of urban climates, highlighting the widespread increase in surface temperatures, represented by satellite imagery, due to the absence of rigorous environmental assessments of changes in land uses and covers that have accompanied the urbanization. A microclimatic simulation has allowed estimating the reduction of speed and changes in the direction of the winds, such as consequence of the densification and verticalization in the Estacion Central commune. The generation of ventilation "dead zones" relates to designs, topology and exposure of the buildings, affecting the quality of life of the inhabitants. Mitigation and adaptation to Climate Change should be an explicit part of the objectives, plans and projects that pursue the quality and territorial justice of urban climates and, consequently, the well-being and comfort of society.

TI  - Variation of the Coastline Between the Years of 1984 and 2017 in the State of Sergipe, Northeast Region, Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The variation of the coastline has become one of the most significant issues for urbanized coastlines in the world, being considered a problem for society, due to the occurrence of erosion in beaches occupied by men. In Brazil, there is a predominant tendency for beach erosion. However, on the coast of the State of Sergipe, Northeast Region in Brazil, dynamic stability predominates in most beaches. The coast in Sergipe has sandy beaches, exposed to the ocean and they are interrupted by the river mouths. The objective of this paper was mapping and presenting the dynamic evolution of the Sergipe coastline between 1984 and 2017, in order to identify areas of erosion, accretion and dynamic stability. The delimitation of the coastline was performed in November 2017 using the Trimble R6 geodetic GPS, the PPK (post-processed kinematic) positioning techniques were applied. The current coastline was compared to another, drawn from 1984 Landsat satellite images, with a spatial resolution of 30 m, sectors where erosion or accretion occurred were delimited. Areas with 30 meters of variation or less were considered dynamically stable, their variation may be related to the resolution of the image from 1984. The mapped coastline has 152, 3 km of linear extension, from which 6, 8 km are river mouths. From the remaining 145, 5 km, 52, 2 km or 34% are subject to erosion, 79, 4 km or 52% are in dynamic stability and 13, 8 km or 9% are in a progradation system. Part of the erosion area is occupied by villages. These findings will help governors and concerned parties to develop strategies for adaptation against losing stretches of land.

TI  - Modeling Alpine Grassland Above Ground Biomass Based on Remote Sensing Data and Machine Learning Algorithm: A Case Study in East of the Tibetan Plateau, China
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Effective and accurate assessment of grassland above-ground biomass (AGB) especially via remote sensing (RS), is crucial for forage-livestock balance and ecological environment protection of alpine grasslands. Because of complexity and extensive spatial distribution of natural grassland resources, the RS estimation models based on moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data exhibited low accuracy and poor stability. In this study, various methods for estimating the AGB of alpine grassland vegetation using MODIS vegetation indices were evaluated by combining with meteorology, soil, topography geography and <italic>in situ</italic> measured AGB data (during grassland growing season from 2011 to 2016) in Gannan region. Results show that 1) five out of ten factors (elevation, slope, aspect, topographic position, temperature, precipitation and the concentration of clay and sand in the soil) exert significant effects on grassland AGB, with <italic>R</italic>(2) 0.04 & x2013;0.39, and RMSE 859.68 & x2013;1075.09 & x00A0;kg & x002F;ha, respectively; 2) the accuracy and stability of AGB estimation model can be improved by constructing multivariate models, especially using multivariate nonparameter models; 3) the optimum estimation model is constructed on the basis of random forest algorithm (RF). Compared with univariate & x002F;multivariate parameter models, RMSE of RF model decreased 26.45 & x0025;& x2013;44.27 & x0025;. Meanwhile, RF models can explain 89.41 & x0025; variation in AGB during grass growing season. This study presented a more suitable RS inversion model integrated MODIS vegetation indices and other effect factors. Besides, the accuracy based on MODIS data was greatly improved. Thus, our study provides a scientific basis for effective and accurate estimating alpine grassland AGB.

TI  - A detection method for reservoir waterbodies vector data based on EGADS
T2  - OPEN GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Owing to the effects of camera, illumination, extraction algorithm defect, and other reasons, vector data for reservoir waterbodies extracted from remote sensing data may have quality issues, impacting the efficiency of data utilization in areas such as water resource management and reservoir monitoring. To efficiently detect abnormal data from massive vector products of reservoir waterbodies, a semi-automatic detection method for reservoir waterbody vector data is presented. The method has three phases. First, the original reservoir vector data are preprocessed to obtain the time series of the area of reservoir waterbodies. Second, data modeling with time series of reservoir waterbodies area data is done using the extensible generic anomaly detection system (EGADS) plug-in framework and time series modeling is conducted using the Olympic model. Third, data that have quality problems are identified with K sigma model was used to determine the outliers; thereby, the date of the outliers is detected. Results of accuracy verification show that the sensitivity and specificity of the method were 94.44 and 83.87%, respectively, showing its feasibility for use in anomaly detection in polygonal reservoir waterbody vector data with far greater efficiency than traditional manual inspection.

TI  - Real-Time Detection of Ground Objects Based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Remote Sensing with Deep Learning: Application in Excavator Detection for Pipeline Safety
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing and deep learning provide a practical approach to object detection. However, most of the current approaches for processing UAV remote-sensing data cannot carry out object detection in real time for emergencies, such as firefighting. This study proposes a new approach for integrating UAV remote sensing and deep learning for the real-time detection of ground objects. Excavators, which usually threaten pipeline safety, are selected as the target object. A widely used deep-learning algorithm, namely You Only Look Once V3, is first used to train the excavator detection model on a workstation and then deployed on an embedded board that is carried by a UAV. The recall rate of the trained excavator detection model is 99.4%, demonstrating that the trained model has a very high accuracy. Then, the UAV for an excavator detection system (UAV-ED) is further constructed for operational application. UAV-ED is composed of a UAV Control Module, a UAV Module, and a Warning Module. A UAV experiment with different scenarios was conducted to evaluate the performance of the UAV-ED. The whole process from the UAV observation of an excavator to the Warning Module (350 km away from the testing area) receiving the detection results only lasted about 1.15 s. Thus, the UAV-ED system has good performance and would benefit the management of pipeline safety.

TI  - Optimal Temporal Window Selection for Winter Wheat and Rapeseed Mapping with Sentinel-2 Images: A Case Study of Zhongxiang in China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, the main remote sensing-based crop mapping methods are based on spectral-temporal features. However, there has been a lack research on the selection of the multi-temporal images, and most of the methods are based on the use of all the available images during the cycle of crop growth. In this study, in order to explore the optimal temporal window for crop mapping with limited remote sensing data, we tested all possible combinations of temporal windows in an exhaustive manner, and made a comprehensive consideration of the spatial accuracy and statistical accuracy as evaluation indices. We collected all the available cloud-free Sentinel-2 multi-spectral images for the winter wheat and rapeseed growth periods in the study area in southern China, and used the random forest (RF) method as the classifier to identify the optimal temporal window. The spatial and statistical accuracies of all the results were assessed by using ground survey data and local agricultural census data. The optimal temporal window for the mapping of winter wheat and rapeseed in the study area was obtained by identifying the best-performing set of results. In addition, the variable importance (VI) index was used to evaluate the importance of the different bands for crop mapping. The results of the spatial accuracy, statistical accuracy, and the VI showed that the combinations of images from the later stages of crop growth were more suitable for crop mapping.

TI  - Monitoring Human-Induced Surface Water Disturbance Around Taihu Lake Since 1984 by Time Series Landsat Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Good knowledge of inland water dynamics is of great significance for water management, preserving ecological balance and supporting industrial and agricultural development. However, the existing water cover products and water extraction methods cannot meet the present needs of monitoring water distribution and dynamic changes accurately and timely, particularly in the areas frequently disturbed by human activities, such as the Taihu Lake region. This article proposed an expert knowledge system to detect annual stable water and separate aquaculture water from natural water, and a frequency-based approach is used to generate stable water map within a year. All available Landsat Level-2 images were used to generate annual 30-m resolution stable water products from 1984 to 2018, and analyze the historical spatial-temporal changes of the water body in the Taihu Lake region. Furthermore, we related each important graph change with a reality event at that time. The results suggest that human activities have an obviously stronger influence on surface water than climate fluctuations in the Taihu Lake region, and confirm the effectiveness of ecological protection policy in maintaining the stability of the total amount of natural water in the past few decades. The spatial-temporal disturbance of aquaculture also provided another perspective and a reliable evidence of previous studies on the influence of human activities on the eutrophication process of Taihu Lake.

TI  - Lessons Learned in the Development of a Web-based Surveillance Reporting System and Dashboard to Monitor Acute Febrile Illnesses in Guangdong and Yunnan Provinces, China, 2017-2019
T2  - HEALTH SECURITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Global spread of Zika virus in 2015 and 2016 highlighted the importance of surveillance to rapidly detect, report, and respond to emerging infections. We describe the lessons learned from the development and deployment of a web-based surveillance reporting system for Zika virus and other acute febrile illnesses (AFI) in Guangdong and Yunnan provinces, China. In less than 2 months, we customized the China Epidemiologic Dynamic Data Collection (EDDC) platform to collect, manage, and visualize data in close to real time. According to provincial and sentinel hospital staff requirements, the customized platform provided specific user authorization management, online/offline data collection, data quality control, and secure data transmission and protection and visualization tools. AFI case data and laboratory test results were entered through a web-based interface by hospital and provincial-level staff and saved on a China CDC server in Beijing. The dashboard visualized aggregate data by hospital, age, onset date, and laboratory test results. From June 2017 to December 2018, data from 768 patients with AFI were entered into the web-based surveillance system and visualized by hospital and provincial-level decision makers. Input from provincial and hospital staff was essential for developing the AFI case-reporting and feedback tools appropriate for specific settings and decision-making requirements. Web-based systems (eg, EDDC, data collection, and visualization tools that can be easily adapted to meet local surveillance needs) can help shorten time for system deployment, thereby strengthening global health security to rapidly detect and respond to emerging infections and outbreaks.

AB  - The high-speed railway from Harbin to Dalian was plays an important role for the development of the Harbin-Changchun megalopolis. In this paper, based on sentinel-1A /B data from 2016 to 2019, the surface deformation of the high-speed railway from Changchun to Harbin were firstly evaluated using time-series ps-insar method. The results indicate that the surface deformation is not dangerous for the safe operation of the railway. Moreover, the surface depressions near Dehuixi station and Zhuchengzi town are potentially dangerous for the safe of the railway. finally, the cause of the surface deformation along the railway is mainly attributed to the human activity and the seasonal subgrade frost heave in the seasonal frozen soil.

T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Diameter distributions of indigenous trees as possible criteria for indicating adapted species in semi-arid rangelands were assessed at Nthangu, Kathonzweni and Kibwezi forests of Makueni County, Kenya using existing vegetation, agro-climatic maps and Landsat images. The sites have mean annual rainfalls of 974, 700 and 616 mm respectively, and moisture indices of 49, 35 and 32%. Data on diameters at breast height (DBH) and DBH distributions were collected using transects, 18 sample plots of size 2500 m(2) and 90 subplots. Shapiro-Wilk test was used to determine normality of DBH distributions, and t-tests were conducted on species occurring in two of the three study sites. Statistically significant differences were declared at p < 0.05. Mean DBH values were 7.6, 6.4 and 4.6 cm at Kibwezi, Kathonzweni and Nthangu respectively. Ecologically important trees with high populations of juvenile individuals and near-perfect inverted J-shaped distributions were Searsia spp., Acacia hockii and Diospyros mespihformis at Nthangu; Combretum collinum, Combretum apiculatum and Acacia tortilis at Kathonzweni; and A. tortilis, Acacia mellifera and Commiphora africana at Kibwezi. These species were likely candidates for rehabilitation of degraded sections as their DBH distributions indicated regenerating, sustainable and stable populations adapted to the respective sites.

TI  - Impact of urban land cover change on the garden city status and land surface temperature of Kumasi
T2  - COGENT ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Rapid urban expansion and development have resulted in the conversion of many natural green surfaces within cities to non-transpiring built-up surfaces, such as concrete and asphalt. These artificial urban surfaces cause substantial variation in land surface temperatures that affect the urban microclimate. Thus, there is the need to substantially quantify the extent of green cover loss within growing cities and its impact on surface temperatures. This study used LANDSAT data to spatially assess the extent of urban expansion and its effect on land surface temperature within Kumasi, Ghana. Subsequently, the results showed significant changes in the land cover, which had an effect on the observed land surface temperatures from 1986 to 2015. Generally, there was an overall increase in the built-up areas by 24.13% (55.81 km(2)) from 1986 to 2015, with a corresponding increase in the mean land surface temperature by 4.16 degrees C. As such, there is the need for the adoption of sustainable urban planning strategies with green vegetation conservation initiatives for modern city planners. This would help reduce urban land surface temperatures while promoting clean air circulation within the city.

TI  - Death anxiety in the time of COVID-19: theoretical explanations and clinical implications
T2  - COGNITIVE BEHAVIOUR THERAPIST
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a surge in anxiety across the globe. Much of the public's behavioural and emotional response to the virus can be understood through the framework of terror management theory, which proposes that fear of death drives much of human behaviour. In the context of the current pandemic, death anxiety, a recently proposed transdiagnostic construct, appears especially relevant. Fear of death has recently been shown to predict not only anxiety related to COVID-19, but also to play a causal role in various mental health conditions. Given this, it is argued that treatment programmes in mental health may need to broaden their focus to directly target the dread of death. Notably, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has been shown to produce significant reductions in death anxiety. As such, it is possible that complementing current treatments with specific CBT techniques addressing fears of death may ensure enhanced long-term symptom reduction. Further research is essential in order to examine whether treating death anxiety will indeed improve long-term outcomes, and prevent the emergence of future disorders in vulnerable populations. Key learning aimsTo understand terror management theory and its theoretical explanation of death anxiety in the context of COVID-19. To understand the transdiagnostic role of death anxiety in mental health disorders. To understand current treatment approaches for directly targeting death anxiety, and the importance of doing so to improve long-term treatment outcomes.

TI  - GIRLS' TATTOOS: THEIR SIGNIFICANCE FOR SUICIDOLOGICAL PRACTICE
T2  - SUICIDOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tattoo is the process of applying a permanent (lasting, constant) drawing to the body. There is an opinion that people who want to get a tattoo, have more self-doubts, are prone to deep introspection, have a fanciful worldview. This means that the tattoo itself is an indicator of personal disharmony that can possibly be connected with auto-aggressive traits and aspirations of the person. There are opposing opinions as well. Today, there is no clear idea of the connection between the phenomenon of auto-aggression and tattooing. Whether it is a harmless behavioral pattern or behavior that basically has certain causes that are significant for suicidalogical practice requires in-depth study. The purpose of the study: to study suicidological profiles of tattooed individuals. The main objective of the study is to test the hypothesis of the relationship between having tattoos and a tendency to aggressive behavior, to understand if they have any suicide prediction value. Materials and methods. 30 girls with at least one tattoo on their body were examined (mean age - 21.07 +/- 2.1 years). A representative group with similar age and socio-demographic characteristics was used as control. As a diagnostic tool, a questionnaire to identify auto-aggressive patterns and their predictors in the past and present was used, as well as the following tests: MiniMult, STAXI, The Drego Injunction Scale (Russian version). Mathematical data processing was performed using the SPSS-Statistics V26 program. Results and discussion. The data obtained allow us to ascertain the high auto-aggressive activity of the studied group: an attempt was noted in every fourth (26.67%), every other individual had the history of suicidal thoughts 53.33% (in the control group, respectively - 6.25% and 17.19%). Significantly more often they reported depressive episodes (70%), hopelessness (60%), obsessive shame (36.6%), used drugs (33.3%), were prone to risky modes of behavior. Conclusions. We have to admit that having a tattoo is closely associated with a high risk of detecting auto-aggressive patterns in girls, both suicidal and non-suicidal. The data described above are consistent with the frequency of detection in the study group of important predictors of suicidal behavior and a specific set of psychological characteristics. The data obtained expand our understanding of the relationship between the phenomena of autoaggression and tattoos.

T2  - Movebank Data Repository

AB  - The characterization of species environmental niches and spatial distribution predictions based on them are now central to much of ecology and conservation, but implicitly requires decisions about the appropriate spatial scale (i.e. grain) of analysis. Ecological theory and empirical evidence suggest that range‐resident species respond to their environment at two characteristic, hierarchical spatial grains: (i) response grain, the (relatively fine) grain at which an individual uses environmental resources, and (ii) occupancy grain, the (relatively coarse) grain equivalent to a typical home range. We use a multi‐grain (MG) occupancy model, aided by fine‐grain remotely sensed imagery, to simultaneously estimate species‐environment associations at both grains, conduct grain optimization to measure response grain, and apply this analysis framework to an example species: a medium‐sized bird (Tockus deckeni) in a heterogeneous East African landscape. Based on home range analysis of movement data, we calculate an occupancy grain of 1km for T. deckeni. Using a grain optimization procedure across 32 grains from 10m to 500m, we identify 60m as the most strongly supported response grain for a suite of environmental variables, slightly coarser than opportunistic behavioral observations would have suggested. Validation confirms that the accuracy of the optimized MG occupancy model substantially exceeds that of equivalent single‐grain (SG) occupancy models. We further use a simulation approach to assess the potential impacts of accounting for the multi‐scale structure of species environmental requirements on estimates of population size. We find that the more strongly supported MG approach consistently predicts a minimum population sizes in the study landscape that is much lower than that provided by the SG model. This suggests that SG approaches commonly used in conservation applications could lead to overly optimistic abundance and population estimates and that the MG approach may be more appropriate for supporting species conservation goals. More generally, we conclude that multi‐grain approaches of the sort presented, and increasingly enabled by growing high‐resolution remotely sensed data, hold great promise for offering a more mechanistic framework for assessing the appropriate grain(s) for population monitoring and management and enable more reliable estimates of abundances and species distributions.

M3  - Article
AB  - Second half of 19th century-1945 was the period of drastic changes in Japanese society, the time of building the nation-state and the Great Japanese Empire, based on the unity of all Japanese people. Political reforms and the ideology of this period are well investigated. However, there are few studies of how the Japanese themselves and peoples worldview have changed. The article focuses on the emotional transformations of the Japanese during this period and based on official historical documents, writings of publicists, poetry and prose. One consequence of such a rapid changes was, in particular, the dramatic increase in number of mental illnesses and suicides during the Meiji period. Shared exaltation was a characteristic feature of the era, the most important government decisions were made on a sudden impulse. Literature (especially the new shintaishi poetry contributed to the popular feelings excitement, and openly promoted xenophobia. The belief in the superiority of the Japanese spirit over matter dictated decisions that were insane in military-practical terms. Thus, in 1941 Japan attacked the main US naval base in the Pacific - Pearl Harbor. The decision that led to the collapse of the empire.

TI  - Time-Series of Sentinel-1 Interferometric Coherence and Backscatter for Crop-Type Mapping
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The potential use of the interferometric coherence measured with Sentinel-1 satellites as input feature for crop classification is explored in this study. A one-year time-series of Sentinel-1 images acquired over an agricultural area in Spain, in which 17 crop species are present, is exploited for this purpose. Different options regarding temporal baselines, polarization, and combination with radiometric data (backscattering coefficient) are analyzed. Results show that both radiometric and interferometric features provide notable classification accuracy when used individually (overall accuracy lies between 70% and 80%). It is found that the shortest temporal baseline coherences (6 days) and the use of all available intensity images perform best, hence proving the advantage of the 6-day revisit time provided by the Sentinel-1 constellation with respect to longer revisit times. It is also shown that dual-pol data always provide better classification results than single-pol ones. More importantly, when both coherence and backscattering coefficient are jointly used, a significant increase in accuracy is obtained (greater than 7% in overall accuracies). Individual accuracies of all crop types are increased, and an overall accuracy above 86% is reached. This proves that both features provide complementary information, and that the combination of interferometric and radiometric radar data constitutes a solid information source for this application.

TI  - Model-Based Recursive Partitioning of Patients' Return Visits to Multispecialty Clinic During the 2009 H1N1 Pandemic Influenza (pH1N1).
T2  - Online journal of public health informatics
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Background During the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic (pH1N1), the proportion of outpatient visits to emergency departments, clinics and hospitals became elevated especially during the early months of the pandemic due to surges in sick, 'worried well' or returning patients seeking care. We determined the prevalence of return visits to a multispecialty clinic during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic and identify subgroups at risk for return visits using model-based recursive partitioning technique. Methods This study was a retrospective analysis of ILI-related medical care visits to multispecialty clinic in Houston, Texas obtained as part of the Houston Health Department Influenza Sentinel Surveillance Project (ISSP) during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza (April 2009 - March 2010). The data comprised of 2680 individuals who made a total of 2960 clinic visits. Return visit was defined as any visit following the index visit after the wash-out phase prior to the study period. We applied nominal logistic regression and recursive partitioning models to determine the independent predictors and the response probabilities of return visits. The sensitivity and specificity of the outcomes probabilities were determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Results Overall, 4.56% (Prob. 0.0%-17.5%) of the cohort had return visits with significant variations observed attributed to age group (76.0%), type of vaccine received by patients (18.4%) and Influenza A (pH1N1) test result (5.6%). Patients in age group 0-4 years were 9 times (aOR: 8.77, 95%CI: 3.39-29.95, p<0.0001) more likely than those who were 50+ years to have return visits. Similarly, patients who received either seasonal flu (aOR: 1.59, 95% CI 1.01-2.50, p=0.047) or pH1N1 (aOR: 1.74, 95%CI: 1.09-2.75, p=0.022) vaccines were about twice more likely to have return visits compared to those with no vaccination history. Model-based recursive partitioning yielded 19 splits with patients in subgroup I (patients of age group 0-4 years, who tested positive for pH1N1, and received both seasonal flu and pH1N1 vaccines) having the highest risk of return visits (Prob.=17.5%). The area under the curve (AUC) for both return and non-return visits was 72.9%, indicating a fairly accurate classification of the two groups. Conclusions Return visits in our cohort were more prevalent among children and young adults, and those that received either seasonal flu or pH1N1 or both vaccines. Understanding the dynamics in care-seeking behavior during pandemic would assist policymakers with appropriate resource allocation, and in the design of initiatives aimed at mitigating surges and recurrent utilization of the healthcare system.

AB  - Aerosol remote sensing has become a powerful tool to characterize the optical and microphysical properties of aerosols. Several satellite sensors such as MODIS, MISR, OMI, Tropomi and PARASOL utilize the solar electromagnetic radiation for retrieving aerosol properties from space. These instruments have high spatial coverage and can provide aerosol properties globally on a repeated basis. However, these passive sensors mostly lack the information regarding vertical distribution of aerosol and its types. Using active remote sensing technique however, provide valuable information to understand the vertical distribution of aerosols which is very useful to predict the lifetime of atmospheric aerosols, long-range transport and subsequent interaction with cloud droplets. CALIOP is an active sensor flying on board CALIPSO satellite provide height-dependent aerosol extinction repeatedly on a global basis. CALIOP aerosol retrieval algorithm retrieves aerosol information in 5 km horizontal resolution and 30-60 m vertical resolution. The latest updated CALIOP aerosol retrieval algorithm version 4 (V4) has the ability to identify ten aerosol subtypes; six for tropospheric aerosols and four for stratospheric aerosols. In this context, the annual, seasonal and diurnal variation of smoke aerosol have been investigated over central Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP), South Asia using ten years V4 CALIOP profile data. We noted that for all the seasons, the highest smoke aerosol extinction observed near surface and contributed 40-60% to the total aerosol extinction during winter (DJF) and postmonsoon seasons (ON). In premonsoon (MAM) and monsoon (JJAS) seasons the highest contribution of smoke to the total extinction coefficient found at relatively higher altitude (premonsoon: 60% at 7-9 km, monsoon: 75% at 5-8 km). The day-night occurrence frequency of smoke aerosol found higher during the day time in winter at 4 km, while during monsoon the occurrence of the smoke was found higher at night time.

TI  - <i>Money Makes the World Go</i> '<i>Round</i>: The pecuniary worldview of modern American proverbs
T2  - VESTNIK SANKT-PETERBURGSKOGO UNIVERSITETA-YAZYK I LITERATURA
M3  - Article
AB  - No matter in what currency, money rules personal and financial life to a remarkable degree, and it is not surprising that international and national proverb collections contain a plethora of examples from antiquity to the modern age. Many monetary proverbs were coined in the United States with modern American proverbs reflecting this preoccupation with pecuniary issues quite distinctly. Based on about 110 such proverbs coined after the year 1900 it is shown that they contain folk wisdom regarding business, trade, sales, purchase, payment, price, etc. with money playing a dominant role. This can be seen as a reflection of a general American worldview or mentality stemming from the fact that capitalism is part of the social and economic structure of the country. The proverbs under discussion are from The Dictionary of Modern Proverbs (2012) edited by Charles Doyle, Wolfgang Mieder and Fred Shapiro. Some of the modern proverbs give solid financial advice, especially regarding investment in the stock market. While many of them indicate a definite preoccupation with materialistic matters and an interest in accumulating wealth, there are also proverbs that deal with such socio-economic aspects as the widening schism between richness and poverty. There can be no doubt that money and wealth in all their iterations are part of the American capitalist worldview. There are numerous other components to the image of a general American mentality, but business and finance certainly belong to it.

AB  - Improving the efficiency of agriculture is impossible without the use of innovative solutions, among which it is necessary to highlight information technology and the use of the capabilities of the digital economy. To the greatest extent, these opportunities are manifested in such a new technological direction as precision farming which has received a new impetus for development in connection with the expanding use of remote sensing of the Earth. However, it should be noted that the use of remote sensing means for more than twenty years has so far had little effect on the effectiveness of precision farming technologies. This is due to the insufficient development of the scientific and methodological base for the use of remote sensing in the monitoring and control of agricultural technologies. Until now, the enormous opportunities of modern remote sensing tools are reduced to the construction and study of various types of vegetation indices, according to which it is impossible to make control decisions in precision farming systems. This problem is especially acute in control systems for the processes of applying mineral fertilizers, which are the main technological operations in crop production. Here, scientific and technological progress concerned only the mechanization of soil sampling at fixed points in the field and subsequent laboratory analysis of the samples. Each sampling point is considered representative for a field plot with an area of 5 to 15 ha. Such a technology for obtaining information is not only very laborious, but also carries big errors in the subsequent justification of fertilizer doses. The aim of this work is the further development of scientific and methodological foundations and software and hardware assessment tools according to remote sensing data of the content of the main nutrients in plants and soil.

AB  - An analysis of modern work in the field of the use of Earth remote sensing data in agriculture has shown that, at present, they have not yet created the information and methodological basis for estimating the parameters of the chemical state of plants and soil. Currently, sample surveys of fields with mechanical sampling at individual points at the end of the growing season are widely used. Such a survey is very time-consuming and expensive, and most importantly, does not have sufficient accuracy required to solve management problems and decision-making in precision farming. The aim of this work is to bridge this gap, which will make it possible to more fully use the modern capabilities of remote sensing of the Earth to solve many problems of agricultural technology management. Since the parameters of the chemical state of the soil are inaccessible to remote sensing, a two-stage iterative scheme for their assessment was developed. It consists in the fact that on the basis of mathematical models and current data of remote sensing of the Earth, the parameters of the crop biomass are estimated, as well as the parameters of the chemical state of the crop biomass, and estimates of the parameters of the chemical state of the soil are constructed from the estimates and the mathematical model. Moreover, the closure of this integration procedure is carried out by comparing the actual reflection parameters relative to the chemical state of the crop and their estimates obtained at the first stage of the assessment procedure.

TI  - Characterizing Flood Impact on Swiss Floodplains Using Interannual Time Series of Satellite Imagery
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pressure on the biodiversity of ecosystems along many rivers is growing continuously due to the increasing number of hydropower facilities regulating downstream flow and sediment regimes. Despite a thorough understanding of the short-term processes and interactions at this hydro-biosphere interface, long-term analyses of the impacts on floodplain dynamics are lacking. We used interannual Landsat 4, 5, 7, and 8 time series to analyze the effects of hydrological events on floodplain vegetation in four mountainous floodplains in the Swiss Alps. Using a spectral mixture analysis approach, we demonstrate that the floodplain vegetation dynamics of mountainous rivers can be recovered at a spatial resolution of 30 m. Our results suggest that interactions between floods and floodplain vegetation are complex and not exclusively related to flood magnitude. Of the four reaches analyzed, only data gathered along the submountainous reach with a quasi-natural flow regime show a clear link between remotely sensed vegetation indices and floods. In addition, our 29-year time series shows a continuous upward trend in vegetation indices along the floodplains, strongest in the reaches affected by hydropower facilities. The approach presented in this study can be easily replicated in other mountain ranges by providing available flow data to verify the impact of hydropower on floodplain vegetation dynamics.

T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion represents one of the most severe soil degradation processes. Approximately 65% of Serbia is affected by erosion of different intensities. In the Polomska River catchment, which is a typical torrential area, the assessment of soil erosion was conducted, and soil loss was determined using USLE and WaTEM/SEDEM model. The average annual soil loss by USLE is 11.19 t.ha(-1) yr(-1), while soil loss by WaTEM model is 13.37 t.ha(-1) yr(-1), which is in accordance with mean values for Europe. Supervised classification was performed on SENTINEL 10m resolution satellite, in order to obtain land use classes. Based on these classes, soil loss values, were compared, according to different erosion intensity categories. Analysing the intensity categories inside specific land use class, the models give different and uneven results. The most evident difference of estimated soil loss, are in the class of agricultural soil, and generally, WaTEM gives higher values, in all the categories.

AB  - Pastoral counseling and Christian counseling do not have psychological assessment instruments based on the Christian worldview, Christian tradition, and the Bible, so they have relied on general psychological assessment tools to measure and evaluate the client's psyche. Since this phenomenon has negatively affected the identity of pastoral counseling and Christian counseling, developing a Christian psychological assessment instrument was one of the tasks necessary for pastoral counseling and Christian counseling. The purpose of this study is to develop and validate the New Testament-based Biblical Heart Inventory.The Biblical Heart Inventory uses Bible verses in the New Testament that include the word καρδία (heart). Use of the inventory is intended to give Christian clients a sense of security and be suitable for use in the church. In Christianity, the Bible holds its place as a scripture and is the example for all Christians as the Word of God, so the Biblical Heart Inventory provides an opportunity for Christians to reflect on themselves in the light of God's Word. In fact, the Biblical Heart Inventory can be said to be a tool for Bible-based theological reflection.First, this study suggests the necessity of the Biblical Heart Inventory, introduces the process of item development, and then presents the results of exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis. As a result of exploratory factor analysis, 75 items of 15 factors were extracted. Factor loading was in the range of .48-.91, commonality was in the range of .49-.88, and explanatory power was 68.815%, showing stable results. As a result of confirmatory factor analysis, the fit of model was verified, with RMSEA of .043, and CFI, TLI, and IFI of more than .90, respectively.

CL  - Banjarmasin, INDONESIA
AB  - Peatlands are globally recognized for their high carbon stock. Worldwide estimates of soil carbon stocks have improved in the last decade due to the availability of large soil datasets and wide application of digital topsoil mapping. However, most mapping studies focus on mineral soils and do not include peatlands, leading to uncertainties in the global estimates. To reduce this knowledge gap, digital mapping techniques should be applied to peatlands. This study reviewed the controls of peatland distribution along with mapping in Indonesia. Open digital mapping techniques were introduced and demonstrated for charting peat thickness in Bengkalis Island in Indonesia. The approach makes use of the abundance of satellite data currently available in an open-access format. Additionally, it utilizes a range of machine learning algorithms in an open-source computing environment for mapping peatlands. It is upheld for transparency in the procedures, making it reputable and accountable. Due to its open nature, the method is scalable and appropriate for countries in tropical regions such as Indonesia. Field work and computer modelling can be executed in parallel for different regions and thus enhance the availability of high-quality peat information.

TI  - TOPOS "KARJALA" IN BILINGUAL POETRY BY A. VOLKOV
T2  - NAUCHNYI DIALOG
M3  - Article
AB  - The observations on the specifics of the Karjala topos in the works of the bilingual poet A. Volkov is for the first time presented in the article. It has been proved that in his mind "Karjala" is associated with "native land", the memory of ancestors, native language, Livvik's happiness itself. In Russian and Karelian-language poems, the recreated spaces of "Karjala" are semantically similar. This locus is open (the center of the universe) and closed (the outskirts of Russia) at the same time. Like an archeologist, the author turns to the understanding of the mythological genealogy of "Karjala", its ancestral homeland, proto-language, archetypes of national consciousness, totem signs. The authors found that the bilingual view of the universe allowed the poet to conceptualize in a new way and reveal, in the context of world history and culture, the main concepts in the life of Livvik Karelians: native dialect, memory of tradition, Karelian genotype, Livvik happiness. Particular attention is paid to the analysis of the socalled semantic "transitions" from one ethnic picture of the world to another (remembering is transformed into crying, the genesis of the native language as a gift from God - into the path to God). In the poetic reconstruction of the Karjala topos by A. Volkov, the Karelian worldview is fundamental, the Russian language and literature is a guide in the formation of an original poetic tradition. For the first time, the original poems of A. Volkov and their auto-translations were introduced into scientific circulation.

AB  - The Mekong delta is inhabited by more than 20 million people in Vietnam and is highly vulnerable to the additive effects of land subsidence and sea-level rise due to global climate change. To cover Delta-wide from 2015-2020, there are 250 multi-temporal SAR Sentinel-1 images, where each scene is stored in complex values with about 14 GB memory data. To do interferometry processing, we need to be able to intelligently handle ensemble 250x14 GB data. Thus, although Sentinel-1 Big Data offers the best opportunity for land subsidence monitoring, it is challenge due to an unprecedented big volume of multi-temporal InSAR dataset. In this paper, the objective is to provide a discuss on a feasible method to handle the Delta-wide land subsidence by TOPS interferometry.

TI  - Assessing temporal variation of coloured dissolved organic matter in the coastal waters of South Eastern Arabian Sea
T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) plays a major role in marine photochemical and biological processes and its optical properties are known to affect the underwater light penetration. This paper highlights in situ optical estimation and satellite retrieval of CDOM in deciphering its temporal variations in coastal waters of the South Eastern Arabian Sea. The study accentuated the source of CDOM as terrigenous origin during monsoon, of in situ productions during pre-monsoon and during post-monsoon of autochthonous-allocthonous origin. The matchup analysis for in situ and MODIS Aqua retrieved A(dg)443 exhibited bias which decreased by incorporating the seasonal component. The study also identified degrading bloom of Noctiluca scintillans as the source for exceptionally high CDOM in the area during January and February. The study demands to incorporate seasonal components and phytoplankton abundance while assessing the performance of CDOM algorithms in optically complex coastal waters.

TI  - Copernicus Program as a source of information on the dominant leaf type in Poland - assessment of the accuracy of the national high resolution layer
T2  - SYLWAN
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on the spatial distribution and variability of forests is important in monitoring of forest resources, biodiversity assessment, threat prevention, estimation of carbon content and forest management. The Pan-European High Resolution Layers (HRLs) produced as part of the European Earth Monitoring Programme - Copernicus provide detailed information on the land cover characteristics in Europe. The HRLs are produced using satellite imagery based on an interactive rule-based classification. There are the following HRL themes: imperviousness, forest, water and wetness and grasslands. The HRLs are available for the reference year 2012 and 2015, at the spatial resolution of 20 m. The forest related HRL consists of tree cover density, dominant tree type and forest type products. In this study, we performed a) the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the accuracy of the dominant leaf type (DLT) layer for the 2015 year at the national scale, and b) detailed analysis of the data quality at the forest stand level over the selected forest districts. The DLT layer was compared with the national orthophotos. The detailed analysis was carried out using Sentinel-2 images and forest inventory data obtained from the Forest Data Bank over the selected forest districts. The accuracy analysis of the national DLT layer revealed the high omission error equal to 18.8%, and lower commission error of 5.4%. The omission error is mostly related to the omitted orchards and young forest plantations, which are included in the DLT layer. The commission error of the broadleaved forest is related mostly to the small patches of coniferous forest that was misclassified as broadleaved. In general, commission errors were identified more frequently in broadleaved forest than in the coniferous forest. In many locations the patches of coniferous forest were misclassified as broadleaved forest. In general, the area of the broadleaved forest is overestimated.

TI  - ON THE TIME IN RUSSIAN BYLINAS AND ITS AXIOLOGICAL NATURE
T2  - NOVYI ISTORICHESKII VESTNIK-THE NEW HISTORICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The subject matter of the given study is both the artistic time of Russian heroic epics and its relationship with the present continuous of traditional bylina narration. Based on the results of bylina axiological analysis, the author criticizes the existing stereotype (produced by M.M. Bakhtin, D.S. Likhachov, and other scholars) according to which the epic time should be described as ideal, sacral, and "insular" (an "original time") - i.e., as separated from the ordinary time of the epic singer and his audience.According to the author, Russian folk epics do not imply any features of the sacral "original time", but absorb traits of different historical epochs into themselves on the principle of identical "spiritual codes", their temporality essentially open to the present and future of the epic singer and his audience. The convergence between the "ancient" epic time and the "familiar" time of the audience is due to the single system of value coordinates which, in turn, are equally applicable for the assessment of acts committed either by epic knights or listeners themselves. For this reason, the events belonging to different historical periods are rendered in Russian bylinas as subordinate to and comprehended by the universal logic of spiritual laws - the ones immanent to the consciousness of the hero and his traditional audience.The author concludes that the temporality of Russian folk epics is subjected to the law of "reverse perspective" according to which the past shouldn't be represented as distant and vague, but, on the contrary, as realistic and near, placed in the foreground of the recipient's perception, in the field of the present. At that, the necessary condition to "draw" the audience into the epic chronotope is the positioning of plotlines' "vanishing point" "behind" the listener - i.e., in his or her personal space and personal time focused on individual future. As a result, the present time of the audience becomes an organic part of the epic continuum, while the "epic knights' time" is perceived by the listener as a number of well-structured elements translating a certain axiological worldview. The transition from the "familiar" time to the "relevant epic" one is experienced by the listener precisely as a personal transition from one value system to another.

AB  - The satellite images can be categorized in three classes on the basis of the spectral bands, viz., panchromatic, multispectral and hyprspectral. The multispectral imageries are very useful in the feature extraction and enhancement, the combination of bands creates magical effect not only to delineate some features but also to eliminate the others. Several water indices on the basis of band combinations have been proposed by the researchers for the open surface water detection. In the present work a new index has been proposed for open surface water detection from landsat-8 satellite imagery. The proposed index can detect the water class more efficiently as compared to the existing indices which has been supported by the quantitative data. The results are validated in terms of the number of pixels of water class with an accuracy of 99.77%.

T2  - Journal of Urban Ecology
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the major drivers of global biodiversity declines is habitat loss and modification, often associated with anthropogenic environments. To mitigate biodiversity declines, a comprehensive understanding of how species respond to novel anthropogenic environments is required. Compared to natural habitats, human-modified environments often have increased noise and light pollution, potentially affecting acoustically communicating species, such as frogs. These areas may force animals to modulate or alter their calls to communicate with potential mates, as they compete with anthropogenic noise. Using large-scale citizen science data, coupled with remotely sensed data, we examined how the advertisement calls of the Australian red tree frog (Litoria rubella) varied in response to a gradient consistent with anthropogenic disturbance. After measuring a suite of acoustic properties of L.rubella across its range, we discovered that their advertisement calls showed no response to a disturbance urbanisation gradient. The advertisement calls of the species were highly variable, both at continental and local scales. Our results indicate that acoustic communication in male L.rubella may not be impeded in human-modified habitats as (1) they are a loud species typically heard over background noise and multi-species choruses and (2) their calls are highly variable-potentially serving as a buffer to any acoustic disturbances. Overall, our results provide evidence that some frog species may be acoustically urban tolerant and provide a greater understanding of the responses frogs exhibit to human-mediated environmental change.

Wind speed W, cloud liquid water content Q and total atmospheric water vapor content V were estimated from GMI and AMSR2 data with original algorithm based on total atmospheric absorption at frequency of 10.65 GHz tau(10). Mean square slope (mss) was retrieved from Ku-band channel of DPR radar. The location of typhoon center was traced due to the difference of retrieved parameters between the eye and surrounding area. Hagibis warm core was found by MTVZA-GY radiometer at several frequencies at oxygen absorption band. The position of the sharp gradient zones in V, Q and tau(10) fields served as an indicator of the change of typhoon area and structure. The calm cloudless region in the western Japan Sea was used as the reference area for matching to zero level of the retrieved wind speed and mss.

AB  - Assessment of potential risk of land degradation, especially after fire events, is essential for identifying and prioritizing sites for post-fire management. This study aimed to model potential post-fire land degradation risk in Lebanon in order to plan and prioritize post-fire management actions. The specific objectives were to 1) map "burn severity" of the year 2019 using Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2-A imagery and 2) model post-fire land degradation risk using a Geographic ObjectBased Image Analysis (GEOBIA) approach. Initially, mapping burned areas of the 2019 fire season involved the use of a differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) of Sentinel 2-A imagery. Another dNBR image was produced with the use of Landsat 8 imagery. Mapping overall burn severity was conducted based on cross-mapping between the two dNBR images which involved data sources of different spatial and spectral characteristics. Potential post-fire degradation risk was modelled in GEOBIA with the combined use of burn severity and topographic data (i.e., slope gradients). In addition, field data was collected to produce a Composite Burn Index (CBI) of fire-affected sites. The correlation between field data (i.e., CBI scores) and imagery analysis (i.e., dNBR data from Sentinel 2-A and Landsat 8) was assessed using a Spearman correlation test. The combined use of satellite remote sensing images (i.e., polygons of post-fire degradation risk) and their corresponding ancillary data (i.e., CBI and soil texture) allowed the prioritization of fire affected sites for implementing post-fire restoration measures.

M3  - Article
AB  - The Soviet intelligentsia were perceived by the government and outside observers as a non-religious and even atheist community, as higher education supposedly would effectively obliterate a religious worldview. In reality, the situation was significantly more complicated. From the 1950s through the 1980s, for the wider Soviet public, the intelligentsia were the accumulator, converter, and relay of various religious concepts. These included not only modernized versions of traditional Russian religions (Orthodoxy, Judaism, Catholicism), but also a wide range of new religions (neo-Hinduism, Buddhism, yoga, Neopaganism, astrology). The author also includes parascientific beliefs (for example, yetis or UFOs) and so-called "civil religions" ("noosphereology" and other versions of Vladimir Vernadsky's teachings, "methodology," morozovschina [later known as the teachings of Anatoly Fomenko]). In this article, the author intends to examine the process of developing and disseminating these teachings among Soviet intelligentsia in the 1950s and 1960s, their institutionalization in the 1970s, and commercialization and the beginning of a mass mission in the 1980s. As a whole, the process of the propagation of these teachings among the Soviet intelligentsia is seen by the author as a part of the overall process of rethinking the role of religion of the propagation of new religious teachings among individuals with higher education in the economically developed countries of the Northern Hemisphere in the 1950s and 1960s.

AB  - In this paper, we attempt to fill some gaps in the knowledge of the oil pollution pattern in the whole area of the Caspian Sea on the base of the remotely sensed data. We present the results of a long-term survey of the Caspian Sea by use of satellite SARs and multispectral sensors. Our primary attention is focused on the oil showings on the sea surface due to natural hydrocarbon emissions from the seabed. During our satellite survey, we discovered a previously unknown seep of petroleum hydrocarbons from the seabed in the shelf area of the Caspian Sea near the Cheleken Peninsula, which belongs administratively to Turkmenistan. We documented its source point as the persistent location of the origins of 379 oil slicks detected in satellite images taken over the area of interest. We also performed the precise estimation of the actual positions of two offshore seeps on the Iranian shelf near the Cape Sefid Rud on the base of 173and 198 oil slicks correspondently. For these two regions of interest, we compare the release rates of the crude oil from the seabed to the sea surface. Further, we assess the detection rate of oil showings on the sea surface, depending on a sensor type and the season. We put together detailed maps of the sea surface oil pollution caused by natural hydrocarbons seepages on the seabed and determine areas of the high risks of sea surface oil pollution.

AB  - Herein, we propose a novel scheme for detecting earthquake-damaged buildings from optical satellite imageries. The scheme comprises two steps: first, using the information of the positions and shapes of the buildings in a GIS database, we identify the photographic scope of each residence in wide-area photographic imagery and extract small photographic fragments at the level of individual structures. Second, using a classifier to determine if these individual fragments represent collapsed structures, we assess the damage of the residential structures in the affected area. Furthermore, we verify the effectiveness of applying the recent machine learning techniques to improve the performance of the classifier. To utilize images captured before and immediately after the earthquake, we apply spatio-temporal convolution neural network that is regarded as a generalized method of image subtraction. Additionally, we integrate the structural attributes comprising structural age and structural materials with the satellite images using a multimodal learning structure. The effectiveness of using the aforementioned techniques is discussed using a dataset constructed from a satellite imagery of the affected area in 2016 Kumamoto Earthquake Japan taken by Spot 6 and 7.

TI  - Evaluation of Hyperspectral Multitemporal Information to Improve Tree Species Identification in the Highly Diverse Atlantic Forest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring of forest resources is crucial for their sustainable management, and tree species identification is one of the fundamental tasks in this process. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and miniaturized lightweight sensors can rapidly provide accurate monitoring information. The objective of this study was to investigate the use of multitemporal, UAV-based hyperspectral imagery for tree species identification in the highly diverse Brazilian Atlantic forest. Datasets were captured over three years to identify eight different tree species. The study area comprised initial to medium successional stages of the Brazilian Atlantic forest. Images were acquired with a spatial resolution of 10 cm, and radiometric adjustment processing was performed to reduce the variations caused by different factors, such as the geometry of acquisition. The random forest classification method was applied in a region-based classification approach with leave-one-out cross-validation, followed by computing the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUCROC) curve. When using each dataset alone, the influence of different weather behaviors on tree species identification was evident. When combining all datasets and minimizing illumination differences over each tree crown, the identification of three tree species was improved. These results show that UAV-based, hyperspectral, multitemporal remote sensing imagery is a promising tool for tree species identification in tropical forests.

AB  - Understanding spatiotemporal distribution of terrestrial water in Arctic region is essential to diagnose/predict the impact of climate change at the region. Among the components of the total terrestrial water, surface water is important in the aspect of ecology and human living. To observe the broad region with good observation frequency, this research investigates ability of passive microwave satellite data to extract surface water fraction (SWF), with the help of optical data. In spite of the complex landscape with boreal forest, snow/ice, river and wetland, a polarization difference index derived from AMSR2 could track SWF, although it has a detection limit in open-water size and it is likely to be affected by snow and/or frozen soil in the winter and thaw season. Combination with other water indices derived from microwave data may also contribute to accurate estimation of SWF.

TI  - Evaluation of tree-base data mining algorithms in land used/land cover mapping in a semi-arid environment through Landsat 8 OLI image; Shiraz, Iran
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - Land Use Land Cover (LULC) mapping has been used in different environmental applications including disaster management, risk analysis, heat island mapping, and the effects of urbanization on environmental changes such as floods and droughts in the recent decade. The earth's natural surface coverage including urban infrastructure, surface vegetation, bare soil can be identified with LULC maps. Besides, LULC is one of the most important tasks in natural hazards, planning activities, resource management, and global monitoring studies. The present study aimed to improve the level of land used and land cover change mapping in a semi-arid environment using Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) image. In this research, several tree-based algorithms for LULC mapping are used and compared. These algorithms are used in a combination model implementation of WEKA 3.8 and R programming language to provide a method of a fit-for-purpose algorithms for LULC mapping. It is found that Reduced Error Pruning Tree (REP Tree) is the best approach according to the training and test datasets which are four classes including the build-up, soil, roads, and vegetation region pixels in a semi-arid environment. For the training dataset, the best values of Overall Accuracy (OA), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is determined, 99.7313, 0.002 and 0.0354 as well as for the test dataset are 99.7313, 0.002 and 0.0354, respectively. Finally, trained models of the implemented data mining algorithms are used for the classification of a different dataset without using any training data where the Logical Analysis of Data Tree (LAD Tree) algorithm shows the best performance in terms of OA, MAE, and RMSE with values of 99.2815, 0.0057, and 0.0557 respectively.

TI  - A Forgotten Philosopher Juozapas Cepenas: Ethic Insights
T2  - FILOSOFIJA-SOCIOLOGIJA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with ethic insights of the priest Juozapas Cepenas (1880-1976), who published a study cycle on Nietzsche. This cycle is significant in the context of an early reception of Nietzsche's ideas in Lithuania; however, the author himself appears to remain an undeservedly forgotten thinker of the national school of thought. The article attempts to bring back Cepenas' philosophical outlooks and analyse the factors that shaped his philosophical position such as his academic upbringing in German classical universities and epenas' subsequent activities overstepping the boundaries of a clerical work. The article offers a new interdisciplinary approach in reviewing Cepenas' dissertation thesis that earned him a Degree of Doctor of Philosophy of Freiburg University. The thesis is analysed in comparison to other Cepenas' philosophical writings on Dostoevsky produced at the period of university studies and later during his clerical service in Lithuania. Ethical aspects of Cepenas' thesis continue to hold relevance until the recent period of philosophical development. Cepenas' writings are viewed in parallel analysis with a spectrum of the Lithuanian existential thought. Critical contemplations on ethical principles in the cycle of articles on Nietzsche's philosophy are emphasised. The article attempts to clarify Cepenas' understanding of the egotism of the superhuman, the reasons and the content of supplements of Christian ethics, and the concept of the secular purpose of life.

TI  - Ecological worldview, attitudes, and visitors' behaviour: a study of front-country campers
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOTOURISM
M3  - Article
AB  - Tourism and recreation have included attitudes in their proenvironmental behaviour prediction frameworks, though not many have assessed the cognitive and affective dimensions of attitudes in their analyses. In environmental psychology, environmental values are antecedent to attitudes, where ecological worldviews are reflective of environmental values. This study reports the influence of nature-based tourists' ecological worldviews in combination with the cognitive and affective dimensions of attitudes on pro-environmental behavioural intentions. A sample of 1,009 front-country campers visiting Alberta, Canada's provincial parks were surveyed. Analysis of data using structural equation modelling revealed that affectiveattitudes strongly and positively influenced intentions to engage in nature-protective behaviours while camping; cognitive-attitudes had a non-significant effect on intentions. This is congruent with other studies' findings that emphasize the importance of affect in influencing intentions and behaviours. Respondents' New Ecological Paradigm scale scores demonstrated a direct, positive effect on camper's intention to engage in pro-environmental camping behaviours. They also had a strong indirect effect on intentions through affective-attitudes. These findings suggest an emphasis on affect-based messaging to promote proenvironmental behaviour among nature-based tourists are warranted, especially when communicating to individuals who already possess pro-ecological worldviews.

AB  - This research developed a new approach to extract the lineaments using Landsat, QuickBird and ALOS PALSAR satellite remotely sensed data in Aynak copper mine which is located in Kabul tectonic block and the Tethyan Copper Belt of Afghanistan. Lineaments and trench directions are not relatively studied in the study area which will bring obstacles in exploration and extraction of the mine. This research aims to extract the lineaments for studying the better trench direction in the study area. Lineaments such as faults and joints are extremely important structures that not only show the surface structure but also give us important knowledge about the subsurface of the earth. Afghanistan is a part of the Alpine-Himalayan orogenic belt which suffers from high tectonic movements in some areas, especially north-eastern and central parts which leads to the occurrence of different lineaments and unconformities. Lineaments can be surveyed and mapped using field geological survey or using satellite remotely sensed data. Satellite remote sensing data costs less and takes less time compare to field geological survey for lineament extraction. This research used Landsat 8 natural color with 2, 3, 4 band composition, QuickBird 1m resolution, and ALOS PALSAR 12.5 m satellite imagery to detect and map the lineaments in the Aynak copper mine area in Afghanistan. Geomatica software was used for lineament extraction using the Manual technique. Then the rose diagrams of the lineaments were plotted using Polar Plots extension of ArcGIS. Next, the rose diagrams derived from the two mentioned lineament extraction techniques were compared and evaluated. Global Mapper software was used for the extraction of lineaments using Visual technique and to map the rivers and ridges in the Aynak area of interest for validation of the results. Finally, the best orientation for trenches in Aynak copper mine was derived. This study found that faults and joints in the study area have a NE-SW trend and directions. This study will contribute to a better understanding of the trench direction and mineral exploration in Aynak copper mine.

AB  - In this study, classification results were derived from remote sensing data and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm used in this process, which classifies Landsat land-cover images. The accuracy of image classifications was evaluated by calculation of the Kappa coefficient. The area of study is Karaj, the capital of Alborz province, in north-central Iran. It is situated in the foothills of the Alborz Mountains and occupies a fertile agricultural plain. Landsat data used in the classification of land cover were collected from USGS websites, and multi-temporal images from the data were geometrically corrected. After this process, we calculated 11 metrics at the landscape and class-level scales: five metrics of class level and six metrics of landscape. The results showed that the landscape patterns in Karaj were changed due to the process of urbanization over an 11-year period. At the class level, for all classifications, the AI metric increased and the PD and NP metrics decreased. At the landscape level, the PD, ED, NP, and SHDI metrics decreased, and LPI and AI increased. These results provide insights about urban development policies and about whether the expansion of urban areas is beneficial for environmental sustainability in Iran and elsewhere in the world.

AB  - The changes in the land cover using geographical information systems and remote sensing techniques for the period (1990 - 2019) for part of the Baghdad governorate in central Iraq are detected and monitored. In this research, four satellite scenes with different sensors were used the TM, ETM+, and OLI, which were obtained by Landsat-5, Landsat-7 and Landsat-8 satellites, respectively. Maximum likelihood method supervised classification is adopted as the main classifier to distinguish different land cover types in the study region. The results showed that there are ten different classes in the values of their reflectance. This study proved that any landcover of the earth's surface can be studied and determined by its spectral characteristics. The change for each class of the land cover for the study area was determined within the study period. The results of the study confirmed the possibility of identifying the types of land cover and finding the percentage of changes that occur in it and detecting it with high efficiency using the remote sensing technique.

TI  - MAPPING MANGROVE DENSITY FOR CONSERVATION OF THE RAMSAR SITE IN PENINSULAR MALAYSIA
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSERVATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - It is widely agreed that rapid development has led to mangroves being in urgent need of improved monitoring and assessment techniques for better conservation. In Malaysia, the Convention on Wetlands, otherwise known as the Ramsar Convention, came into being specifically to address this problem and protect this particular area. The rapidly rising sea-level at mangrove sites is currently impacting the depth of mangrove soil, so action must be extended using available technology to sustain mangrove lives. This study tested if the vegetation indices from recent high-resolution multispectral satellite images Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre, known as SPOT, can map mangrove density and predict health area for the sites. An Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) was also used to fly at the nearer sites for mangrove density classification mapping based on feature extraction tools classification. This study employed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI), Greenness Vegetation Index (GVI), and Ratio Vegetation Index (RVI) to map mangrove density for the study site. The study showed, in terms of Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) measurement, that 52% of the area was "high density", 10%-19% was "low density", and "low density mixed sand" and also "sand" area. The results also showed that NDVI responded higher for "high density" with 0.56, GNDVI with 0.27 for "high density", GDVI with 17.0, and RVI only classified two density areas. In addition, the UAV images were classified into shadow, obvious tree crown, vegetation in the water, sea area, and others. As expected, the study revealed that UAV (b) was presented in a very high percentage in obvious tree crowns but in a low percentage with 2% of other classes, making it a distinct class from others. In addition, UAV (a) showed 42% shadow with a small portion distributed in other vegetation features (sea area and others) class, 4% to 10%. Mangrove density can also be used as an indicator of mangrove health status because low density mangroves are always found near to the risk areas.

AB  - The main objective of this paper is mapping of Soybean and Cotton crop area using the integration of Sentinel-1 and 2 observations and Deep Neural Networks (DNN). The present research also attempted the identification of early and late sowing of Soybean and Cotton using time-series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and VH backscatter. The study was carried out in Wardha district of Maharashtra, India during Kharif 2019. The Sentinel-1 observations available during 15 Jun. to 30 Nov. 2019 and Sentinel-2 maximum NDVI and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) composites during Aug. to Sept. and Oct. to Nov. 2019 were used for Cotton and Soybean area mapping. We evaluated the performance of tuned Random Forest (RF) and DNN for classification of Soybean and Cotton. Results showed that DNN performs better with an overall accuracy of 89.15% and the F-score of 0.856. Further, identification of early and late sown Soybean and Cotton was performed using short time-series of VH backscatter and NDVI. Local minima along with subsequent increase/decrease based approach was developed for the separation of early and late sown crop. Visual comparison with geo-tagged crop growth stage images shows good agreement between estimated and actual sowing time window.

AB  - Satellite-based Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) observations can provide global estimates of ocean surface motion. We used Doppler Centroid anomaly from Sentinel-1 Interferometric Wide (IW) mode observations collocated with Lagrangian ocean surface drifter (CARTHE) and high-resohution free-run ocean model (ROMS) to study Norwegian Coastal Current. The ocean surface current derived from the Sentine-1 is in good agreement with the ocean surface drifter observations as well as the ocean surface velocity derived from ROMS. Although just one case is investigated, the study shows promising results of using Doppler shift observations from the Sentinel-1 Interferometric Wide (IW) mode for studying ocean surface currents in the coastal zone with high-spatial resolution.

TI  - RELIGIOUS INTERSECTIONS IN AFRICAN CHRISTIANITY: THE CONVERSION DILEMMA AMONG INDIGENOUS CONVERTS
T2  - SCRIPTURA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIBLE RELIGION AND THEOLOGY IN SOUTHERN AFRICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The conversion of indigenous converts to Christianity is often perceived as a linear process, which marks individuals' rebirth and assumption of a new identity as they are assimilated into the Christian fold. This simplistic view, however, seems to undermine the intrinsic technicalities that are involved in the process of conversion, particularly for indigenous converts who already embrace a unique worldview, which is different from and sometimes contradictory to the conservative Christian outlook. This paper uses a qualitative research approach in the form of document analysis to critically explore the religious intersectionalities between Christianity and African Traditional Religion (ATR), and discusses some dilemmas that are inherent in the conversion of indigenous converts. It concludes by suggesting a paradigmatic model for re-viewing and reinterpreting the coming together of Christianity and African Traditional Religion in Africa south of the Sahara, particularly in South Africa.

AB  - Orbital imatzes have been increasingly refined spatially as spectrally as that is the case with those provided by satellite Earth observation WorldView-3 used in this paper. However, the images are very susceptible to noise interference, so it is difficult to identify and characterize objects. Therefore, it is essential to use techniques to minimize them. Thus, through increasingly innovative processing, it is possible to carry out detailed characterization mainly of urban areas. This work aims to perform the classification of images Worldview-3 using the advanced methods of classification Random Forest and Deep Learning for the region of Botafogo in the municipality of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Such classifications were performed for four different data sets, including the spectral bands and transformations (MNF and PCA) resulting from the original images. The results demonstrate that the use of transformations resulting from the original images as input data for the extraction of attributes in conjunction with the spectral bands improves the accuracy of the classifications generated by the Random Forest and Deep Learning method.

AB  - SAR despeckling is a problem of paramount importance in remote sensing, since it represents the first step of many scene analysis algorithms. Recently, deep learning techniques have outperformed classical model-based despeckling algorithms. However, such methods require clean ground truth images for training, thus resorting to synthetically speckled optical images since clean SAR images cannot be acquired. In this paper, inspired by recent works on blind-spot denoising networks, we propose a self-supervised Bayesian despeckling method. The proposed method is trained employing only noisy images and can therefore learn features of real SAR images rather than synthetic data. We show that the performance of the proposed network is very close to the supervised training approach on synthetic data and competitive on real data.

T2  - SEMINARS IN NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Well executed multicenter clinical trials often provide significant evidence and support for, or against, foundational aspects of clinical procedures perceived to improve clinical management of a medical condition. In this review, discussed are reports of multicenter clinical trials designed to investigate sentinel lymph node biopsy procedures in seven types of cancer: breast, melanoma, head and neck, gastric, colon, uterine, and vulvar-with focus on the most recent reports of the hypotheses, objectives, parameters, data, results, implications, and impacts of the included trials.Such trials generally enroll more subjects, in shorter time periods, than do single-center studies. Such studies generally also have greater diversities among investigator practitioners and investigative environments than do single-center studies. The greater number of subjects provides more power to statistical analyses performed in such studies. The more rapid accrual usually results in data being more consistently acquired. The diversities of practitioners and environments may produce results that are more conservative than might be obtained from more "focused" studies; however, diversities in a study often identify implicitly results that are more robust-that is results applicable by more practitioners and applicable in more environments.

AB  - An attempt has been made to correlate groundwater quantity and quality concerning land use and land cover in the city, Raipur, Chhattisgarh, India. The land-use land-cover (LULC) is one of the dynamic processes of the urbanization method in a city or cities in a developing country. To assess the land use and land cover classes, we have used the multi-temporal remote sensing LANDSAT data of the year 2000 and 2018. There are ten LULC classes are identified, such as settlement, road, cultivation, industry, drainage, river, open land, vegetation, canal, and water bodies. The result shows that the LULC changes are mainly associated within the settlement and the cultivated area in the highest degree from 2000 to till date (2018). A comparison of LULC between the years 2000 and 2018 indicates that anthropogenic activities like settlement, road, and industrial areas have been expanded. The spatiotemporal variation of the water table and water quality parameters such as electrical conductivity (EC), Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), and Nitrate (NO3) between the year 2000 and 2018 have also been studied. The result shows that significant changes in the groundwater quantity and quality in the study area are due to anthropogenic activity.

AB  - Coastline detection, and monitoring have different research challenges. Global warming, deforestation, and sea level rising have several adverse effects on coastlines such as, erosion, coastline recession, loss of biodiversity, etc. In the past, various techniques have been proposed to detect, and monitor coastlines. While detecting coastlines, most of the techniques do not consider removing inland water bodies. The objective of this work is to remove inland water bodies, in the process of detection of coastlines. For accomplishing this task, we propose to use difference of Coal Mine Index (CMI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) to separate water bodies from other regions. Subsequently, inland water bodies are identified from this set by computing and analyzing their contours, and removed to provide coastlines. Overall, this work presents a novel automated method of coastline detection with the presence of inland water bodies having precision, and recall of 80%, and 82.35%, respectively.

AB  - This work shows two examples on the use of Sentinel-1 data for monitoring different natural processes, like active geohazards or glacier dynamics in the Patagonia region. Sentinel-1 is a two-satellite constellation, launched by the European Space Agency (ESA), that provides SAR imagery with interferometric capabilities. It is in operation since 2014 and has supposed a significant improvement in the exploitation of these type of data for applications like natural hazards mapping and monitoring. The acquisition policy, that guarantees an acquisition each few days (12 days in Patagonia region) for both ascending and descending trajectories, and the data distribution policy, that allows free access to the images without legal constrains, are the main reasons for this improvement. These two aspects allowed not only to assure the data in the past but also to perform monitoring plans at medium-long term. In this work we show the potentialities of the use of these data in the Patagonia region through the application of two different techniques in two different application test sites: urban areas and glaciers.

AB  - Accurate knowledge of soil and crop conditions such as water content, biomass, and phenology is crucial in agriculture for estimating growth and productivity. Remote sensing observations at microwave frequencies are sensitive to various soil and crop characteristics. For example, both the active (radar) and passive (radiometer) microwave sensors measure radiation quantities that are functions of soil and vegetation dielectric constant and exhibit sensitivities to soil moisture (SM) and vegetation water content (VWC). In addition to SM, the quantities are also influenced by other land surface parameters such temperature, soil surface roughness, vegetation geometry. Brightness temperature (T-B) is more sensitive to SM and less sensitive to surface roughness and vegetation geometry compared to radar backscattering (sigma(0)). Satellite passive observations have been widely used because of their high temporal resolutions (frequency of every 3 days), but these observations are available at coarse resolutions of about 25-40km. In contrast, satellite active observations from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) provide finer resolution (lower than 3 km), but low temporal resolution. However, with the recent availabilities of both Radarsat-2 and Sentinel-1, we have almost weekly observations combining both observations. In addition, upcoming launch of NISAR mission in 2021 will provide unprecedented opportunities to harness multifrequency observations at L-, S-, and C-bands. In this study, we investigate sensitivities of such multifrequency observations to soil and vegetation water content using current C-band SAR data and ground-based L-band data (in preparation for NISAR) obtained from field experiments. Active L-band observations are the most sensitive to SM variations even when the biomass in agriculture fields such as corn is high; in contrast, active C-band observations are more sensitive to vegetation.

TI  - Primary Aortoesophageal Fistula: Is a High Level of Suspicion Enough?
T2  - European journal of case reports in internal medicine
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Aortoenteric fistula (AEF) is a rare condition with a high mortality rate. AEFs are classified according to their primary and secondary causes, the former being less frequent. Primary AEFs occur in a native aorta and their causes include aneurysms, foreign bodies, tumours, radiotherapy and infection. The classic triad of aortoesophageal fistulas, a subtype of AEFs, are mid-thoracic pain and sentinel haemorrhage, followed by massive bleeding after a symptom-free interval. We present the case of a 41-year-old male patient who presented in the emergency room after successive episodes of abundant haematemesis. He was hypovolemic, hypothermic and acidotic at presentation. His medical history included an emergency room visit the week before with chest pain but no relevant anomalies on work-up, active intravenous drug use and chronic hepatitis. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed a bulging ulcerated lesion suspicious for aortoesophageal fistula, confirmed by computed tomography (CT) angiography, which revealed a saccular aortic aneurysm with a bleeding aortoesophageal fistula. The patient underwent urgent thoracic endovascular aortic repair. The sentinel chest pain, leucocytosis and CT findings hinted at the presence of a mycotic aneurysm, despite the negative blood cultures. It was most likely caused by a septic embolus due to the patient's risk factors. While a high level of suspicion for aortoesophageal fistula is needed to prompt a fast diagnosis, EGD and CT findings were crucial to establish it and allow a life-saving intervention. We conclude that chest pain cannot be disregarded in a patient aged 41 years with multiple comorbidities, despite normal work-up, to prevent a fatal outcome.LEARNING POINTS: Aortoesophageal fistula is a rare cause of severe upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage with a high mortality rate.Computed tomography angiography is diagnostic in most cases but a high level of suspicion is essential.Chest pain, a characteristic clinical symptom of aortoesophageal fistula, cannot be disregarded in a patient with multiple comorbidities, even in the presence of a normal electrocardiogram and chest x-ray.

AB  - We present the implementation of a global archive of Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (DInSAR) co-seismic defounation maps. The archive has been generated by automatically processing all the Copernicus Sentinel-1 data spanning about 300 significant (at least Mw > 5.5) earthquakes all over the Earth. An empirical relation between magnitude and epicenter depth was considered to limit the study to those earthquakes that can likely induce ground defounation. DInSAR processing has been carried out within a Cloud-Computing (CC) environment, specifically the Amazon Web Services, to benefit of high processing capacity. The generated DInSAR results are then made freely and openly available to the Solid Earth scientific community through the European Planet Observing System (EPOS) Research Infrastructure.

AB  - In summer 2019 the SARSense campaign was held in Rilich, Germany, to provide insights into the potentials and specifications of the ESA Copernicus candidate mission ROSE-L (Radar Observation System for Europe). ROSE-L will consist of two satellites that carry a polarimetric L-band SAR. Since the L-band signal can penetrate through many natural materials such as vegetation, dry snow and ice, the mission will provide additional information that cannot be gathered by the Copernicus Sentinel-1 C-band SAR mission. The overall objective of the SARSense 2019 campaign is to analyze the mission design concerning its potential for agricultural monitoring services including target applications such as soil moisture monitoring, irrigation management, crop type discrimination, food security and precision farming. The SARSense in situ measurements of soil moisture, soil temperature, vegetation properties, UAS-based multispectral and thermal mapping, as well as the airborne SAR observations are presented as well as strategies for soil moisture retrieval and first analysis.

TI  - THE CRAB AS COSMIC YUX: A SYMBOL OF POWER AND CREATION IN COTZUMALHUAPA
T2  - ANCIENT MESOAMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Crab iconography in Mesoamerica is a novelty, often ignored academically while its meaning remains a mystery. In Cotzumalhuapa, the crab appears as either a base or a headdress in monumental art, but why? Why is the crab singled out in the creation portion of thePopol Vuh, establishing an unexplained precedent? The following work attempts to answer these questions. The decapod itself was not arbitrarily chosen for its role aspaxil, or as a feminine symbol of creation, with links to the moon and rain. Rather, its biology and behavior mirrored the existing Mesoamerican worldview. Unfortunately, the linguistic and cultural affinities of Cotzumalhuapa are unknown. Thus, I analyze other objects from other regions/cultures and compares zoological, linguistical, and ethnohistorical data to conclude that the crab was conceptually feminine, a cognate to the moon goddess and the surface of the earth, representing creation. Furthermore, rulers of Cotzumalhuapa wore regalia that include crab imagery, which provided them the power of creation and propagated belief in the legitimacy of their rule.

TI  - Outcomes after Treatment of Metaplastic Versus Other Breast Cancer Subtypes
T2  - JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Metaplastic breast cancer (BC) is an uncommon yet aggressive histologic subtype of BC. We sought to identify factors associated with its diagnosis and compare the management and outcomes of metaplastic BC with those of other BCs and triple negative invasive ductal carcinoma in particular given how often it has a triple negative phenotype.Patients and Methods: We identified women diagnosed with invasive BC in 2010-2014 in the National Cancer Data Base, and used univariate analysis to compare baseline patient and tumor characteristics by BC subtype. Overall survival (OS) was estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method, and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify independent predictors of OS.Results: Of 247,355 cases, 2,084 (0.8%) were metaplastic BC, 55,998 (23%) triple negative BC, and 77% other BC. Relative to non-metaplastic BC, women with metaplastic BC were more likely to be older at diagnosis (median age, 62 vs. 59 years), have >= 1 comorbid conditions (22% vs. 18%), and be on Medicare (41% vs. 33%; P<0.001). Metaplastic BCs tended to be basal-like (77%), and relative to triple-negative or other BC, metaplastic BC was associated with higher clinical T status (cT3-4, 18% vs. 11%, 8%), no clinical nodal involvement (cNO, 86%, 77%, 80%), no lymphovascular invasion (72%, 65%, 62%), and high-grade tumors (71%, 77%, 35%) (P<0.001). Most metaplastic BCs were treated with mastectomy (58%), sentinel lymph node dissection (65%), chest wall or breast irradiation (74%), and chemotherapy (75%) as adjuvant therapy (60%). At a median follow-up time of 44.5 months, OS rates were lower for metaplastic BC than for triple-negative or other BC across all clinical stages at 5 years (stage I, 85%, 87%, 91%; II, 73%, 77%, 87%; III, 43%, 53%, 75%) and at 3 years (Stage IV, 15%, 22%, 64%; P<0.001). On multivariate analysis, increasing age, advanced clinical stage, lymphovascular invasion, axillary (vs. sentinel) node dissection, and no radiation or chemotherapy were associated with worse outcomes in metaplastic BC. Extent of surgery affected survival for triple-negative and other BC but not for metaplastic BC.Conclusion: Outcomes for metaplastic BC continue to be worse than those for other BC subtypes despite modern treatments. Optimizing systemic therapy options, which was a significant predictor of survival, should be a priority in managing metaplastic BC.

TI  - Particulate matter concentration in the air: statistical analysis of spatial relations between surface and MODIS data for two weather types in the Madrid region
T2  - INVESTIGACIONES GEOGRAFICAS-SPAIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensors are monitoring planetary atmospheric pollution and producing considerable information on aerosols - similarly to the MODIS sensor and its Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) indicator. Comparison with common ground measures shows discordances between both data sources. Assuming a hypothetical positive relation between them, this work makes a systematic analysis of data representing two weather types prone to high particulate matter concentration in the Madrid region, explores the strength of AOD-PM10 correlation, and the influence of meteorological variables (temperature, wind, and relative humidity), weather types, and the geographical context. In line with other authors' findings, the results of this investigation generally support the positive relation, although inconsistencies appear, and in many cases the statistical relation frequently decreases, and may become null because of various potential reasons - including abundant missing data.

AB  - High spatial resolution vegetation products are fundamental in different fields, such as improving the understanding of crop seasonality at regional scales. Here, two new vegetation products such as the Leaf Area Index (LAI) and the Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) are downscaled at continental scales. A novel HIghly Scalable Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (HIS-TARFM) is used to generate the gap-free time series of Landsat surface reflectance data by fusing MODIS and Landsat reflectance for the contiguous United States. An artificial neural network is trained to capture the relationship between the gap free Landsat surface reflectance and the MODIS LAI/FAPAR products and allows to predict both biophysical variables at 30 meters spatial resolution. The results confirm that both vegetation products largely agree with the test dataset, providing low error and high explained variance.

TI  - Cowden Syndrome Diagnosed by Bilateral Breast Cancer with Lhermitte-Duclos Disease: A Case Report
T2  - CASE REPORTS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cowden syndrome is extremely rare and is characterized by multiple hamartomas in various tissues, including the skin, mucous membranes, gastrointestinal tract, breast, thyroid, and brain, and has an increased risk of breast, thyroid, and uterine cancers. Here, we report a case of Cowden syndrome diagnosed following presentation with bilateral breast cancer and provide a discussion of the relevant literature. A 47-year-old woman with a tumor in her right breast was referred to our hospital. She was diagnosed with bilateral breast cancer upon imaging and underwent a bilateral mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy. Previously, she had undergone total thyroidectomy to treat a thyroid tumor. Approximately 3 years later, she was diagnosed with Lhermitte-Duclos disease affecting her left cerebellar hemisphere. As her sister and mother had also been diagnosed with breast cancer, we suspected that she might have an inherited disease. Since 80% of individuals with Cowden syndrome have a mutation in the phosphatase and tension homolog (PTEN) gene, we did not perform any genetic testing. Instead, we used the syndrome's pathognomonic criteria and major criteria (breast cancer, thyroid tumor, and Lhermitte-Duclos disease) to diagnose our patient with Cowden syndrome. While treatment of Cowden syndrome is currently limited to strategies that can manage the symptoms, patients are at an increased risk of certain cancers and require regular screening to allow for early detection of disease.

TI  - Investigating polygonal fault topological variability: Structural causes vs image resolution
T2  - JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The topology of three polygonal fault sets is investigated to determine potential causes of variations in connectivity (as measured by nodes and branches) between, and vertically within the fault sets. Two faults sets (from the Great South Basin (GSB), New Zealand, and Southeast Asia (SEA)) are imaged by 3D seismic reflection data, a third data set (Al Farafra Oasis, Egypt) is imaged from satellite data. The values measuring connectivity for the GSB and SEA polygonal fault sets plot in ternary diagrams in similar areas to other complex normal fault sets from rifts. These data sets are dominated by faults with either isolated fault tips (I nodes) or with abutting or splaying geometries (Y nodes). The similarities in node and branch topology of polygonal faults, and complex fault patterns in rifts (associated with multi-phase rifting, complex local stress rotations, or inherited fabrics), which are imaged on 3D seismic, indicates that topology describes the complexity of fault connectivity, but in general, by itself, cannot discriminate the causes of normal fault pattern variations. The Al Farafra Oasis faults sets (areas 2 and 3) provide an end member example of fault patterns with a very high degree of connectivity associated with cross-cutting fault sets (X-nodes) that are more rarely present in other fault sets. Some faults forming X-nodes may be hybrid tensile-shear failure fractures, or even calcite vein-filled tensile fractures. Much of the difference between the seismic and satellite image data sets may be related resolution, indicating that comparisons of topology characteristics are best made between data sets of similar resolution.

AB  - Change detection represents a major family of remote sensing image analysis techniques and plays a fundamental role in a variety of applications to environmental monitoring and disaster risk management. However, most change detection methods operate under the assumption that the multitemporal input data have been collected with the same (or very similar) acquisition modality - a possibly critical restriction in several applications. In this paper, the problem and the opportunities of change detection from multitemporal data acquired through heterogeneous modalities are addressed. Methodologically, this is a highly challenging data fusion problem, especially within an unsupervised framework. Here, these challenges and the methodological approaches proposed in the literature, which range from earlier semi-parametric regression to current deep learning architectures, are reviewed. Then, recent fully unsupervised techniques, based on spectral clustering, traditional image regression, and deep image-to-image translation, are briefly described.

TI  - Population estimate and identification of major conservation threats for the river dolphin (<i>Inia geoffrensis humboldtiana</i>) at the Colombian Orinoquia
T2  - Therya
M3  - Article
AB  - South American sub-continent, housed the largest diversity of river dolphins on the planet, here there are two species in the genus Sotalia and three species in the genus Ink,. Tonina, present on the Orinoco basin, are exposed to many different anthropogenic threats, such as: the fragmentation and loss of aquatic ecosystems; acoustic contamination; risk of collision with boats; entanglement; deaths by retaliation, resulting from biological and operational interactions with artisanal and industrial fisheries; biomagnification of heavy metals such as mercury in the aquatic trophic web; capture of individuals for their usage as bait for the fishery of Calophysus macropterus, primarily on borderline localities between Colombia and Venezuela; and finally, the negative effects of climate change. We conducted a study to determine population sizes and anthropogenic threats affecting river dolphins populations during the beginning of high-water season, between November 2018 and February of 2019, along 1,402 km. We calculated the degradation index for streams of continental waters and density of the river dolphins. Water quality, habitat transformation, species exploitation, and the increment in number of human settlements were identified as the main conservation stressor in the analyzed area. We obtained density values by habitat type for different aquatic environments and population sizes for river dolphins and the value in the index of degradation, with a potential increment in value through time. River confluences were identified as priority areas for the conservation of the species. Water quality, habitat modification, and species exploitation were particularly intense. Our results highlight a potential transformation of the ideal conditions that allow for the establishment of the species, explaining its distribution with predicted values between 46.6 % and 70.1 % for the evaluated timeframe due to the effects of climate change on aquatic ecosystems. The Meta River, has the highest value for the index of freshwater ecosystems degradation followed by the Orinoco basin, water quality and species exploitation appear to be the major stressors for dolphins in these areas. Finally, river confluences were identified as conservation hot spots for dolphin populations. We point out on the importance of river dolphins as bioindicator, sentinel species, and one of the most susceptible to the negative effects of climate change.

TI  - Mapping the moral assumptions of multi-faith religious education
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF RELIGIOUS EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - When Religious Education (RE) in England and Wales transitioned from Christian confessionalism to a multi-faith approach in the latter half of the twentieth century, the subject's moral aims were reasserted. In this article, we explore the moral assumptions of this transformation and map some of their connections to other theological and ethical ideas. Inspired by Deleuze and Guattari's metaphor of a rhizome, we make two novel contributions to scholarship in this regard. First, through some salient examples we show the connections between the moral aims of multi-faith RE and the assumptions of Kantian moral religion. The second contribution, building on this analysis, identifies three moral justifications of multi-faith RE: universalist (founded on assumptions of moral universals across religions), vicarious (the support of a religious worldview by using other religions' moral teachings) and instrumentalist (a moral justification based on the supposed extrinsic benefits of studying religions). We then go onto consider how these assumptions may differ from the moral commitments of the religions they appropriate, suggesting they disrupt and recombine theocentric concepts into pedagogic ones.

AB  - For semi-arid ecosystems, the remote sensing based crop type classification is often hampered by heterogeneous agricultural landscapes with mixed crops and small scale land use. Under these complicated conditions, the use of high spatio-temporal satellite time series data can improve classification results. in this context, Sentinel-2 for Agriculture (Sen2Agri) provides an open source processing system to exploit Sentinel-2 imagery in an operational way for crop monitoring. This research was conducted to explore and evaluate the potentiality of Sen2Agri system for crop type mapping in a highly fragmented and heterogeneous agricultural landscape in Haouz plain, Morocco. Based on the phenological information from field campaign, Sentinel-2 time series data for 2018 agricultural season, were processed to classify the main crop types dominated in the study area. After classification, accuracy assessment was undertaken based on generated crop map and resulted in Overall Accuracy (OA) of 85.6 and Kappa coefficients of 0.81.

TI  - Mangrove Typology: A Proposal for Mapping based on High Spatial Resolution Orbital Remote Sensing
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Solutions to improve environmental management strategies increasingly require the adoption of new techniques, such as Geotechnologies. All this effort must be carried out in a multidisciplinary way, using different concepts, techniques and scientific visions about the same phenomenon. In response to the cartographic demands, one of the primordial steps for a good mapping starts before the processing of the images to be used. This step is based on the definition of a legend related to the scale and purpose of the mapping. This work aims to contribute in the definition of a typology adapted to the use of high spatial resolution remote sensing data for the mapping of mangrove phytophysiognomies in the Brazilian Equatorial Coast. The final mapping covered more than 27,000 ha of forests divided into the following classes: (i) Forest dominated by Avicennia schaueriana; (ii) Forest dominated by Rhizophora spp.; (iii) Mixed Forests; all indicating differences in structural development (high, medium or low). Through this reflexive process, this work contributes to the mapping with effectively transdisciplinary strategies.

T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The limited number of in situ stations of surface soil moisture (SM) in Africa creates a shortage in the validation of SM satellite products. Therefore, this study investigates the performance of Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), and the H113 product from the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) on the regional scale over Africa through these goals: (1) validate of satellite SM products against in situ stations and SM data from the ERA-Interim atmospheric reanalysis product, (2) study the spatiotemporal variability of satellite SM products on the regional scale, and (3) evaluate the regional scale error patterns and investigate regions where the assimilation of satellites SM data may add improvement to ERA-Interim. Standard statistical metrics, hovmoller diagrams, and the Triple Collocation (TC) model were used to achieve these goals. Land cover data, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, and precipitation data were used to interpret results. The validation results based on statistical metrics and TC indicate that over the desert and shrub, passive products showed better performance than ASCAT, while over moderate vegetation areas (grassland), SMAP had the best among SM products. Over high densely vegetated regions, ASCAT showed a high comparatively performance than passive products. The potential regions for assimilation of satellite data sets were selected to be over savannas and grassland regions for ASCAT, and over shrub and grassland regions for SMAP. In particular, SMAP and ASCAT SM data sets are considered more stable than SMOS for data assimilation and capturing the spatial distribution of SM on the regional scale over Africa.

TI  - Antarctic Supraglacial Lake Detection Using Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 Imagery: Towards Continental Generation of Lake Volumes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Melt and supraglacial lakes are precursors to ice shelf collapse and subsequent accelerated ice sheet mass loss. We used data from the Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 satellites to develop a threshold-based method for detection of lakes found on the Antarctic ice shelves, calculate their depths and thus their volumes. To achieve this, we focus on four key areas: the Amery, Roi Baudouin, Nivlisen, and Riiser-Larsen ice shelves, which are all characterized by extensive surface meltwater features. To validate our products, we compare our results against those obtained by an independent method based on a supervised classification scheme (e.g., Random Forest algorithm). Additional verification is provided by manual inspection of results for nearly 1000 Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 images. Our dual-sensor approach will enable constructing high-resolution time series of lake volumes. Therefore, to ensure interoperability between the two datasets, we evaluate depths from contemporaneous Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 image pairs. Our assessments point to a high degree of correspondence, producing an average R-2 value of 0.85, no bias, and an average RMSE of 0.2 m. We demonstrate our method's ability to characterize lake evolution by presenting first evidence of drainage events outside of the Antarctic Peninsula on the Amery Ice shelf. The methods presented here pave the way to upscaling throughout the Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 observational record across Antarctica to produce a first-ever continental dataset of supraglacial lake volumes. Such a dataset will improve our understanding of the influence of surface hydrology on ice shelf stability, and thus, future projections of Antarctica's contribution to sea level rise.

AB  - Monitoring urban expansion is important because the policy makers in cities must detect the changes to provide services and manage resources for urban dwellers. In this study we analyse the built-up areas extracted from very high-resolution images of two important databases of CORINE land cover and GHSL; Built-Up Grid to map urban expansion at local level of cities of Tallinn and Tartu in their context (County) in Estonia. The reason for selecting these datasets was the representation of an available temporal data in many timespans which allowed extracting urban expansion in our case studies. The analysis was carried out over a subset of these datasets in ArcGIS environment and the data of GHSL- Built-Up Grid was extracted from Google Earth Engine platform. Therefore, the results showed that there was an increase in the amounts of built-up areas and its rate in these two counties while based on these two databases the results were not similar in areas and cells but similar in rate and growth patterns.

M3  - Article
AB  - The goal of the paper is to trace motifs and themes found in Pavel Vilikovsky ' s debut book titled Citova vychova v marci (Sentimental Education in March, 1965) that relate to the category of sensibility. The introduction outlines literary historical conceptualizations of the self and sensibility: sentimentalism, Rousseauesque self, sentimental attitude to the world in the sense as formulated by F. Schiller, sentimental natural line (V. Svaton). They represent the starting point of the interpretative part where they, as historically unlimited tendencies of literary production, are updated and modified under the influence of modernist poetics and worldview in the context of the 1960s. The subject of the interpretation is thus a reflective process of self-realization. It takes place on the level of body as a sensitive matter, by returning to the elementary, along with searching for authenticity of experience, which is gradually verified through the concept of Romantic illusion: the theme of human self- deception based on the predefined patterns contributes to disillusioned reassessment of sentimental education. The reflection of this shift is linked to modernist elimination of fake sentiment in sensibility (e.g. influence of the Hemingway style in the short story titled Tvoj prvy ston/Your First Moan). The given framework helps show the value hierarchy of emotions and the problem of the ethical conflict between freedom and responsibility for the others.

AB  - In this paper we tackle the problem of data analysis over the higher dimensional space provided by hyperspectral images. Remote sensing data analysis is a complex task due to numerous factors such as the large spectral and spatial diversity. The latter is the key focus of attention in this paper.As a matter of fact, mixed pixels are often sources of uncertainty which affects the accuracy of several approaches whose target is to solve the sub-pixel problem. Although spectral un-mixing techniques can provide abundance fractions within mixed pixels to each class, their associated spatial distribution remains unknown. The set of techniques aimed to solve the above mentioned problem is commonly known as sub-pixel mapping (SPM); existing algorithms based on the spatial dependence assumption cannot solve these problems efficiently and cannot provide a unique configuration for the same problem. In the context of variational framework to solve inverse problems, various strategies were proposed to avoid their intrinsic ill-posedness in the form of regularization. Differently from previous approaches of literature, which apply spatial regularization individually for each class, the proposed method takes also into account spatial links among classes. In order to improve sub-pixel mapping accuracy and, consequently, enhance hyperspectral image classification, we propose a method based on a pre-constructed spectral dictionary and isotropic total variation minimization of classes within and between pixels (SMSD-ITV). Experimental results with real and simulated data sets show the attributes of using spectral dictionary with total variation as a prior model, which lead to improve sub-pixel mapping of different classes tacking into account spatial correlation between them.

TI  - Impact of Land Use/Cover Change on Ecosystem Service Values in the Kilombero Valley Floodplain, Southeastern Tanzania
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use/cover change (LUCC) attributed to natural factors and human activities has led to the loss of ecosystem services, making the quantitative valuation of ecosystem services the scientific focal pointfor sustainable development. This study assessed changes in the ecosystem services values (ESVs) due to LUCC during the period 1990-2016 in the Kilombero Valley floodplain, located in southeastern Tanzania. Moderate resolution Landsat images from 1990, 2010 and 2016 were obtained and analyzed using a random forest (RF) algorithm for classification, and ArcGIS Desktop software (version 10.2, Esri, Redlands, CA, USA) for mapping to assess the LUCC. The ESVs were estimated based on the benefit transfer approach using adopted global value coefficients and modified local value coefficients. The results revealed that the aggregated ESVs of the forests, bushlands, wetlands, and water had decreased, consequently leading to a total loss of US$ 811.5 million (26.6%) in ESVs over the past 26 years when calculated with the modified local value coefficients to US$ 3000.7 million (42.3%) when calculated with global value coefficients. Moreover, the loss in the ESV was attributed to the decreased values of water regulation, climate regulation, erosion control, nutrient cyclying, habitat/refugia, and water supply, with the exception of the values of food production and biological control, which gradually increased during the study period. This study provided minimum estimates of the ecosystem service values, which willcontribute to the formulation of policy actions and strategies for sustainable management of the Kilombero Valley floodplain and inform various stakeholders on the tradeoffs involved in the use of land resources.

AB  - Climate and land use change have become serious challenges facing protected areas globally, more so those in the tropical forest ecosystems. Kilimanjaro-Mountain National Park was specifically designated to protect and safeguard the highest free-standing mountain in the tropics. The park attracts thousands of national and international tourists annually because of its snow capped-summit and the altitudinal gradients, representing the different eco-climatic zones of the world. Earnings from tourism boost the country's economy while ensuring the sustainability of this unique glacial-tropical mountainous forest ecosystem park. Conventional monitoring of key biodiversity and environmental parameters are carried out by park staff, following established guidelines by Tanzania National Parks. However, given the park's geo-morphological nature of mountainous terrain, efficient implementations of the labor intensive in-situ observations are hardly feasible. This research explored the use of Remote Sensing data from the European Satellite Agency-Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument, in developing a state-of-the-art monitoring protocol. The developed methodology ensures that essential biodiversity parameters, including Vegetation Indices, required in monitoring the vast areas of the park and its surroundings in the short-term and long-term, using up to date, high resolutions and frequently available Remote Sensing data from the Sentinel-2 Sensors are captured.

CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - An accurate on-orbit characterization of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors onboard the Terra and Aqua satellites is essential to satisfy the requirements from the scientific community for high-quality operational and research products. In this study, NASA's C6.1 L1B data are utilized to assess the stability of the calibrated top of atmosphere reflectance retrieved from individual detectors within a spectral band over deep convective clouds (DCCs) and desert sites. The results from these invariant Earth targets show detector-to-detector (D2D) differences in the L1B reflectance products for select MODIS reflective solar bands. For Aqua MODIS, the D2D differences have no significant change over time for the bands studied. However, the D2D differences exhibit an increase in magnitude over time for Terra MODIS bands 1, 3-7, and 26, which can induce noticeable striping and higher uncertainties in the downstream data products. The D2D stability assessment results over DCCs are consistent with those observed over desert sites. In addition, the view-angle dependence of the D2D differences is investigated by separating the frames along scan into five zones. The D2D assessment is performed for each of the five zones, and the results will further benefit any improvements in the calibration of a detector-dependent response versus scan angle that can be considered for future MODIS Level 1B Collections.

AB  - There has been a need for African countries to report on United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to keep up with other developed nations. However, there has been a lack of data especially geospatial that can be used by National Statistics Offices (NSOs) to report on SDGs.The Africa Regional Data Cube (ARDC) is part of the Open Data Cube (ODC) and represents an example of multistakeholder collaboration and responding to country-level demand. The ARDC was created by the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites in partnership with GPSDD, Office of the Deputy President representing Kenya, Group on Earth Observation (GEO), Strathmore University, and Amazon Web Services.The ARDC offers free and open satellite data to address the SDGs. The ARDC allows users to select and analyze time series Earth Observation datasets to study land change and report on SDGs. In this paper, ARDC countries namely Ghana, Kenya, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Tanzania showcase some of their work in reporting on SDGs 2.4.1, 6.6.1, 11.3.1, 14.5, 15.1.1 and 15.3. Further, the countries have been able to institutionalize ARDC into various technical committees that have helped develop thematic use cases, which contribute and inform country specific policy. The preliminary results are useful for NSOs on reporting on SDGs and contributing to national development agenda including the Africa Union Agenda 2063. Overall, the ADRC provides opportunities for countries in Africa to report on SDGS.

TI  - Modeling the Temporal Population Distribution of <i>Ae</i>. <i>aegypti</i> Mosquito Using Big Earth Observation Data
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Over 50% of the world population is at risk of mosquito-borne diseases. Female Ae. aegypti mosquito species transmit Zika, Dengue, and Chikungunya. The spread of these diseases correlate positively with the vector population, and this population depends on biotic and abiotic environmental factors including temperature, vegetation condition, humidity and precipitation. To combat virus outbreaks, information about vector population is required. To this aim, Earth observation (EO) data provide fast, efficient and economically viable means to estimate environmental features of interest. In this work, we present a temporal distribution model for adult female Ae. aegypti mosquitoes based on the joint use of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, the Normalized Difference Water Index, the Land Surface Temperature (both at day and night time), along with the precipitation information, extracted from EO data. The model was applied separately to data obtained during three different vector control and field data collection condition regimes, and used to explain the differences in environmental variable contributions across these regimes. To this aim, a random forest (RF) regression technique and its nonlinear features importance ranking based on mean decrease impurity (MDI) were implemented. To prove the robustness of the proposed model, other machine learning techniques, including support vector regression, decision trees and k-nearest neighbor regression, as well as artificial neural networks, and statistical models such as the linear regression model and generalized linear model were also considered. Our results show that machine learning techniques perform better than linear statistical models for the task at hand, and RF performs best. By ranking the importance of all features based on MDI in RF and selecting the subset comprising the most informative ones, a more parsimonious but equally effective and explainable model can be obtained. Moreover, the results can be empirically interpreted for use in vector control activities.

TI  - The influence of landscape structure on the diversity of avifauna species in tropical urban areas of Northeastern Zimbabwe
T2  - Biodiversity (Ottawa)
M3  - Article
AB  - Variations in avifauna species diversity are subject to environmental factors as well as interactions with other species. We evaluated how landscape structure can influence the composition and distribution of avifauna species groups in a tropical urban landscape from the understudied region of the Harare metropolitan area in Northeastern Zimbabwe. We sampled avifauna species groups and computed patch metrics (size, shape and isolation distance) using remotely sensed data from 35 census plots representing five land use/land cover classes. Using multivariate analysis techniques, we found three habitat patch characteristics distinguishing avifauna species diversity and distribution, namely patch shape complexity (R-2 = 0.47-0.64), patch size (R-2 = 0.55-0.62) and isolation distance (R-2 = 0.73-0.78). In this study, we discuss the implications of these findings with a view to better understanding the effects of urban landscape structure on avifauna species diversity in this understudied region. In particular, contextual landscape features such as native savanna vegetation accompanied by dispersed urban development patterns could mitigate the negative impacts of urbanization on biodiversity. This study may be useful in helping to understand landscape structure-biodiversity linkages in ecosystems outside tropical savannas, as well as in other urban areas of sub-Saharan Africa.

T2  - 3RD INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM MARINE AND FISHERIES (ISMF) 2020
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 3rd International Symposium on Marine and Fisheries (ISMF)
CL  - South Sulawesi, INDONESIA
AB  - Base-on time efficiency, cost, and wide coverage area, bathymetry mapping with a hydroacoustic measurement on a small island were avoided; only remote sensing surveys were conducted. Therefore, comparing the bathymetry map of Bonetambung Island, from Hydroacoustic data with that from Landsat 8 OLI images, is essential. Hydroacoustic measurements were carried out in September 2013, while Landsat 8 Satellite Imagery was recorded on April 25, 2018. After being corrected, Kriging (K) and Natural Neighbor (NN) interpolations methods were performed on both data. The 95% ANOVA test, conducted in a previous study, showed that the average depth for the two interpolation results did not differ significantly for the depth range of 0-5m. However, for the 0-30m depth range, this study shows that the accuracy of interpolation hydroacoustic data is much better with the range of RMSE = 0.8-1.2m, ME = 0.4-0.7m, and range of RMSE = 0.8-1.3, ME = 0.4-0.7 for each K and NN interpolation methods. On the other hand, only in the depth range of 0-5m, the accuracy of interpolation Landsat 8 OLI data shows a relatively good value with RMSE = 1.1m, ME = 0.8m, and RMSE = 1.1m and ME = 0.8m for the K and NN Methods respectively. The results of hydroacoustic data interpolation and Landsat 8 OLI were then visually compared with Dishidros Nautical chart number 124. It was concluded that although Landsat data can produce bathymetry maps with a wider coverage area, its accuracy is still unreliable compared to bathymetry maps from Hydroacoustic measurements.

TI  - Assessing land cover change in Namibia's Kavango East region: a multi-date object approach
T2  - BOIS ET FORETS DES TROPIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover change is a global issue but its effects can be particularly severe in developing countries such as Namibia, by affecting the ecological functions of ecosystems and hence sustainable development. Namibia's arid conditions, due to low rainfall and high evapotranspiration rates, coupled with annual savannah fires, have resulted in a heterogenous landscape composed of a mixture of trees, shrubs and herbaceous plants. As a result, land cover maps are often inaccurate at the pixel level. Despite their relatively high accuracy, object-based image analyses are yet to be exhaustively applied to the dry tropical forests of Southern Africa. The purpose of this study was to apply a multi-date object-based approach to land cover change, in order to determine its extent and dynamics in the heterogenous landscape of Kavango East, one of the regions with the highest forest cover in Namibia. Multi-date segmentation, mean band values and image differentiation were used to detect land cover changes in four periods (1990, 2000, 2009 and 2016). The most common land conversion for all the periods was from forest to cropland. In 1990, forests covered 58% of the land but by 2016, this had dropped to 55%. Meanwhile, cropland covered 3% of the study area in 1990 and had doubled to 6% by 2016. The novel approach used in this study has produced promising results compared to traditional methods, which are prone to errors in detecting post-classification changes. The method can therefore be recommended for long term monitoring of land cover and land use change in areas with similar environmental and biophysical conditions.

T2  - REVISTA GENERO & DIREITO
M3  - Article
AB  - Various relations between the forms of social consciousness such as art and religion are formed in the process of the historical development of the spiritual culture of mankind. In this historical phenomenon, certain religions "choose" this or that system of arts, which in the most optimal way is capable of reproducing the spiritual atmosphere and religious practice of this religion. Fine arts as the emotional-figurative affirmation of religious ideas occupies a certain place in the system of religious values. In a bright and clear form, this process is manifested in the functioning of the developed world religions, whose structure is the most stable and defined, although historically it has, of course, evolved. The present article discusses the mythological and religious themes in the works by artists of Tatarstan of the years 1990s-2000s, which reflect, above all, the two main religions represented in Tatarstan - Islam and Christianity, and often regardless of the ethnic affiliation of certain artists. And the religious tolerance inherent in the Republic of Tatarstan, the dialogue of two cultures, are reflected in this interaction, the mutual influence of various religious denominations on the worldview, on the spiritual world of people, on the creativity of artists.

AB  - Coal seam fire has various environmental, social, and economical adversities. In the past, coal seam fire regions are detected by studying the land surface temperature properties of satellite images. Yet, these techniques do not consider the spectral properties of the fire locations. Thus, various other high temperature regions are falsely detected as coal seam fire regions. The objective of this paper is to detect coal seam fire regions by analyzing the land surface temperature and eliminating the falsely detected high temperature regions. We propose a novel technique for detecting coal seam fire regions by using clay mineral ratio, which can differentiate other high temperature regions from coal seam fire regions.

TI  - THE TRANSFORMATION OF ECOSYSTEMS OF THE ILI RIVER DELTA (KAZAKHSTAN) UNDER THE FLOW REGULATION AND CLIMATE CHANGE
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the results of a study on the main reasons for the transformation of wetland ecosystems in the Delta of the Ili River in the period of 1979-2014. The study results are shown based on the analysis of multi-temporal satellite data Landsat, dynamics of hydrological regime of the river Ili, climate conditions and features of economic activities of the local community, as well as fieldwork in the study region. Analysis of area changes of main types of hydromorphic and semi-hydromorphic ecosystems of Delta river Ili in high and medium on water discharge in the following (1979, 1993, 2000, 2010, and 2015) years. Increasing water consumption in China and in Kazakhstan part of the Ili-Balkhash basin due to the development of the agrarian and municipal sectors of economy especially in China, significantly exceed increasing flow of Ili River, caused by regional warming in the catchment part of Ili River Basin. The global warming has intensified the degradation of glaciers in mountain catchment areas of Ili River, this in the near future threatens with a decline in river flow and as a consequence lead to the deterioration of delta ecosystems and the desiccation of lake Balkhash similarly to the ecological disaster of the Aral Sea. Analysis of long-term (from 1970 to 2013) climatic data from three meteorological stations demonstrated a trend of the regional increase of average annual air temperature by 1.4 degrees C and decreasing of average annual precipitation by 10 mm. These factors also contribute to the transformation process of hydromorphic ecosystems.

T2  - Trudy VNIRO
M3  - Article
AB  - Aiming to develop the biological resources of the Okhotsk Sea shelf zone, a remote study of regional features of the ice processes dynamics in fishing areas is important. One of the main fishing areas of the Okhotsk Sea is the West Kamchatka subzone the northeastern sector of the water area to the east of 153 degrees 30' E, bounded from the south by latitude 54 degrees N. Dynamics of seasonal changes in ice cover is inherent in every region of the sea, regardless of the total area of ice. Geophysical processes affect the ice cover through a complicated mediated correlation that includes changes of the atmospheric circulation parameters. Critical, anomalous states of the ice cover in the West Kamchatka fishing subzone and also the cause-effect relations of its formation are revealed during the pollock seasons in 2006-2017. The mechanism of influence of thermobaric conditions, confirming the influence of the Okhotsk tropospheric cyclone (OTC) and the Pacific tropospheric crest on the formation of abnormal ice conditions in the Okhotsk Sea both in general and in certain local areas is presented.

T2  - COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Primary data collection that is generalizable and applicable on a large scale would benefit gentrification research, as more stakeholders' perspectives could be gathered. Thus, an instrument measuring gentrification worldview was constructed and tested for inter-item relationships, through survey pretesting, exploratory factor analysis, and confirmatory factor analysis. The Gentrification Worldview Instrument (GWI) is a set of evaluative beliefs representing one's worldview of gentrification. Items measure beliefs about neighborhood change and the roles of individual residents and local government in preserving or changing city neighborhoods. The instrument demonstrated partial measurement invariance across two racial groups. The resulting models indicate the GWI is composed of three domains, neighborhood preservation, development, and social integration. The instrument provides researchers, policy makers, and communities with a tool to measure people's perceptions of gentrification, which can then be used to predict attitudes and behaviors.

AB  - A polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (Po1SAR) image is able to capture target backscattering properties in different polarimetric states, making it a rich source of information for target characterization. However, as with any SAR image, Po1SAR images are affected by speckle. Therefore, to extract useful information about targets, the polarimetric covariance matrix has to be first estimated by reducing speckle. In this paper, we use a deep neural network to estimate the dual Po1SAR covariance matrix. This application was compared against the state of the art Po1SAR despeckling methods. Even if the method is agnostic on the structure of the covariance matrix, the deep learning based Po1SAR covariance matrix estimation performed better than the state of the art Po1SAR despeckling methods. These results showcase the potential of supervised deep learning for the improvement of Po1SAR despeckling pipelines.

AB  - The study was conducted on a test plot located in the Yasnogorodsky district of the Tula Region; With a camera with fisheye lens photographs were taken at different points of the plot, each point with a geographical reference. Subsequently, the possible relationship between the information extracted from the classification of the photographs using the CAN-EYE software (LAI, percentage of vegetation) and the vegetation indices (Ratio, NDVI, SAVI and EVI) calculated with spectral values obtained from the different channels of Sentinel-2 (B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, B8, B8a) were evaluated. Finally, best regression models obtained for each phase of the winter wheat development were used to create the maps of LAI and percentage of vegetation. According to our results, Sentinel-2 can be successfully used to map LAI in the studied region at the shooting stage of winter wheat development with accuracy of 85 %. At other stages and for percentage of vegetation the accuracy of the models was below 50 %.

AB  - In Oh, Gyu-won's poetry, language is recognized as an important medium for the subject to recognize the world and reveal it. In the poems on materialism criticism, 'world' is used in almost the same meaning as the reality in which the subject lives. In contrast, ‘world’ in later poems is the perception horizon where the subject lives with the object. As the viewpoint of the world changes, the language corresponding to it changes. If the language used as a tool of materialism criticism is a metaphorical language that replaces a particular object, the language corresponding to the open world is a metonymous language that can express the adjacency of the world. This study examined the process of Oh, Gyu-won's poetic theory from the perspective of cognitive poetics to the transition from metaphorical thinking to metonymic thinking, and examined the change of perspective on 'figure' intensively.The modern poetry creation method is a creative theory based on the experience of creative instruction. In this book, figure is explained as a rhetorical technique that constitutes poem. Oh, Gyu-won divides figures into ‘figures of thought’ and ‘ figures of speech’. The criteria for division is whether the figure results in semantic changes in the original words. And this semantic effect is to correspond to the phase of human life beyond poetic effect. This idea is similar to the cognitive poetic view that the metaphor in literature is based on the metaphor in human life.Oh, Gyu-won puts on footnotes such as Rene Wellek, M.H.Abrms, and Philip Wheelwright, but in the process of actual analysis, he explains the process of mapping of the metaphor rather than specifying the kind of metaphor. The success or failure of the metaphor is evaluated by focusing on whether the idea is properly established between the source domain and the target domain, which is consistent with the cognitive poetic view that the metaphor is an activity of consciousness.The concept of ‘metonomy’, which focuses on his later poems and poetics, also shows the process of change. If the distinction between metonymy and metaphor he spoke is a poetic technique, similarity/adjacency is an explanation of the association between words, and this corresponds to the relationship between metaphor/metonymy in cognitive poetics. In The modern poetry creation method, there are different concepts of metonymy.The confusion of this concept is clearly summarized in the later poetry. Oh, Gyu-won makes it clear that his research is distinguished from new criticism analysis by criticizing the theories of Rene Wellek and Austin Warren, who were the grounds for explaining figure in The modern poetry creation method. Since then, metonymy has become a key theme of later poetics as a way of constructing speech based on similarity and adjacency and a world view.Oh, Gyu-won overcomes the limitations of new criticism in the actual analysis process, and the process is quite similar to the cognitive poetic view of metaphor as human conscious activity rather than technique. In later poetics, metonymy is a linguistic system that reveals it as well as a worldview. The cognitive poetic perspective of identifying the object as adjacent can be a way to explain the process of change in Oh, Gyu-won’s poetic theory.

M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Site-specific seeding (SSS) is a precision agricultural (PA) practice aiming at optimizing seeding rate and depth, depending on the within field variability in soil fertility and yield potential. Unlike other site-specific applications, SSS was not adopted sufficiently by farmers due to some technological and practical challenges that need to be overcome. Success of site-specific application strongly depends on the accuracy of measurement of key parameters in the system, modeling and delineation of management zone maps, accurate recommendations and finally the right choice of variable rate (VR) technologies and their integrations. The current study reviews available principles and technologies for both map-based and senor-based SSS. It covers the background of crop and soil quality indicators (SQI), various soil and crop sensor technologies and recommendation approaches of map-based and sensor-based SSS applications. It also discusses the potential of socio-economic benefits of SSS against uniform seeding. The current review proposes prospective future technology synthesis for implementation of SSS in practice. A multi-sensor data fusion system, integrating proper sensor combinations, is suggested as an essential approach for putting SSS into practice.

AB  - In this study, the susceptibility to landslides at Sevilla township, Valle del Cauca, located at southwest of Colombia was evaluated. The conditioning factors that involve the generation of landslides were evaluated using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing (RS) techniques. For the estimating susceptibility, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was implemented by applying the "Backpropagation" method to extract the synoptic weights of the conditioning variables (slopes, flow length, curvature, geology, fracture density, and land cover) on an automatic way with a data training module. The data for the analysis of the conditioning factors were carried out through a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) obtained through Radar Interferometry techniques, with Sentinel-1B satellite images for the year 2018. The results showed that Sevilla's township has areas with high susceptibility, high slopes, and that it's crossed by an active geological fault which implies that the earth's dynamics will condition the terrain stability.

AB  - Numerous natural lentic systems of the world are under the threat of drying due to either natural or anthropogenic activities. Natural circumstances are basically due to climate change effects remarkably sensed within the past decades. However, human-induced activities in some cases dominate over natural events due to demand of water particularly for irrigation and domestic needs. This study investigates the changes that have occurred on the water surfaces of 3 significant water bodies located in the Konya Closed Basin of Turkey. Geographically inner Anatolia region of Turkey receives half of the annual average precipitation of the overall country; on the contrary, the region is known to be an important agricultural area. The majority of fertile arable land is spared to wet agriculture necessitating vast amounts of water. As expected, all the 3 water bodies have incredibly lost their water within years. In the multi-temporal analysis of the study area, Landsat 5 TM, 7 ETM+ and 8 OLI satellite images belonging to every 10-years interval between 1987 and 2017, and corresponding meteorological data were used. Water losses in the 3 ecosystems, one is a salt production lake, Tuz (Salt) Lake, the other is a Ramsar Site (MekeMaar), and the last one is an internationally recognized wetland (Akgol), are detected. Resultantly, it is observed that only Tuz Lake has been artificially fed in the last decade as its economic value is higher than the other two systems. Meke Maar and Akgol Wetland have high ecological value; however, their original functions vanished as they have almost lost their water. It is important to state that humans' need of water is essential; but, unconscious utilization and wrong irrigation applications lead to water scarcity. On the other hand, climate change accelerates the reduction of water resources. Satellite data coupled with ground truth measurements are accepted as modern technological tools to detect short and long term temporal changes in the water surfaces of such vulnerablewater systems especially for attracting the attention of decision-makers responsible of sustainable management of water resources.

AB  - The article analyzes the features of Chechen communicative behavior in the context of the emotional component. It is noted that self-control dominates in the traditional communicative behavior of Chechens. Free expression of emotions in Chechen society is perceived as inappropriate, and suppression of emotions is characteristic of both men and women and belongs to one of the advantages of the Chechen mentality. It is concluded that the key idea of the communicative picture of the world of the Chechens is manifested in the model "yakh hilar - yukh lar yar" (honor to have - to keep a face), which determines their worldview and morality. The end-to-end line, expressing the emotional component of the communicative behavior of the Chechens - "sobar" (restraint, self-control)), considered in the following directions: everyday life - family, society - social etiquette, rituals - ritual etiquette).

TI  - Some Aspects of Islam and Relics of Pre-Islamic Worldview Traditions Among the Kazakhs (Based on the Field Ethnographic Data)
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the study is the modem processes in the ethno-confessional and ethno-cultural life of the population of villages and cities of different administrative status in the new socioeconomic conditions in Kazakhstan. The study uses methods of field ethnographic research, participant observation, ethnographic survey, interviewing, comparative analysis, discourse analysis, and a prognostic method. Religious institutions and religious schools have been examined. The results of the study show that in the present period, compared to previous years, there is no construction boom in the sphere of religious institutions (mosques, madrasas) in the studied regions. In Kazakhstan, construction of new mosques continues at the expense of foundations, patrons of art, local entrepreneurs, donations of parishioners. New trends in the religious sphere have been revealed: new mosques are built in the traditions of Islamic religious architecture, which absorbed elements of ethnic culture. Modem mosques have halls (canteens) for ritual meals: the Karaganda mosque, for example, has two halls; the Mashhur Zhusip mosque in Pavlodar has three halls. The new Almaty mosque Baiken has an underground parking for 2,500 lots, which on days of religious holidays serves as an additional prayer hall. The author comes to the conclusion that, in recent years, there has been a tendency of active interaction of mosques with the local ethnic environment. Everywhere, mosques hold events for the implementation of the Religion and Tradition programme initiated by the Spiritual Board of Muslims of Kazakhstan. The programme is designed to promote the traditions of Islam of the Hanafi madhhab in Kazakhstan, which for centuries has interacted with the local ethnic culture of the Kazakhs. Forms of interaction between the state and religion in the educational sphere have been identified. At present, a number of Kazakhstan madrasas are equated to state colleges and are under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Kazakhstan. One of the new trends is the presence of modem Islamic ministers of not only religious education, but also of secular one. Currently, the Spiritual Board of the Muslims of Kazakhstan has developed a programme to counter religious radicalism. It includes the legal prohibition of radical movements; educational work in educational institutions, the promotion of the history of Islam and Islamic culture in Central Asia.

Vegetation height product derived from ICESat-2 was interpolated into a 2-D surface using ordinary kriging. Interpolated forest height was validated with in situ data which resulted in determination coefficient of 0.6221 and RMSE of 3.17 m. Interpolated forest surface height and terrain corrected backscatter from L-band ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 data was used to develop linear regression models for above ground biomass estimation. A combination of HV backscatter and ICESat-2 interpolated height-based regression model performed better with a relative RMSE of 30.67%.

AB  - The most fundamental task in remote sensing data processing and analysis is object detection. It plays an important role in classification and very useful for various applications such as forestry, urban planning, agriculture, land use and land cover mapping, etc. However, it has many challenges to find an appropriate method due to many variations in the appearance of the object in image. The object may have occlusion, illumination, viewpoint variation, shadow, etc. Many object detection method has been researched and developed. Recently, the development of various machine learning-based methods for object detection has been increasing. Among of them are methods based on artificial neural network, deep learning and its derivatives. In this research, object detection method of aerial image by using mask-region convolutional neural network (mask-R CNN) is developed. The result shows that this method gives a significant accuracy by increasing the image training and epoch time.

AB  - The growing need to include foliar biochemical measurements in global change models has triggered the landscape level application of broadband satellites in nitrogen (N) estimation. In addition, the determination of seasonal variations in the accuracy of estimating N from remote sensing platforms is critical for understanding the reliability of N data used as an input into these models. However, seasonal differences in the accuracies of landscape level remote sensing models in dry deciduous landscapes such as the savanna woodlands remain poorly understood. Our study was carried out in the dry miombo woodland, one of the most expansive deciduous woodland in Southern Africa. A bootstrapped random forest model in the R environment was used to estimate foliar N from sentinel-2 broadband satellite platform. The relationship between foliar N and spectral reflectance was determined at two key phenological stages; the start and end of the growing season. Our results showed that the start of the growing season model (RMSE = 0.42) estimated N concentration better than the end of the growing season model (RMSE = 0.49). The difference between the two statistics are significantly (p < 0.05) different. In addition, maps of the standard deviation of predictions also indicate that the start of growing season model is more consistent (lower standard deviation overall) in its predictions, when compared with the end of the growing season model. We conclude that compared to the end of the growing period, the start of the growing season is a better phenological stage for remotely estimating N in miombo woodlands. This finding is significant in providing higher accuracy maps of N concentration for input into global change models.

AB  - Deep learning (DL) has shown promising results, especially in the area of computer vision, making it suitable for remote-sensing image analysis tasks such as land cover classification. However, the increased accuracy comes at a cost of increased training data requirements. This paper showcases our approach to address this shortcoming by using machine learning to bootstrap the process. To achieve this aim, supervised classification has been carried out on Landsat 8 imagery using Support Vector Machines (SVM). Out of the five classes segmented using traditional supervised classification (SVM), urban class is taken into consideration for training the DL model. The dataset is manually cleaned before feeding it into the DL model for training. The model achieves an accuracy of 0.92 at identifying settlements after 1,100 training iterations. This approach saved time required to prepare training data for the DL model, while producing highly accurate results. Such a process can reap the benefits of DL for geospatial mapping, while reducing the requirement to start with copious amounts of labelled training data.

AB  - Water is a limited natural resource; therefore, continuous monitoring is required to develop methods and policies to support its sustainability. An approach like satellite radar altimetry is a powerful technique for monitoring water level variations. It was designed and developed for smooth surfaces such as the open ocean, but to some extent, it is now used to study the inland waters as well. The satellite radar altimetry coupled with passive remote sensing enabled the monitoring of continental surface water, such as inland seas, lakes, rivers, and reservoirs, by providing information about its water level, river discharge, lake extent, and its volume. This study estimated the monthly water balance of an ungauged lake, located in Pakistan, using satellite radar altimetry and passive remote sensing. The Manchar Lake is significant for its ecological, social, and economic value but is not monitored regularly and hence cannot be managed well. Due to the unavailability of gauge data, it is challenging to calculate Lake's water balance directly. The water levels from sentinel 3A combined with Landsat 8 derived lake surface areas were used to estimate changes in the lake's volume, which were used in the water balance equation. The primary inflows to the Lake are from Main Nara Valley Drain (MNVD), Indus River, and runoff from hills. Whereas, the outflows are evaporation, groundwater recharge, and domestic and agricultural water use. This study provides Manchar Lake's monthly water balance from July 2016 to July 2019. An inconsistent and random water balance values are observed during the study period, with outflows exceeding inflows 40% of the time. The Lake's ecosystem depends on the availability of sufficient water, and the negative water balance may cause a threatening situation. The approach and results may provide valuable information for water resource management of the Manchar Lake using satellite data, which has still existential issues of ground observations.

AB  - Detection of changes occurring on the Earth surface is one of the most important tasks of remote monitoring. It is noted that the traditional methods of detecting changes (basic components, subtraction, division, etc.) are not sufficiently effective when they are applied to the problems of remote sensing of the Earth. This is due to the fact that the images obtained by different systems under different conditions of illumination of the Earth surface have significant differences in their characteristics. To reduce the impact of qualitative differences on the result of processing, it is proposed to use a preliminary classification of objects in the images. The proposed algorithm was tested on the detection of deforestation according to the spacecraft data SPOT and Landsat. Recommendations on the choice of parameters of the classification algorithm (frequency channels of images, quantitative and qualitative composition of classes, decision rules, etc.) are formulated.

AB  - This study aimed to examine the trend of changes in Korean Taekwondo history through its formation process, discuss the meaning of “tradition”, which functioned as the core concept in the Taekwondo history study, and expand the epistemological extension. The following results were obtained from this study. First, the value of traditionalism shall be respected in terms of responding to social and cultural demands to promote national pride and playing an important role for establishing the theoretical foundation of Taekwondo history in the initial stage while forming Taekwondo history. It will be possible to understand the paradigm of understanding history at that time through this. Second, the emergence of revisionism was not just a simple differentiation in Taekwondo history, but an opportunity for introspecting about the existing theoretical system. Taekwondo history was enriched and stabilized by viewing Taekwondo from a new perspective owing to the emergence of a different worldview, armed with objectivity and rationality, different from traditionalism. Third, a long history, not disconnected from the origin, is not the only required condition of “tradition”. If it is understood that “succession” and “disconnection” are the processes of establishing tradition, it shall be acknowledged that Taekwondo is already a tradition, which has been recreated with Korean traits and characteristics.

TI  - Regional-Scale Forest Mapping over Fragmented Landscapes Using Global Forest Products and Landsat Time Series Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite imagery of 25-30 m spatial resolution has been recognized as an effective tool for monitoring the spatial and temporal dynamics of forest cover at different scales. However, the precise mapping of forest cover over fragmented landscapes is complicated and requires special consideration. We have evaluated the performance of four global forest products of 25-30 m spatial resolution within three flatland subregions of Ukraine that have different forest cover patterns. We have explored the relationship between tree cover extracted from the global forest change (GFC) and relative stocking density of forest stands and justified the use of a 40% tree cover threshold for mapping forest in flatland Ukraine. In contrast, the canopy cover threshold for the analogous product Landsat tree cover continuous fields (LTCCF) is found to be 25%. Analysis of the global forest products, including discrete forest masks Global PALSAR-2/PALSAR Forest/Non-Forest Map (JAXA FNF) and GlobeLand30, has revealed a major misclassification of forested areas under severe fragmentation patterns of landscapes. The study also examined the effectiveness of forest mapping over fragmented landscapes using dense time series of Landsat images. We collected 1548 scenes of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) for the period 2014-2016 and composited them into cloudless mosaics for the following four seasons: yearly, summer, autumn, and April-October. The classification of images was performed in Google Earth Engine (GEE) Application Programming Interface (API) using random forest (RF) classifier. As a result, 30 m spatial resolution forest mask for flatland of Ukraine was created. The user's and producer's accuracy were estimated to be 0.910 +/- 0.015 and 0.880 +/- 0.018, respectively. The total forest area for the flatland Ukraine is 9440.5 +/- 239.4 thousand hectares, which is 3% higher than official data. In general, we conclude that the Landsat-derived forest mask performs well over fragmented landscapes if forest cover of the territory is higher than 10-15%.

AB  - Philosophical prose and poetry today attract both general cultural and literary interest. Nevertheless, the genesis of philosophical prose remains one of the least developed problems of literary criticism. The purpose of this article is to identify the different branches of artistic and philosophical thinking in the philosophical prose of the late XX - early XXI centuries. To solve it, the article analyzes the works of modern Chuvash writers of different generations: the older (G. Fedorov), middle (B. Chindykov) and younger (N. Ilyina). Research methods are historical and genetic and comparative analysis. Artistic and philosophical prose, being a synthetic form of culture in which the elements of philosophy and art are combined, helps to reveal the decisive, basic issues of human life, seeks to create a holistic view of the world and spirituality. Works of philosophical prose are often built on the primacy of a moral and philosophical thesis, clear to the author, and the narrative is subject to the logic of its disclosure. Proceeding from this, the main character is assigned the role of the bearer of the idea of spiritual rebirth and the spokesman of certain moral, ethical and national principles. Moreover, deepening the character of the hero and expanding the possibilities of knowing a person occurs through the study of the depths of national outlook and life. The moral comprehension of being becomes the value center of philosophical prose and determines its genre-style structure. Philosophical prose recreates the process of thinking in the moral integrity of the thinking person, which cannot be reduced to any purely logical conclusions and results of this thought process. The modern world is under the sign of crisis, not only social and economic, but also a cultural, moreover, a spiritual crisis. In this regard, literature that studies the general through the individual does not bring to the fore the problems and interests of the whole collective, as it was very recently, but the thoughts of an individual person. In such literature, a person already appears as a "small universe, microcosm," in which the basic truth of man's knowledge and the basic truth assumed by the very possibility of cognition were originally laid down. Modern Chuvash philosophical prose through a deepening in the thickness of the national character and life broadens the horizons of knowledge of the human essence and the meaning of his life. The prism through which the writer looks at the world is not a fact, not a phenomenon, but the dynamics of social consciousness, recreated in its individual contradictory forms. The narrative in such prose is not a direct embodiment of the author's artistic thoughts, because such self-expression would be similar to an abstract contemplation of abstract thinking. Philosophical prose is a phenomenon of art, and therefore combines knowledge and action. The author of philosophical prose does not so much form his thoughts about the world as he reveals the general state of reality, exploring the dynamics of social consciousness.

TI  - ASSESSMENT OF POSSIBILITY FOR USING REMOTE SENSING DATA AND MARKOV CHAINS FOR PREDICTION OF VEGETATION COVER DEVELOPMENT
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF BELARUS-AGRARIAN SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - In conditions of global climate change, it is important to develop reliable models allowing to reliably predict plant development based on combination of the Earth remote sensing data and statistical modeling. Modeling by means of Markov chains is an efficient and at the same time simple way to predict random events, which include prediction of performance of phytomass of agricultural crops. The Earth remote sensing data obtained from the Sentinel-2 satellite with spatial resolution of 10 m were used to calculate the value of vegetation index NDVI and obtain different time rasters (2017-2019) with different degrees of vegetation cover development. To construct the matrix of probability of transition from one state to another for different levels of vegetation cover development, functionality of geoinformation systems (GIS) were used allowing to classify raster images, transform them into vector layers, and establish intersection areas. The probability matrix was later used to predict vegetation cover development using the Markov model as a predictor. The developed prediction model was tested for feasibility of the chi(2) test. The results obtained showed that both the modeled values and the actual area of vegetation distribution with different degrees of development, determined from the available raster image of 2019, correlated well with each other. The research results can be useful both in developing forecasting methods and in directly predicting the crop yield of primarily dense-cover agricultural crops, as well as for estimating performance of pastures and creating efficient pasture rotations.

AB  - Jeju Province has unique geographical and climatologic characteristics compared with other areas in Korea. Thus it needs to evaluate the status of nationwide notifiable infectious diseases (NND) continuously. The aim was to conduct a descriptive study for NNDs in Jeju Province, 2001-2019. The source of data was on the Infectious Disease Statistics System operated by Centers for Diseases Control & Prevention in Korea between 1 September 2001 and 31 August 2019. When calculating the proportion of the sum of years showing a higher incidence in Jeju province than nationwide divided by the sum of comparing years, the NDD with the proportion of the sum of years over 75% in 2001-2019 included chickenpox and syphilis. The results support significant evidence to plan strategies and distribute community resources for the control and prevention of NND in Jeju Province, Korea

AB  - Since 2011, Syria has suffered from one of the longest armed conflicts in the world which have presented significant consequences including the changes within the spatial patterns of the environment including the land cover. This research used the remote sensing data and geospatial techniques to study the land cover changes in Al-Salamiyah District using Landsat images at the end of the dry season in three selective years:1989, 2004 and 2019. The results show that the actually cultivated lands were decreasing from 115 thousand hectares in 1989 to 97 thousand hectares in 2019 and the rate of change is higher in the period (2004-2019) which includes 9 years of the Syrian conflict comparing with the first one. The results shed the light on the current situation of the land cover and raising questions on the environment-related challenges resulted from the Syrian conflict and the urgent need to maintain and preserve the productive agricultural lands in this region.

AB  - This paper provides watershed-specific information dimensions computed through construction of binomial multiplicative process based multifractal spectra. Information dimension of watersheds provides clues on the distribution of terrestrial elevations spread across all the spatial positions within the watershed. This information dimension could be related to the responses of watersheds to the perturbation caused due to cascade of endogenic and exogenic forces. Higher the information dimension, lesser is the response to the cascade of endogenic and exogenic forces. Based on the information dimension computed through multifractal spectra for thirty one watersheds partitioned from the Cartosat DEM of the Lower Indus subbasin, we inferred that the watersheds are within the range of highly heterogeneous to highly homogeneous categories. It would be interesting to adopt this approach to study watersheds belonging to physiographically distinct regions.

There are many factors to cause commission errors in SAR image and ground moisture is one of them. To reduce such commission errors, seasonal change analysis is effective. In this study, a time-series analysis method using Savitzky-Golay (SG) filtering was developed. The method of speckle noise filtering by frost and 2-step thresholding and time-series analysis using SG was good method. The accuracy of forest change detection was improved from 19 % of the threshold method to 80%.

AB  - Shipping traffic has grown steadily in the Arctic in recent years. One of the reasons for this increased traffic is the lengthening of open water season, which is accompanied by increases in the area covered by intermediate ice concentrations, or marginal ice zones (MIZs). These regions are difficult to detect using passive microwave data. In this paper, we propose the use of deep learning for automatic detection of MIZs in the RADARSAT-2 satellite images. A synthetic aperture radar (SAR) dataset is manually annotated to train, test and refine the method. Various convolutional neural network (CNN) models are evaluated as fixed feature extractors for the task of classification. To aid the classification accuracy we use a weighted binary cross-entropy loss criterion. Finally, to refine the segmentation process, we used a multi-scale patch technique. The analysis of the results demonstrates that CNN model predictions obtained with multiple sizes of spatial windows is able to detect MIZs in SAR images.

M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, the verbalization of one of the key concepts in the English sphere of concepts, HOUSE, in P. Lively's novel The House in Norham Gardens is analysed. The research is based on a three-layer model of a concept developed by V. I. Karasik, as well as the method of linguo-conceptual analysis which involves the following steps: 1) definition and etymological analysis of the lexeme house; 2) analysis of the lexical and phraseological units representing the concept in the language, 3) contextual analysis of the corpus of contexts in which the lexeme house is used. The traditional, "cultural", verbalization of the HOUSE is compared with the author's individual one, which is derived through a similar analysis of the author's contexts. In the novel, a certain extension in the meaning of the core components is traced - the concept HOUSE acquires the basic features of the concept HOME. The method of linguo-conceptual analysis allows us to reveal the variety of images connected with the idea of the house. The metaphorical models "the house is a museum", "the house is life", "the house is a dinosaur/monster" employed by the author add to the conceptualization of the house as a major value of English culture. This concept is based on the archaic understanding of the house as "one's own", internal, mastered space, which confronts the strange, external space of chaos. The analysis allows us to assume that the procedure of the linguo-conceptual analysis of the individual author's concepts opens up prospects for further study of the individual author's concepts in modern English literature, followed by a comparative study in the intercultural dimension.

AB  - Creating autonomous robots to assist humans in their daily activities has been one of the important innovations of robotic research. In this paper, a 2-dimensional movement platform of the haptic feedback interface for human machine systems is developed including DC motors and ball screws as the core components. The platform is inclusive in the complete haptic feedback teleoperation systems, which display remote sensing data to the operators in the forms of force and vibration. The remote objects/environment can be actual devices/machines or just computer simulations, such as virtual reality. The proposed platform helps to mimic various interactions between the concerned remote object and corresponding environment. Lagrange method is applied to model the mechanical-electrical system. The developed model is simulated and compared with the hardware platform. The time domain responses obtained from both mathematical models and platform validate the established prototype.

T2  - OPEN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial distribution of urban vegetation cover is strongly related to climatological conditions, which play a vital role in urban cooling via shading and reducing ground surface temperature andeffective strategy in mitigation urban heat island. Based on the Landsat satellite images, the quantitative normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was spatially mapped at two times for each year during 2008, 2013, 2019 in Baghdad. The NDVI values ranged from -1 to +1 with considering values larger than 0.2 indicate the dense healthy vegetation. In this study, the fractional areas of NDVI >0.2 were computed with their percentage. The responses of the NDVI during the growing seasons to two climate indices (i.e., air temperature and precipitation) were investigated. These climatic data obtained from the Iraqi Meteorological Organization and Seismology for the aforementioned years were used to explore the potential correlations between seasonal NDVI and above climate variables. The result shows that NDVI-derived vegetation growth patterns were highly correlated with their recording during the current growth seasons.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Image and Signal Processing for Remote Sensing XXVI
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Global mapping of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) is a challenging task and crucial for forest management and planning. Lidar data provides 3D information of forest stands and has been consistently identified as the state-of-the-art technology for monitoring forests. However, lidar data are expensive and their acquisition is spatially restricted to some forest areas. A reasonable solution for overcoming these restrictions is the use of spaceborne data. In recent years, the number of multispectral sensor based satellites have consistently increased, including open data sources like Sentinel-2 and small satellite sources like RapidEye and Dove constellations. In this work, we compared and evaluated different multispectral satellite data like Sentinel-2, RapidEye and Dove on the basis of different available spectral, spatial and temporal information for modelling AGB. We also used airborne lidar data as the state-of-the-art to compare results from multispectral data models. The experiments were performed under a common framework of variable elimination based on autocorrelation analysis and variable selection using stepAIC (Akaike Information Criterion) algorithm. A multiple linear regression with leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) was used to perform p-value quartiling for spectral information analysis, generate LOOCV metrics for temporal information analysis and modelling at spectral parity for spatial information analysis. Results demonstrate a clear and extensive influence of spectral information from specific channels like red-edge and SWIR for modelling AGB. Also, the addition of temporal information increases the precision and agreement of multispectral AGB models. Differently, the spatial information may not be relevant unless datasets are at spectral parity.

M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are one of the major natural hazards that account for loss of hundreds of lives besides causing enormous damage to properties and blocking the communication links every year in the NorthWestern Himalaya. The present study, discuss about the major landslides that occurred in the Dharasu-Uttarkashi National Highway NH-108/34 sector of NW Himalaya, and to suggest the required mitigation measures. The area chosen for the study is located along toe side of the Bhagirathi river valley in Uttarkashi district of Uttarakhand, suffering from landslides every year. One of the massive landslides in the study area was Varunavat Parvat landslide in Uttarkashi city, and other villages affected by landslide were Maneri, Mala and Bhatwari. The populations living in these townships and villages continue to suffer badly from the onslaught of landslides. Therefore, landslide susceptibility mapping is one of the important approaches for the sustainable development of these villages. Landslide susceptibility analysis (LSA) was made using various parameters such as DEM, slope, stream, roads and Landsat image. The validation results show satisfactory agreement between the susceptibility map and the existing data on landslide locations. Consequently, the landslide susceptibility map was prepared for the study area.

AB  - The Middle East-North Africa (MENA) region has a prevailing hot and dry climate. The increasing demographic pressure brings an increased demand on water resources. In this study, we analyzed the drought dynamics using precipitation and soil moisture remote sensing data over the MENA region in the last two decades. Two types of remotely sensed micro-wave datasets (i.e. TRMM 3B43 and ESA-CCI SM) were used, to depict meteorological and agricultural droughts. Our results showed that the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) [1] from TRMM showed a good correlation with SPI from in-situ rainfall data and predicted successfully historical droughts. The standardized index shows lesser extreme agricultural droughts than meteorological drought for the same period. The region faced the biggest number of extreme meteorological droughts in 2015 and the biggest number of extreme agricultural droughts in 2013. These outputs help local and regional water management authorities as well as policy makers in combating water scarcity in the region. Further studies will look into optical remote sensing.

AB  - 「Hanhwondanghwabyeongbal」 of Nammyung Cho Sik(1501- 1572), is known as literary works created at the last.A study on Nammyung is now fairly accumulated, so in this context, a study on literature also achieves many things. However, it is rare that existing research analyze with focus on formal beauty of the work itself or the beauty of literature. There are many research that take advantage of literature for disproving author’s consciousness of the times or values.This article explores Nammyung’s spirits on 「Hanhwondanghwa byeongbal」, at the same time, pays attention how the work is described. Furthermore, analyzes the structure of the work focusing on author’s theme, and inspects relevance of revealing author’s theme.Nammyung tries to appreciate Hanhwondang’s spirits, and he wants to clarify it through 「Hanhwondanghwabyeongbal」. Also he tries to reveal own worldwiew pursuing non-artificial life. Author’s value is displayed in a regular pattern across the full work. Moreover, Nammyung continually reveals topic to readers by exposing proper contents for appreciating Hanhwondang’s spirits and descriptions.「Hanhwondanghwabyeongbal」 is the works structured author’s worldview controling any artificial one of selfishness. In these days, we can have enough sympathy because of structural devices in works designed carefully. In other words, the literary style inherent in this work contributes to reveal the beauty of literature and multiplies subject of work as well as characteristic in itself. This kind of device is factor that readers regard as more attractive than simply describing the subject.This article researchs on subject and the beauty of form centered the 「Hanhwondanghwabyeongbal」 itself. Korean Classics in Chinese research have to pay attention to the nature of literature centered on the work itself. It will be true literary research that clarify literature of individual works and the aesthetic aspect of the author by dissecting closely.

AB  - Pepper (Piper nigrum L.) is one of the potential agricultural commodities in Indonesia. In the past, Indonesia was the leading producer and exporter of black and white pepper in the world. However, in recent years, Indonesia has lost its leading position to Vietnam due to instability of price, climate change and pepper farmer's lack of knowledge on Good Agricultural Practices (GAP), resulting in low productivity, plant diseases, and difficulties with water supply. In order to tackle those problems, eight public and private organizations (Verstegen, ICCO, N&S, AKVO, VanderSat, IPB, Balittro and PT. CAN) formed a multinational partnership project named SpiceUp funded by NSO. SpiceUp aims to implement a financially sustainable information service based on geodata and precision agriculture that supports 100,000 Indonesia pepper farmers to increase their production, income, food security and reduce the inputs of water, fertilizer, and pesticides. As an initial phase, baseline surveys were conducted in four targeted areas to collect data about household characteristics, inputs and income of farmers and better understand farming practices. The baseline findings show that there is an urgent need for farmers to get access to: 1. Fertilizer advice; 2. Pest and disease advice; 3. Good Agricultural Practice; 4. Water management advice; 5. Sustainability tracing system. In conclusion, increasing farmers' knowledge of pepper culture that corresponds with GAP and inviting farmers to be able to start using information technology and satellite data in their cultivation systems will be solutions in facing current challenges because the services offered depend on the real problems.

AB  - Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results on time series classification (TSC) tasks. In this work, we focus on leveraging DNNs in the often-encountered practical scenario where access to labeled training data is difficult, and where DNNswould be prone to overfitting. We leverage recent advancements in gradient-based meta-learning, and propose an approach to train a residual neural network with convolutional layers as a meta-learning agent for few-shot TSC. The network is trained on a diverse set of few-shot tasks sampled from various domains (e.g. healthcare, activity recognition, etc.) such that it can solve a target task from another domain using only a small number of training samples from the target task. Most existing meta-learning approaches are limited in practice as they assume a fixed number of target classes across tasks. We overcome this limitation in order to train a common agent across domains with each domain having different number of target classes, we utilize a triplet-loss based learning procedure that does not require any constraints to be enforced on the number of classes for the few-shot TSC tasks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to use meta-learning based pre-training for TSC. Our approach sets a new benchmark for few-shot TSC, outperforming several strong baselines on few-shot tasks sampled from 41 datasets in UCR TSC Archive. We observe that pre-training under the meta-learning paradigm allows the network to quickly adapt to new unseen tasks with small number of labeled instances.

AB  - This research aims to extract water bodies from several types of satellite images by using machine learning. There are several methods to apply the extraction of information about water bodies such as unsupervised classification, supervised classification. This project applied the supervised classification method to extract water bodies and building geodatabase for the water bodies in Salah Adin, Iraq by applying remote sensing and GIS technique. The satellite images which have been used in this research include satellite images from RapideEye satellite with spatial resolution (5x5) m at 2011, where these images used to extract canals of water, also used images from Sentinel-2 satellite with spatial resolution (10 x 10) m at 2017 to extract lakes, and broad rivers. In addition, DEM raster (90) m at 2011 from ASTER satellite was used to extract the water streams, which are expected to be channels of water discharge in flood situations. During implementation of the methodology of the research the most important issue which appear is using multi data to extract all types of water bodies in study area also to avoid the pixel mixed problem, this case was evident when using RapidEye satellite images in the confluence of the river in the surrounding wetlands, which led to inaccurate results in the geometric dimensions of the river, although the high spatial resolution but the influenced element on the accuracy of results is radiometric resolution. The result shows the random forest of machine learning algorithm is overcome on the other algorithms such as decision tree machine learning, maximum likelihood and support vector machine. The high accuracy of image classification to extract the water bodies depend on integrating the three satellite images.

TI  - Playing with accents: On Ugandan Englishes and indexical signs of urbanity and rurality
T2  - SOCIOLINGUISTIC STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - While certain ways of speaking or varieties of English - such as American English or British English - evoke associations of modernity, higher education and urbanity in Uganda, others - such as Ugandan English with strong northern or western accents - stand for backwardness, social strata remote from education and 'village identities'. Yet concepts of backwardness or modernity are not only based on linguistic criteria but also associated with a specific worldview, contributing to complex signs of higher-order indexicality. In contrast, speakers' practices of enregisterment reveal how fluid and contextual these indices of urbanity and rurality actually are. Considering diverse repertoires of English accents and varieties used in Uganda, I suggest a turn toward a more fluid understanding of contextual practices of English as negotiations of urbanity and rurality, or as 'indexical play', instead of hypothesising fixed entities such as 'Ugandan English', 'urban language', or 'rural language'.

AB  - This study was conducted to observe the dynamic of shoreline changes in Sangsit Region, Bali Province using multi-temporal remote sensing datasets. The remote sensing data were acquired from several Landsat images in the period of 2000-2019 (20 years) with 30-meter spatial resolution. Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) method was used to analyse data images to determine the shoreline changes. Prior to the analysis, the images were corrected by ground check data. It revealed that the shoreline changes has occur in Sangsit Region for period of 20 years (2000-2019). The results obtained indicate that there is a change in shoreline with mild accretion to less extreme abrasion categories which occurred in the Sangsit Region in that period. From 2000-2005 it shows an accretion of 221.03 m which is categorized as mild accretion and from 2005-2019 the shoreline changes that occur is only an abrasion its categorized as mild to less extreme abrasion. The highest abrasion occurred in the period of 2010-2015 which the abrasion is around 49.65 m.

TI  - Alternatives of Languages and Worlds: Multilingualism as Critique of Ideology in Contrafactual Fiction by Quentin Tarantino and Christian Kracht.
T2  - INTERLITTERARIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Multilingualism and the alternate history genre have something in common: both phenomena are based on the construction of alternatives, in the case of multilingualism on the alternatives between different languages and communication systems, and in the case of the alternate history genre on the alternatives between real-world facts and the variation thereof within fictional worlds. This article investigates the interconnections between these two forms of thinking in alternatives by looking specifically at Quentin Tarantino's counterfactual war film Inglourious Basterds (2009) and Christian Kracht's alternate history novel Ich werde hier sein im Sonnenschein und im Schatten (2008). I argue that the consideration of language alternatives forms part of the meta-reflection of the alternate history genre in these works while at the same time opening up a political perspective: in Tarantino's film and Kracht's novel, multilingualism serves as a means for the critique of ideology by rendering palpable the political threats of a worldview based on clear-cut alternatives. In the article's final section, I plead for the establishment of stronger links between the research on literary multilingualism and the theory of fiction.

TI  - Modelling malaria reduction in a highly endemic country: Evidence from household survey, climate, and program data in Zambia
T2  - JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH IN AFRICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Substantial efforts have seen the reduction in malaria prevalence from 33% in 2006 to 19.4% in 2015 in Zambia. Many studies have used effect measures, such as odds ratios, of malaria interventions without combining this information w levels of the interventions to assess how malaria prevalence would change if these interventions were scaled up. We contribute to filling this gap by combining intervention coverage information with marginal predictiorns to the extent to which key interventions can bring down malaria in Zambia. We used logistic regression models and derived marginal effects using repeated cross-sectional survey data from the Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS) datasets for Zambia collected in 2010, 2012 and 2015. Average monthly temperature and rainfall data were obtained from climate explorer a satellite-generated database. We then con ducted a counterfactual analysis using the estimated marginal effects and various hypothetical levels of intervention coverage to assess how different levels of coverage would affect malaria prevalence. Increasing IRS and ITNs from the 2015 levels of coverage of 28.9% and 58.9% respectively to at least 80% and rising standard housing to 20% from the 13.4% in 2015 may bring malaria prevalence down to below 15%. If the percentage of modern houses were increased further to 90%, malaria prevalence might decrease to 10%. Other than ITN and IRS, streamlining and increasing of the percentage of standard houses in malaria fight would augment and bring malaria down to the levels needed for focal malaria elimination. The effects of ITNs, IRS and Standard housing were pronounced in high than low epidemiological areas.

M3  - Article
AB  - River network formation in the northeast part of the East European Plain was discussed. The relevance of the study is due to a lack of knowledge about the functioning and development of the Upper Kama River basin in the Pleistocene. Most of the available data quite schematically describe the scope and stages of the change in the direction of development of channel processes in space and time.The decoding of satellite images from the Landsat-8 OLI, SPOT-5 satellite for the period of 2014-2018 and the ESRI ArcGIS World Imagery open mapping service data were used as the main method for studying the structural features of the river network, meso- and microrelief, vegetation distribution, as well as the nature and degree of moisture of the Upper Kama River basin. For geomorphometric analysis, digital elevation models from freely available (ArcticDEM, Alos DEM, TanDEM-X) and created on the basis of vectorization of maps of scales 1: 100 000 and 1:25 000 were used.As a result, events of different scales were highlighted . inter-basin - the union or rupture of the basin of the western pra-Kama River with adjacent river systems (Vychegda, Vyatka); regional - breakthroughs of lake waters through the Kirsa-Veslyana and Urolka-Vishera watersheds, which formed a single Kama River valley from the source to the mouth of the Vishera River. The formation of the South Keltma River (the left tributary of the Kama River) can also be attributed to the regional level of events. This river, by its location, inherits the lower course of the pra-Kosa River, which still flowed north in the middle Pleistocene and belonged to the pra-Vychegda River basin. The local events include the formation of macrobends in the valleys of the tributaries of the pra-Kama River and the formation of the Late Pleistocene incisions of channel systems on the low terrace of the Kama River. The composition of the sediments (according to drilling data) and the geomorphological data clearly indicate the Late Pleistocene age of watercourses that developed here earlier. In the modern landscape, their channels are represented by an erosive microrelief preserved among the bog geosy stems.

AB  - We present results of observations of vortex structures in the Caspian Sea based on satellite images of the visible range obtained by Sentinel-2 (MSI), Landsat-5 (TM), Landsat-7 (ETM+) and Landsat - 8 (OLI). The initial goal of this work was to identify vortex structures and their main localization areas in the Caspian Sea. In this paper we used Ocean Color Data for two periods: 1999-2006 and 2007-2013, plus 2 recent years (2019 and 2020). Results of these periods were comparing between each other. About 50% of the scenes from the obtained data are covered by clouds due to difficult weather conditions over the Caspian Sea - a frequent changes of air masses in all seasons of the year. Among cloudless scenes, on average, vortex structures occur on 20-30% of scenes. According to the results of the analysis of the data obtained, a predominance of submesoscale cyclones and anticyclones is noted. It was noted that vortex structures were mainly found in the shelf zone of the Caspian Sea. More intense vortex formation is observed in the South Caspian. The main reasons for their formation: the flow of river runoff, complex bottom and coastal topography, the vorticity of the wind field, shear instability at the periphery of the main circulation elements. The mapping of the main circulation elements in Caspian Sea was carried out. For each part of the Caspian Sea, the six main areas of vortex formation were identified.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a methodology for upscaling fractional vegetation cover (FVC) estimates derived from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to a larger area using freely available Sentinel-1/2 and Landsat-8 satellite data in the semi-arid Nama-Karoo biome of South Africa. To the best of our knowledge, such an approach is still lacking yet critical for understanding human-environment interactions, degradation, and the impacts of climate change in this vulnerable dryland ecosystem. The proposed approach utilizes ultra-high spatial resolution UAV imagery (i.e. < 5 cm) to develop a high quality FVC product. The resulting product is then used to upscale and validate satellite-based estimates of FVC. The rationale for upscaling UAV estimates to the satellite-scale is not only to cover larger areas but also to exploit historical satellite time-series data, in an attempt to understand past trends and vegetation dynamics in the Nama Karoo-Grassland ecotone. The proposed method is expected to produce the first-ever high-resolution continuous maps of FVC and its changes in the above-mentioned ecosystem. Such information is of vital importance as it could help decision makers to gain a better understanding of the extent at which mechanisms such as bush encroachment, grassland expansion, or degradation are occurring in dryland ecosystems.

AB  - Forests ecosystems are extremely vulnerable to the changes of climatic parameters such as quantity and seasonal distribution of precipitations, temperature variation, heat transfer, soil moisture content and others. The consequences of forest vegetation alterations include growth and productivity failures, insect outbreaks, biodiversity changes, and increase in the incidence of forest fires and floods. Remote sensing has been identified as an effective tool for better understanding how forest ecosystems respond to dynamics of climatic parameters and their impact to forest vegetation state in terms of the occurrence of hazard events. In the present study spectral indices like Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Improved Modified Chlorophyll Adsorption Ratio Index (MCARI(2)), Moisture Stress Index (MSI), Normalized differential greenness indices (NDGI), and Normalized Differential Wetness Index (NDWNI), derived trough remote sensing methods have been applied for monitoring of the forest state before and after fire event occurred on 29 July 2016. Using a model based on the three major Tasseled Cap components, a Disturbance Index (DI) for the affected forest ecosystem was quantified. The study area is situated in southeastern Bulgaria - a region, highly vulnerable to forest disturbances due to climate changes. The results obtained after the application of the suggested indices show that changes observed in the forest ecosystem state could be assessed with a high accuracy. These results were confirmed with statistical analyses with high correlation coefficients for greenness component and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI).

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine aspects of the imagined geography, shown in the North Korean film titled The Fate of Kum Hui and Un Hui (1974), during a period when there was fierce national system competition between South and North Korea to intensify the internal power structure following the 7.4 South-North Joint Declaration. The Fate of Kum Hui and Un Hui is one of the works that both illuminated the landscape of South Korea and carried the greatest weight among North Korean films by contrasting the social realities of the two Koreas. To do so, it considered and contrasted the fate of sisters who went to the South and the North, respectively, during the liberation period. In the process, the film presents the modernized industrial structure of North Korea and the spectacle of Pyeongyang as a “revolutionary city,” while, simultaneously, revealing the back alleys of South Korea and the effects of pariah capitalism and the backward industrial system. The film alternates between the growth drama led by Kum Hui in North Korea and the ordeals of women in South Korea, portrayed by Un Hui. Aside from the landscape the camera focuses on containing, the element that would attract the interest of a socialist audience such as North Korea or China was the tragic story structure available for securing the depraved image and popularity in a South Korean city faced only with hearsay. In this regard, this film based on the national system competition in the new era includes elements that will be diversely comprehended in terms of success factors and audience response, as opposed to content based on a Cold War worldview.

TI  - GInSAR: A cGPS Correction for Enhanced InSAR Time Series
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth surface displacements from interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) have long been used to study deformation from a wide range of geophysical processes. Whereas deformation rates can be robustly estimated from InSAR by averaging many individual deformation observations, noise in these observations has limited their utility for generating deformation time series. In this article, we introduce a novel combination of InSAR and Global Positioning System (GPS) data that align InSAR displacements to an absolute reference and reduces long-wavelength spatial errors prior to InSAR time series construction. We test our GInSAR (GPS-enhanced InSAR) methodology on Sentinel-1 data over the southern Central Valley, CA, USA, comparing GInSAR displacement velocities and time series with those from three other referencing techniques. We find that the GInSAR approach outperforms alternative methods, yielding mm-level displacement differences with respect to collocated cGPS. By contrast, other referencing methods can overestimate peak subsidence velocities in the Central Valley by upwards of 10, deviate by tens of millimeters relative to cGPS validation time series, and contain spatial biases absent in the GInSAR methodology. We also present a modification to the widely used small baseline subset (SBAS) technique for time series estimation, whereby we use a temporal connectedness constraint to regularize the mathematical inversion and increase the number of InSAR pixels with valid time series estimates.

AB  - In the process of studying physics to solve the tasks of forming the foundations of a scientific worldview, the development of intellectual abilities and cognitive interests of students, the main attention should be paid not to transferring the amount of ready knowledge, but to acquaintance with the methods of scientific knowledge of the surrounding world, the formulation of problems that require students to independently work to resolve them. The relevance of the study of this problem is due to the fact that one of the difficult sections for training physics is the section "Quantum Physics". To achieve the best learning outcomes in this section, it is advisable to supplement the existing physical laboratory workshop with virtual interactive computer laboratory works that simulate those physical processes whose study is difficult or impossible with existing laboratory equipment, which allows a better understanding of the essence of such processes. The purpose of the work is to develop and test a digital laboratory workshop "Quantum Physics", which allows to increase the level of understanding of the essence of physical processes considered in quantum physics and gives a chance to the development of professional competencies of a future physics teacher. To achieve this goal, the authors used the following research methods: theoretical analysis of the state of the problem based on the study of methodological, didactic, psychological and specialized literature, dissertation research on this problem; materials of conferences on the use of digital technologies in physical education, regulatory documents that determine the structure and content of professional training of a physics teacher, the study and generalization of pedagogical experience; computer modeling of physical processes, observation, conversation, questioning, interviewing, conducting a pedagogical experiment. The digital laboratory workshop "Quantum Physics" direct to create a connection between the mathematical formalism of quantum physics and its specific practical manifestations. The focus of the digital laboratory workshop "Quantum Physics" is on the physical side of the issues addressed. The results of the testing, observation and conversation during the submission of the report on the implementation of laboratory work showed that the introduction of the digital laboratory workshop "Quantum Physics" in the educational process allows you to increase the level of understanding of the essence of the physical processes considered in quantum physics.
