TI  - An Interannual Transfer Learning Approach for Crop Classification in the Hetao Irrigation District, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop type classification is critical for crop production estimation and optimal water allocation. Crop type data are challenging to generate if crop reference data are lacking, especially for target years with reference data missed in collection. Is it possible to transfer a trained crop type classification model to retrace the historical spatial distribution of crop types? Taking the Hetao Irrigation District (HID) in China as the study area, this study first designed a 10 m crop type classification framework based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) for crop type mapping in the current season. Then, its interannual transferability to accurately retrace historical crop distributions was tested. The framework used Sentinel-1/2 data as the satellite data source, combined percentile, and monthly composite approaches to generate classification metrics and employed a random forest classifier with 300 trees for crop classification. Based on the proposed framework, this study first developed a 10 m crop type map of the HID for 2020 with an overall accuracy (OA) of 0.89 and then obtained a 10 m crop type map of the HID for 2019 with an OA of 0.92 by transferring the trained model for 2020 without crop reference samples. The results indicated that the designed framework could effectively identify HID crop types and have good transferability to obtain historical crop type data with acceptable accuracy. Our results found that SWIR1, Green, and Red Edge2 were the top three reflectance bands for crop classification. The land surface water index (LSWI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) were the top three vegetation indices for crop classification. April to August was the most suitable time window for crop type classification in the HID. Sentinel-1 information played a positive role in the interannual transfer of the trained model, increasing the OA from 90.73% with Sentinel 2 alone to 91.58% with Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 together.

TI  - Impact of atmospheric circulation patterns on properties and regional transport pathways of aerosols over Central-West Asia: Emphasizing the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tibetan Plateau (TP), as a remote and sparsely populated area, is regularly exposed to polluted air masses sourcing from surrounding regions. Atmospheric circulation, as the major driving force generating long-range transport processes of air pollutants, contributes to high-pollution episodes on the TP. Therefore, using reanalysis data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts for the 2000-2019 period, this paper first classified atmospheric circulation patterns over the study area into nine types (type 1 - type 9). Among them, circulation types 1, 2, 6, and 8 mainly occurred in spring and winter, while circulation types 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9 primarily occurred in summer and autumn. Second, ground-based and satellite remote sensing data were combined to investigate the impact of atmospheric circulation patterns on the properties of aerosols over Central West Asia and their surrounding areas. We detailed how the atmospheric circulation patterns impacted the aerosol optical depth, angstrom ngstro center dot m exponent, and aerosol types at different Aerosol Robotic Network sites in the study area. The results obtained from ground-based data were further verified by those from satellite remote sensing data. Third, backward trajectories and the corresponding potential source contribution function based on the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model were used to explore the impact of atmospheric circulation patterns on regional transport pathways of aerosols. It was found that under circulation types 1, 2, 6, and 8, few HYSPLIT trajectories were sourced from the south direction, while under circulation types 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9, the trajectories originating from the south increased significantly, which could be attributed to the summer monsoon.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Ecosystem Water Use Efficiency in Different Ecozones of the North China Plain
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Water use efficiency (WUE), as an environmental factor of metabolism in different ecosystem functional areas, is a key indicator of the ecosystem carbon-water cycle. WUE is defined as the ratio of carbon absorbed by ecosystems to water evaporated. Exploring the spatiotemporal variation in carbon and water cycles in different ecological zones of the North China Plain and their driving factors is important for the ecological management and sustainable development of the different ecological zones in the North China Plain. Based on remote sensing data products, this paper studies the spatiotemporal variations of WUE and their driving factors in different ecological functional areas of the North China Plain from 2001 to 2017. This study found that: (1) The spatial distribution of WUE and gross primary production (GPP) in the North China Plain is similar, with the multiyear average of WUE at 0.74 g C m(-2) y(-1). The variation trend of WUE is mainly affected by the variation trend of GPP (44.38% of the area of the North China Plain). (2) The change trend of WUE mainly showed a mild decrease and a mild increase, accounting for 73.22% of the area of the North China Plain; the area with medium-low fluctuation of WUE accounted for the largest proportion, accounting for 59.90% of the area of the North China Plain. In addition, the multiyear average values of WUE in the ecological functional area are Qin Ling Mountains deciduous forests > Central China loess plateau mixed forests > Mongolian-Manchurian grassland > Ordos Plateau steppe > Changjiang Plain evergreen forests > Huang He Plain mixed forests > Bohai Sea saline meadow, in the order from high to low. (3) The influence of precipitation on WUE was higher than that of temperature. The area of WUE that increased with the increase of precipitation accounted for 23.74% of the area of the North China Plain and was mainly distributed in the Qin Ling Mountains deciduous forests, Changjiang Plain evergreen forests, and Huang He Plain mixed forests' ecological functional areas. The results of the study can provide a reference and theoretical basis for the conservation and management of carbon and water cycles in the functional areas of North China's ecosystems.

TI  - Frequency and Nature of Communication and Handoff Failures in Medical Malpractice Claims
T2  - JOURNAL OF PATIENT SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The Joint Commission has identified miscommunication as a leading cause of sentinel events, the most serious adverse events, but it is unclear what role miscommunications play in malpractice claims. We sought to determine the proportion of medical malpractice claims involving communication failure and describe their nature, including providers involved, locations, miscommunications types, costs, and the potential for handoff tools to avert risk and associated costs. Methods We retrospectively reviewed a random sample of malpractice claims from 2001 to 2011, collected in CRICO Strategies' Comparative Benchmarking System, a national claims database. Two researchers reviewed cases to determine if a claim involved communication failure, its type, and potential preventability using a communication tool. Interrater reliability was assessed by dual review of 50 cases (81% agreement, kappa = 0.62 for evidence of miscommunication). Claimant demographics, case characteristics, and financial data were analyzed. Results Communication failures were identified in 49% of claims. Claims with communication failures were significantly less likely to be dropped, denied, or dismissed than claims without (54% versus 67%, P = 0.015). Fifty-three percent of claims with communication failures involved provider-patient miscommunication, and 47% involved provider-provider miscommunication. The information types most frequently miscommunicated were contingency plans, diagnosis, and illness severity. Forty percent of communication failures involved a failed handoff; the majority could potentially have been averted by using a handoff tool (77%). Mean total costs for cases involving communication failures were higher ($237,600 versus $154,100, P = 0.005). Conclusions Communication failures are a significant contributing cause of malpractice claims and impose a substantial financial burden on the healthcare system. Interventions to improve transmission of critical patient information have the potential to substantially reduce malpractice expenditures.

TI  - Land cover mapping using Sentinel-2 images in area dominated by small-scale, heterogeneous agricultural parcels
T2  - Agriculture and Natural Resources
M3  - Article
AB  - Importance of the work: Satellite imagery contains information on a pixel basis and promises an efficient and effective solution for mapping agricultural land resources. However, in tropical regions, the use of medium-resolution optical imagery for land cover (LC) mapping is constrained by the presence of cloud cover, seasonal changes in LC, small agricultural parcels and heterogeneity of patch or landscape features.Objectives: To analyze and compare the LC classification in a region characterized by small-scale agricultural land occupation. Materials & Methods: Two scenes of Sentinel-2 images were used. Three well-known pixel-based classification algorithms-maximum likelihood classifier (MLC), extraction and classification of homogeneous objects (ECHO) and the Fisher linear discriminant (FLD)-were investigated and compared. The study covered 3,320.3 km2 in East Java province, Indonesia. Results: The classification results produced nine LC classes-pavement or urban area (PUA), heterogeneous agricultural land (HAL), irrigated paddy (IP), open water body (OWB), dense vegetation or forest (DVF), sparse vegetation or plantation (SVP), shrubland or dry-land (SC), wetland (WL) and sand-clay-rock (SCR). Classification using MLC and ECHO produced kappa and overall accuracies of more than 90%. However, classification using the FLD algorithm had lower overall and kappa accuracies of 90.31% and 87.96%, respectively. Main finding: Of the algorithms, MLC and ECHO were better than FLD. However, four classes (HAL, IP, DVF and SVP) were still difficult to distinguish as the seasonal variation of these four LC classes may propagate different areas based on the different algorithms.

TI  - Wahi Pana Aloha Modified Letter Turned CommaAina: Storied Places of Resistance as Political Intervention
T2  - GENEALOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Wahi pana aloha Modified Letter Turned Commaaina, storied places of resistance, is a historical and political research device that perpetuates contemporary Hawaiian sovereignty history, and can serve as a political intervention between Kanaka (Hawaiian people) and the State of HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai. Wahi pana aloha Modified Letter Turned Commaaina are places where movements and resistance in the name of aloha Modified Letter Turned Commaaina occur. Aloha Modified Letter Turned Commaaina is a founding quintessential concept to a Hawaiian worldview and epistemology. The genealogy of aloha Modified Letter Turned Commaaina traditions, equipped generations of Kanaka with environmental keenness through a deep love for and connection to the land. During the illegal overthrow of the Kingdom of HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai in the 1890s, aloha Modified Letter Turned Commaaina became the political identity of Kanaka in the struggle for sovereignty of HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai during the illegal encroachment by the United States. In the 1970's during the Hawaiian renaissance (cultural re-awakening), leaders of the Protect KahoModified Letter Turned Commaolawe Modified Letter Turned CommaOhana (the group who organized the first contemporary resistance by Kanaka against the U.S.) re-discovered and reclaimed aloha Modified Letter Turned Commaaina to re-awaken the Hawaiian consciousness after decades of imposed American indoctrination. The Hawaiian renaissance led to a series of land movements that arose in opposition to America's control of Hawaiian lands and became the basis for the Hawaiian Sovereignty Movement, or, the current Hawaiian political movement for better self-determination and the return of HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai's sovereignty to Kanaka. This legacy of storied places of resistance has been effectively written over by colonial historiography and the State of Hawaii's legacy of American expansionism. This has manifested into a legacy of prejudice in the State of HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai judicial system that favors non-Kanaka entities, initiatives and agendas, while disapproving and discrediting Kanaka self-determination initiatives and sovereignty agendas. Due to this, there is no concern from the State of HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai in remedying the political conflicts that arise between Kanaka and the State. I argue that the normalization of wahi pana aloha Modified Letter Turned Commaaina, can assist Kanaka in overcoming the negative impact of the colonial footprint of the State of HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai over Kanaka ancestral legacies and land histories, and be used to reclaim Kanaka land rights. In this paper, I lay out the research behind the theory of wahi pana aloha Modified Letter Turned Commaaina, and how it functions as a research tool in the field of Kanaka land struggles, with a specific focus on historical colonial resistance. Second, I exemplify the use of wahi pana aloha Modified Letter Turned Commaaina through telling the story of the wahi pana aloha Modified Letter Turned Commaaina of my own moModified Letter Turned CommaokuModified Letter Turned Commaauhau (genealogy) in Keaukaha on the Big Island of HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai, and how my family and community maintain our moModified Letter Turned CommaokuModified Letter Turned Commaauhau and kuleana (rights/privilege/responsibility) through the practice of perpetuating wahi pana aloha Modified Letter Turned Commaaina.

TI  - Seasonal effect of agricultural pollutants on coastline environment: a case study of the southern estuarine water ecosystem of the boseong county Korea
T2  - PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The untreated disposal of wastewater in the coastal environment leads to growth of harmful algal blooms which risks the coastal ecology and human health. The harmful algal bloom can destroy aquatic natural life by reducing dissolved oxygen concentration. This study aimed to evaluate the eutrophication status at the Boseong county, Beolgyo village estuary, considering different water quality parameters. Furthermore, this study also investigated the effect of land use activates the estuarine water environment. The date of the acquisition for the Landsat 8 high-resolution satellite images were four different events i.e., 11th March, 2019, 15th June, 2019, 19th September, 2019, and 8th December, 2019 in four different seasons such as Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter respectively for selected study region. Land use and land cover were extracted on the basis of accuracy's percentage and the Kappa coefficient. Concentrations of water quality parameters such as Chlorophyll-a (Chi-a), Total Phosphorous (TP), Transparency of Sechi Depth (TSD) were extracted using Carlson Trophic State Index (CTSI). The study found that the overall value of the CTSI is classified under the medium eutrophication state in summer and autumn season (CTSI-60-70). While it falls in the light eutrophic state in winter and spring seasons (CTSI-50-60). The value of TSI for all studied nutrients is the higher nearby cropping area as well as land settlements. The spatial variation of the trophic index in the study region aided strong evidence to be detected over the area's adjutant to agrarian farming and urban habitats. The study concludes that the TSI could be used as a simple management tool to classify individual water ecosystems into broad classification that represent their water quality health.

TI  - Monitoring of Radial Deformations of a Gravity Dam Using Sentinel-1 Persistent Scatterer Interferometry
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Dams have many important socio-economic functions, fulfilling roles ranging from storing water to power generation, but also serving as leisure areas. Monitoring of their deformation is usually performed using time-consuming traditional terr estrial techniques, leading to a yearly monitoring cycle. To increase the monitoring cycle, new methods are needed. Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) is a well-established technique for monitoring millimeter deformation of the Earth's surface. The availability of free and open SAR data with a repeat cycle of 6 to 12 days from the Copernicus mission Sentinel-1, allows PSI to be used complementary to traditional surveying techniques. This present study investigates deformation dynamics at the Moehne gravity dam in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The applicability of the PSI technique to the deformation monitoring of dams is evaluated, in relation to the necessary accuracy requirements. For this purpose, Sentinel-1 data from January 2015 to November 2020 are analyzed and the deformation estimates are assessed with in situ information. Using a precise dam model, the radial deformation of the dam could be extracted and compared to trigonometric and plumb measurements. The first results show that the movements of the Moehne dam follow a seasonal pattern, reaching a maximum radial deformation of up to 4 mm in Spring, following a decline to -4 mm in the late summer. RMSE between 1.1 mm and 1.5 mm were observed between the PSI observations and the in situ data, showing that the PSI technique achieves the necessary accuracy requirements for gravity dam monitoring from space.

TI  - Modelling the Impact of Land Cover Changes on Carbon Storage and Sequestration in the Central Zagros Region, Iran Using Ecosystem Services Approach
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Central Zagros region in Iran is a major hotspot of carbon storage and sequestration which has experienced severe land cover change in recent decades that has led to carbon emission. In this research, using temporal Landsat images, land cover maps were produced and used in Land Change Modeler to predict land cover changes in 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2050 using Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network and Markov Chain techniques. Next, resultant maps were used as inputs to Ecosystem Services Modeler. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report data was used to extract carbon data. Results show that between 1989-2013 about half of forests have been destroyed. Prediction results show that by 2050 about 75% of existing forests will be lost and between 2013-2020 about 157,000 Mg carbon and by 2050 about 565,000 Mg carbon will be lost with more than US$1.9 million to 2020 and AU$3.2 million by 2050 economic compensation.

TI  - Impact of Image-Processing Routines on Mapping Glacier Surface Facies from Svalbard and the Himalayas Using Pixel-Based Methods
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier surface facies are valuable indicators of changes experienced by a glacial system. The interplay of accumulation and ablation facies, followed by intermixing with dust and debris, as well as the local climate, all induce observable and mappable changes on the supraglacial terrain. In the absence or lag of continuous field monitoring, remote sensing observations become vital for maintaining a constant supply of measurable data. However, remote satellite observations suffer from atmospheric effects, resolution disparity, and use of a multitude of mapping methods. Efficient image-processing routines are, hence, necessary to prepare and test the derivable data for mapping applications. The existing literature provides an application-centric view for selection of image processing schemes. This can create confusion, as it is not clear which method of atmospheric correction would be ideal for retrieving facies spectral reflectance, nor are the effects of pansharpening examined on facies. Moreover, with a variety of supervised classifiers and target detection methods now available, it is prudent to test the impact of variations in processing schemes on the resultant thematic classifications. In this context, the current study set its experimental goals. Using very-high-resolution (VHR) WorldView-2 data, we aimed to test the effects of three common atmospheric correction methods, viz. Dark Object Subtraction (DOS), Quick Atmospheric Correction (QUAC), and Fast Line-of-Sight Atmospheric Analysis of Hypercubes (FLAASH); and two pansharpening methods, viz. Gram-Schmidt (GS) and Hyperspherical Color Sharpening (HCS), on thematic classification of facies using 12 supervised classifiers. The conventional classifiers included: Mahalanobis Distance (MHD), Maximum Likelihood (MXL), Minimum Distance to Mean (MD), Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM), and Winner Takes All (WTA). The advanced/target detection classifiers consisted of: Adaptive Coherence Estimator (ACE), Constrained Energy Minimization (CEM), Matched Filtering (MF), Mixture-Tuned Matched Filtering (MTMF), Mixture-Tuned Target-Constrained Interference-Minimized Filter (MTTCIMF), Orthogonal Space Projection (OSP), and Target-Constrained Interference-Minimized Filter (TCIMF). This experiment was performed on glaciers at two test sites, Ny-angstrom lesund, Svalbard, Norway; and Chandra-Bhaga basin, Himalaya, India. The overall performance suggested that the FLAASH correction delivered realistic reflectance spectra, while DOS delivered the least realistic. Spectra derived from HCS sharpened subsets seemed to match the average reflectance trends, whereas GS reduced the overall reflectance. WTA classification of the DOS subsets achieved the highest overall accuracy (0.81). MTTCIMF classification of the FLAASH subsets yielded the lowest overall accuracy of 0.01. However, FLAASH consistently provided better performance (less variable and generally accurate) than DOS and QUAC, making it the more reliable and hence recommended algorithm. While HCS-pansharpened classification achieved a lower error rate (0.71) in comparison to GS pansharpening (0.76), neither significantly improved accuracy nor efficiency. The Ny-angstrom lesund glacier facies were best classified using MXL (error rate = 0.49) and WTA classifiers (error rate = 0.53), whereas the Himalayan glacier facies were best classified using MD (error rate = 0.61) and WTA (error rate = 0.45).The final comparative analysis of classifiers based on the total error rate across all atmospheric corrections and pansharpening methods yielded the following reliability order: MXL > WTA > MHD > ACE > MD > CEM = MF > SAM > MTMF = TCIMF > OSP > MTTCIMF. The findings of the current study suggested that for VHR visible near-infrared (VNIR) mapping of facies, FLAASH was the best atmospheric correction, while MXL may deliver reliable thematic classification. Moreover, an extensive account of the varying exertions of each processing scheme is discussed, and could be transferable when compared against other VHR VNIR mapping methods.

TI  - Differential response of Bay of Bengal during deficit and normal monsoons
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Present study explains the disparity in biological production (primary and secondary) with respect to two distinct monsoonal regimes in the western Bay of Bengal, viz., deficit monsoon (DM) and normal monsoon (NM). A combination of in situ and satellite data during the years 2002 (DM) and 2003 (NM) was used to address the physico-chemical and biological responses. The basin was relatively warm (Delta SST = 0.55 degrees C) and fresh (Delta SSS = -0.55) during DM than NM. Physical processes such as coastal upwelling and cyclonic eddy were prominent during NM. Variations of hydrography between DM and NM were reflected in the biological production as well. Chlorophyll a concentration (0.05 to 5.2 mg m(-2)) was almost similar during both the periods; however, column production showed higher values during DM. Mesozooplankton standing stock was relatively less during DM than NM. Composition of zooplankton also showed pronounced variation between the periods. This can be attributed to the variability in biological response of the region to the varying environmental condition. Relatively high chlorophyll a and primary productivity observed during DM may be due to the increased light availability (less cloud cover) and extended euphotic depth. In addition, the low mesozooplankton standing stock (low grazing) observed during the period also might have helped in maintaining a relatively high rate of production. The seasonal production of the basin is influenced by duration and intensity of various atmospheric as well as oceanic processes.

TI  - Change Analysis on the Spatio-Temporal Patterns of Main Crop Planting in the Middle Yangtze Plain
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As a traditional agricultural production base in China, the Middle Yangtze Plain (MYP) is a typical region to explore the intensification, large-scale, and agglomeration of agricultural land, and its crop planting situation is sensitive to changes in national agricultural policy and economic development. So far, the research of crop remote sensing extraction mainly has focused on the areas with simple crops rotation patterns, by using short-time sequence remote sensing data with low spatial resolution. The objective of this study was to address how to accurately map the spatial distribution of main crops considering their spectral and phenological features, and what characteristics of spatio-temporal patterns dynamics of crops occurred in the MYP in 1990-2020. Based on Landsat and MODIS data, using the Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM) as well as the raster-based spectral and phenological differential change method (RSPDCM), this study mapped the spatial distribution of main crops (rice, cotton, maize, soybean, rapeseed and winter wheat) in the MYP during 1990-2020 and analyzed their planting characteristics. The RSPDCM has a good overall accuracy of more than 89%. The planting characteristics of the main crops were highly intensive and agglomerate double-cropping rotation in the MYP's paddy field. Rice and rapeseed were the two most important crops, accounting for 74.75% of the annual planting area. The highly intensive and large-scale areas were mainly distributed in the Dongting Lake Plain (DTLP) and Poyang Lake Plain (PYLP), while the highly agglomerate areas of main crops were mainly distributed in the Jianghan Plain (JHP). This study innovatively provides a high-precision multi-cropping spatial dynamic mapping method and basic information, which is helpful to realize high-precision remote sensing extraction of crops in different regions of the world and provide basic data for optimizing the allocation of agricultural production resources in top grain-producing areas.

TI  - A spectral analysis of stem bark for boreal and temperate tree species
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The woody material of forest canopies has a significant effect on the total forest reflectance and on the interpretation of remotely sensed data, yet research on the spectral properties of bark has been limited. We developed a novel measurement setup for acquiring stem bark reflectance spectra in field conditions, using a mobile hyperspectral camera. The setup was used for stem bark reflectance measurements of ten boreal and temperate tree species in the visible (VIS) to near-infrared (NIR) (400-1000 nm) wavelength region. Twenty trees of each species were measured, constituting a total of 200 hyperspectral reflectance images. The mean bark spectra of species were similar in the VIS region, and the interspecific variation was largest in the NIR region. The intraspecific variation of bark spectra was high for all studied species from the VIS to the NIR region. The spectral similarity of our study species did not correspond to the general phylogenetic lineages. The hyperspectral reflectance images revealed that the distributions of per-pixel reflectance values within images were species-specific. The spectral library collected in this study contributes toward building a comprehensive understanding of the spectral diversity of forests needed not only in remote sensing applications but also in, for example, biodiversity or land surface modeling studies.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Influences of LULC Changes on Land Surface Temperature in Rapid Urbanization Area by Using Landsat-TM and TIRS Images
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The inverse correlation between NDVI and LST is widely known for its long time series. However, when more specific statistical tests were performed, subtle differences in the correlation behavior over time are more clearly observed. In this work, regression analyses were performed between NDVI and LST at intervals of approximately 10 years, quantifying this relationship for an area of transition from vegetation to urban occupation from 1985 to 2018. The removal of vegetation cover (reduction of 51% to 7% in grassland and 14.4% to 0.6% in forest) to occupy impermeable surfaces ( increase of 31% to 91% in urban areas) caused an average LST increase of 4.18 degrees C when compared to the first and last decades of the historical series. Temporal analysis allowed us to verify the increase in temperature in the four seasons. The largest difference was 6.36 degrees C between the first and last decade of autumn, 4.40 degrees C in spring, 4.09 degrees C in summer, and 2.41 degrees C in winter. The results also show that LST has a negative correlation with NDVI, especially in urban areas, with an increase in this correlation during the period (1989: R = -0.55; 1999: R = -0.58; 2008: R = -0.59; 2018: R = -0.76). Our study results will help policymakers understand the dynamics of temperature increases by adding scientifically relevant information on the sustainable organization of the urban environment.

TI  - Data Fusion in Earth Observation and the Role of Citizen as a Sensor: A Scoping Review of Applications, Methods and Future Trends
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent advances in Earth Observation (EO) placed Citizen Science (CS) in the highest position, declaring their essential provision of information in every discipline that serves the SDGs, and the 2050 climate neutrality targets. However, so far, none of the published literature reviews has investigated the models and tools that assimilate these data sources. Following this gap of knowledge, we synthesised this scoping systematic literature review (SSLR) with a will to cover this limitation and highlight the benefits and the future directions that remain uncovered. Adopting the SSLR guidelines, a double and two-level screening hybrid process found 66 articles to meet the eligibility criteria, presenting methods, where data were fused and evaluated regarding their performance, scalability level and computational efficiency. Subsequent reference is given on EO-data, their corresponding conversions, the citizens' participation digital tools, and Data Fusion (DF) models that are predominately exploited. Preliminary results showcased a preference in the multispectral satellite sensors, with the microwave sensors to be used as a supplementary data source. Approaches such as the "brute-force approach" and the super-resolution models indicate an effective way to overcome the spatio-temporal gaps and the so far reliance on commercial satellite sensors. Passive crowdsensing observations are foreseen to gain a greater audience as, described in, most cases as a low-cost and easily applicable solution even in the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic. Immersive platforms and decentralised systems should have a vital role in citizens' engagement and training process. Reviewing the DF models, the majority of the selected articles followed a data-driven method with the traditional algorithms to still hold significant attention. An exception is revealed in the smaller-scale studies, which showed a preference for deep learning models. Several studies enhanced their methods with the active-, and transfer-learning approaches, constructing a scalable model. In the end, we strongly support that the interaction with citizens is of paramount importance to achieve a climate-neutral Earth.

TI  - Spatial modeling of soil organic carbon using remotely sensed indices and environmental field inventory variables
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The relationship between soil organic carbon (SOC) and environmental parameters was investigated in the Galazchai Watershed, Iran. Therefore, correlating the SOC amounts with remote sensing (RS) indices, topographic variables, and soil texture was analyzed. Some 125 soil samples gather from the upper 30 cm, and the weight of each sample was about 0.5 kg. The RS indices, consisting of difference vegetation index (DVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), optimized soil adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), were used. Topographic variables included slope, elevation, aspect, and topographical wetness index (TWI), as well as clay and silt contents. The ordinary least square (OLS) and the geographically weighted regression (GWR) were employed to develop the SOC relationship considering different combinations of the variables. Results showed that none of the combinations of variables accurately estimated SOC (R-2 < 0.32 and p value > 0.001). However, EVI with GWR (R-2 = 0.291) and OSAVI, clay, slope, and aspect with GWR (R-2= 0.32) better estimated SOC. Therefore, results showed that the study remotely sensed indices and environmental field inventory variables could not favorably predict the SOC content. These results can be attributed to the low SOC values varying from 0.917 to 3.355%, with a mean of 2.194 +/- 0.522 in the study watershed. However, studies using more uniformly distributed and denser sampling in the study area and other methods to investigate the relationship between variables are recommended.

TI  - Automated Delineation of Supraglacial Debris Cover Using Deep Learning and Multisource Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-mountain glaciers can be covered with varying degrees of debris. Debris over glaciers (supraglacial debris) significantly alter glacier melt, velocity, ice geometry, and, thus, the overall response of glaciers towards climate change. The accumulated supraglacial debris impedes the automated delineation of glacier extent owing to its similar reflectance properties with surrounding periglacial debris (debris aside the glaciated area). Here, we propose an automated scheme for supraglacial debris mapping using a synergistic approach of deep learning and multisource remote sensing data. A combination of multisource remote sensing data (visible, near-infrared, shortwave infrared, thermal infrared, microwave, elevation, and surface slope) is used as input to a fully connected feed-forward deep neural network (i.e., deep artificial neural network). The presented deep neural network is designed by choosing the optimum number and size of hidden layers using the hit and trial method. The deep neural network is trained over eight sites spread across the Himalayas and tested over three sites in the Karakoram region. Our results show 96.3% accuracy of the model over test data. The robustness of the proposed scheme is tested over 900 km(2) and 1710 km(2) of glacierized regions, representing a high degree of landscape heterogeneity. The study provides proof of the concept that deep neural networks can potentially automate the debris-covered glacier mapping using multisource remote sensing data.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variation in Gross Primary Productivity and Their Responses to Climate in the Great Lakes Region of Sub-Saharan Africa during 2001-2020
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The impacts of climate on spatiotemporal variations of eco-physiological and bio-physical factors have been widely explored in previous research, especially in dry areas. However, the understanding of gross primary productivity (GPP) variations and its interactions with climate in humid and semi-humid areas remains unclear. Based on hyperspectral satellite remotely sensed vegetation phenology processes and related indices and the re-analysed climate datasets, we investigated the seasonal and inter-annual variability of GPP by using different light-use efficiency (LUE) models including the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approaches (CASA) model, vegetation photosynthesis models (VPMChl and VPMCanopy) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) GPP products (MOD17A2H) during 2001-2020 over the Great Lakes region of Sub-Saharan Africa (GLR-SSA). The models' validation against the in situ GPP-based upscaled observations (GPP-EC) indicated that these three models can explain 82%, 79% and 80% of GPP variations with root mean square error (RMSE) values of 5.7, 8.82 and 10.12 g C center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1), respectively. The spatiotemporal variations of GPP showed that the GLR-SSA experienced: (i) high GPP values during December-May; (ii) high annual GPP increase during 2002-2003, 2011-2013 and 2015-2016 and annual decreasing with a marked alternation in other years; (iii) evergreen broadleaf forests having the highest GPP values while grasslands and croplands showing lower GPP values. The spatial correlation between GPP and climate factors indicated 60% relative correlation between precipitation and GPP and 65% correction between surface air temperature and GPP. The results also showed high GPP values under wet conditions (in rainy seasons and humid areas) that significantly fell by the rise of dry conditions (in long dry season and arid areas). Therefore, these results showed that climate factors have potential impact on GPP variability in this region. However, these findings may provide a better understanding of climate implications on GPP variability in the GLR-SSA and other tropical climate zones.

TI  - Assessing geeSEBAL automated calibration and meteorological reanalysis uncertainties to estimate evapotranspiration in subtropical humid climates
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The application of energy balance models for estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) still has challenges to be addressed for large scale applications. The algorithm for automated calibration using inverse modeling at extreme conditions (CIMEC) is based on the definition of endmembers that represent the extreme conditions of the ET spectrum, between hot (dry and sparse vegetation) and cold (wet and dense vegetation) surfaces, with pre-defined quantiles for the endmember selection. The main goal was to assess geeSEBAL algorithm uncertainties related to the (i) automated calibration, including the use of additional filters (land cover, homogeneity, and domain area) and (ii) the use of a global climate grid as input data. Based on a sensitivity analysis, we defined new set of quantiles to increase the accuracy of ET estimates in subtropical humid climates, since the default quantiles were adjusted to semiarid climates with dry summers. To validate our ET estimates we used eddy covariance measurements from five flux towers located in the South of Brazil. Processing 132 Landsat cloud free images and using adjusted quantiles, we found a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.91 mm d - 1 and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.82 with geeSEBAL driven by meteorological measurements. Using the predefined quantiles, we found an RMSE of 1.16 mm d -1 (27% higher) and R2 of 0.75. The upscaling instantaneous ET to daily ET resulted in an underestimation of the daily ET using the pre-defined quantiles, while the optimized quantiles corrected the daily estimates. Furthermore, our results suggested a low sensitivity of geeSEBAL to meteorological inputs, since RMSE slightly increased to 1.04 mm d - 1 (14.3% higher) and R2 decreased to 0.76 (8.5% smaller) when driven by global climate data. For data scarce areas, geeSEBAL is a feasible alternative for cropland ET estimation and water resources management in subtropical humid climates.

TI  - Mendicants, Minimalism, and Method: Franciscan Scientific Travel in the Early Modern French Atlantic
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARLY MODERN HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article explores the scientific travels of French members of mendicant orders in the early modern Atlantic World. The Royal Cosmographer Andre Thevet, the Capuchin Claude D'Abbeville and the Minim Charles Plumier demonstrate a coherent but evolving Franciscan perspective in missionary scientific observation on the colonial frontier. It argues that the Franciscan monastic tradition, the Franciscan reform movement, and the teachings of the Minim order interacted with the colonial landscape and encounters with local environments and indigenous peoples in the Atlantic and Caribbean to produce a unique tradition of natural knowledge production. This tradition culminates in the convergence of the Minim worldview with the cartographic and observational program of the Paris Academy of Sciences in the Atlantic voyages of the French Minim friar and scientific traveler Louis Feuillee at the turn of the eighteenth century.

TI  - Can one-step nucleic acid amplification assay predict four or more positive axillary lymph node involvement in breast cancer patients: a single-centre retrospective study
T2  - ANNALS OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS OF ENGLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Background One-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) assay is a proven, accurate, intraoperative method for the detection of lymph node (LN) metastases. The aim of this study was to assess if the total tumour load (TTL) as calculated by OSNA could be used to predict N2 stage disease, ie >= 4 LN containing metastases, in invasive breast cancer patients.Methods Between 2011 and 2019 at St Richard's Hospital, Chichester, all macro-metastasis-positive OSNA cases for invasive breast cancer were retrospectively reviewed. The association between clinicopathological variables and >= 4 LNs containing metastases was analysed using regression analysis.Results In total, 134 patients with positive sentinel lymph node (SLN) on OSNA undergoing axillary node clearance were analysed, 53% of whom had no further positive LN, 25% had >= 4 lymph nodes positive. TTL was calculated as the aggregate of cytokeratin-19 mRNA copy count of all SLN tissue analysed via OSNA. TTL >= 1.1x10(5)copiesbl and lymphovascular invasion (LVI) were both significant predictors of N2 stage disease on both univariate (TTL p=0.04, LVI p=0.005) and multivariate (TTL p=0.008, LVI p=0.039) regression analysis.Conclusion Our findings show that SLN TTL via intraoperative OSNA assay can predict four or more positive axillary LN involvement in invasive breast cancer. This is important in that it may be used intraoperatively by surgeons to decide on whether to proceed with a full axillary node clearance in order to stage the axilla. Further research is required to shape future guidance.

TI  - The Diurnal Dynamics of Gross Primary Productivity Using Observations From the Advanced Baseline Imager on the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R Series at an Oak Savanna Ecosystem
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Gross primary productivity (GPP) is the largest flux in the global carbon cycle and satellite-based GPP estimates have long been used to study the trends and interannual variability of GPP. With recent updates to geostationary satellites, we can now explore the diurnal variability of GPP at a comparable spatial resolution to polar-orbiting satellites and at temporal frequencies comparable to eddy covariance (EC) tower sites. We used observations from the Advanced Baseline Imager on the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R series (GOES-R) to test the ability of subdaily satellite data to capture the shifts in the diurnal course of GPP at an oak savanna EC site in California, USA that is subject to seasonal soil moisture declines. We compared three methods to estimate GPP: (a) a light-use efficiency model, (b) a linear relationship between the product of near-infrared reflectance of vegetation and photosynthetically active radiation (LIN-NIRvP) and EC tower GPP, and (c) a light response curve (LRC-NIRvP) between NIRvP and EC GPP. The LRC-NIRvP achieved the lowest mean absolute error for winter (2 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)), spring (2.51 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)), summer (1.43 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)), and fall (1.35 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)). The ecosystem experienced the largest shift in daily peak GPP in relation to the peak of incoming solar radiation toward the morning hours during the dry summers. The LRC-NIRvP and the light-use efficiency model were in agreement with these patterns of a shift in peak daily GPP toward the morning hours during summer. Our results can help develop diurnal estimates of GPP from geostationary satellites that are sensitive to fluctuating environmental conditions during the day.

TI  - Effect of DEM resolution in flood modeling: a case study of Gorganrood River, Northeastern Iran
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluated the efficiency of different Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), including ALOS-12.5 m, SRTM-30 m, SRTM-90 m, and ASTER-30 m v3 when being applied for the hydraulic simulation of flood inundation areas. HEC-RAS-2D model was employed to simulate inundation extent of a 400-year flood (Mar 17, 2019, with peak discharge similar to 547.92 m(3)/s) along 70 km reach of low-gradient Gorganrood River, northeastern Iran. Fit percentage indicator (FI) and BIAS percentage indicator (BI) were used to evaluate the results in comparison with the remotely sensed inundated area data. The results revealed that the accuracy and capability of the ALOS and SRTM-30 m were higher in simulation of flood extend area (FI similar to 52, BI similar to - 22) and in deriving peak discharge in downstream of the study reach (RMSE similar to 20%). The ASTER showed the worst performance in both floods extend area and peak discharge, despite dramatic improvements in the new version. The results of this study can be considered as a baseline for the selection of DEM sources for deriving flood inundation mapping.

T2  - FILOZOFIA NAUKI
M3  - Article
AB  - The article examines the concept of anti-irrationalism coined by the members of the Lvov-Warsaw School. The term "anti-irrationalism" comes from Ajdukiewicz, who used it to define the specificity of the School as a whole. For Ajdukiewicz, anti-irrationalism, which values cognition with intersubjective qualities, is contrasted with irrationalism. The article discusses Twardowski's tripartite division of beliefs into rational, "irrational," and "non-rational." Against this background, the article explores Dambska's view on irrationalism, which is divided by her into several sub-categories. Finally, the author considers the question of anti-irrationalism as a metaphilosophical standpoint in the context of the question of a worldview.

TI  - Airborne HySpex Hyperspectral Versus Multitemporal Sentinel-2 Images for Mountain Plant Communities Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and anthropopression significantly impact plant communities by leading to the spread of expansive and alien invasive plants, thus reducing their biodiversity. Due to significant elevation gradients, high-mountain plant communities in a small area allow for the monitoring of the most important environmental changes. Additionally, being a tourist attraction, they are exposed to direct human influence (e.g., trampling). Airborne hyperspectral remote sensing is one of the best data sources for vegetation mapping, but flight campaign costs limit the repeatability of surveys. A possible alternative approach is to use satellite data from the Copernicus Earth observation program. In our study, we compared multitemporal Sentinel-2 data with HySpex airborne hyperspectral images to map the plant communities on Tatra Mountains based on open-source R programing implementation of Random Forest and Support Vector Machine classifiers. As high-mountain ecosystems are adapted to topographic conditions, the input of Digital Elevation Model (DEM) derivatives on the classification accuracy was analyzed and the effect of the number of training pixels was tested to procure practical information for field campaign planning. For 13 classes (from rock scree communities and alpine grasslands to montane conifer and deciduous forests), we achieved results in the range of 76-90% F1-score depending on the data set. Topographic features: digital terrain model (DTM), normalized digital surface model (nDSM), and aspect and slope maps improved the accuracy of HySpex spectral images, transforming their minimum noise fraction (MNF) bands and Sentinel-2 data sets by 5-15% of the F1-score. Maps obtained on the basis of HySpex imagery (2 m; 430 bands) had a high similarity to maps obtained on the basis of multitemporal Sentinel-2 data (10 m; 132 bands; 11 acquisition dates), which was less than one percentage point for classifications based on 500-1000 pixels; for sets consisting of 50-100 pixels, Random Forest (RF) offered better accuracy.

AB  - The paper explores the status of NATURE metaphors in Hungarian folk songs with respect to their representation and transmission of folk culture and worldview. Employing a Cultural Linguistic analysis, metaphors are observed from three perspectives: in relation to cultural schemas, generic-level conceptual metaphors, and experiential motivation. NATURE metaphors are to a large extent framed by cultural experience regarding their experiential basis, conceptual structure and relation with other cultural conceptualizations.

TI  - Possible pathways of seawater intrusion along the Mount-Cameroon coastal area using remote sensing and GIS techniques
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal aquifers are vulnerable to salinisation due to seawater intrusion. Lineaments generally play the role of pathways for this intrusion. This paper investigates the lineament pattern in the region of southern-Cameroon with the main purpose of understanding the mechanism of the eventual contamination of groundwater by salinity. 472 lineaments are mapped in the study area using both Landsat-8 OLI and 7 ETM + images. 15 of those lineaments connect 19 contaminated boreholes to the shore. A total of 24 out of 58 boreholes are contaminated by seawater. A statistical analysis of this network depicts the responsibility of lineaments in seawater intrusion. Other aggravating factors are elevation (<100 m) and slope (<7 degrees). A wide NE-SW-oriented fractured zone is detected within the flat area extending between Mount-Cameroon and Limbe-Mabeta Massif. Furthermore, several new fractured zones are highlighted, and will be considered when elaborating policy of local water management. This low-cost and time-saving approach which combines remote sensing and GIS has been effective, and recommended for similar investigations worldwide. A geophysical campaign with the purpose of characterizing local aquifer and upgrade hydrological, geological and electrical parameters of the local aquifer is scheduled. (C) 2021 COSPAR.

TI  - Tumor-educated T<sub>regs</sub> drive organ-specific metastasis in breast cancer by impairing NK cells in the lymph node niche
T2  - CELL REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Breast cancer is accompanied by systemic immunosuppression, which facilitates metastasis formation, but how this shapes organotropism of metastasis is poorly understood. Here, we investigate the impact of mammary tumorigenesis on regulatory T cells (T-regs) in distant organs and how this affects multi-organ metastatic disease. Using a preclinical mouse mammary tumor model that recapitulates human metastatic breast cancer, we observe systemic accumulation of activated, highly immunosuppressive T-regs during primary tumor growth. Tumor-educated T-regs show tissue-specific transcriptional rewiring in response to mammary tumorigenesis. This has functional consequences for organotropism of metastasis, as T-reg depletion reduces metastasis to tumor-draining lymph nodes, but not to lungs. Mechanistically, we find that T-regs control natural killer (NK) cell activation in lymph nodes, thereby facilitating lymph node metastasis, In line, an increased T-reg/NK cell ratio is observed in sentinel lymph nodes of breast cancer patients compared with healthy controls. This study highlights that immune regulation of metastatic disease is highly organ dependent.

TI  - The Universe as an Aesthetic Symbolism of Postmodernity
T2  - POSTMODERN OPENINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article reveals the philosophical, worldview, aesthetically-axiological aspects of considering the universe as a symbolic phenomenon of the postmodern era. It is emphasized that the analysis of beauty, as the basic category of aesthetics, needs to find out its aggregate nature, depending on the individual and social semantic characteristics of reality. One of the key points of such an analysis is its metaphysical problematic - the direct emergence of constructive emotion into the realm of the transcendental, namely, the view of Man from the Universe from the standpoint of eternity. The timeliness and necessity of considering the problem of the symbolic context of the universe is obvious in the context of the third millennium, the realities of which call into question the very fact of conservation of wildlife on Earth. In the minds of assimilating the finality of the earthly boot, its primarity of progressive stochasticity, in the midst of the amplification of the eschatological context, the people of the era of postmodernity are demonstrating the development of the fastflowing, hardened nonsense. In the philosophical tradition, the symbol is the role of a pure "selfness", not tied to the powerful moment of the object: the symbolic picture does not reflect reality, as it is - the symbol of knowing the "refair" in the sphere of the virtual. It is proved that for the modern man the Universe is the object of not only scientific, technological, but also philosophical, cultural studies, it synthesizes for the unity of the object of scientific interest, a symbol of aesthetic pleasure and a source of formation of appropriate images and archetypes.

TI  - Do We Need A Higher Resolution? Case Study: Sentinel-1-Based Change Detection of the 2018 Hokkaido Landslides, Japan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Since 2014, Sentinel-1 (S1) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data have become an important source in the field of displacement detection thanks to regular acquisitions and 7.5 years of temporal coverage at global level. Despite the increasing number of publications on the role of S1 in landslide detection, there is still a need for research to further clarify the capabilities of the sensor and the applicable image analysis techniques. Previous studies have successfully exploited high-resolution ALOS-PALSAR image-based intensity and coherence analysis at the 2018 Hokkaido landslides. Nevertheless, they expressed a clear need to analyse the capabilities of other sensors (such as S1). This raises the question: Do we need SAR imagery with higher spatial resolution (such as ALOS-PALSAR) or are freely available S1 imagery also suitable for rapid landslide detection? The S1 images could provide suitable material for a comparative analysis and could answer the aforementioned question. Therefore, 17 ascending and 19 descending S1 images were analysed to test S1 accuracy on landslide detection. Multitemporal analyses of both intensity and coherence were performed along with coherence differences, multitemporal features (MTF) and MTF differences of coherence images. In addition, the spatial analysis of the classification results was also evaluated to highlight the potential of S1 coherence analysis. S1 was found to have limitations at the site, as single coherence differences provided low-quality results. However, the results were significantly improved by calculating the MTF on coherence and almost reached the success rate of the ALOS-PALSAR-based coherence analysis, even though the improvement of the results with intensity was not possible. Half of the false positives were identified in the 30-45-m buffer zone of the agreement, underlining that the spatial resolution of the S1 is not appropriate for accurate landslide detection. Only an approximation of the landslide-affected area can be given with considerable overestimation. Due to the inclusion of post-event images, the sensor is not perfectly applicable for rapid detection purposes here.

TI  - NIGHTTIME LIGHT EMISSIONS EXPLAIN THE DECLINE IN NO<sub>2</sub> DURING A COVID-19-INDUCED TOTAL LOCKDOWN IN FRANCE
T2  - GEOGRAPHIA TECHNICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Referring to a total lockdown due to COVID-19 in Metropolitan France, this study investigates the geospatial correlation between nighttime light emission and the relative change of NO2 air pollution (dNO(2) %). To address the research problem, near-surface NO2 data and nighttime light data were implemented. Stable night lights were obtained for a long period on average (2014-2019) using Day-Night Band (DNB) data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). The relative change in tropospheric NO2 was calculated using Sentinel-5P satellite data from the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). The dNO(2) calculation was performed considering an equivalent reference period (April 2019) to the major lockdown period in France (April 2020). The correlation between the variables DNB nighttime lights and dNO(2) was tested with a statistical T-test. The findings revealed an intense phenomenon of decreasing NO2 air pollution in France (decreases by -25% to -50%). Decreases < -50% were mainly recorded in the greater Paris metropolitan area, in Alsace, and other locations. The results showed a strong and statistically significant inverse geospatial correlation between the two variables under anti-COVID-19 control measures. The higher was the emission of nighttime lights, the higher was the degree of tropospheric NO2 decrease in the regions of France (R-2 =0.72). It is concluded that employing remote sensing techniques, DNB nighttime light is a reliable indicator to estimate the degree of air decontamination. DNB as an independent variable is recommended for future research on changes in the concentration of other pollutant gases.

TI  - Sentinel-1 Satellite Radar Images: A New Source of Information for Study of River Channel Dynamics on the Lower Vistula River, Poland
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The amount of sediments transported by a river is difficult to estimate, while this parameter could influence channel geometry. It is possible to derive the bedload transport rate per unit width of the river channel by measuring the migration distance of bedform profiles over time and thickness of bedload layer in motion. Other possible methods include instrumental measurements using bedload traps and empirical formulas. It is possible to use remote-sensing techniques to measure the dynamics of bedform movements and geometries. Landsat images and aerial photographs have been used for this. A new source of remote-sensing information is radar satellite images. Sentinel-1 images have a temporal resolution of 2-3 days and spatial resolution of 25 m at middle latitudes, which make them usable on large rivers. The research area is the 814-820 km reach of the Lower Vistula River, where seven alternate sandbars were selected. The bank lines of the sandbars were delineated on Sentinel-1 images sensed during two low-flow periods of 4 August-26 September 2018 and 1 July-31 August 2019, when discharges at low flow were similar. From water stage observations at gauges, water elevations were assigned to every bank line of the alternate sandbars. The following morphometric parameters were calculated: alternate sandbar centers, volumes and longitudinal profile. Average daily movement of the sandbars in the period 4 August 2018-1 July 2019 was calculated as 0.97 m center dot day(-1). A similar alternate sandbar movement velocity was obtained from a study of Sentinel-2 optical satellite images and hydro-acoustic measurements on the Lower Vistula River. Having depth of bedload in motion and alternate sandbar shift velocities, it was possible to calculate the rate of bedload transport according to the Exner approach formula. Rate of bedload transport was estimated as q(b) = 0.027 kg center dot s(-1)center dot m(-1). This study shows a novel use of Sentinel-1 images to study the 3D geometry and movement rate of sandbars.

TI  - Fires on Ice: Emerging Permafrost Peatlands Fire Regimes in Russia's Subarctic Taiga
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires in permafrost areas, including smoldering fires (e.g., "zombie fires"), have increasingly become a concern in the Arctic and subarctic. Their detection is difficult and requires ground truthing. Local and Indigenous knowledge are becoming useful sources of information that could guide future research and wildfire management. This paper focuses on permafrost peatland fires in the Siberian subarctic taiga linked to local communities and their infrastructure. It presents the results of field studies in Evenki and old-settler communities of Tokma and Khanda in the Irkutsk region of Russia in conjunction with concurrent remote sensing data analysis. The study areas located in the discontinuous permafrost zone allow examination of the dynamics of wildfires in permafrost peatlands and adjacent forested areas. Interviews revealed an unusual prevalence and witness-observed characteristics of smoldering peatland fires over permafrost, such as longer than expected fire risk periods, impacts on community infrastructure, changes in migration of wild animals, and an increasing number of smoldering wildfires including overwintering "zombie fires" in the last five years. The analysis of concurrent satellite remote sensing data confirmed observations from communities, but demonstrated a limited capacity of satellite imagery to accurately capture changing wildfire activity in permafrost peatlands, which may have significant implications for global climate.

TI  - Flood Depth Estimation during Hurricane Harvey Using Sentinel-1 and UAVSAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In August 2017, Hurricane Harvey was one of the most destructive storms to make landfall in the Houston area, causing loss of life and property. Temporal and spatial changes in the depth of floodwater and the extent of inundation form an essential part of flood studies. This work estimates the flood extent and depth from LiDAR DEM (light detection and ranging digital elevation model) using data from the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) and satellite sensor-Sentinel-1. The flood extent showed a decrease between 29-30 August and 5 September 2017. The flood depths estimated using the DEM were compared with the USGS gauge data and showed a correlation (R-2) greater than 0.88. The use of Sentinel-1 and UAVSAR resulted in a daily temporal repeat, which helped to document the changes in the flood area and the water depth. These observations are significant for efficient disaster management and to assist relief organizations by providing spatially precise information for the affected areas.

AB  - This article discusses the issue of the philosophical and creative aesthetic basis of Pushkin and Turgenev. The study pays special attention to the features of artistic and aesthetic similarities and differences between both writers. The results of a comparative analysis are presented, based on the history of aesthetics of the corresponding periods. The novelty of the work lies in the revision of previous studies on this topic and the introduction of important touches to the topic under study. The relevance of the research is due to the tasks of examining classical works using modern tools through the prism of new research. In the course of the research, a review of the work of writers and works of researchers in the context of this topic was carried out, which allows us to draw the following conclusions: the philosophical and aesthetic basis of the work of both writers most reflects the ideas of Kant, Schiller and Hegel; the beautiful and the good in their worldview are inseparable; both writers are united by nationality and the whole spectrum of socio-political issues; the creativity of the writers is excellent to the same extent that the Slavophil is different from the Westernizer; Turgenev's aesthetics is less mobile and rosy, but represents a greater synthesis of philosophical and aesthetic attitudes of different types of art.

Through extended ethnographic research, I examine the imagination of Turkish political theology and the exclusion of the Kurds from the imagined transnational Muslim ummah for which Turkish Islamist discourse promotes the Turkish state as the flag-bearer. I demonstrate that the existence of the Kurds, by virtue of their exclusion from this imaginary worldview, unravels the limitations of Turkish pan-Islamist discourse.

TI  - DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGES IN THE ERGO DESIGN OF PROTESTANT CHURCHES IN UKRAINE (1991-2021)
T2  - OCCASIONAL PAPERS ON RELIGION IN EASTERN EUROPE
M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents the evolution of ergonomics and design of Protestant churches in Ukraine in the period from 1991-2021. Since Ukraine left the Soviet Union, the Soviet worldview of Ukrainian Protestants has gradually changed, which, in turn, influenced the formation of the subject-spatial environment and, in general, the ergo design of Protestant churches. The concept presented in the article is that ergo design is similar to a living organism, which changes under the influence of external factors, such as the emotional feeling of believers, political and economic changes, etc. This influence was especially evident during the transitional period on the territory of Ukraine, beginning on August 24, 1991, when the Verkhovna Rada adopted the "Act of the Declaration of Independence of Ukraine," which led to the achievement of religious freedom by the churches. The newfound freedom for Protestants in Ukraine opened the way for the implementation of design solutions in their churches, despite a significant lack of funds. The Protestant worldview, freed from the influence of Soviet ideology, was reflected in the pictorial features of the spatial and artistic environment of the sacred structures. The contrast of changes in the ergo design and architecture of Ukrainian Protestant churches is summarized in this study.

The patient was scheduled for radical vulvectomy with a left inguinal SLN biopsy. Indocyanine green was injected directly into the vulvar mass to map lymphatic drainage. A 4-cm-sized linear incision was made on the left inguinal crease, and the lymphatic channels of the left inguinal area were dissected under fluorescent image guidance using a 1588 Advanced Imaging Modalities Platform laparoscopic camera (Stryker, Kalamazoo, MI, USA).ResultsFluorescence image-guided left inguinal SLN biopsy and radical vulvectomy were performed. The pathologic diagnosis confirmed vulvar adenoid cystic carcinoma with metastasis to the left inguinal lymph node (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IIIA). The patient was discharged without complications and received adjuvant radiotherapy.ConclusionThis video demonstrates a successful ICG fluorescence image-guided left inguinal SLN biopsy in a vulvar cancer patient using a laparoscopic camera. Mapping of inguinal SLNs in patients with vulvar cancer may help in retaining surgical radicality while minimizing operative complications.

TI  - Climatic Drivers of the Complex Phenology of the Mediterranean Semi-Deciduous Shrub <i>Phlomis fruticosa</i> Based on Satellite-Derived EVI
T2  - PLANTS-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - A 21-year Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) time-series produced from MODIS satellite images was used to study the complex phenological cycle of the drought semi-deciduous shrub Phlomis fruticosa and additionally to identify and compare phenological events between two Mediterranean sites with different microclimates. In the more xeric Araxos site, spring leaf fall starts earlier, autumn revival occurs later, and the dry period is longer, compared with the more favorable Louros site. Accordingly, the control of climatic factors on phenological events was examined and found that the Araxos site is mostly influenced by rain related events while Louros site by both rain and temperature. Spring phenological events showed significant shifts at a rate of 1-4.9 days per year in Araxos, which were positively related to trends for decreasing spring precipitation and increasing summer temperature. Furthermore, the climatic control on the inter-annual EVI fluctuation was examined through multiple linear regression and machine learning approaches. For both sites, temperature during the previous 2-3 months and rain days of the previous 3 months were identified as the main drivers of the EVI profile. Our results emphasize the importance of focusing on a single species and small-spatial-scale information in connecting vegetation responses to the climate crisis.

TI  - Variability of nitrogen oxide emission fluxes and lifetimes estimated from Sentinel-5P TROPOMI observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite observations of the high-resolution TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on Sentinel-5 Precursor can be used to observe nitrogen dioxide (NO2) at city scales to quantify short time variability of nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions and lifetimes on a daily and seasonal basis. In this study, 2 years of TROPOMI tropospheric NO2 columns, having a spatial resolution of up to 3.5 km x 5.5 km, have been analyzed together with wind and ozone data. NOx lifetimes and emission fluxes are estimated for 50 different NOx sources comprising cities, isolated power plants, industrial regions, oil fields, and regions with a mix of sources distributed around the world. The retrieved NOx emissions are in agreement with other TROPOMI-based estimates and reproduce the variability seen in power plant stack measurements but are in general lower than the analyzed stack measurements and emission inventory results. Separation into seasons shows a clear seasonal dependence of NOx emissions with in general the highest emissions during winter, except for isolated power plants and especially sources in hot desert climates, where the opposite is found. The NO, lifetime shows a systematic latitudinal dependence with an increase in lifetime from 2 to 8 h with latitude but only a weak seasonal dependence. For most of the 50 sources including the city of Wuhan in China, a clear weekly pattern of NOx emissions is found, with weekend-to-weekday ratios of up to 0.5 but with a high variability for the different locations. During the Covid-19 lockdown period in 2020, strong reductions in the NOx emissions were observed for New Delhi, Buenos Aires, and Madrid.

TI  - Sentinel Epileptiform Discharges Activating Two Seizure Networks on Intracranial EEG
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel epileptiform discharges (SEDs) are epileptiform transients preceding the onset of a focal seizure seen on scalp EEG. Despite their potential localizing value, formal study of SED has been limited. The authors report a patient with MRI-negative focal-onset epilepsy whose seizures on scalp and intracranial EEG were always preceded by SED. Although the location and morphology of the SED was invariable, the seizures after the discharge were of two clearly distinct types, each with different semiology and region of spread on intracranial EEG. This suggests that the SED played a role in activating two distinct seizure networks. A right temporal lobectomy with amygdalohippocampectomy was performed. The resection included both the region of the SED as well as the seizure-onset zone of the more common seizure type, achieving seizure freedom at 3 years after surgery. Further research exploring whether the localization of SED is a reliable indicator of the seizure-onset zone could aid surgical planning in patients whose seizures are preceded by SED.

TI  - Multi-Band Bathymetry Mapping with Spiking Neuron Anomaly Detection
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The developed method extracts bathymetry distributions from multiple satellite image bands. The automated remote sensing function is sparsely coded and combines spiking neural net anomaly filtration, spline, and multi-band fittings. Survey data were used to identify an activation threshold, decay rate, spline fittings, and multi-band weighting factors. Errors were computed for remotely sensed Landsat satellite images. Multi-band fittings achieved an average error of 25.3 cm. This proved sufficiently accurate to automatically extract shorelines to eliminate land areas in bathymetry mapping.

TI  - Review of Atmospheric Environmental Change from Earth Observing Satellites
T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Satellite data is a collection of various atmospheric environmental information through continuous earth observations. Those data observed for a long time-series provide detailed information on environmental changes which has been processed as two-dimensional information representing the atmospheric columnar integrated properties or multi-dimensional data combining space and time. In this review, we investigate the characteristics of various earth observing satellites that have been deriving the global atmospheric information up to date. In terms of applications, the patterns of global atmospheric environmental changes based on statistical and comparative analysis with the long-term observations are also addressed. The spatio-temporal changes in the atmospheric environmental parameters are discussed, in order to provide a quantitative grasp of the statistical relationship. Finally, future developments are put forward. This information will help to understand the atmospheric environment and climate-related interactions.

TI  - The role of radiotherapy in the management of nodal disease in breast cancer
T2  - REPORTS OF PRACTICAL ONCOLOGY AND RADIOTHERAPY
M3  - Review
AB  - The management of nodal disease in breast cancer has evolved over the last two decades. With minimalist surgical approaches for early breast cancers becoming commonplace, the question of whether radiation can replace surgery to reduce morbidity is an important question in this population, as decision making has become more complex. In more advanced disease, and in patients with significant high-risk clinical and/or pathological features, the dilemma of who should receive regional nodal irradiation has been addressed in large studies but remains controversial. In this article, we summarise and discuss the recent trials which guide modern clinical practice, as well as some of the ongoing studies which aim to address outstanding questions within the field.

TI  - A New Benchmark for Surface Radiation Products over the East Asia-Pacific Region Retrieved from the <i>Himawari</i>-<i>8</i>/AHI Next-Generation Geostationary Satellite
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface downward radiation (SDR), including shortwave downward radiation (SWDR) and longwave downward radiation (LWDR), is of great importance to energy and climate studies. Considering the lack of reliable SDR data with a high spatiotemporal resolution in the East Asia-Pacific (EAP) region, we derived SWDR and LWDR at 10-min and 0.05 degrees resolutions for this region from 2016 to 2020 based on the next-generation geostationary satellite Himawari-8 (H-8). The SDR product is unique in terms of its all-sky features, high accuracy, and high-resolution levels. The cloud effect is fully considered in the SDR product, and the influence of high aerosol loadings and topography on the SWDR are considered. Compared to benchmark products of the radiation, such as Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) next-generation reanalysis (ERA5), and the Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS), not only is the resolution of the new SDR product notably much higher, but the product accuracy is also higher than that of those products. In particular, hourly and daily root-mean-square errors of the new SWDR are 104.9 and 31.5 W m(-2), respectively, which are much smaller than those of CERES (at 121.6 and 38.6 W m', respectively), ERA5 (at 176.6 and 39.5 W m(-2), respectively), and GLASS (daily of 36.5 W m(-2)). Meanwhile, RMSEs of hourly and daily values of the new LWDR are 19.6 and 14.4 W m(-2), respectively, which are comparable to that of CERES and ERA5, and even better over high-altitude regions.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variation of water area with high chlorophyll concentration in the South China Sea based on OC-CCI data
T2  - Journal of Tropical Oceanography
M3  - Article
AB  - Phytoplankton are the basis of the Marine ecosystem food chain, and affect the variation of CO2 flux through photosynthesis. In this study, an estimation system of phytoplankton biomass in the South China Sea was established based on the area index. Based on remote sensing data, the empirical orthogonal function decomposition interpolation method (DINEOF) was used to reconstruct the chlorophyll concentration field in the South China Sea with long time series. We studied the space-time distribution of the high biomass water area of the south China sea and found that the changes of water area with high chlorophyll concentration had significant seasonal characteristics. The area reaches the maximum in the winter, and minimum in the summer. Conversely, the chlorophyll concentration reaches the minimum in winter, and maximum in the summer. This feature may be due to the wind-driven sea surface dynamic process to redistribute the sea surface chlorophyll. In terms of spatial distribution, waters with high chlorophyll concentrations are found near the coast all year round, especially in coastal areas of China, northern and southern Vietnam, the Gulf of Thailand and near Borneo Island. In the Sunda continental shelf and the central basin of eastern Vietnam, the area of high biomass water showed interannual variation. The South China Sea monsoon regulated by El Nino led to different degrees of northern cold water invasion in the southeast coast of Vietnam in different years, which may be the reason for the increase and decrease of local phytoplankton biomass.

TI  - Response of Vegetation Phenology to the Interaction of Temperature and Precipitation Changes in Qilian Mountains
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Located at the junction between the continental climate region and marine climate region, the Qilian Mountains have experienced significant climate change. Vegetation phenology in the Qilian Mountains is sensitive to climate change. However, the response of vegetation phenology to temperature and precipitation change is still unclear, and the same is true for their interactions. First, we extracted grassland phenological parameters such as SOS (the start of the growing season), EOS (the end of the growing season), and LOS (the length of the growing season) from revised MODIS-NDVI data in the Qilian Mountains during the period from 2000 to 2019. Second, we analyzed change trends of the phenological parameters, temperature, and precipitation. Furthermore, the effects of each meteorological element changes and their interaction on multiple phenological parameters were detected using the GeoDetector method. The result implied that (1) the SOS in most areas except the northwestern mountain region showed an advanced trend (10 d/10a); the EOS showed a delayed trend in the southeast (5 d/10a), and an advanced trend (5 d/10a) in the northwest; the LOS showed an extended trend (10 d/10a) in the southeast, and a shortened trend (5 d/10a) in the northwest. (2) Compared with a single meteorological element in a single period, the interaction of temperature and precipitation in different periods had a higher impact on grassland phenology, with the maximum q-value increasing by about 0.4 for each phenological parameter. (3) The change in the grassland phenology in the Qilian Mountains was inconsistently complete with climate change in the spatial distribution. Our research reveals the response of grassland phenology to the interaction of different meteorological elements in different periods. Compared with a single element, this can reflect the response of vegetation phenology to climate change more comprehensively.

TI  - Revisiting the Performance of the Kernel-Driven BRDF Model Using Filtered High-Quality POLDER Observations
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) is usually used to describe the reflectance anisotropy of a non-Lambertian surface and estimate surface parameters. Among the BRDF models, the kernel-driven models have been extensively used due to their simple form and powerful fitting ability, and their reliability has been validated in some studies. However, existing validation efforts used in situ measurements or limited satellite data, which may be subject to inadequate observational conditions or quality uncertainties. A recently released high-quality BRDF database from Polarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectances (POLDER) provides an opportunity to revisit the performance of the kernel-driven models. Therefore, in order to evaluate the fitting ability of the kernel-driven models under different observational conditions and explore their application direction in the future, we use the filtered high-quality BRDF database to evaluate the fitting ability of the kernel-driven model represented by the RossThick-LiSparseR (RTLSR) kernels in this paper. The results show that the RTLSR model performs well, which shows small fitting residuals under most observational conditions. However, the applicability of the RTLSR model performed differently across land cover types; the RTLSR model exhibited larger fitting residuals, especially over non-vegetated surfaces. Under different sun-sensor geometries, the fitting residuals show a strong positive correlation with the Solar Zenith Angle. The above two factors cause the RTLSR model to exhibit a poorer fitting ability at high latitudes. As an exploration, we designed a model combination strategy that combines the advantages of different models and achieved a better performance at high latitudes. We believe that this study provides a better understanding of the RTLSR model.

TI  - Classification of Snow Cover Persistence across China
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we classified the variability in snow cover persistence across China by using a novel method; continuous snow cover days and variability of snow cover were used as the evaluation indicators based on a long-term Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) snow cover extent (SCE) product. The product has been generated by the snow research team in the Northwest Institute of Eco-Environment and Resources (NIEER), Chinese Academy of Sciences. There were obvious differences in snow cover classification in three snow cover areas (northern Xinjiang, northeast China, and the Tibetan Plateau): northern Xinjiang was dominated by persistent snow cover, most regions of northeast China were covered by persistent and periodic variable snow cover. There was the most abundant snow cover classification in the Tibetan Plateau. The extents of persistent and periodic variable snow cover were gradually shrinking due to rising temperatures and decreasing snowfall during 1981-2019. In contrast, non-periodic variable snow cover areas increased significantly. This method takes into account the stability, continuity, and variability of snow cover, and better captures the characteristics and changes of snow cover across China. Based on our research, we found that snow disasters in ephemeral-type (belong to non-periodic variable snow cover) regions cannot be well prevented because of the unfixed snow cover timing. Therefore, we recommend that monitoring and forecasting of snow cover in these snow cover regions should be strengthened.

TI  - Experiencing Urban Green and Blue Spaces in Urban Wetlands as a Nature-Based Solution to Promote Positive Emotions
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Green and blue spaces are nature-based solutions (NBSs) that evoke positive emotions of experiencers therein. There is an impetus to optimize wetland forest landscapes by planning the geographical arrangement of metrics that promote positive emotion. The facial expressions of nature experiencers in photos, downloaded from social media databases with landscape metrics, were evaluated for emotions and given scores. Happy and sad scores were rated by FireFACE v1.0 software and positive response index (PRI) was calculated as happy score minus sad score. Spatial areas and tree height were evaluated from Landsat 8 images and digital model maps, respectively. Visitors at middle and senior ages smiled more frequently in southern parts than in northern parts, and females had higher happy scores and PRI than males. Both green- and blue-space areas had positive relationships with PRI scores, while blue spaces and their area to park area ratios had positive contributions to happy scores and PRI scores in multivariate linear regression models. Elevation had a negative relationship with positive facial emotion. Overall, based on spatial distributions of blue-space area and elevation, regional landscape was optimized so people perceived more happiness in wetlands around Zhejiang and Shanghai, while people in wetlands of Jiangxi and Hubei showed more net emotional expressions.

TI  - A satellite-measured view of aerosol component content and optical property in a haze-polluted case over North China Plain
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Directional Polarimetric Camera (DPC) is the first Chinese satellite-borne multi-angle polarimetric sensor onboard the GaoFen-5 (GF-5) satellite, which was launched on May 9th 2018. In this paper, we present the spatiotemporal variability of satellite-measured aerosol components (such as, black carbon, brown carbon, iron oxides contained in mineral dust etc.) over North China Plain (36-41?degrees N, 113-123?degrees E) for a heavily haze-polluted case, to demonstrate the first successful retrievals of aerosol component content and optical property directly from the DPC/GF-5 instrument measurements. We also reveal the relationship between absorbing/scattering component mass ratio and aerosol absorption based on the multi-angle polarimetric satellite measurements, which presents comparable agreement with previous laboratory studies and field studies for an indirect validation of aerosol component retrievals. In addition, the feasibility, stability and uncertainty of the aerosol optical property and component content retrievals from DPC multi-angle polarimetric observations were evaluated and assessed by sensitivity tests. The distributions of DPC/GF-5 aerosol optical depth (AOD) are in line with satellite observed MODIS (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) AOD and ground-based CARSNET (China Aerosol Remote Sensing Network) AOD products. Therefore, the multi-angle polarimetric satellite measurements show an encouraging potential for the comprehensive inversion of aerosol optical, microphysical and chemical properties. The results and further applications of this component algorithm in the future are helpful to reduce the uncertainty of climate change assessment by providing the measurements of aerosol component, in particular for black carbon, brown carbon, and iron oxides contained in dust, with large and extensive spatiotemporal scale.

TI  - Spatial autocorrelation in land use type and ecosystem service value in Hainan Tropical Rain Forest National Park
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - National parks promote the protection of the ecological environment and global biodiversity conservation. However, the changes in land use obviously damages the natural habitat, leading to habitat fragmentation and degradation. Land use changes affect ecosystem service value (ESV) and its spatial distribution. In this study, a framework for the assessment of regional spatial patterns in land use/cover changes (LUCC) and ESV was established; the framework relies on the application of a classical spatial autocorrelation model. Remote sensing data for Hainan Tropical Rain Forest National Park (HNTRFNP) were used as a test case for the autocorrelation model approach to analyzing spatial patterns in ESV. Across HNTRFNP, ESV averaged 6201.44 million USD, with high ESV seen in aquatic and forested areas. Furthermore, land use types in HNTRFNP showed spatial auto correlation (P < 0.05), though the extent varied among types. Forests and water exhibited the most aggregation. The ESV showed significant spatial autocorrelation (P < 0.05). High ESV clusters occurred in primary tropical rainforests (i.e., Bawangling, Jianfengling, Wuzhishan, and Yinggeling) and aquatic areas (i.e., Changhua river, Daguangba reservoir, Nandu river, Taiping reservoir, Xiaomei reservoir, and Wanquan river tributaries). Low ESV areas occurred in villages and surrounding farmlands. There was a negative correlation (P < 0.05) between land use intensity and ESV. In conclusion, to heighten the ESV of HNTRFNP, we should return farmlands to forest, carry out relocation projects in key areas, and construct migration corridors to expand key species habitat.

TI  - Pre-Launch Radiometric Calibration of Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder on FengYun-4B Satellite
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The geostationary interferometric infrared sounder (GIIRS) is a key payload on the geostationary FengYun-4B meteorological satellite of China. Because the GIIRS can measure atmospheric upwelling hyperspectral infrared radiance, it can be used to retrieve atmospheric temperature and humidity profiles and can also be applied to numerical weather prediction models. For the prediction of GIIRS' post-launch performance, a series of blackbody calibration experiments are performed before launch in a laboratory thermal vacuum tank in a ground laboratory to test the radiometric performances of the instrument, including sounder sensitivity, radiometric calibration accuracy, and dynamic observation range. The noise equivalent differential radiance (NEdR) in the long-wave infrared (LWIR) band is less than 0.5 mW/(m(2).sr.cm(-1)), and that in the mid-wave infrared (MWIR) band is less than 0.1 mW/(m(2).sr.cm(-1)). Both NEdRs meet the sensitivity design requirements. As for the radiometric calibration, the average calibration difference in the LWIR band is improved from 1 K to 0.2 K after the nonlinearity correction. In addition, in the observation range of 220-315 K, the calibration differences meet the design requirement of 0.7 K. The MWIR band is susceptible to noise when the instrument is used to observe low-temperature targets. Nevertheless, the calibration differences also meet the 0.7 K index requirement in the dynamic range of 260-315 K.

TI  - The variation of net primary productivity and underlying mechanisms vary under different drought stress in Central Asia from 1990 to 2020
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The variation in net primary productivity (NPP) and its controlling factors are crucial for understanding the mechanisms that maintain terrestrial ecosystem under ongoing climate and land cover change. However, such knowledge is still deficient in Central Asia where vegetation may be subjected to different drought stress. To achieve this goal, our study quantitatively explored the NPP variations and the mechanisms under different drought stress in Central Asia from 1990 to 2020 using Google Earth Engine with the Landsat datasets and environmental data. And a new method was introduced using NPP model to distinguish climate NPP (CNPP), and land cover NPP (LCNPP), affected by climate change, and land cover change, respectively. The results showed that vegetation productivity exhibited an increasing trend from 1990 to 2020, with the value of 473.61 Tg C and 522 Tg C in 1990 and 2020, respectively. The NPP in semi-arid, and dry sub-humid zones respectively increased by 12.94% and 33.78%, while NPP change in arid zones was not significant. The CNPP and LCNPP in Central Asia were -2.84x10(3) t C and 102.4x10(3) t C, respectively. In particular, land cover change significantly accumulated terrestrial productivity in the semi-arid zones, with the value of 66.44x10(3) t C. Climate conditions in arid and dry sub-humid zones respectively contributed 1.85x10(3) t C and 0.7x10(3) t C, but led to a decrease of 5.39x10(3) t C in dry sub-humid zones. NPP change in Central Asia was more sensitive to precipitation (R=0.72) than to temperature (R=-0.06) and solar radiation (R=-0.44). Additionally, the major limiting conditions in arid, and semi-arid zones both were precipitation, while the temperature was the key factor for vegetation growth in dry sub-humid ecosystems. In general, the impact of land cover change on vegetation productivity was higher than that of climate variations in Central Asia between 1990 and 2020.

TI  - Time-Lag Effect of Vegetation Response to Volumetric Soil Water Content: A Case Study of Guangdong Province, Southern China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The content of soil water affects the physiological activities of vegetation, and the type of vegetation also affects the soil water balance. It is of great significance to study the response of vegetation to soil moisture change, which is helpful for understanding the vulnerability of vegetation for regional and environmental protections. The response of vegetation to soil moisture in Guangdong Province from mid-October 2015 to the end of March 2017 was studied by using cloudy region drought index (CRDI) as the drought index and volumetric soil water content (VSWC) as the soil moisture index to measure the level of water stress on vegetation. Taking the peak and valley positions of CRDI and VSWC as characteristic points, the lag time of vegetation to volumetric soil water content was obtained by judging the difference between the peak and valley positions of the two indexes. The results indicate that the response of vegetation to volumetric soil water content in Guangdong lagged 3.33 periods (9-35 days) on average. When VSWC is sufficient, there is no obvious difference in time-lag between different types of vegetation. However, when VSWC is relatively insufficient, grass shows the fastest response to the change of volumetric soil water content. Both longitude and soil moisture affect the lag time of vegetation. Under the same conditions, the higher the soil humidity is, the longer the lag time is, and the longer the delay time is with the greater longitude. CRDI can reflect the time-lag effect between vegetation and VSWC in Guangdong, indicating it is a sensitive and applicable index for characterizing the time-lag phenomena of vegetation to soil moisture.

TI  - Inventory and Spatiotemporal Patterns of Glacial Lakes in the HKH-TMHA Region from 1990 to 2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Himalayan, Karakoram, and Hindu Kush (HKH-TMHA) are the three main mountain ranges in the high-mountain Asia region, covering the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). In this study, we identified glacial lakes in the HKH-TMHA region based on multitemporal Landsat images taken from 1990 to 2020. We analyzed the spatial distribution and evolution of glacial lakes in the HKH-TMHA region from the perspective of their elevation, size, and terrain aspect; then, we described their temporal changes. The results showed that approximately 84.56% of the glacial lakes (84.1% of the total lake area) were located at elevations between 4000 m and 5500 m, and glacial lakes with areas ranging from 0.01-0.5 km(2) accounted for approximately 95.21% of the number and 63.01% of the total area of glacial lakes. The number (38.64%) and area (58.83%) of south-facing glacial lakes were largest in HKH-TMHA and expanded significantly over time. There were 5835 (664.84 +/- 89.72 km(2)) glacial lakes in 1990; from 1990 to 2020, the number of glacial lakes in the HKH-TMHA region increased by 5974 (408.93 km(2)) in total; and the annual average increase in the area of glacial lakes reached 13.63 km(2) (11.15%). In 2020, the total number of glacial lake reached to 9673 (899.66 +/- 120.63 km(2)). In addition, most glacial lakes were located in the Eastern Himalayan, China, and the Indus Basin. Based on the precipitation and temperature analyses performed in our study area, we found inconsistent climate characteristics and changes in the three mountain ranges. In general, the daily precipitation (temperature) increased by 1.0766 mm (1.0311 degrees C), 0.8544 mm (0.8346 degrees C), and 0.8245 mm (-0.1042 degrees C) on the yearly, summer, and winter scales, respectively. Glacial melting and climate change are common contributors to glacial lake expansion. The investigation of glacial lakes in this region can provide basic supporting data for research on glacial lake-related disasters, land cover, and climate change in the high-mountain Asia region.

TI  - QUANTIZING GEOECONOMICS: EMERGING GEOECONOMICS IN INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC LAW THROUGH A QUANTUM WORLDVIEW
T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF WTO & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH LAW AND POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Geoeconomics captures anomalies in neoliberalism, represented by the resurgence of national security protection and regional competition in the global economic order since 2016. Yet, several aspects of geoeconomics have been criticized. Inspired by the recent developments in quantum theories in international relations, we aim to create a theoretical framework for the quantization of geoeconomics by using quantum measurement and holism at the analogical and ontological levels, respectively, to better conceptualize geoeconomics within the scope of international economic law. The article analyzes geoeconomics on the premise of a holographic ontology with features of the probabilities of wave functions, as evidenced by the practices of China and the US under cooperative and competitive geoeconomics. This work is the first attempt to "travel" quantum theories to international economic law. It calls for collective endeavors to transcend the limitations of a quantum worldview and develop new scholarships to expand the outreach of international law.

TI  - Methods of Sandy Land Detection in a Sparse-Vegetation Scene Based on the Fusion of HJ-2A Hyperspectral and GF-3 SAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate identification of sandy land plays an important role in sandy land prevention and control. It is difficult to identify the nature of sandy land due to vegetation covering the soil in the sandy area. Therefore, HJ-2A hyperspectral data and GF-3 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data were used as the main data sources in this article. The advantages of the spectral characteristics of a hyperspectral image and the penetration characteristics of SAR data were used synthetically to carry out mixed-pixel decomposition in the "horizontal" direction and polarization decomposition in the "vertical" direction. The results showed that in the study area of the Otingdag Sandy Land, in China, the accuracy of sandy land detection based on feature-level fusion and single GF-3 data was verified to be 92% in both cases by field data; the accuracy of sandy land detection based on feature-level fusion was verified to be 88.74% by the data collected from Google high-resolution imagery, which was higher than that based on single HJ-2A (74.17%) and single GF-3 data (88.08%). To further verify the universality of the feature-level fusion method for sandy land detection, Alxa sandy land was also used as a verification area and the accuracy of sandy land detection was verified to be as high as 88.74%. The method proposed in this paper made full use of the horizontal and vertical structural information of remote sensing data. The problem of mixed pixels in sparse-vegetation scenes in the horizontal direction and the problem of vegetation covering sandy soil in the vertical direction were both well solved. Accurate identification of sandy land can be realized effectively, which can provide technical support for sandy land prevention and control.

TI  - A Novel Method for Mapping Lake Bottom Topography Using the GSW Dataset and Measured Water Level
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake bottom topography is a basic parameter that reflects the elevation of all lake bottom geographical locations. In this study, a novel method was proposed for mapping lake bottom topography by combining the water occurrence map from the Global Surface Water (GSW) dataset with long-term measured water levels. This method took advantage of the following feature: the rapid change in water level of a lake's dynamic inundation area leads to a different water occurrence frequency and, therefore, put forward the concept of lake water level frequency, which refers to the frequency at which the water level is higher than or equal to a specified elevation. As water occurs more frequently in lake bottoms with lower elevations and less frequently in lake bottoms with higher elevations, we assume that lake water level frequency is identical to the water occurrence frequency over a long time. The water level frequency curve of all the measured water level data was generated through the P-III distribution function, and the elevation values from the water level frequency curve were assigned to pixels with the same frequency in the water occurrence map in order to generate the lake bottom topographic map. A case study was conducted on Poyang Lake in China to demonstrate the performance of the method. The derived bottom topographic map of Poyang Lake was verified by four measured sections. The results showed that the proposed method was feasible and could well reflect the bottom topography of Poyang Lake. The absolute error was mostly less than 0.5 m, the mean relative error was 7.4%, and the root mean square error was 0.99 m. The proposed method enriches the mapping means of lake bottom topography and has the potential to become a useful tool with a broad application prospect.

TI  - Sea Surface Skin Temperature Retrieval from FY-3C/VIRR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The visible and infrared scanning radiometer (VIRR) onboard the Fengyun-3C (FY-3C) meteorological satellite has 11 mu m and 12 mu m channels, which are capable of sea surface temperature (SST) observations. This study is based on atmospheric radiative transfer modeling (RTM) by applying Bayesian cloud detection theory and optimal estimation (OE) to obtain sea surface skin temperature (SSTskin) from VIRR in the Northwest Pacific. The inter-calibration of FY-3C/VIRR 11 mu m and 12 mu m brightness temperature (BT) is carried out using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) as the reference sensor. Bayesian cloud detection and OE SST retrieval with the calibration BT data is performed to obtain SSTskin. The SSTskin retrievals are compared with the buoy SST with a temporal window of 1 h and a spatial window of 0.01 degrees. The bias is -0.12 degrees C, and the standard deviation is 0.52 degrees C. Comparisons of the retrieved SSTskin with the AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) SSTskin from European Space Agency Sea Surface Temperature Climate Change Initiative (ESA SST CCI) project show the bias of 0.08 degrees C and the standard deviation of 0.55 degrees C. The results indicate that the VIRR SSTskin are consistent with AVHRR SSTskin and buoy SST.

TI  - Estimating Evapotranspiration over Heterogeneous Surface with Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 Data: A Case Study in Heihe River Basin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is an important part of surface-atmosphere interactions, connecting the transfer of matter and energy. Land surface heterogeneity is a natural attribute of the Earth's surface and is an inevitable problem in calculating ET with coarse resolution remote sensing data, which results in significant error in the ET estimation. This study aims to explore the effect and applicability of the evaporative fraction and area fraction (EFAF) method for correcting 1 km coarse resolution ET. In this study we use the input parameter upscaling (IPUS) algorithm to estimate energy fluxes and the EFAF method to correct ET estimates. Five ground stations in the midstream and downstream regions of the Heihe River Basin (HRB) were used to validate the latent heat flux (LE) calculated by the IPUS algorithm and EFAF method. The evaluation results show that the performance of the EFAF method is superior to that of the IPUS algorithm, with the coefficient of determination (R-2) increasing, the root mean square error (RMSE) decreasing, and the mean bias error (MBE) decreasing by 17 W/m(2) on average. In general, the EFAF method is suitable for correcting the deviation in LE estimated based on Sentinel data caused by land surface heterogeneity and can be applied to obtain accurate estimates of ET.

TI  - Estimation of Aerosol Optical Depth at 30 m Resolution Using Landsat Imagery and Machine Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Current remote sensing-based aerosol optical depth (AOD) products have coarse spatial resolutions, which are useful for studies at continental and global scales, but unsatisfactory for local scale applications, such as urban air pollution monitoring. In this study, we investigated the possibility of using Landsat imagery to develop high-resolution AOD estimations at 30 m based on machine learning algorithms. We assessed the performance of six machine learning algorithms, including Extreme Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Cascade Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Decision Trees, Extremely Randomized Trees, and Multiple Linear Regression. To obtain accurate AOD estimations, we used prior knowledge from multiple sources as inputs to the machine learning models, including the Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) albedo, the 1-km AOD product from MODIS data using the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm, and meteorological and surface elevation data. A total of 13,624 AOD measurements from Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sites were used for model training and validation. We found that all six algorithms exhibited good performance, with R-2 values ranging from 0.73 to 0.78 and AOD root-mean-square errors (RMSE) ranging from 0.089 to 0.098. The extremely randomized trees algorithm, however, demonstrated marginally superior performance as compared to the other algorithms; hence, it was used to produce AOD estimates at a 30 m resolution for one Landsat scene coving Beijing in 2013-2019. Through a comparison with overlapping AERONET observations, a high level of accuracy was achieved, with an R-2 = 0.889 and an RMSE = 0.156. Our method can be potentially used to generate a global high-resolution AOD dataset based on Landsat imagery.

T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to identify the relationship between changes in temperature regarding urbanization processes and seasonality in the city of Sao Paulo, located in the Tropic of Capricorn. The land surface temperature (LST) results were compared to official weather stations measurements, identifying in the spring-summer period 65.5% to 86.2% accuracy, while in the autumn-winter period, the results ranged from 58.6% to 93.1% accuracy, when considering the standard deviation and the temperature probe error. The mean MAE and mean RMSE range from 1.2 to 1.9 degrees C, with 83.0% of the values being <= 2.7 degrees C, and the coefficient of determination values are R = 0.81 in spring-summer and R = 0.82 in autumn-winter. Great thermal amplitude was estimated in the spring-summer season, with a difference in LST of the built-up space and rural area ranging from 5.8 and 11.5 degrees C, while in the autumn-winter season, the LST is more distributed through the city, with differences ranging from 4.4 to 8.5 degrees C. In addition, the current study suggests remote sensing as a reliable, cheap, and practical methodology to assist climate in order to support public policies and decision-making actions regarding environmental and urban planning.

TI  - Ecological Response of the Subsidy and Incentive System for Grassland Conservation in China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The overexploitation of Grasslands without any return-back and compensation is the major cause of degradation and deterioration of the grassland ecosystem. The Subsidy and Incentive System for Grassland Conservation (SISGC) in China aimed to restore grassland ecology by the reduction of overgrazing, promoting carrying capacity, and increasing alternative employment of herders in non-husbandry sectors. However, the ecological response to the SISGC still remains unclear on the national scale. Here, we used systematic sampling, and satellite image time series data revealed a widespread proliferation of major ecological indicators for grasslands, contrasting climate and actual net primary productivity (NPP) before (2004-2010) and after (2011-2017) the implementation of SISGC founded the contributions to policy, as simulated by the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford-Approach (CASA) model. On average, by two-phase comparison, the actual grassland NPP increased by 11.72%. The contribution of policy implementation and climate factors increased grassland NPP by up to 61.14% and 38.86%, respectively, but the response of the NPP growth of various grassland types exhibited divergence, mainly divided into policy-led (contribution rate of 52.28-97.02%) and climate-led (contribution rate of 57.56-96.00%). Hence, the SISGC policies should be renewed for different grassland types.

TI  - Using NOAA Satellite Imagery to Detect and Track Hazardous Sea Spray in the High Latitudes
T2  - WEATHER AND FORECASTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea spray presents a significant hazard to vessels in the high latitudes. At issue is the accumulation of ice, which can destabilize, and at times, sink a ship. Many studies have focused on icing prediction systems, but a knowledge gap exists in the detection of sea spray using remote sensing data. The recent availability of data from new and advanced imagers on board NOAA satellites, specifically the GOES-R series Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) and JPSS Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), offers new tools for the detection and tracking of sea spray for forecasters. While ABI provides superior temporal coverage in order to capture the near-real-time evolution of sea spray, VIIRS contributes higher spatial detail, allowing for improved analysis of sea spray extent, particularly within smaller bodies of water. Forecasters can implement these detection techniques to help verify sea spray-related forecast products, and to pass along potentially life-saving information to their mariner core partners. This paper discusses the freezing sea spray hazard, and introduces newly identified methods for detecting and tracking sea spray using NOAA satellite data.

Even though the polyphasic approach has facilitated Colletotrichum species identification, knowledge of the overall species diversity and host distribution is largely incomplete. To address this, we examined 952 Colletotrichum strains isolated from plants representing 322 species from 248 genera, or air and soil samples, from 87 locations in China, as well as 56 strains from Saudi Arabia, Thailand, Turkey, and the UK. Based on morphological characteristics and multi-locus phylogenetic analyses, the strains were assigned to 107 species, including 30 new species described in this paper and 18 new records for China. The currently most comprehensive backbone tree of Colletotrichum, comprising 16 species complexes (including a newly introduced C. bambusicola species complex) and 15 singleton species, is provided. Based on these analyses, 280 species with available molecular data are accepted in this genus, of which 139 have been reported in China, accounting for 49.6 % of the species. Colletotrichum siamense, C. karsti, C. fructicola, C. truncatum, C. fioriniae, and C. gloeosporioides were the most commonly detected species in China, as well as the species with the broadest host range. By contrast, 76 species were currently found to be associated with a single plant species or genus in China. To date, 33 Colletotrichum species have been exclusively reported as endophytes. Furthermore, we generated and assembled whole-genome sequences of the 30 new and a further 18 known species. The most comprehensive genome tree comprising 94 Colletotrichum species based on 1 893 single-copy orthologous genes was hence generated, with all nodes, except four, supported by 100 %bootstrap values. Collectively, this study represents the most comprehensive investigation of Colletotrichum diversity and host occurrence to date, and greatly enhances our understanding of the diversity and phylogenetic relationships in this genus.

TI  - Remotely Monitoring Vegetation Productivity in Two Contrasting Subtropical Forest Ecosystems Using Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Subtropical forests can sequester a larger amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) relative to other terrestrial ecosystems through photosynthetic activity and act as an important role in mitigating global climate warming. Compared with the model-based gross primary production (GPP) products, satellite-derived solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) opens a new window for quantification. Here, we used the remotely sensed SIF retrievals, two satellite-driven GPP products including MODIS (GPP(MOD)) and BESS (GPP(BESS)), and tower-based GPP measurements at two contrasting subtropical forests to provide a systematic analysis. Our results revealed that GPP and the associated environmental factors exhibited distinct seasonal patterns. However, the peak GPP values had large differences, with stronger GPP in the evergreen needleleaf forest site (8.76 +/- 0.71 g C m(-2) d(-1)) than that in the evergreen broadleaf forest site (5.71 +/- 0.31 g C m(-2) d(-1)). The satellite-derived SIF retrievals showed great potential in quantifying the variability in GPP, especially for the evergreen needleleaf forest with r reaching up to 0.909 (p < 0.01). GPP(MOD) and GPP(BESS) showed distinctly different performances for the two subtropical forests, whereas the GPP estimates by exclusive use of satellite-based SIF data promised well to the tower-based GPP observations. Multi-year evaluation again confirmed the good performance of the SIF-based GPP estimates. These findings will provide an alternative framework for quantifying the magnitude of forest GPP and advance our understanding of the carbon sequestration capacity of subtropical forest ecosystems.

TI  - Dynamic Prediction Method of 3D Spatial Information of Coal Mining Subsidence Water Area Integrated with Landsat Remote Sensing and Knothe Time Function
T2  - GEOFLUIDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Subsidence water disaster has become a major problem to the ecological environment because of the submerged villages, farmland destruction, and ecological destructive changes in the mining subsidence area of high-water level. Taking the 1031 working face of Wugou Coal Mine in Huaibei, Anhui, China, as the research subject, (1) a three-dimensional (3D) spatial information dynamic prediction method was proposed for high-water-level coal mining subsidence areas by combining the Knothe time function based on the probability integration method (PIM) and the principle of water balance. (2) The dynamic evolution law of the water accumulation area in the high-water-level coal mining subsidence area was studied. (3) The applicability of the dynamic prediction model of the water accumulation range in the high-water-level coal mining subsidence area was verified. The results showed that the dynamic prediction of the 3D spatial information of the high diving area is highly accurate and can be suitable for the dynamic prediction by comparison with the results of remote sensing monitoring and field measurement. As a result, technical reference and theoretical basis for the comprehensive assessment and remediation of the ecological environment of the high diving mining subsidence area were proposed.

TI  - Objective Detection of a Tropical Cyclone's Center Using Satellite Image Sequences in the Northwest Pacific
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - A tropical cyclone (TC) is one of the most destructive natural disasters that can cause heavy loss of life and property. Determining a TC's center is crucial to TC forecasting. It is difficult to locate the center of a TC during its formation stage and dissipation period. To address this problem, a novel objective algorithm called cloud motion wind (CMW) was proposed for detecting a TC's center using infrared (IR) image sequences from a geostationary meteorology satellite. First, the optical flow model with weighted median filtering was utilized to build a cloud motion wind field. Second, the density matrix method was used to calculate the center of the TC. FY-2E (Fengyun-2E geostationary meteorological satellites) IR images of three TCs in the Northwest Pacific, Halong, Rammasun and Haiyan were analyzed using the proposed algorithm. The present algorithm estimated the track with an averaged track error of around 41 km. Experimental results compared with the observed track that was given by the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) show that the proposed method provided accurate estimates of the cyclone center. The present algorithm has the potential to be employed to assist forecasters to detect the track of imminent TC.

TI  - Three-Dimensional Surface Displacements of the 8 January 2022 Mw6.7 Menyuan Earthquake, China from Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2 SAR Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The 8 January 2022 Mw6.7 Menyuan earthquake was generated in the transition zone between the western Lenglongling fault and the eastern Tuolaishan fault, both being part of the Qilian-Haiyuan fault system with an important role in the adjustment of the regional tectonic regime. In this study, four pairs of SAR (synthetic aperture radar) data from Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2 (Advanced Land Observation Satellite-2) satellites were used to derive the surface displacement observations along the satellite line-of-sight (LOS) and azimuth directions using the differential interferometric SAR (InSAR, DInSAR), pixel offset-tracking (POT), multiple aperture InSAR (MAI), and burst overlap InSAR (BOI) methods. An SM-VCE method (i.e., a method for measuring three-dimensional (3D) surface displacements with InSAR based on a strain model and variance component estimation) was employed to combine these derived SAR displacement observations to calculate the 3D co-seismic displacements. Results indicate that the 2022 Menyuan earthquake was dominated by left-lateral slip, and the maximum horizontal and vertical displacements were 1.9 m and 0.6 m, respectively. The relative horizontal surface displacement across the fault was as large as 2-3 m, and the fault-parallel displacement magnitude was larger on the southern side of the fault compared with the northern side. Furthermore, three co-seismic strain invariants were also investigated, revealing that the near-fault area suffered severe deformation, and two obviously expanding and compressed zones were identified. We provide displacements/strains derived in this study in the prevailing geotiff format, which will be useful for the broad community studying this earthquake; in addition, the SM-VCE code used in this study is open to the public so that readers can better understand the method.

TI  - Trend Analysis of Coverage Variation in <i>Pinus yunnanensis</i> Franch. Forests under the Influence of Pests and Abiotic Factors
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Yunnan pine (Pinus yunnanensis Franch.) is one of the primary forest vegetation types in Yunnan Province and has prominent economic value and ecological significance. Monitoring changes in Yunnan pine forests contributes to their health management. The normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) is an essential indicator for studying regional vegetation change. Landsat images were used to analyze the NDVI changes of Yunnan pine forests in rainy and dry seasons as well as the NDVI changes of Yunnan pine forests from 2009 to 2020. The results showed that the NDVI in Yunnan pine forests showed opposite trends in the rainy and dry seasons, with an increase in the rainy season and a decrease in the dry season. The areas of NDVI decline during the rainy season are mainly located at the edges of the forest area, with very few within the forest area. The main reason for the decline in NDVI within the forest area was pests. From 2009 to 2020, the areas where NDVI increased and decreased were 92.23% and 7.77% of the pine forests, respectively. The decreasing areas were mainly located at the edges of the pine forests, with sporadic distribution within the forest areas. The drought led to a significant decline in NDVI in the forest area in 2010 and 2013. Due to the lack of protective measures, the forest area in Xijiekou Town was severely infested with pests, with complex NDVI changes and strong fluctuations, and areas of severe pest infestation could be detected by NDVI imagery. This study is meaningful for forest protection and explores the potential capability of Landsat imagery for pest detection.

TI  - Evaluation of GOCI Remote Sensing Reflectance Spectral Quality Based on a Quality Assurance Score System in the Bohai Sea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the application of ocean color remote sensing, remote sensing reflectance spectral (R-rs(lambda)) is the most important and basic parameter for the development of bio-optical algorithms. Atmospheric correction of ocean color data is a key factor in obtaining accurate water R-rs(lambda) data. Based on the QA (quality assurance) score spectral quality evaluation system, the quality of R-rs(lambda) spectral of GOCI (Geostationary Ocean Color Imager) obtained from four atmospheric-correction algorithms in the Bohai Sea were evaluated and analyzed in this paper. The four atmospheric-correction algorithms are the NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) standard near-infrared atmospheric-correction algorithm (denoted as Seadas-Default), MUMM (Management Unit of the North Sea Mathematical Models, denoted as Seadas-MUMM), and the standard atmospheric-correction algorithms of KOSC GOCI GDPS2.0 (denoted as GDPS2.0) and GDPS1.3 (denoted as GDPS1.3). It is shown that over 90% of the R-rs(lambda) data are in good quality with a score >= 4/6 for the GDPS1.3 algorithm. The probability of R-rs(lambda) with a QA score of 1 is significantly higher for the GDPS1.3 algorithm (57.36%), compared with Seadas-Default (37.91%), Seadas-MUMM (35.96%), and GDPS2.0 (33.05%). The field and MODIS measurements of R-rs(lambda) were compared with simultaneous GOCI R-rs(lambda), and they demonstrate that the QA score system is useful in evaluating the spectral shape of R-rs(lambda). The comparison results indicate that higher QA scores have higher accuracy of the R-rs band ratio. The QA score system is helpful to develop and evaluate bio-optical algorithms based on the band ratio. The hourly variation of QA score from UTC 00:16 to 07:16 was investigated as well, and it demonstrates that the data quality of GOCI R-rs(lambda) can vary in an hour scale. The GOCI data with high quality should be selected with caution when studying the hourly variation of biogeochemical properties in the Bohai Sea from GOCI measurements.

TI  - From Regression Based on Dynamic Filter Network to Pansharpening by Pixel-Dependent Spatial-Detail Injection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Compared with hardware upgrading, pansharpening is a low-cost way to acquire high-quality images, which usually combines multispectral images (MS) in low spatial resolution with panchromatic images (PAN) in high spatial resolution. This paper proposes a pixel-dependent spatial-detail injection network (PDSDNet). Based on a dynamic filter network, PDSDNet constructs nonlinear mapping of the simulated panchromatic band from low-resolution multispectral bands through filtering convolution regression. PDSDNet reduces the possibility of spectral distortion and enriches spatial details by improving the similarity between the simulated panchromatic band and the real panchromatic band. Moreover, PDSDNet assumes that if an ideal multispectral image that has the same resolution with the panchromatic image exists, each band of it should have the same spatial details as in the panchromatic image. Thus, the details we fill into each multispectral band are the same and they can be extracted effectively in one pass. Experimental results demonstrate that PDSDNet can generate high-quality fusion images with multispectral images and panchromatic images. Compared with BDSD, MTF-GLP-HPM-PP, and PanNet, which are widely applied on IKONOS, QuickBird, and WorldView-3 datasets, pansharpened images of the proposed method have rich spatial details and present superior visual effects without noticeable spectral and spatial distortion.

TI  - Literary and dialect variants of the lexical-semantic field of "vred" (harm): comparative aspect
T2  - SIBIRSKII FILOLOGICHESKII ZHURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper compares the semantic structure and motivational characteristics of the lexical-semantic field of "vred" (harm) in the literary and dialectal Russian language. The analysis has shown the similarity of the conceptual basis for dividing the field into subfields in the literary language and dialects ("harm to the health of the subject," "harm to the material condition of the subject," "harm to the life of the subject and society (in general)"). The comparison of fields in terms of motivation revealed eight motivational models with different lexical representations in the literary language and dialects: three are widely represented in the Russian literary language and dialects, while five are much less productive. Absolute superiority in the quantitative realization of dialects compared with the literary language is observed in the motivational model "vred / vrednyy / vredit'" (harm / harmful / to harm), "a magical action, when the evil eye brings the subject into a painful, unnatural state," indicating the traces of the pagan (in the form of superstition) worldview of traditional culture bearers. Combining the synchronic approach analysis with the diachronic one allowed revealing the historical depth of the formation of the concept "harm" and definite stability in its modeling since the Proto-Slavonic period. With the historical variation of the conceptual basis for the division of the field into subfields in the literary language and dialects, the similarity identified indicates the general structure of the fragment in question of the linguistic picture of the world in the national consciousness.

TI  - Daytime F Region Echoes at Equatorial Ionization Anomaly Crest During Geomagnetic Quiet Period: Observations From Multi-Instruments
T2  - SPACE WEATHER-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - By using Qujing very high frequency radar (25.6 degrees N, 103.7 degrees E, magnetic latitude 16.1 degrees N, magnetic longitude 177.0 degrees E), daytime F region echoes were reported at equatorial ionization anomaly crest on 26 June 2020. Radar interferometry experiment was performed during the observation period. The observed results show that the spatial distributions of daytime F region echo pattern were about 150 km, 200 km, and 180 km in the zonal, meridional, and height extents, respectively. In addition, we observed a remarkable eastward drift of F region echoes with a mean velocity of about 50 m/s. To investigate the possible generation mechanism of daytime F region echoes, simultaneous occurrences of ionospheric disturbance and atmospheric gravity wave activities were presented by combining with the observations of ionosonde, global position system stations and FY-4A satellite. The existence of gravity wave from the deep convective activities in the lower atmosphere was confirmed by using FY-4A satellite measurements. The gravity wave signatures were also observed in the time series of virtual height deviations of sporadic E (dhE(S)) and total electron content near the region where the F region echoes. We surmise that ionospheric disturbance in the F region could be excited during atmospheric gravity wave activities. Then the large-scale ionospheric disturbance could further evolve into small-scale irregularity producing radar echoes through the non-linear cascade process.Plain Language Summary F region echoes associated with small-scale irregularity are generally observed during nighttime by very high frequency (VHF) radar. During daytime, some cases of F region echoes were reported for the past several decades. The possible reason of the daytime F region echoes generation is still unclear. By using Qujing VHF radar, we observed daytime F region echo phenomena at equatorial ionization anomaly crest. Simultaneous observations of ionospheric disturbance and atmospheric gravity wave activities revealed that daytime F region echoes could be excited by ionospheric disturbance during the strong atmospheric gravity wave activities. Our results provided the observational evidence of links among different ionospheric disturbance in the daytime region of China.

TI  - Deep Learning Segmentation of Satellite Imagery Identifies Aquatic Vegetation Associated with Snail Intermediate Hosts of Schistosomiasis in Senegal, Africa
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Schistosomiasis is a debilitating parasitic disease of poverty that affects more than 200 million people worldwide, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa, and is clearly associated with the construction of dams and water resource management infrastructure in tropical and subtropical areas. Changes to hydrology and salinity linked to water infrastructure development may create conditions favorable to the aquatic vegetation that is suitable habitat for the intermediate snail hosts of schistosome parasites. With thousands of small and large water reservoirs, irrigation canals, and dams developed or under construction in Africa, it is crucial to accurately assess the spatial distribution of high-risk environments that are habitat for freshwater snail intermediate hosts of schistosomiasis in rapidly changing ecosystems. Yet, standard techniques for monitoring snails are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and provide information limited to the small areas that can be manually sampled. Consequently, in low-income countries where schistosomiasis control is most needed, there are formidable challenges to identifying potential transmission hotspots for targeted medical and environmental interventions. In this study, we developed a new framework to map the spatial distribution of suitable snail habitat across large spatial scales in the Senegal River Basin by integrating satellite data, high-definition, low-cost drone imagery, and an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered computer vision technique called semantic segmentation. A deep learning model (U-Net) was built to automatically analyze high-resolution satellite imagery to produce segmentation maps of aquatic vegetation, with a fast and robust generalized prediction that proved more accurate than a more commonly used random forest approach. Accurate and up-to-date knowledge of areas at highest risk for disease transmission can increase the effectiveness of control interventions by targeting habitat of disease-carrying snails. With the deployment of this new framework, local governments or health actors might better target environmental interventions to where and when they are most needed in an integrated effort to reach the goal of schistosomiasis elimination.

TI  - Thermal-Based Remote Sensing Solution for Identifying Coastal Zones with Potential Groundwater Discharge
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Submarine Groundwater Discharge (SGD) is an essential process of the hydrological cycle by hydraulically connecting the land and sea. However, the occurrence, importance and effects of SGD remain largely underexplored. Here, we developed and validated a straightforward tool for mapping potential SGD areas in coastal ecosystems of Portugal. Our approach was based on the premise that relatively cooler groundwater discharging to warmer coastal waters manifests in the thermal band of satellite imagery acquired during the summer months. We then used Landsat 8 thermal infrared imagery (TIR) to derive sea surface temperature and standardized temperature anomalies maps. The results confirmed the capacity of TIR remote sensing for identifying SGD areas. The thermal analysis enabled us to acquire a useful visual-spatial correlation between the location of thermal anomalies and potentiometric surfaces of coastal aquifers. This way, over 20 potential SGD areas were identified. Our study makes an important contribute to our current SGD research status by developing a cost-efficient tool which can be used as a first level approach for large areas. Further investigation is needed to quantify the SGD and its potential effect in the receiving ecosystems, especially those located within environmentally protected areas.

TI  - Comparison of Two Rapid Assays for the Detection of <i>BRAF</i> V600 Mutations in Metastatic Melanoma including Positive Sentinel Lymph Nodes
T2  - DIAGNOSTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Testing for the BRAF mutation is mandatory for the management of patients with locally advanced or metastatic melanoma. Molecular analysis based on DNA sequencing remains the gold-standard method for the screening of the different BRAF mutations. These methods must be rapid, sensitive, and specific enough to allow optimal therapeutic management in daily practice and also to include patients in clinical trials. Here, we compared the Idylla BRAF Mutation Test and the anti-BRAF V600E (clone VE1) immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 90 melanoma samples, with a focus on a challenging cohort of 32 positive sentinel lymph nodes. The BRAF status was assessed with both methods independently of the percentage of tumor cells. The concordance rate was calculated excluding both non-contributory analyses and BRAF V600K/R/M mutants due to the specific V600E-IHC test design. The incidence of the BRAF V600E mutation was 33% with both BRAF Idylla and BRAF IHC. The agreement rate was 91% (72/79). Although the agreement rate was high, we suggest that the use of IHC is more suitable for rapid BRAF testing on sentinel lymph node biopsies when associated with a low percentage and scattered tumor cells, which gave a high risk of non-contributory analysis and/or false negative results with the Idylla (TM) BRAF Mutation Test.

TI  - Is It Possible to Assess Heatwave Impact on Grapevines at the Regional Level with Time Series of Satellite Images?
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Unexpected climatic conditions or extreme climatic events in vineyards are a worldwide problem that requires accurate spatial and temporal monitoring. Satellite-based remote sensing is an important source of data to assess this challenge in a climate-change context. This paper provides a first insight into the capacity of a multiway analysis method applied to Sentinel-2 time series to assess heatwave impacts in vineyards at a regional scale. Multi-way partial least squares (N-PLS) regression was used as a supervised technique to predict the intensity of damage caused to vineyards by the heatwave phenomenon that impacted the vineyards in the south of France in 2019. The model was developed based on available ground truth data of yield losses for 107 vineyard blocks in the Languedoc-Roussillon region and multispectral time-series predictor data for the period May to August 2019. The model showed a performance accuracy (R-2) of 0.56 in the calibration set and of 0.66 in the validation set, with a standard error of cross-validation in the calibration set of 12.4% and a standard error of the prediction of yield losses in the validation set of 10.7. The model was applied at a regional scale on 4978 vineyard blocks to predict yield losses using spectral and temporal attributes. The prediction of the yield loss due to heat stress at a regional scale was related to the spatial pattern of maximum temperatures recorded during the extreme weather event. This relation was confirmed by a chi-square test (p < 5%). The introduction of N-PLS insights into the analysis enables the characterisation of heat stress responses in vineyards and the identification of spectro-temporal profiles relevant for understanding the effects of heatwaves on vine blocks at a regional scale.

TI  - Land Surface Phenology Retrieval through Spectral and Angular Harmonization of Landsat-8, Sentinel-2 and Gaofen-1 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land Surface Phenology is an important characteristic of vegetation, which can be informative of its response to climate change. However, satellite-based identification of vegetation transition dates is hindered by inconsistencies in different observation platforms, including band settings, viewing angles, and scale effects. Therefore, time-series data with high consistency are necessary for monitoring vegetation phenology. This study proposes a data harmonization approach that involves band conversion and bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) correction to create normalized reflectance from Landsat-8, Sentinel-2A, and Gaofen-1 (GF-1) satellite data, characterized by the same spectral and illumination-viewing angles as the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Nadir BRDF Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR). The harmonized data are then subjected to the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM) to produce time-series data with high spatio-temporal resolution. Finally, the transition date of typical vegetation was estimated using regular 30 m spatial resolution data. The results show that the data harmonization method proposed in this study assists in improving the consistency of different observations under different viewing angles. The fusion result of STARFM was improved after eliminating differences in the input data, and the accuracy of the remote-sensing-based vegetation transition date was improved by the fused time-series curve with the input of harmonized data. The root mean square error (RMSE) estimation of the vegetation transition date decreased by 9.58 days. We concluded that data harmonization eliminates the viewing-angle effect and is essential for time-series vegetation monitoring through improved data fusion.

TI  - Postoperative management of vulvar cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - The primary treatment for resectable vulvar cancer includes wide local excision of the primary tumor and surgical lymph node assessment. Following surgery, up to 40-50% of patients develop a local recurrence. Historically, the strongest predictor of local recurrence is a positive or close margin (defined as <8 mm), although recent studies question the importance of margin status. Post-operative radiotherapy to the vulva is recommended for all women with a positive margin where re-excision is not possible. Radiotherapy may also be considered in the setting of risk factors for local recurrence: close margin, lymphovascular invasion, large tumor size, and/or depth of invasion >5 mm. Nodal assessment is an important component of vulvar cancer management. A negative sentinel node is associated with a low false-negative predictive value (2% in patients with vulvar tumor <4 cm in GOG 173), 2-year groin recurrence rate of 2.3%, and 3-year disease-specific survival rate of 97% in patients with unifocal vulvar tumor <4 cm in the GROningen INternational Study on Sentinel nodes in Vulvar Cancer (GROINSS-V I) study. Thus, patients with tumor size <4 cm (without additional local risk factors) and negative sentinel node can be observed. Patients with sentinel node metastasis <= 2 mm can be treated with post-operative radiotherapy (2-year isolated groin recurrence rate of 1.6% in GROINSS-V II), as a safe alternative to lymphadenectomy. Patients with sentinel node metastasis >2 mm following sentinel node biopsy should undergo inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy followed by post-operative radiotherapy-based on the GROINSS-V II study, the 2-year isolated groin recurrence rate remains unacceptably high (22%) with radiotherapy alone. Retrospective studies suggest that the addition of concurrent chemotherapy to radiotherapy may improve survival. The ongoing GROINSS-V III study is investigating concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy dose escalation. The main goal of these post-operative treatments is to reduce the risk of local, and especially groin, recurrences, which are almost universally fatal.

TI  - Structure of Sea Surface Temperature Anomaly Induced by Mesoscale Eddies in the North Pacific Ocean
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) induced by oceanic mesoscale eddies trigger mesoscale air-sea interactions and modulate large-scale climate systems. Yet, how eddies drive SSTAs has not been firmly established; particularly, the relative importance of lateral stirring and vertical pumping remains a debated issue. This study investigates characteristics and generation mechanisms of mesoscale eddy SSTAs in three eddy-enriched domains of the North Pacific Ocean: the Kuroshio Extension (KET), the Subtropical Countercurrent (STCC), and the North Equatorial Countercurrent (NECC). Analysis of satellite observational data reveals quasi-monopole eddy SSTAs in the KET and NECC and dipole-like eddy SSTAs in the STCC. By investigating spatial and seasonal variations and performing sensitivity experiments using an idealized model, we demonstrate that lateral stirring plays a more important role than vertical pumping in causing mesoscale eddy SSTAs. The eastward transport by the strong background current U-C (similar to 0.6 and similar to 0.4 m s(-1) in the KET and the NECC, respectively) and the westward eddy translation U-C (similar to-0.2 m s(-1) in the NECC) can dramatically modify the structure of SSTA. The pure stirring effect of eddy rotation velocities generates strong dipole-like SSTAs. Owing to the eastward U-C and the westward U-T, the western SSTA pole tends to approach the eddy center, while the eastern SSTA pole departs from the eddy and scatters along the eddy trajectory. These effects reduce the eddy SSTA amplitude and favor the emergence of quasi-monopole structure. This work provides a useful benchmark for model simulations of mesoscale SST variability and air-sea interaction.Plain Language Summary Mesoscale sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) of tens to hundreds of kilometers induced by oceanic eddies are one of the most striking features of satellite SST images. Yet, we still have no firm answer to the question as to how eddies drive SSTAs. Particularly, whether the eddy SSTAs are induced by lateral stirring or vertical pumping is unknown. Here, by analyzing satellite data, we identify both monopole-like (a single warming/cooling core within the eddy) and dipole-like (a pair of opposite-sign anomaly patches) eddy SSTAs in the North Pacific, and they are both intimately associated with the lateral stirring of eddies. We further demonstrate that the existence of eastward background current and westward movement of eddies are favorable for the generation of such quasi-monopole SSTAs. While the pure stirring effect of the eddy rotation produces dipole-like SSTAs, the eastward U c and the westward U T gradually push the western SSTA pole toward the eddy center and finally give rise to quasi-monopole SSTA structure. In addition to insights into the mechanisms, our work provides useful knowledge for the simulation of mesoscale SST variability and air-sea interaction by climate models.

TI  - Rheology of the Northern Tibetan Plateau Lithosphere Inferred from the Post-Seismic Deformation Resulting from the 2001 Mw 7.8 Kokoxili Earthquake
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Time-series observations from Sentinel-1 A/B InSAR spanning November 2014 to July 2021 were used to study the late post-seismic deformation velocity field arising from the Kokoxili earthquake. The deformation velocity caused by the interseismic slip along the major active faults in Tibet was first simulated. Comparing the simulated deformation velocity with the observed one, the maximum ratio of the simulated deformation velocity to the observed one was found to be 42%, indicating continuity in the viscoelastic relaxation caused by the 2001 Kokoxili earthquake. Subsequently, the rheological structure of the Kokoxili region was explored using a mixed model comprising the viscoelastic relaxation mechanism and the buried elastic dislocation model. The best estimated viscosities for the lower crust and upper mantle were eta(lc)=1(-0.44)(+0.78)x10(19) Pas and eta(um)=1(+0)(+0.78)x10(20) Pas, respectively. The results obtained in this study were compared with those of previous studies that used the early post-seismic displacement ranging from 0 to 6.5 years following the earthquake. The obtained value was largely the same as the previously estimated steady-state viscosity, which means that the viscosities of the viscoelastic layer beneath the Kokoxili regions have almost reached their stable state. Furthermore, the effective lower crustal viscosity of the Kokoxili region exhibited a logarithmic trend with time.

TI  - Applications of Radial Basis Functional Link Networks in the Exploration for Lala Copper Deposits in Sichuan Province, China
T2  - MINERALS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Lala copper area in Huili County, Sichuan Province, China, is favored by superior regional metallogenic geological conditions due to its location in an extremely important copper-iron metallogenic belt in southwest China, and it has witnessed the formation of a series of unique iron-copper deposits following the superposition of multiple tectonic events. In recent years, major mineral exploration breakthroughs have been achieved in the deep and peripheral zones of this area. Using the Lala copper mining area in Sichuan as an example, this paper describes metallogenic prediction research carried out based on multivariate geoscience information (geological information, geophysics, geochemistry, and remote sensing data) and the application of geographic information system (GIS) technology and the radial basis function neural network (RBFLN) model. The five specific aspects covered in this paper are as follows: (1) we collected geology-geophysics-geochemistry remote sensing data and other information, adopted GIS technology to extract multivariate geoscience ore-forming anomaly information, and established a geoscience prospecting information database; (2) we applied the RBFLN algorithm for information on integrated analysis of ore-forming anomalies in the study area; (3) we applied a statistical method to divide the threshold value to delineate favorable ore-prospecting target areas; (4) we applied three-dimensional (3D) visualization technology, through which sample assistance was verified, to evaluate the performance of the RBFLN model; and (5) the results revealed that the RBFLN model can integrate multivariate and multi-type geoscience information and effectively predict metallogenic prospective areas and delineate favorable target areas. The metallogenic prediction method based on RBFLN technology provides a scientific basis for the exploration and deployment of minerals in the study area. It is obvious that the methods to predict and evaluate mineral resources are developing towards model integration and information intelligent analysis.

TI  - Genomic analysis of group A Streptococcus isolated during a correctional facility outbreak of MRSA in 2004.
T2  - Journal of the Association of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Disease Canada = Journal officiel de l'Association pour la microbiologie medicale et l'infectiologie Canada
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2004-2005, an outbreak of impetigo occurred at a correctional facility during a sentinel outbreak of methicillin- resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in Alberta, Canada. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was used to characterize the group A Streptococcus (GAS) isolates and evaluate whether genomic biomarkers could distinguish between those recovered alone and those co-isolated with S. aureus.METHODS: Superficial wound swabs collected from all adults with impetigo during this outbreak were cultured using standard methods. NGS was used to characterize and compare all of the GAS and S. aureus genomes.RESULTS: Fifty-three adults were culture positive for GAS, with a subset of specimens also positive for MRSA (n = 5) or methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (n = 3). Seventeen additional MRSA isolates from this facility from the same time frame (no GAS co-isolates) were also included. All 78 bacterial genomes were analyzed for the presence of known virulence factors, plasmids, and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes. Among the GAS isolates were 12 emm types, the most common being 41.2 (n = 27; 51%). GAS genomes were phylogenetically compared with local and public datasets of invasive and non-invasive isolates. GAS genomes had diverse profiles for virulence factors, plasmids, and AMR genes. Pangenome analysis did not identify horizontally transferred genes in the co-infection versus single infections.CONCLUSIONS: GAS recovered from invasive and non-invasive sources were not genetically distinguishable. Virulence factors, plasmids, and AMR profiles grouped by emm type, and no genetic changes were identified that predict co-infection or horizontal gene transfer between GAS and S. aureus.
AB  - HISTORIQUE: En 2004-2005, une eclosion dimpetigo sest manifestee dans un etablissement correctionnel pendant une eclosion sentinelle de Staphylococcus aureus resistante a la methicilline (SRAM) en Alberta, au Canada. Le sequencage de prochaine generation (SPG) a ete utilise pour caracteriser les isolats du streptocoque du groupe (SGA) et evaluer si les biomarqueurs genomiques peuvent distinguer ceux qui se retablissent seuls de ceux qui ont co-isole le S. aureus.METHODOLOGIE: Les chercheurs ont mis en culture des ecouvillons de plaies cutanees superficielles preleves chez tous les adultes atteints dimpetigo pendant cette eclosion. Ils ont utilise le SNG pour caracteriser et comparer tous les genomes du SPG et du S. aureus recuperes.RESULTATS: Cinquante-trois adultes etaient positifs au SGA, un sous-groupe dechantillons etait egalement positif au SRAM (n = 5) ou au S. aureus (n = 3) sensible a la methicilline. Dix-sept autres isolats de SRAM provenant de cet etablissement pendant la meme periode (pas de co-isolats du SGA) ont ete inclus. Ils ont analyse lensemble des 78 genomes bacteriens pour deceler la presence de facteurs de virulence connus, de plasmides et de genes de resistance antimicrobienne (RAM). Parmi les isolats du SGA se trouvaient 12 types demm, les plus courants etant 41,2 (n = 27, 51 %). Les genomes du SGA ont ete compares sur le plan phylogenetique aux donnees locales et publiques sur les isolats invasifs et non invasifs. Les genomes du SGA presentaient divers profils de facteurs de virulence, de plasmides et de genes de RAM. Lanalyse du pangenome na pas permis de reperer les genes transferes dans les genomes de co-infection ou les adaptations genetiques associees a une co-infection plutot par rapport aux infections uniques.CONCLUSIONS: Le SGA preleve de sources invasives ou non invasives netait pas reconnaissable sur le plan genetique. Les facteurs de virulence, les plasmides et les profils de resistance antimicrobienne regroupes par type demm ne presentaient pas de changements genetiques predicteurs dune co- infection ou dun transfert genetique horizontal entre le SGA et le S. aureus.

TI  - Eastern Arctic Sea Ice Sensing: First Results from the RADARSAT Constellation Mission Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea ice monitoring plays a vital role in secure navigation and offshore activities. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has been widely used as an effective tool for sea ice remote sensing (e.g., ice type classification, concentration and thickness retrieval) for decades because it can collect data by day and night and in almost all weather conditions. The RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) is a new Canadian SAR mission providing several new services and data, with higher spatial coverage and temporal resolution than previous Radarsat missions. As a very deep convolutional neural network, Normalizer-Free ResNet (NFNet) was proposed by DeepMind in early 2021 and achieved a new state-of-the-art accuracy on the ImageNet dataset. In this paper, the RCM data are utilized for sea ice detection and classification using NFNet for the first time. HH, HV and the cross-polarization ratio are extracted from the dual-polarized RCM data with a medium resolution (50 m) for an NFNet-F0 model. Experimental results from Eastern Arctic show that destriping in the HV channel is necessary to improve the quality of sea ice classification. A two-level random forest (RF) classification model is also applied as a conventional technique for comparisons with NFNet. The sea ice concentration estimated based on the classification result from each region was validated with the corresponding polygon of the Canadian weekly regional ice chart. The overall classification accuracy confirms the superior capacity of the NFNet model over the RF model for sea ice monitoring and the sea ice sensing capacity of RCM.

TI  - Monitoring Irrigation Events and Crop Dynamics Using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Capturing and identifying field-based agricultural activities, such as the start, duration and end of irrigation, together with crop sowing/germination, growing period and time of harvest, offer informative metrics that can assist in precision agricultural activities in addition to broader water and food security monitoring efforts. While optically based band-ratios, such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI), have been used as descriptors for monitoring crop dynamics, data are not always available due to the influence of clouds and other atmospheric effects on optical sensors. Satellite-based microwave systems, such as the synthetic aperture radar (SAR), offer an all-weather advantage in monitoring soil and crop conditions. In this paper, we leverage the relative strengths of both optical- and microwave-based approaches by combining high resolution Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 optical imagery to monitor irrigation events and crop dynamics in a dryland agricultural landscape. A microwave backscatter model was used to analyze the responses of simulated backscatters to soil moisture, NDVI and NDWI (both are correlated with vegetation water content and can be regarded as vegetation descriptors), allowing an empirical relationship between these two platforms. A correlation analysis was also performed using Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 optical data over crops of maize, alfalfa, carrot and Rhodes grass in Al Kharj farm of Saudi Arabia to identify an appropriate SAR-based vegetation descriptor. The results illustrate the relationship between SAR and both NDVI and NDWI and demonstrated the relationship between the cross-polarization ratio (VH/VV) and the two optical indices. We explore the capacity of this multi-platform and multi-sensor approach to inform on the spatio-temporal dynamics of a range of agricultural activities, which can be used to facilitate field-based management decisions.

TI  - Quantitative Analysis of Land Subsidence and Its Effect on Vegetation in Xishan Coalfield of Shanxi Province
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - It is of great significance for the monitoring and protection of the original ecological environment in coal mining areas to identify the ground subsidence and quantify its influence on the surface vegetation. The surface deformation and vegetation information were obtained by using spaceborne SAR and Landsat OLI images in the Xishan Coalfield. The relative change rate, coefficient of variation, and trend analysis methods were used to compare the vegetation growth trends in the subsidence center, subsidence edge, and non-subsidence zones; and the vegetation coverage was predicted by the pixel dichotomy and grey model from 2021 to 2025. The results indicated that the proportions of vegetation with high fluctuation and serious degradation were 6.60% and 5.64% in the subsidence center, and its NDVI values were about 10% lower than that in the subsidence edge and non-subsidence zones. In addition, vegetation coverage showed a wedge ascending trend from 2013 to 2020, and the prediction values of vegetation coverage obtained by GM (1,1) model also revealed this trend. The residuals of the predicted values were 0.047, 0.047, and 0.019 compared with the vegetation coverage in 2021, and the vegetation coverage was the lowest in the subsidence center, which was consistent with the law obtained by using NDVI. Research suggested that ground subsidence caused by mining activities had a certain impact on the surface vegetation in the mining areas; the closer to the subsidence center, the greater the fluctuation of NDVI, and the stronger the vegetation degradation trend; conversely, the smaller the fluctuation, and the more stable the vegetation growth.

TI  - Mysticism and Theosophy in the Service of the Regime: Azharite Scholars and the Challenges to Religion-State Relations under Mubarak
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUFI STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Challenged by Salafi Islam, Sufism managed to reassert itself in Egypt by acquiring new roles in society while emphasizing commitment to the Sharia. This article explores the role played by the religious organs of the state in promoting Sufism under President Hosni Mubarak, in the context of growing challenges to religion-state relations during this period. Focusing on the thought of 'Ali Jum'a, the Grand Mufti of Egypt (200-2013), and the current Shaykh al-Azhar A.mad Muhammad Ahmad al-Tayyib, it also assesses the contribution of popular preachers, many of whom were graduates of al-Azhar, to this mystical discourse. The study aims to demonstrate that these popular preachers shared with the Azharite scholar some form of identification with theoretical mysticism, reflecting a broad inclination towards Sufism within Egyptian society.The Shaykh al-Azhar and the Grand Mufti sought to prove the compatibility between spirituality with its esoteric and introspective basis and Islamic law with its more worldly and structured dimension, by incorporating a theosophical debate within an apologetic exchange with Western thought. While this encounter with mysticism did not represent a new phenomenon, the novelty was in its political direction, in which a Sufi-oriented worldview became a tool to strengthen the regime's position in its struggle against Islamist movements. The regime's growing dependence on its religious institutions to counter the challenge of political Islam enhanced the bargaining-position of al-Azhar and Dar al-Ifta., providing them leverage to advance the path of Islam and mitigate the regime's secular orientation. While many popular preachers backed moderate Islamism, the religious officials of al-Azhar and Dar al-Ifta. relied on mysticism to support a highly supervised state-sponsored Islam. The reliance on the spiritual path to support diverse political trends demonstrates the all-encompassing and dynamic nature of theoretical mysticism as it was infused with rationalism, new knowledge, politics and a Sharia-based worldview.

AB  - Long-term follow-up data from multicenter phase III non-inferiority trials confirmed the safety of omission of axillary dissection in selected patients with clinically node-negative, sentinel node-positive breast cancer. Several ongoing trials investigate extended eligibility of the Z0011 protocol in the adjuvant setting. De-escalation of axillary surgery in patients with clinically node-positive breast cancer is currently limited to the neoadjuvant setting, where the sentinel procedure is used to determine nodal pathological complete response. Targeted axillary dissection lowers the false-negative rate of the sentinel procedure, which, however, is consistently associated with a very low risk of axillary recurrence in several recent single-center series. Axillary dissection remains standard care in patients with residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy while the results of Alliance A011202 are pending. The TAXIS trial investigates the role of tailored axillary surgery in patients with clinically node-positive breast cancer, a novel concept designed to selectively remove positive nodes in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant setting.

TI  - Assessment of ecological environment quality in Kolkata urban agglomeration, India
T2  - URBAN ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The global ecosystem has been significantly disrupted on various spatiotemporal scales over the last three decades due to human activities. Geospatial technology can quickly, effectively, and quantitatively to evaluate the spatiotemporal change of eco-environmental quality (EEQ). The present study is focused on novel approach of Remote Sensing based Ecological Index (RSEI), using Landsat Imagery data to assess environmental conditions and changes pattern. Four ecological indicators were prepared in the year 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020 of Kolkata urban agglomeration (KUA) to evaluate the ecological environmental condition. The principal component analysis (PCA) and spatial autocorrelation analysis can relate all indicators with each other's and RSEI. Out study indicated, greenness and wetness have a positive effect on EEQ of the province, but both dryness and heat have a negative effect. However, it should be noted that greenness has a greater impact on the eco-environment than the other three indicators. Based on the RSEI values, we have categorized the environmental standards of the study area into four groups-very good (0.81-1.00), good (0.61-0.80), acceptable (0.41-0.60), poor (0.21-0.40), and very poor (0.00-0.20), where high values indicate that environmental quality is stable and healthy for living organisms and low values indicate relatively unstable and threatening conditions of the environment. The status of RSEI showed that 9.02%, 12.29%, 12.79% and 37.23% of an area was under poor to very poor condition in the year of 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020 respectively. Good to very good condition of RSEI values was increased from 19.12% to 34.074% during 1990 to 2010, but declined of RSEI value 9.47% during 2010 to 2020 due to urban expansion. Here, Moran's I values fund that 0.265, 0.543, 0.396 and 0.367 in the year 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020 respectively. The result of Moran's I values indicate that clustering nature. The present study can helpful for the decision making of ecological management guided by planners and policy makers.

TI  - Estimation of Aufeis Resources in the Indigirka River Basin
T2  - RUSSIAN METEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - On the basis of corrected Landsat data for 2013-2017, a modern assessment of aufeis in the Indigirka River basin and its partial catchments with an area of 1830 to 305000 km(2) was conducted. The potential contribution of the aufeis flow to the formation of the water balance of rivers during various phases of hydrological regime was calculated. During the phase of the maximum development, the aufeis area of partial catchments ranges from 0.30 to 1.49%, reaching 0.54% of the total area of the Indigirka River basin. The aufeis resources (water content in aufeis) of the Indigirka River basin are 10.0 mm of the runoff level or in total 3.5 km(3). For individual rivers, the aufeis flow can reach 5-28 mm per year, which makes up 2.6 to 20.8% (an average is 8.1%) of river runoff. On average, water resources stored in aufeis make up 235% of the winter river flow (135% for the Indigirka River basin). The contribution of the aufeis flow during the spring flood can reach 39% and is 13.7% in the outlet of the Indigirka River basin. The ambiguous impact of climate change on aufeis (reducing their area and increasing their number) requires further detailed studies.

TI  - Examining the expansion of Urban Heat Island effect in the Kolkata Metropolitan Area and its vicinity using multi-temporal MODIS satellite data
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the Urban Heat Island (UHI) phenomena in the Kolkata Metropolitan Area (KMA) region and its surrounding rural areas based on MODIS satellite data of the last two decades (2001-19). The temporal land surface temperature (LST) has increased in both the KMA and its neighborhood, with this rate of increase being 2.5 times higher in the KMA as compared to its surroundings. Seasonally, the pre-monsoon period was the warmest, with an average LST of 32.0 degrees C, followed by the monsoon (30.5 degrees C), post-monsoon (28.6 degrees C) and winter (25.0 degrees C) periods, respectively. Especially during the pre-monsoon, the ambient high air and LSTs extenuate the UHI scenario, causing much discomfort to residents. The human health comfort map identified that the city's center and a 20 km buffer around it contained stressful health conditions, with about 90% of the heat island situated within this zone. The total amount of UHI growth was 44.65 sq.km, with an urban expansion of 28.74 sq.km and the highest UHI extent index (UHIEI) was identified in the WSW direction, with it being least towards SSE. High-rise buildings and population density has increased rapidly with concomitant decline in greenery during the study period, and therefore the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values are lower within the KMA but more enhanced in the surrounding rural areas. Spaces that enable quicker lowering of the LST are also more in areal extent in these surrounding rural areas. Practices of water roof and green roof wherever possible and planting of trees in available spaces within the city is urgently required to mitigate the UHI effect. This time series based study can guide future planning efforts towards decreasing the adverse effects of urbanization induced by heat islands and make possible an eco-friendly and sustainable urban development in this region.

TI  - Study on the Characteristics of Aerosol Radiative Forcing under Complex Pollution Conditions in Beijing
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol radiative effects usually have a heating effect on the atmosphere and a cooling effect on the surface, and they are also important uncertainty factors that cause climate change. Based on the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) and Aerosol Optical Properties Observation Network (AERONET), a study on the distribution characteristics of aerosol optical depth (AOD) in Beijing was developed, and a method to calculate the regional aerosol direct radiative forcing (ADRF) was improved. ADRF was calculated for Beijing by inputting aerosol optical parameters and surface parameters based on this method. The results show that the MODIS AOD and AERONET AOD both reached the correlation coefficient of 0.9 at 412 nm, 470 nm and 660 nm. Additionally, the correlation coefficient of ADRF as calculated by SBDART reached 0.8 through verification with AERONET ADRF. In addition, the ADRF of the atmosphere (ATM) under different degrees of pollution in Beijing was also calculated; the results indicate that the aerosol radiative effect becomes more obvious with higher pollution degrees. Finally, the interaction between the relevant factors (relative humidity, lower troposphere stability and wind speed) and the aerosol radiative effect was analyzed. Studies have found that the aerosol radiative effect influences the occurrence and continuation of pollution and provides a supporting basis for preventing the occurrence of pollution and predicting the climate.

T2  - Revista espanola de medicina nuclear e imagen molecular
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the effect of technical problems and patient characteristics on sentinel lymph node (SLN) scintigraphic detection and mapping success in early stages of endometrial cancer (EC).METHODS: Patients with clinical early stage EC (IA-IB) underwent SLN mapping using technetium-99m-nanocolloid, between September 2011 and February 2020 were included. There were excluded cases with technical problems, 92 patients were included for the analysis of the diagnostic performance and the relation of mapping failure (pelvic unilateral or not detected SLN) with patient (age, body mass index, previous pelvic disease or surgery) and disease characteristics (histology, grade, myometrial invasion, lymphovascular space infiltration, tumor size, and lymphatic infiltration risk).RESULTS: The overall detection rate was 79%. Lymph node metastases were diagnosed in 7 patients. Age (P = .01), depth of myometrial invasion ≥50% (P = .04) and high risk of lymphatic infiltration (P = .02) were positively associated with mapping failure. In multivariate analysis, age was significantly associated with mapping failure [odds ratio = 1.63, 95%CI: 1.06-2.50; P = .027].CONCLUSIONS: Age, depth of myometrial invasion and high risk of lymphatic infiltration were the factors associated with higher mapping failure. An individualized injection technique, optimizing the methodology, could minimize the detection failures.

TI  - Commercially Available Heart Rate Monitor Repurposed for Automatic Arrhythmia Detection with Snapshot Electrocardiographic Capability: A Pilot Validation
T2  - DIAGNOSTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The usefulness of opportunistic arrhythmia screening strategies, using an electrocardiogram (ECG) or other methods for random "snapshot" assessments is limited by the unexpected and occasional nature of arrhythmias, leading to a high rate of missed diagnosis. We have previously validated a cardiac monitoring system for AF detection pairing simple consumer-grade Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) heart rate (HR) sensors with a smartphone application (RITMIA (TM), Heart Sentinel srl, Italy). In the current study, we test a significant upgrade to the above-mentioned system, thanks to the technical capability of new HR sensors to run algorithms on the sensor itself and to acquire, and store on-board, single-lead ECG strips. We have reprogrammed an HR monitor intended for sports use (Movensense HR+) to run our proprietary RITMIA algorithm code in real-time, based on RR analysis, so that if any type of arrhythmia is detected, it triggers a brief retrospective recording of a single-lead ECG, providing tracings of the specific arrhythmia for later consultation. We report the initial data on the behavior, feasibility, and high diagnostic accuracy of this ultra-low weight customized device for standalone automatic arrhythmia detection and ECG recording, when several types of arrhythmias were simulated under different baseline conditions. Conclusions: The customized device was capable of detecting all types of simulated arrhythmias and correctly triggered a visually interpretable ECG tracing. Future human studies are needed to address real-life accuracy of this device.

TI  - Paranoid styles and innumeracy: implications of a conspiracy mindset on Europeans' misperceptions about immigrants
T2  - ITALIAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW-RIVISTA ITALIANA DI SCIENZA POLITICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Innumeracy, that is, the inability to deal with numbers and provide correct estimates about political issues, is reported to be widespread among the public. Yet, despite the recognition that a conspiracy mindset is an increasingly common phenomenon in Western democracies, this has not been considered as a potential correlate of innumeracy. Using data from an online sample of respondents across 10 European countries, we show that those with a higher propensity to hold a conspiracy worldview tend to overestimate the actual share of the immigrant population living in their own country. This association holds true when accounting for country heterogeneity and other cognitive, affective and socio-demographic factors. Employing a comparative design and refined measurements, the article contributes to our understanding of how a conspiracy mentality may influence perceptions of relevant political facts, questioning basic processes of democratic accountability.

TI  - Assessment of Urban Plantations Spatial-Temporal Structure
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ACCOUNTING AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial-temporal distribution of vegetation within an urban environment is known as "green space" and is a fundamental component of an urban environment. The study aims to assess the spatial-temporal structure of plantations in Ufa, including using satellite images. The studies covered urban forests, plantations of general use in Ufa. It has been determined that most of the Ufa urban forestry territory is occupied by deciduous plantations - 90.6% of the forested area, conifers - 4.2%. The plantations of Ufa's common areas in 2019 amounted to 1,236.5 hectares, of which parks prevail - 66.6%. The location of plantings of common areas in the city's districts is uneven: objects are most widespread in the Kirovsky district (37.7%). The correlation dependence between green spaces and the number of residents by administrative districts was r = 0.43 +/- 0.03. The increase in the area of plantations of common areas is confirmed by the analysis of the land area by types of Ufa's underlying surface for 1987-2018, carried out based on the calculation of the ARVI vegetation index based on Landsat-5 and Landsat-8 satellite images. A significant increase in the area occupied by tree and shrub vegetation + 10,875.2 hectares was revealed, with a reduction in the surface type "open soil" - -2,666.07 hectares and "without vegetation" - 1,393.83 hectares (t(calc). = -0.002; t(0.05tab). = 2.306). The transformation of the urban area over 30 years is due to increased green spaces in common areas and the construction of roads, buildings, and structures. (C) 2022 L&H Scientific Publishing, LLC.

TI  - Normalized Difference Enhanced Sand Index for desert sand dunes detection using Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 OLI data, application to the north of Figuig, Morocco
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper discusses developing a novel spectral index for desert sand dunes detection using four bands from Sentinel-2 data. This index, called Normalized Difference Enhanced Sand Index (NDESI), uses the blue band (492 nm), the red (664 nm) or the Vegetation Red Edge (VRE) band (782 nm), and two of the Shortwave Infrared (SWIR) bands (1613 and 2202 nm) to generate a grayscale image, where DN values are within-2 to 2. The lowest and highest values represent water bodies and sand dunes, respectively. A threshold calculation technique was used to generate a unique threshold for each image. This index application on several images covering the northern region of Figuig city seems to perfectly highlight sand dunes all over the image, with an overall accuracy of 97.9% and a kappa coefficient of 83.4%. This index is adapted for Landsat 8 data and can track sand dunes change over time.

TI  - A Proposed Satellite-Based Crop Insurance System for Smallholder Maize Farming
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop farming in Sub-Saharan Africa is constantly confronted by extreme weather events. Researchers have been striving to develop different tools that can be used to reduce the impacts of adverse weather on agriculture. Index-based crop insurance (IBCI) has emerged to be one of the tools that could potentially hedge farmers against weather-related risks. However, IBCI is still constrained by poor product design and basis risk. This study complements the efforts to improve IBCI design by evaluating the performances of the Tropical Applications of Meteorology using SATellite data and ground-based observations (TAMSAT) and Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) in estimating rainfall at different spatial scales over the maize-growing season in a smallholder farming area in South Africa. Results show that CHIRPS outperforms TAMSAT and produces better results at 20-day and monthly time steps. The study then uses CHIRPS and a crop water requirements (CWR) model to derive IBCI thresholds and an IBCI payout model. Results of CWR modeling show that this proposed IBCI system can cover the development, mid-season, and late-season stages of maize growth in the study area. The study then uses this information to calculate the weight, trigger, exit, and tick for each of these growth stages. Although this approach is premised on the prevailing conditions in the study area, it can be applied in other areas with different growing conditions to improve IBCI design.

TI  - Efficiency of Geospatial Technology and Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis for Groundwater Potential Mapping in a Semi-Arid Region
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing water demand in Egypt causes massive stress on groundwater resources. The high variability in the groundwater depth, aquifer properties, terrain characteristics, and shortage of rainfall make it necessary to identify the groundwater potentiality in semi-arid regions. This study used the possibilities of multi-criteria decision approaches (MCDA), geographical information system (GIS), and groundwater field data to delineate potential groundwater zones in the Tushka area, west of Lake Nasser, South Egypt. Furthermore, groundwater potentiality identification can help decision-makers better plan and manage the water resources in this promising area. Eight controlling factors were utilized to achieve the objective of the present work using multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) approaches, namely the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and frequency ratio (FR) models. The controlling parameters were integrated with the geographic information system (GIS) to develop the zones of groundwater potentialities. The results revealed that high and moderate-potential zones cover approximately 61% and 52% of the total area in the AHP and FR models, respectively. A total of 44 groundwater production wells along with the well yield were collected and used to validate the models. The results were evaluated using the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve. The best-performing prediction rates achieved by AHP and FR were 83% and 81%, respectively. Finally, the obtained results indicated that the AHP model achieved better performance than the FR model.

TI  - Application of a Cloud Removal Algorithm for Snow-Covered Areas from Daily MODIS Imagery over Andes Mountains
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover area is dramatically decreasing across the Los Andes Mountains and the most relevant water reservoir under drought conditions. In this sense, monitoring of snow cover is key to analyzing the hydrologic balance in snowmelt-driven basins. MODIS Snow Cover daily products (MOD10A1 and MYD10A1) allow snow cover to be monitored at regular time intervals and in large areas, although the images often are affected by cloud cover. The main objective of this technical note is to evaluate the application of an algorithm to remove cloud cover in MODIS snow cover imagery in the Chilean Andes mountains. To this end, the northern region of Chile (Pulido river basin) during the period between December 2015 and December 2016 was selected. Results were validated against meteorological data from a ground station. The cloud removal algorithm allowed the overall cloud cover to be reduced from 26.56% to 7.69% in the study area and a snow cover mapping overall accuracy of 86.66% to be obtained. Finally, this work allows new cloud-free snow cover imagery to be produced for long term analysis and hydrologic models, reducing the lack of data and improving the daily regional snow mapping.

TI  - Multispectral satellite imagery and machine learning for the extraction of shoreline indicators
T2  - COASTAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Analysis of shoreline change is fundamental to a broad range of investigations undertaken by coastal scientists, coastal engineers, and coastal managers. Multispectral Satellite Imagery (MSI) provides high resolution datasets that allow coastlines to be monitored more frequently and on a global scale. The Landsat and Sentinel-2 MSI datasets are free for public use, which has increased the frequency of studies focusing on coastal change using satellite imagery. However, despite access to global and free satellite imagery, a method has yet to be developed to monitor different shoreline types and indicators globally, as not all shorelines are sandy beaches, and the waterline cannot be representative of all shoreline changes. The review paper introduces different techniques used currently to extract shoreline features, including water indexing, Machine Learning (ML) and segmentation methods. We presented here a comprehensive review of range of the methods available for shoreline extraction from MSI and discuss why some shoreline features have been identified using multispectral satellite imagery and others not. This approach helps to signal where the gaps are on the current methods for shoreline extraction and provides a roadmap of the key challenges that prevents MSI to be used for understanding shoreline changes at a global scale.

TI  - Management of early stage HER2 positive breast cancer and increased implementation of axillary imaging to improve identification of nodal metastasis
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objectives Given the significant benefit of targeted therapies for HER2+ breast cancer patients in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings, it is critical to identify all eligible patients for these treatments. We sought to investigate cT1cN0 HER2+ patients to determine the rate of postsurgical nodal positivity, and to identify presurgical factors associated with nodal positivity. We hypothesize there is a subset of underdiagnosed HER2+ patients who would benefit from preoperative axillary imaging and inclusion in neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens. Methods We performed a 10-year retrospective analysis of T1 HER2+ breast cancer patients. Clinicopathologic characteristics were evaluated based on surgical nodal data. Results We identified 38 patients with cT1cN0 HER2+ cancer. Of this cohort, 24% had positive lymph nodes on final pathology. High tumor grade (p = 0.035) on core needle biopsy and the presence of lymphovascular invasion (p = 0.0036) were associated with an increased likelihood of lymph node positivity. The majority (66%) of lymph node positive patients were clinically T1c. Conclusions We identified a 24% nodal positivity rate in clinically node negative T1 HER2+ breast cancer patients. In particular, HER2+ patients with high-grade T1c cancers should undergo preoperative diagnostic axillary imaging to expand potential benefit from targeted therapies.

TI  - The Bestiary in the Candy Aisle A Framework for Nature in Unexpected Places
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL HUMANITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Archaeology and anthropology treat the presence of animals in mythology and folklore as axiomatically about a culture's ideas of nature. Sociology often assumes modernity no longer has such myths, but animal imagery abounds. In this article, the authors argue that our relationships with animals and nature are not primarily rational or scientific but formed through these images and the mythologies that come with them. The authors call these images "modern bestiaries" in reference to the medieval proto-encyclopedias that cataloged animals for moral instruction. Modern bestiaries (including alphabet books, sports teams, and car names, among others) generate a holistic worldview that marries a deep love of animals and "nature" to a fundamentally anti-ecological cosmology. The authors examine a particular modern bestiary-the menagerie of gummi animals in the candy aisle. Eating a gummi bear is never merely gastronomic but also an act of mimesis, sympathetic magic, and storytelling in which cultural relationships to animals are formed.

TI  - Complex hydrological knowledge to support digital soil mapping
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Drainage network (DN) is the representation of all the stream channels developed over the landscape. The morphometry of DN describes the relationship between channel characteristics and basin geometry, which is regulated by a series of processes, such as weathering, geomorphology, sediment erosion/deposition. The interaction between these factors impacts soil formation, resulting in a relationship between DN morphometry and soil characteristics. Unstable surfaces produced shallow soils, enhancing surface runoff and high drainage density, while stable landscapes favor vertical infiltration through old and weathered soils. Digital soil mapping has benefited from multiple environmental variables, such as relief and satellite data, but DN information can offer great contributions for the prediction of soil attributes. In this work, we applied a set of complex DN variables to perform digital maps of clay, sand, and soil organic carbon (SOC), for a 1378 km2 site in the Sa similar to o Paulo state, Brazil. We analyzed the relationship between the drainage density (DD), drainage frequency (DF), channel sinuosity, and confluence angle with soil classes and attributes. The Cubist and Random Forest algorithms were tested to predict the soil information, and to evaluate the impact of the new hydrological variables. The results showed that landscapes predominated by clayey soils favor surface runoff and increase channel formation, with higher channel sinuosity and acute confluence angles. These new drainage variables contributed 35 to 55% for SOC prediction. DD and DF were the most important drainage variables on the models, ranging from 65 to 70%. The external validation reached R2 of 0.72 and 0.56 for the prediction of clay and sand, respectively. The impact of DN information on the model performance suggests that more work is needed to better explore and understand the relationship between DN and soil information.

TI  - Sentinel Surveys 1995-2020-Catch rates and biological information on Atlantic Cod (Gadus morhua) in NAFO Subdivision 3Ps.
T2  - Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat Research Document
M3  - Article
AB  - Catch rates and biological information for Atlantic Cod from the Sentinel survey Program in the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) Subdivision 3Ps are updated for 2019, and preliminary results presented for 2020. Temporal trends in gillnet (small 31/4 inch mesh, large 51/2 inch mesh) and linetrawl unstandardized catch rates were similar for all gears, with the highest values at the beginning of each time-series, sharp declines after 1997, and oscillations around or below the series' mean catch rate thereafter. Age-disaggregated standardized catch rates for recent year-classes were generally weaker than those in the past. Age-aggregated catch rates were higher at the beginning of each time-series for both gears, declined over the mid-to-late 1990s, then remained at their lowest levels; decreasing below the series' mean of 6.4 fish/net (large mesh gillnet) in 1999, and 86 fish/1,000 hooks in 2009 (linetrawl). Gillnet and linetrawl catch rates for 2019 were 3.4 fish/net and 92 fish/1000 hooks (control sites), and 2.5 fish/net and 114 fish/net (experimental sites), respectively. Length frequencies of Atlantic Cod measured in Sentinel surveys indicated that the small mesh gillnet was the least selective gear (retaining small and large fish from multiple length-classes), whereas large mesh gillnet and linetrawl captured larger fish in specific size ranges and few overlapping length-classes. Fish lengths from small mesh gillnet showed several modes ranging between 37-43 cm and 53-60 cm throughout the time-series, while those of fish from large mesh gillnet and linetrawl ranged between 60-68 cm and 42-61 cm, respectively. Indices describing the physiological condition of Atlantic Cod varied at both seasonal and annual scales. Total annual removals of Atlantic Cod by Sentinel harvesters peaked at 38 t (2001), then declined to a minimum of 9.9 t (2016), prior to increasing to 14.3 tin 2019. At least 15 fish species have been recorded as Sentinel bycatch over 2005-19, with American Plaice and Redfish been the most common in gillnet and linetrawl, respectively.

TI  - Dust Radiative Effect Characteristics during a Typical Springtime Dust Storm with Persistent Floating Dust in the Tarim Basin, Northwest China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A special topography and ultra-high atmospheric boundary layer conditions in the Tarim Basin (TB) lead to the unique spatial-temporal distribution characteristics of dust aerosols. A typical dust storm with persistent floating dust over the TB from 27 April to 1 May 2015 was used to investigate the characteristics of the dust radiative effect using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem). Based on reasonable evaluations involving in situ sounding observations, as well as remotely sensed MODIS observations of meteorology, dust aerosols, and the ultra-high atmospheric boundary layer, the simulation characterized the complete characteristics of the dust direct radiative effect (DDRE) during the dust storm outbreak stage and persistent floating dust stage over the TB. During the daytime, the shortwave (SW) radiative effect heated the atmosphere and cooled the land surface (SUR), whereas the longwave (LW) radiative effect had the opposite effect on the TB. Regarding low-level dust, the LW radiative effect was greater than the SW DDRE in the atmosphere, while for high-level dust the situation was reversed. During the nighttime, the LW DDRE at the top of the atmosphere (TOA), at the SUR, and in the atmosphere was less than that during the daytime, when the DDRE at the SUR was the most significant. In contrast to the daytime, the near-surface dust aerosols exerted an LW warming effect in the atmosphere during the nighttime; however, the dust LW radiative effect had a cooling effect from above a 100 m altitude until the top of the dust layer. In contrast, the DDRE heating rate peaked at the top of the dust layer within the TB. The event-averaged net DDRE was 0.53, -5.90, and 6.43 W m(-2) at the TOA, at the SUR, and in the atmosphere over the TB, respectively. The dust SW radiative effect was stronger than the dust L4W radiative effect over the TB at the SUR and in the atmosphere. Moreover, the DDRE at the TOA was weaker than that at the SUR. Overall, the study revealed noteworthy radiative effect features of dust aerosols during typical dust storms with persistent floating dust over the TB.

TI  - Time Series Surface Deformation of Changbaishan Volcano Based on Sentinel-1B SAR Data and Its Geological Significance
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the surface deformation is of great significance, in order to explore the activity and geophysical features of the underground deep pressure source in the volcanic regions. In this study, the time series surface deformation of the Changbaishan volcano is retrieved via Sentinel-1B SAR data, using the SBAS-InSAR method. The main results are as follows. (1) The mean surface deformation velocity in the Changbaishan volcano is uplifted as a whole, while the uplift is locally distributed, which shows a strong correlation with faults. (2) The time series surface deformation of the Changbaishan volcano indicates an apparently seasonal change. (3) The cumulative surface deformation shows a strong correlation with the maximal magnitude and number of annual earthquakes, and it is likely dominated by the maximal magnitude of the annual earthquakes. (4) The single Mogi source model is appropriate to evaluate the deep pressure source in the Changbaishan volcano, constrained by the calculated surface deformation. The optimal estimated depth of the magma chamber is about 6.2 km, and the volume is increased by about 3.2 x 10(6) m(3). According to the time series surface deformation, it is concluded that the tectonic activity and faults, related to the deep pressure source, are pretty active in the Changbaishan volcano.

TI  - Climatic, Decadal, and Interannual Variability in the Upper Layer of the Mediterranean Sea Using Remotely Sensed and In-Situ Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mediterranean Sea is considered a hot spot of global warming because it has been changing faster than the global ocean, creating a strong impact on the marine environment. Recent studies agree on the increase in the sea level, in the sea surface temperature, and in the sea surface salinity in the Mediterranean Sea over the last two decades. In this research, the possible interconnection between these and other parameters that contribute to the regulatory effect of the sea on the climate are identified and discussed. Spatio-temporal variability of four oceanographic and air-sea interaction parameters (sea-level, sea surface temperature, sea surface salinity, and freshwater flux) are estimated over the last 27 years by performing the empirical orthogonal function analysis. Climatic trends, and interannual and decadal variability of the different datasets are delineated and described in the whole Mediterranean and in its sub-basins. On the climatic scale, the Mediterranean and its sub-basins behave in a coherent way, showing the seal level, temperature, salinity, and freshwater flux rise. On the interannual scale, the temporal evolution of the sea level and sea surface temperature are highly correlated, whereas freshwater flux affects the variability of sea level, temperature, and the salinity field mainly in the Western and Central Mediterranean. The decadal signal associated with the Northern Ionian Gyre circulation reversals is clearly identified in three of the four parameters considered, with different intensities and geographical extents. This signal also affects the intermediate layer of the Eastern Mediterranean, from where it is advected to the other sub-basins. Decadal signal not associated with the Northern Ionian Gyre reversals is strongly related to the variability of main sub-basin scale local structures.

TI  - Applying Machine Learning and Time-Series Analysis on Sentinel-1A SAR/InSAR for Characterizing Arctic Tundra Hydro-Ecological Conditions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a widely used tool for Earth observation activities. It is particularly effective during times of persistent cloud cover, low light conditions, or where in situ measurements are challenging. The intensity measured by a polarimetric SAR has proven effective for characterizing Arctic tundra landscapes due to the unique backscattering signatures associated with different cover types. However, recently, there has been increased interest in exploiting novel interferometric SAR (InSAR) techniques that rely on both the amplitude and absolute phase of a pair of acquisitions to produce coherence measurements, although the simultaneous use of both intensity and interferometric coherence in Arctic tundra image classification has not been widely tested. In this study, a time series of dual-polarimetric (VV, VH) Sentinel-1 SAR/InSAR data collected over one growing season, in addition to a digital elevation model (DEM), was used to characterize an Arctic tundra study site spanning a hydrologically dynamic coastal delta, open tundra, and high topographic relief from mountainous terrain. SAR intensity and coherence patterns based on repeat-pass interferometry were analyzed in terms of ecological structure (i.e., graminoid, or woody) and hydrology (i.e., wet, or dry) using machine learning methods. Six hydro-ecological cover types were delineated using time-series statistical descriptors (i.e., mean, standard deviation, etc.) as model inputs. Model evaluations indicated SAR intensity to have better predictive power than coherence, especially for wet landcover classes due to temporal decorrelation. However, accuracies improved when both intensity and coherence were used, highlighting the complementarity of these two measures. Combining time-series SAR/InSAR data with terrain derivatives resulted in the highest per-class F1 score values, ranging from 0.682 to 0.955. The developed methodology is independent of atmospheric conditions (i.e., cloud cover or sunlight) as it does not rely on optical information, and thus can be regularly updated over forthcoming seasons or annually to support ecosystem monitoring.

TI  - Multi-Temporal Analysis of Changes of the Southern Part of the Baltic Sea Coast Using Aerial Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding processes that affect changes in the coastal zone and the ability to predict these processes in the future depends on the period for which detailed monitoring is carried out and on the type of coast. This paper analyzes a southern fragment of the Baltic coast (30 km), where there has been no anthropogenic impact (Slowinski National Park). The study was carried out covering a time interval of 65 years. Historic and current aerial photographs (orthophotomaps) from the following years: 1951, 1964, 1975, 1984, 1995, 2004, and 2016 were used. Changes in the position of the foredune toe line (FTL) in each years' images were used. For each time interval (1951-1964, 1964-1975, 1975-1984, 1984-1995, 1995-2004, 2004-2016), the coastal area over which morphodynamic processes (erosion and accumulation) took place was calculated. The calculated RL (reference line)-FTL positions allowed us to determine differences in the shoreline course in subsequent years and to determine the extent of shifts/changes of the coastline in each time period. The study results showed an equilibrium between the processes of accumulation and erosion, proving that the development of the studied natural coastline is balanced. There was only a change in the trend of the characteristics of changes from erosive into accumulative ones and vice versa. Moreover, along the studied coast section, a certain periodicity in the coastline changes can be observed. The intervals where predominant erosion occurs alternate with those when accumulation prevails, and then the cycle repeats. The analysis of historic/current aerial images and orthophotomaps from 1951-2016 indicated that strong storms have a significant impact on the magnitude of change (accumulation/erosion) and the formation of the studied coastline.

TI  - Estimation of Parameters of Biomass State of Sowing Spring Wheat
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this work is to present a new method for estimating the parameters of the biomass of agricultural crops based on Earth remote sensing (ERS) data. The method includes mathematical models and algorithms estimation and has been tested on the example of spring wheat sowing. Sowing biomass parameters are the basis for making management decisions aimed at obtaining a given crop yield. Currently, for these purposes, vegetation indices are most widely used. It is impossible to estimate the physical parameters of the crop sowing biomass using these indices, due to their scalar form and lack of dimension. The paper develops a classical approach to the problem of estimating the parameters of the state of agricultural crops, in which remote sensing data are considered as an indirect measurement of the estimated parameters. The basis for the implementation of the estimation method is the dynamic model of biomass parameters and the remote sensing model, which reflects the relationship between the spectral reflection parameters and the estimated parameters of the crop biomass. The parameters of the dynamic model and the remote sensing model are refined by selective ground measurements in separate elementary sections of the field. The difference between this article and previous works of a similar nature lies in the fact that agricultural crops with a more complex morphological structure are considered as the object of evaluation. In addition, such an important feature of agricultural objects as their spatial distribution is considered here. To take it into account, a new type of mathematical models is used, in which spatial coordinates are introduced. Due to the significant complication of modeling and estimation algorithms based on such models, simpler approximation schemes are proposed. The advantage of the proposed approach is that the assessment is considered as a dynamic process that meets the content of the task of monitoring crops.

TI  - Laser tracking leader-follower automatic cooperative navigation system for UAVs
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, small payload and short endurance are the main problems of a single UAV in agricultural applications, especially in large-scale farmland. It is one of the important methods to solve the above problems of UAVs by improving operation efficiency through multi-UAV cooperative navigation. This study proposed a laser tracking leader-follower automatic cooperative navigation system for multi-UAVs. The leader in the cluster fires a laser beam to irradiate the follower, and the follower performs a visual tracking flight according to the light spot at the relative position of the laser tracking device. Based on the existing kernel correlation filter (KCF) tracking algorithm, an improved KCF real-time spot tracking method was proposed. Compared with the traditional KCF tracking algorithm, the recognition and tracking rate of the optimized algorithm was increased from 70% to 95% in indoor environment, and was increased from 20% to 90% in outdoor environment. The navigation control method was studied from two aspects: the distance coordinate transformation model based on micro-gyroscope and navigation control strategy. The error of spot position was reduced from the maximum (3.12, -3.66) cm to (0.14, 0.12) cm by correcting the deviation distance of the spot at different angles through a coordinate correction algorithm. An image coordinate conversion model was established for a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) camera and laser receiving device at different mounting distances. The laser receiving device was divided into four regions, S0-S3, and the speed of the four regions is calculated using an uncontrollable discrete Kalman filter. The outdoor flight experiments of two UAVs were carried out outdoors using this system. The experiment results show that the average flight error of the two UAVs on the X-axis is 5.2 cm, and the coefficient of variation is 0.0181. The average flight error on the Z-axis is 7.3 cm, and the coefficient of variation is 0.0414. This study demonstrated the possibility and adaptability of the developed system to achieve multi-UAVs cooperative navigation.

TI  - Can statistical remote sensing aid in predicting the potential productivity of inland lakes? Case study: Lake Qaroun, Egypt
T2  - STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed at creating a sustainable and inexpensive Landsat-based electrical conductivity model that can easily notify fisheries managers of changes in electrical conductivity and hence the potential fish yield of Lake Qaroun in Egypt. The study integrated geospatial technology, field measurements, mathematical computations, and fish yield empirical model into the adopted methodology. Seventeen sampling sites covering the entire study area were selected to measure the electrical conductivity (EC; mS/cm) and water depths (D; m) of Lake Qaroun, Egypt, during November 2018. Spatial analysis tools within ArcGIS were used to extract EC data from non-surveyed sites. A high-resolution Sentinel-2B MSI and a cloud-free medium-resolution Landsat-8 OLI scenes for Lake Qaroun were used for morphometric and regression analyses, respectively. For regression, 75% of the dataset was used to build up the regression model, while the remaining 25% was used for validation. The study selected Landsat band ratios that correlated with the highest certainty (R > 0.80) with the examined EC. Stepwise regression model was then developed to predict EC from Landsat-8 data. In choosing the best regression model, the study selected the significant model (P < 0.05) with the highest coefficient of determination (R-2) and the least error metrics. Finally, the developed model was applied in calculating the potential yield of Lake Qaroun. The innovative EC model derived in the current study using Landsat-8 OLI for Lake Qaroun showed a very good performance in estimating 95% of EC values significantly with high acceptable accuracy. In closure, the model can be used very efficiently as a decision support tool in assisting managers not only in monitoring the lake's electrical conductivity regularly, during the month of November, but also in making preliminary estimates of the lake's potential yield.

TI  - A Satellite Data Mining Approach Based on Self-Organized Maps for the Early Warning of Ground Settlements in Urban Areas
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Featured Application The proposed method is a neural-network-based tool for the early warning of ground settlement hazard in urban areas. On the basis of the analysis of MT-InSAR data through an unsupervised learning, the method can find precursors of similar time-evolving phenomena. The method can be applied under different warning criteria and for different hyper-parameters of the monitoring system. Structural failure prevention is a crucial issue in civil engineering. The causes of structure or infrastructure collapse include phenomena that slowly deform the ground and could affect the stability of foundations such as differential settlements, subsidence, groundwater changes, slope failure, or landslides. When large urban areas need to be monitored, such phenomena are hard to be mapped by means of classical structural health monitoring methods due to the unaffordable quantity of in situ measurements these methods would entail. A very effective alternative is exploiting multitemporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MT-InSAR) displacement timeseries which would enable the monitoring of wide geographical areas over a weekly basis and extended spatial coverage. Analyzing the enormous amount of data produced by MT-InSAR may help to assess the time evolution of phenomena but can barely highlight "anomalous" ground deformations in time, to prevent likely structural failure. This paper proposes a method which analyzes the InSAR data through an unsupervised learning paradigm with the purpose of detecting critical events at their early stage. On the basis of similarities among time sequences, this method allows the finding of precursors of anomalous ground settlement behaviors, the correct framing of which should be directed to specialist evaluation and in situ inspections.

TI  - Tropospheric NO<sub>2</sub>: Explorative analyses of spatial variability and impact factors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to study spatial patterns of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and its impact factors, consistent and area-wide information is essential. With TROPOMI aboard Sentinel-5 Precursor (S-5P), daily tropospheric NO2 observations have become available with an unprecedented spatial resolution of 3.5 km x 5.5 km. However, a systematic study of tropospheric NO2 patterns on a national scale and with preserved high spatial resolution is still pending. In addition, the increasing availability of area-wide, high-resolution data for large study areas presents new challenges for analyzing impact factors, such as spatial heterogeneity. Based on the annual mean tropospheric NO2 of Germany (September 2018 to August 2019) resampled to a 1 km x 1 km spatial resolution, the subject of this study was twofold: on the one hand a hot and cold spot analysis was performed, on the other hand, nonmeteorological factors influencing tropospheric NO2 were investigated within spatial regimes of different land use / land cover (LU/LC) compositions. A total of 24 national hot spots were identified with the majority located in urban areas. The spatial regime-based impact factor analysis revealed that most correlation coefficients between LU/LC and tropospheric NO2 are highly dependent on the location. Some other factors, however, were found to have a strong impact on tropospheric NO2 independent of the location (impervious surfaces, population and road density). Although this study is based on tropospheric column data, and meteorology has not been considered yet, the analyses demonstrate the contribution of Sentinel-5P/TROPOMI data to a better understanding of the high-dimensional and complex relationship between NO2, the atmosphere and the composition of the land surface and its use.

TI  - Remote sensing based crop insurance for jute<i> (Corchorus</i><i> olitorius)</i> crop in India
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Jute (Corchorus olitorius) is an eco-friendly commercial crop largely grown in the West Bengal state of India and is often exposed to weather risks. The existing area-yield crop insurance scheme guarantees a certain per cent of normal green biomass yield of the crop over an insured area. Lack of reliable yield data has diminished the effectiveness of this scheme. Therefore, an alternate basis for jute yield loss assessment using satellite-derived crop performance index called 'Crop Health Factor (CHF)' was developed and implemented as documented in this paper. Both optical and microwave data of Sentinels along with weather and field data sets were analysed to map the jute crop fields and to generate crop condition indices such as NDVI, LSWI, VH backscatter, FAPAR and rainfall derivatives for the current (2020) and past years (2017, 2018 and 2019). The metrics derived from these indices were subjected to entropy analysis to produce the CHF values for different insurance units, which were found to be well correlated with yield. CHF data was used in place of yield for assessing crop loss and insurance pay-outs. This project has implications for developing transformative and parametric crop insurance solutions harnessing the potential of remote sensing data.

TI  - Trophic State Assessment of a Freshwater Himninvan Lake Using Landsat 8 OLI Satelite Imagery: A Case Study of Wular Lake, Jammu and Kashmir (India)
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A new version of Trophic State Index for freshwater Himalayan Lake (TSIFHL) has been derived from Landsat 8 OLI to determine the aquatic health of the lake ecosystem. TSIFHL, is based on chlorophyll-a concentration (CChl-a) which has been retrieved from Landsat 8 OLI data and laboratory measurements using an empirical approach. Further, in situ measurements have also been taken with Secchi disk depth (Z(SD)) in a freshwater Himalayan Lake (FHL). The derived CChl-a exhibited lower and upper limit of 25.81 and 207.96 mu g/L, respectively. The modeled Z(SD) values ranged between 0.18 and 0.66 m with an average depth of 0.50 m. The best-fitted regression model, developed for CChl-a with R-2 = 0.89, exhibited model error of 0.77 mu g/L for the standard error of estimate (SEE). The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (E) values were 5.83% and 0.98 mu g/L, respectively. For the Z(SD), the best-fitted model showed errors of 0.11 mu g/L (SEE), 13.93% (MAPE), and 0.77 mu g/L (E) with R-2 = 0.84. The proposed model is useful for bio-optical studies of Himalayan Lake ecosystems and could provide potential support for inland water management. Long term strategies like multisector monitoring and control of nutrient load entering the lake can be developed to alleviate problems of eutrophication.

TI  - MACHINE LEARNING FOR MAPPING SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF THICKNESS AND CARBON STOCK OF TROPICAL PEATLAND BASED ON REMOTE SENSING DATA: A CASE STUDY IN LAKE SENTARUM NATIONAL PARK, INDONESIA
T2  - GEOGRAPHIA TECHNICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Indonesia is one of the countries with the largest area of tropical peatlands in the world. These wide peatlands have a vital role in the carbon cycle and carbon storage in huge quantities, thus strict conservation in the area is necessary. One effort to carry out conservation is to understand the spatial distribution of carbon stock in peatlands. This study aims to map the spatial distribution of carbon stock based on peat thickness modeling using machine learning algorithms, i.e., Random Forest (RF), Quantile Regression Forests (QRF), and Cubist. A case study was conducted in a part of Lake Sentarum National Park, Indonesia where human interference is still limited. Digital elevation model (DEM) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data were included as the input variables. The results showed that RF performed the best among other models to estimate peat thickness (mean = 1.877 m) with an RMSE (root mean square error) of 0.483 m and an R-2 of 0.786. DEMs are the most important parameters in our analysis compared to SAR data. Based on the best model, we estimated the total volume of 5,112,687 m(3) in the study area, produced at 12.5 m resolution, which was then converted to a total of carbon stock at 0.337 +/- 0.106 Mt carbon.

TI  - Modeling Forest Canopy Cover: A Synergistic Use of Sentinel-2, Aerial Photogrammetry Data, and Machine Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest canopy cover (FCC) is an important ecological parameter of forest ecosystems, and is correlated with forest characteristics, including plant growth, regeneration, biodiversity, light regimes, and hydrological properties. Here, we present an approach of combining Sentinel-2 data, high-resolution aerial images, and machine learning (ML) algorithms to model FCC in the Hyrcanian mixed temperate forest, Northern Iran. Sentinel-2 multispectral bands and vegetation indices were used as variables for modeling and mapping FCC based on UAV ground truth to a wider spatial extent. Random forest (RF), support-vector machine (SVM), elastic net (ENET), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) were the ML algorithms used to learn and generalize on the remotely sensed variables. Evaluation of variable importance indicated that vegetation indices including NDVI, NDVI-A, NDRE, and NDI45 were the dominant predictors in most of the models. Model accuracy estimation results showed that among the tested models, RF (R-2 = 0.67, RMSE = 18.87%, MAE = 15.35%) and ENET (R-2 = 0.63, RMSE = 20.04%, MAE = 16.44%) showed the best and the worst performance, respectively. In conclusion, it was possible to prove the suitability of integrating UAV-obtained RGB images, Sentinel-2 data, and ML models for the estimation of FCC, intended for precise and fast mapping at landscape-level scale.

TI  - Rapid Mapping of Landslides on SAR Data by Attention U-Net
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multiple landslide events are common around the globe. They can cause severe damage to both human lives and infrastructures. Although a huge quantity of research has been shaped to address rapid mapping of landslides by optical Earth Observation (EO) data, various gaps and uncertainties are still present when dealing with cloud obscuration and 24/7 operativity. To address the issue, we explore the usage of SAR data over the eastern Iburi sub-prefecture of Hokkaido, Japan. In the area, about 8000 co-seismic landslides were triggered by an Mw 6.6 earthquake on 6 September 2018, at 03.08 local time (JST). In the following study, we modify a Deep Learning (DL) convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture suited for pixel-based classification purposes, the so-called Attention U-Net (Attn-U-Net) and we employ it to evaluate the potential of bi- and tri-temporal SAR amplitude data from the Sentinel-1 satellite and slope angle to map landslides even under thick cloud cover. Four different datasets, composed of two different band combinations per two satellite orbits (ascending and descending) are analyzed. Moreover, the impact of augmentations is evaluated independently for each dataset. The models' predictions are compared against an accurate landslide inventory obtained by manual mapping on pre-and post-event PlanetScope imagery through F1-score and other common metrics. The best result was yielded by the augmented ascending tri-temporal SAR composite image (61% F1-score). Augmentations have a positive impact on the ascending Sentinel-1 orbit, while metrics decrease when augmentations are applied on descending path. Our findings demonstrate that combining SAR data with other data sources may help to map landslides quickly, even during storms and under deep cloud cover. However, further investigations and improvements are still needed, this being one of the first attempts in which the combination of SAR data and DL algorithms are employed for landslide mapping purposes.

T2  - Radiologia
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the ability of axillary ultrasonography to predict the number of lymph nodes with metastases found in sentinel node axillary surgery or axillary lymph node resection in patients recently diagnosed with breast cancer after percutaneous biopsy.METHODS: This prospective study included patients diagnosed with invasive breast cancer by percutaneous biopsy. Axillary lymph nodes were classified at ultrasound examination as suspicious or not suspicious, and the number of suspicious nodes was compared with the number classified as suspicious in the surgical specimen.RESULTS: We included 142 patients, 4 of whom had bilateral cancer; 133 of the 146 tumors were clinically classified as T1-T2 N0. The median number of suspicious lymph nodes at ultrasound was 2 (1-6), and the median number of suspicious lymph nodes in the surgical biopsy specimen was 1 (1-16); the difference was not significant (p = 0.1). The correlation between the number of positive lymph nodes on axillary ultrasound and the number of metastatic lymph nodes in the surgical specimen was 72.7% p = 0.0002 and the concordance was 79% (95%CI 62.4%-95.6%) p = 0.0001. For diagnosing high axillary tumor load (≥3 metastatic lymph nodes) versus low axillary tumor load (<3 metastatic lymph nodes), axillary ultrasound had 86.6% sensitivity, 83.3% specificity, 92% PPV, and 71.4% NPV.CONCLUSION: Our results show that preoperative axillary ultrasound can differentiate between low and high tumor load and can be used as a tool to select the type of treatment. These results need to be confirmed in randomized multicenter studies.

TI  - Multifractal analysis for spatial characterization of high resolution Sentinel-2/MAJA products in Southwestern France
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Multifractal analysis was applied to evidence spatial properties, in particular scaling behaviour, of Sentinel-2 surface reflectances and optical indexes acquired over the Southwest region of France. Considering the significant impact of clouds on the spatial properties of optical products, no study to our knowledge has focused on the multifractal analysis of a series of images. Images with minimal cloud cover were identified for the whole year 2016 based on the MACCS-ATCOR Joint Algorithm (MAJA) cloud and shadow detection process. This allowed us to access the dynamics of the scaling properties of surface reflectances, contributing to demonstrate the potential of multifractals for spatial characterization. Different scaling regimes, separated by significant scale breaks, were evident in these data. Through simulations from the Universal Multifractal model, we could explain the scaling properties and especially the position of scale breaks observed in the images studied by two types of phenomena. First, a transition scale located between hundreds of meters and one kilometre was detected on power spectra, structure functions and statistical moments. This specific scale was related to the average size of the agricultural plots of the studied region, revealing the direct link between the scaling behaviour observed and the physical properties of the surface. Second, an instrumental phenomenon was detected on the power spectra, resulting in a systematic transition scale observed near the resolution of the sensor and revealing the impact of the acquisition system on the high frequencies of optical images. In this research work, theoretical and/or empirical validation arguments were provided as to the origin of the scales detected, contributing to demonstrate the value of multifractals to extract image texture from surface reflectance products.

TI  - Ha Long-Cam Pha Cities Evolution Analysis Utilizing Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Socio-economic development has promoted the modification of land cover patterns in the coastal area of Ha Long, Cam Pha cities since the 1990s. The urban growth, together with intensive coal mining activities, has improved the life quality of residents. However, it has also caused many environmental problems in this region. Change detection techniques based on post-classification comparison were applied for monitoring the spatial and temporal evolution of land covers. The confusion matrix for 2001 and 2019 showed high overall accuracy (97.99%, 94.95%) and Kappa coefficient (0.97, 0.92), respectively. Statistics from classified images have revealed that man-made features increased by about 15.32%, while natural features, mangrove jungles, and water bodies decreased 10.64%, 1.96%, 2.72%, respectively, and urban evolution presents various dynamics, soft in the first period (1991-2001), but stronger in the second period (2001-2019) with different characteristics. The study also expresses the constraint of topographic and geologic resources, which have prevented the urban development in this coastal area. Such obtained results are very important for understanding interactions and relations between natural and human phenomena and they may help authorities by providing indicators and maps able to highlight necessary actions for sustainable development.

TI  - Multifractality via Stochasticity in Atmospheric Dynamics Description Validated through Remote Sensing Data
T2  - MATHEMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present paper, correlations between multifractality and stochasticity in atmospheric dynamics are investigated. Starting with two descriptions of atmospheric scenarios, one based on scale relativity theory and another based on stochastic theory, correspondences between parameters and variables belonging to both scenarios are found. In such a context, by replacing an atmospheric conservative passive additive with a non-differentiable component of the atmospheric multifractal velocity, stochastic evolution equations are found for this component, which reveal the multifractal variational transport coefficient and the multifractal molecular diffusion coefficient, along with the multifractal inhomogeneity variation. Furthermore, equations which describe a multifractal Reynolds number and singularity spectrum are also found. Finally, these theoretical results are validated through remote sensing data obtained with the aid of a ceilometer platform.

TI  - The 2011 Cordon Caulle eruption triggered by slip on the Liquine-Ofqui fault system
T2  - EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Determining the mechanisms that promote large silicic eruptions is one of the biggest challenges in volcanic hazard assessment. The 2011-2012 Cordon-Caulle eruption in Chile was one of the largest silicic eruptions of the 21st century and was characterized by a rapid change from explosive to effusive behavior. This eruption was preceded by inflation from 2007 to 2009, followed by two years of barely any ground deformation. Despite intensive monitoring by geodetic and seismological data, its trigger remains undetermined. Here, we benefit from SAR imagery over the Puyehue Cordon-Caulle Volcanic Complex acquired by ALOS-1, ENVISAT and SENTINEL-1 data, to analyze the temporal and spatial behavior of ground displacements before, during and after the eruption. First, we find that a similar prolate spheroidal source explains the ground deformation for the pre-eruptive and post-eruptive periods. Then, we use 3D numerical elasto-plastic models to assess the failure conditions resulting from the pre-eruptive magma injection. Our results show that such a magma injection was too small to trigger the eruption. Therefore we explore other eruption triggers. Analytical elastic inversion models show that the ground displacements observed during the explosive phase may have been produced by slip motion along a NNW-striking dextral-strike slip, double-branch fault of the north-trending Liquine-Ofqui Fault System (LOFS), or along a single southern branch fault of the LOFS and collapse of the caldera. When investigating the elasto-plastic deformation pattern resulting from dextral slip along this branch-fault system, we obtain a sub-vertical dilatational plastic zone that connects the reservoir wall to the surface in a location that coincides with that of the 2011 eruption. Hence, we propose that this LOFS branch-fault eventually destabilized (perhaps weakened by the 2007-2009 episode of magma injection), and then slipped in a way that opened channels for fluid migration from the magma reservoir up to the surface.

TI  - SKIPJACK TUNA FISHING SEASON AND ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH OCEANOGRAPHIC CONDITIONS IN PALABUHANRATU WATERS, WEST JAVA
T2  - Malaysian Applied Biology
M3  - Article
AB  - Skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis) is the main catch species in Indonesian Palabuhanratu waters. The dynamics of skipjack fishing areas are influenced by oceanographic parameters such as sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-a concentration. This study aims to predict the skipjack fishing season, to analyze the dynamics of oceanographic conditions, especially the distribution of both sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-a, and to determine the relationship between skipjack fishing season and the dynamic distribution of sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-a concentration in the Palabuhanratu waters, West Java. Catch per unit effort analysis was used to determine the fishing season index. At the same time, the dynamics of sea surface temperature and distribution of chlorophyll-a were analyzed from monthly MODIS image data from 2015 to 2019. This study showed that skipjack fishing season in Palabuhanratu waters was from July to November. Monthly sea surface temperatures range from 26-30 degrees C with an average value of 29 degrees C. The concentration of the chlorophyll-a was 0.09 to 0.51 mg/m(3) (average of 0.23 mg/m(3)). There was a negative relationship between sea surface temperature and skipjack tuna production, while a positive relationship with the chlorophyll-a concentrations.

TI  - Monitoring Phycocyanin with Landsat 8/Operational Land Imager Orange Contra-Band
T2  - ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Operational Land Imager (OLI) onboard the Landsat 8 satellite has a panchromatic band (503-676 nm) that has been used to compute a virtual spectral band known as "orange contra-band" (590-635 nm). The major application of the orange contra-band is the monitoring of cyanobacteria which is usually quantified by the measurement of the concentration of phycocyanin (PC) which has an absorption peak around 620 nm. In this study, we evaluated the use of the orange contra-band approach for estimating PC concentration from in situ proximal hyperspectral data from Eagle Creek Reservoir (ECR), in Indiana, USA. We first validated the empirical relationship for the computation of the orange contra-band by using the panchromatic, red, and green spectral bands from ECR. PC concentration retrieval using the orange contra-band were not successful when using the entire dataset (R-2 < 0.1) or when using only PC concentrations higher than 50 mg/m(3) (R-2 < 0.24). Better results were achieved when using samples in which PC was 1.5 times higher than the chlorophyll-a concentration (R-2 = 0.84). These results highlighted the need for the development of remote sensing algorithms for the accurate estimation of PC concentration from non-PC dominant waters which could be use to track and/or predict cyanobacteria blooms.

TI  - REFLECTION OF THE WORLDVIEW OF THE CLASSICS OF ORIENTAL POETRY IN THE WORK OF RUSSIAN POETS
T2  - REVISTA UNIVERSIDAD Y SOCIEDAD
M3  - Article
AB  - The active penetration of Eastern poetry in Europe began in the XVIII century, although works such as the German translation of Saadi's bustan were known then. For two centuries, the West has been getting acquainted with the masterpieces of Rudaki, Nizami, Firdowsi, Khayyam, Hafiz and other Eastern poets; the Russian cultural environment was no exception. Thus, the Eastern philosophical and religious systems became at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries the basis for the works of such Russian poets as I. Bunin, V. Bryusov, V. Khlebnikov, K. Balmont and many others. Each one took various facets of Eastern poetry, and with their own styles, developed original means of expression, which enriched the national poetic environment. Taking this into consideration, the aim of this article is to analyze the reflection of the worldview of the classics of Eastern poetry in the work of Russian poets.

TI  - An Empirical Model for Backscattering Coefficients of Vegetation Fields at 5.4 GHz
T2  - JOURNAL OF ELECTROMAGNETIC ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A new, simple empirical model for microwave backscattering from vegetation fields at 5.4 GHz is proposed in this paper. First, a modified radiative transfer model (RTM) is used to generate a database of multi-polarized backscattering coefficients of various vegetation fields at 5.4 GHz with wide ranges of vegetation biomasses and soil moistures. Second, we propose a functional form of an empirical model that is a simplified water cloud model (VVCM) after closely examining the behaviors of the well-known WCM based on an extensive database that includes the modified RTM outputs, scatterometer measurements, SAR datasets, and in situ measured ground-truth data for various vegetation fields. Finally, the unknown constant parameters of the empirical model are determined for each soil moisture condition based on the extensive database. The new empirical model is verified with the database itself, and also with independent Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data and in situ measured ground-truth data.

TI  - Lifestyle Factors Associated with Undernutrition in Older People after the Great East Japan Earthquake: A Prospective Study in the Fukushima Health Management Survey
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - We conducted a longitudinal examination to assess the relationship between lifestyle habits, including exercise habits, and the incidence of undernutrition after the Great East Japan Earthquake in March 2011. Of the 31,411 participants aged >= 60 years who lived in the municipalities' evacuation areas before the disaster and had undergone health examinations, 17,622 persons with a body mass index of 20-25 kg/m(2) were followed up through the FY 2017 (a mean follow-up of 6.9 years). The analysis involved 13,378 individuals who could be followed. The associations between undernutrition after the disaster and lifestyle factors were estimated via multivariable-adjusted analysis using the Cox proportional hazard regression model. The dependent variable was the proportion of undernutrition after the disaster, whereas independent variables included evacuation, exercise habits/physical activity, alcohol consumption, smoking, meals before bedtime, gastrointestinal surgery history, history of lifestyle-related diseases, and two or more subjective symptoms. In total, 1712 of the 13,378 participants were newly undernourished after the disaster. The statistically significant variables influencing the occurrence of undernutrition were non-evacuation (hazard ratio (HR), 1.31; 95% confidence index (CI) 1.17-1.47), poor exercise habits (HR, 1.14; 95% CI 1.03-1.50), and poor physical activity (HR, 1.12; 95% CI 1.01-1.25). Other significant related variables were drinking habits, surgical history, lifestyle-related diseases, and two or more subjective symptoms. These results suggest that regular exercise and/or physical activity might be important in preventing undernutrition following a disaster, regardless of sex, other lifestyle habits, or past medical history.

TI  - CLASSIFICATION OF MOUNTAIN WETLANDS (VEGAS) IN THE CENTRAL ANDES, ARGENTINA
T2  - BOLETIN DE LA SOCIEDAD ARGENTINA DE BOTANICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and aims: The objective of this work is to classify mountain wetlands (vegas) in the Central Andes between 28 degrees y 53 degrees S, based on geomorphology and hydrology. In addition, it seeks to characterize and determine the area, height, and slope of the vegas in each typology. M&M: The determination of the different typologies was carried out based on an integrated biophysical approach at different scales of spatial analysis, where the vegas present in the study area were identified and their link with hydrological and geomorphological aspects. The dominant runoff types, and the geomorphological units were determined. Satellite images ALOS-AVNIR-2, Landsat 5 TM and field data were used. Results: A total of 304 vegas were identified that are determined by the geomorphological unit (river plains, alluvial fan, hillside, undifferentiated foothills, depression without surface discharge with or without water and fault) and the dominant type of runoff (linear surface, mantiform subsurface and subsurface mantiform to superficial linear). Four typologies of vegas are recognized: Riverbank, Hillside, Depression and Fault. The Riverbank and Hillside typologies were dominant in number and area. Eight and slope did not result different between typologies. Conclusions: The vegas present in the Central Andes respond to 4 typologies: Riverbank, Fault, Hillside and Depression. There is a close relationship between vegas, geomorphology and the dominant runoff, allowing their classification and to analyze different management measures. The obtained results are a contribution to the study of ecosystems of high ecological and socio-economic value in the region.

TI  - Spatial Transferability of Random Forest Models for Crop Type Classification Using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale crop type mapping often requires prediction beyond the environmental settings of the training sites. Shifts in crop phenology, field characteristics, or ecological site conditions in the previously unseen area, may reduce the classification performance of machine learning classifiers that often overfit to the training sites. This study aims to assess the spatial transferability of Random Forest models for crop type classification across Germany. The effects of different input datasets, i.e., only optical, only Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), and optical-SAR data combination, and the impact of spatial feature selection were systematically tested to identify the optimal approach that shows the highest accuracy in the transfer region. The spatial feature selection, a feature selection approach combined with spatial cross-validation, should remove features that carry site-specific information in the training data, which in turn can reduce the accuracy of the classification model in previously unseen areas. Seven study sites distributed over Germany were analyzed using reference data for the major 11 crops grown in the year 2018. Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data from October 2017 to October 2018 were used as input. The accuracy estimation was performed using the spatially independent sample sets. The results of the optical-SAR combination outperformed those of single sensors in the training sites (maximum F1-score-0.85), and likewise in the areas not covered by training data (maximum F1-score-0.79). Random forest models based on only SAR features showed the lowest accuracy losses when transferred to unseen regions (average F1(loss)-0.04). In contrast to using the entire feature set, spatial feature selection substantially reduces the number of input features while preserving good predictive performance on unseen sites. Altogether, applying spatial feature selection to a combination of optical-SAR features or using SAR-only features is beneficial for large-scale crop type classification where training data is not evenly distributed over the complete study region.

TI  - Estimating Long-Term Average Carbon Emissions from Fires in Non-Forest Ecosystems in the Temperate Belt
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Research into pyrogenic carbon emissions in the temperate belt of the Russian Federation has traditionally focused on the impact of forest fires. Nevertheless, ecosystems in which wildfires also make a significant contribution to anthropogenic CO2 emissions are poorly studied. We evaluated the carbon emissions of fires in the non-forest ecosystems of the Middle Amur Lowland, in the Khabarovsk Territory of the Russian Federation. Our study is based on long-term Earth remote sensing data of medium spatial resolution (Landsat 5, 7, and 8) and expeditionary studies (2018-2021). The assessment of carbon directly emitted from wildfires in meadow and meadow-mire temperate ecosystems in the Middle Amur lowland shows that specific emissions from such ecosystems vary, from 1.09 t/ha in dwarf shrub-sphagnum and sphagnum-ledum and sedge-reed fens to 6.01 t/ha in reed-forb, forb, reed, and sedge meadows. Meanwhile, carbon emissions specifically from fires in meadow and meadow-mire ecosystems are less significant-often an order of magnitude less than carbon emissions from forest fires (which reach 37 tC/ha). However, due to their high frequency and the large areas of land burned annually, the total carbon emissions from such fires are comparable to annual emissions from fires in forested areas. The results obtained show that the inadequacy of the methods used in the automatic mapping of burns leads to a significant underestimation of the area of grassland fires and carbon emissions from non-forest fires.

TI  - Wind Speed Variation Mapped Using SAR before and after Commissioning of Offshore Wind Farms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - When installing offshore wind farms (OWFs) adjacent to the coast, one needs to consider the combined effects of the wind wakes caused by the OWFs and natural horizontal coastal wind speed gradients (HCWSGs). This study exploits the full Sentinel 1A/B and Envisat archive of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery covering the northern European seas. More than 8700 SAR scenes fit well with our selection criteria and are processed as wind maps for the height 10 m above the sea surface. For eight selected wind farm sites, we systematically compare the wind flow variation before and after wind farm commissioning. Before the commissioning, we observe wind speed gradients up to +/- 4% for onshore and offshore winds. After the commissioning, we detect a 2-10% reduction in the mean wind speed downstream of the turbines after taking into account the background wind speed gradients. These velocity deficits are proportional to the OWF capacity. Our findings indicate that wind speed maps retrieved from SAR can be used to quantify the complex interactions between natural HCWSGs and turbine-induced effects on the mean wind climate. Ultimately, this can be used in connection with farm planning in coastal waters.

TI  - PyGEE-SWToolbox: A Python Jupyter Notebook Toolbox for Interactive Surface Water Mapping and Analysis Using Google Earth Engine
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuous monitoring of surface water resources is often challenging due to the lack of monitoring systems in remote areas and the high spatial distribution of water bodies. The Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, which houses a large set of remote sensing datasets and geospatial processing power, has been applied in various aspects of surface water resources monitoring to solve some of the challenges. PyGEE-SWToolbox is a freely available Google Earth Engine-enabled open-source toolbox developed with Python to be run in Jupyter Notebooks that provides an easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI) that enables the user to obtain time series of Landsat, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, pre-process them, and extract surface water using water indices, such as the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Modified NDWI (MNDWI), Automated Water Extraction Index (AWEI), and Dynamic Surface Water Extent (DSWE). The validation of the toolbox is carried out at four reservoir and lake locations: Elephant Butte Lake, Hubbard Creek Reservoir, Clearwater Lake, and Neversink Reservoir in the United States. A time series of the water surface area generated from PyGEE-SWToolbox compared to the observed surface areas yielded good results, with R-2 ranging between 0.63 and 0.99 for Elephant Butte Lake, Hubbard Creek Reservoir, and Clearwater Lake except the Neversink Reservoir with a maximum R-2 of 0.52. The purpose of PyGEE-SWToolbox is to provide water resource managers, engineers, researchers, and students a user-friendly environment to utilize the GEE platform for water resource monitoring and generation of datasets. The toolbox is accompanied by a step-by-step user manual and Readme documentation for installation and usage.

M3  - Article
AB  - This work compares methods of climate measurements, such as those used to measure evapotranspiration, precipitation, net radiation, and temperature. The satellite products used were compared and evaluated against flux tower data. Evapotranspiration was validated against the SSEBop monthly and GLEAM daily and monthly products, respectively, and the results were RMSE = 24.144 mm/month, NRMSE = 0.223, r(2) = 0.163, slope = 0.411; RMSE = 1.781 mm/day, NRMSE = 0.599, r(2) = 0.000, slope = 0.006; RMSE = 36.17 mm/month, NRMSE = 0.401, r(2) = 0.002, and slope = 0.026. Precipitation was compared with the CHIRPS data, K67 was not part of the CHIRPS station correction. The results for both the daily and monthly comparisons were RMSE = 18.777 mm/day, NRMSE = 1.027, r(2) = 0.086, slope = 0.238 and RMSE = 130.713 mm/month, NRMSE = 0.706, r(2) = 0.402, and slope = 0.818. The net radiation validated monthly with CERES was RMSE = 75.357 W/m(2), NRMSE = 0.383, r(2) = 0.422, and slope = 0.867. The temperature results, as compared to MOD11C3, were RMSE = 2.829 degrees C, NRMSE = 0.116, r(2) = 0.153, and slope = 0.580. Comparisons between the remote sensing products and validation against the ground data were performed on a monthly basis. GLEAM and CHIRPS daily were the data sets with considerable discrepancy.

TI  - Evolution of Physical and Biological Patterns Along the Tropical and South Atlantic Western boundary: A satellite Perspective
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigate the spatial and temporal patterns of satellite-derived sea surface temperature, salinity and chlorophyll-a concentration along the eastern South American coast. Two decade-long time series (2002-2019; except for the salinity) allowed us to investigate changes from seasonal to interannual time scales on an array that stretches from the south (42 degrees S) to the north (10 degrees N) of the continent and from isobaths ranging from -50 to -1000 m away from the coast. The novelty of our approach is to assess comparatively the magnitude, variability, and spectrum of these variables following the same isobaths and using the same methodology. This allowed us to examine the influence of large scale ocean circulation patterns entangled with the local forcing systems such as river discharge and coastal currents, and to quantify to what extent these patterns are spatially and temporally consistent. The seasonal cycle of the temperature explains more variance than that of salinity and chlorophyll on average. Comparatively, salinity has a weak seasonal signal, except near major rivers. Significant long-term trends were observed in specific regions in the salinity time series. Our study revealed distinct interannual changes at 2- and 4-year period in the whole array with the largest spectral peaks near the La Plata and the Amazon Rivers. Within this period band, thermal signals propagate northward along the whole array. Statistical correlations between satellite-derived variables and several climate indices suggest remote forcing.Plain Language Summary Studies based on satellite data are useful to assess surface ocean properties on a continuous and regular basis, with global coverage and consistent methodology. In this article we analyzed sea surface temperature and salinity, and chlorophyll-a concentration retrieved from satellite measurements along the eastern South American coast with 20-year satellite data (except for the salinity). That allowed us to investigate how those variables are affected by regional and coastal circulations, major river discharges and oceanic source input of properties, helping us to understand their propagation patterns and connection with atmospheric remote processes. The seasonal cycle dominated the fluctuation patterns of the variables, but distinct interannual signal could also be identified in specific regions like the Amazon or La Plata river mouths. In some regions, the salinity presented significant long-term trends. We found significant correlations between the interannual signal of some regions to atmospheric climate indices, like the Nino 3.4. Our work could be used as a reference for future studies that aim to quantify the connectivity of physical and biological parameters in the region. This is the first study aiming to assess comparatively the magnitude, variability, and spectrum of these variables following the same isobaths and using the same methodology.

The analysis has considered a variety of biogeographical regions [0-3500 m.a.s.l, annual rainfalls 150-2200 mm] and 30 explanatory variables. A rigorous map production at 30 m resolution, including detailed filtering methods and uncertainty management at pixel scale, provided high-quality land cover maps. The main forest expansion trajectories were related to explanatory variables using boosted regression trees. Proximity to previous forests was a key common factor for forest encroachment in all forest types, with other factors being distance to the hydrographic network, temperature and precipitation for broadleaf deciduous forests (BDF), precipitation, temperature and solar radiation for broadleaf evergreen forests (BEF) and precipitation, distance to province capitals, and solar radiation for needleleaf evergreen forests (NEFs). Results also showed contrasting forest expansion trajectories and drivers per biogeographic region, with a high dynamism of grasslands towards new forest in the Eurosiberian and the mountainous Mediterranean regions, a high importance of croplands as land cover origin of new forest in the Mesomediterranean, and increasing importance over time of socioeconomic drivers (such as those employed in the industry sector and the utilized agricultural area) in the Supramediterranean region but the opposite pattern in the Southern Mesomediterranean. Lower precipitation rates favored new NEFs from shrublands in the Thermomediterraean region which, together with the Northern Mesomediterranean, exhibited the highest relative rates of new forests. These findings provide reliable insights to develop policies considering the ecological and social impacts of land abandonment and subsequent forest expansion.

TI  - Latter-Day Saint Roots in the American Forest: Joseph Smith's Restoration Visions in Their Environmental Context
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - On 6 April 1830 Joseph Smith Jr. legally established what he claimed to be the restored Church of Jesus Christ that had existed previously during the New Testament times. This bold claim was bolstered by stories of angelic visitations in the hemlock-northern hardwood forest of New York and Pennsylvania by biblical and nonbiblical figures alike. In one of Smith's supernatural encounters he claims that immediately prior to his theophany the Devil tried to intercede and prevent his communion with God. Thus, Smith and his followers have embraced a complex worldview concerning the nineteenth-century American forest, host to both the Divine and the Devil. The nineteenth-century American forest was complicated by its dangerous elements, its economic opportunities, and the sublime quality popularized in landscape paintings. Forests existed as environments that were equal in their ability to leave one desolate, well-provisioned, or inspired. Navigating these sometimes paradoxical views, Joseph Smith's stories of otherworldly visitations in forest settings have resonated with many people seeking understanding in a confusing world. The founding story of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and artistic depictions thereof demonstrate an evolving view of the American forest. The American forest is a malleable, liminal space in which Latter-day Saints have continually combined elements of faith and memory to create a unique faith tradition with roots in a transformative place in American society. This interdisciplinary paper examines the physical appearance of the hemlock-northern hardwood forest, the socioeconomic climate, shifting sentimental values, and the philosophical ideas popularized by transcendentalists and the Hudson River School of painters that provided the scaffolding for this resilient religious movement's origin story.

TI  - Characteristics of equivalent black carbon aerosols over Doon Valley in NW Indian Himalaya during COVID-19 lockdown 2020
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, black carbon (BC) has been identified as a potential transmitter for COVID-19 besides being responsible for climate change and serious health hazards. To mitigate the dreaded consequences of COVID-19 pandemic, the Government of India declared a nationwide lockdown on March 24, 2020. Accordingly, observations on equivalent black carbon (EBC) aerosols using AE 51 Aethalometer were performed during different lockdowns in Doon Valley. During April, May, June, and July, the monthly average EBC mass concentration recorded 2.12 +/- 1.14 mu g m(-3), 2.58 +/- 1.46 mu g m(-3), 2.74 +/- 1.49 mu g m(-3), and 2.12 +/- 1.32 mu g m(-3), respectively. A comparison of diurnal variation patterns with earlier studies indicates a significant reduction in EBC mass concentration levels. Bipolar NWR analysis for April and May depicts that relatively high EBC concentration was experienced with prominent south-easterly winds. The EBC concentration level during daytime was high compared to nighttime hours. Preliminary visualization of scanning electron micrographs indicates the variable morphology of aerosols. The bulk particle EDX spectral analysis indicates C, O, Na, F, Al, Si, K, Ca, and Ti elements with a dominance of C and O. Windblown dust seems to be the major contributor to the ambient aerosols. Furthermore, MODIS recorded the fire anomaly (attributed to the wheat stubble burning) starting from mid of April to early-June along the Indo-Gangetic Basin. Heavy loading of polluted aerosols was visible in CALIPSO data imageries. HYSPLIT cluster trajectories indicate that the study region is strongly influenced by the air mass transporting from the Gangetic Plain, Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Gulf region.

TI  - An Improved Algorithm for the Retrieval of the Antarctic Sea Ice Freeboard and Thickness from ICESat-2 Altimeter Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - ICESat-2 altimeter data could be used to estimate sea ice freeboard and thickness values with a higher measuring accuracy than that achievable with data provided by previous altimeter satellites. This study developed an improved algorithm considering variable lead proportions based on the lowest point method to derive the sea surface height for the retrieval of Antarctic sea ice freeboard and thickness values from ICESat-2 ATL-07 data. We first collocated ICESat-2 tracks to corresponding Sentinel-1 SAR images and calculated lead (seawater) proportions along each track to estimate the sea surface height in the Antarctic Ocean. Then, the Antarctic sea ice freeboard and thickness were estimated based on a local sea surface height reference and a static equilibrium equation. Finally, we assessed the accuracy of our improved algorithm and ICESat-2 data product in the retrieval of the Antarctic sea ice thickness by comparing the calculated values to ship-based observational sea ice thickness values acquired during the 35th Chinese Antarctic Research Expedition (CHINARE-35). The results indicate that the Antarctic sea ice freeboard estimated with the improved lowest point method was slightly larger than that estimated with the ICESat-2 data product algorithm. The root mean squared error (RMSE) of the improved lowest point method was 35 cm with the CHINARE-35 measured sea ice thickness, which was smaller than that determined with the ICESat-2 data product algorithm (65 cm). Our improved algorithm could provide more accurate data on the Antarctic sea ice freeboard and thickness, thus supporting Antarctic sea ice monitoring and the evaluation of its change under global effects.

TI  - Evolution of Opencast Mines in the Raniganj Coalfield (India): An Assessment through Multi-temporal Satellite Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface mining is the dominant driver of land use land cover (LULC) change in the Raniganj coalfield region in West Bengal, India. Owing to its multifaceted consequences on soil, water, and landholders, assessment of spatio-temporal changes in mining areas has become important. The oldest coal mine of India, Raniganj coalfield has been producing superior quality non-coking coal for the last 246 years. To reduce the cost per unit production of coal, the mining authority prefers the opencast method over underground mining. The mushrooming growth of opencast mines in this coalfield causing huge waste dumps, depletion of vegetated surface, changing slope and drainage pattern, soil erosion, and degradation of environmental quality. With this background, the present study examines the spatio-temporal changes and evolution of opencast mines using multi-temporal Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) datasets of 1991, 2001 and 2014. Further, the study assessed the dynamics of mining patches and their characteristics through spatial metrics analysis. The LULC maps reveal good agreement with in-situ observation as verified by overall accuracy (>= 85%) and Kappa (>= 0.75) statistics. The study showed that mining areas have increased rapidly during the period and the growth has occurred by depleting the forest, sparse vegetation, and agricultural land. It is also noteworthy that the rate of growth in mining areas was comparatively higher during 2001-2014 than in 1991-2001. The change of dynamics of LULC revealed that more than 70% of the active mines was excavated after 2001. It is also observed that patch parameters, i.e. area, perimeter, shape, and density of the mining patches have changed with time that certainly establishes the dynamic nature of mining patches. The unprecedented growth of mining areas during the last decade has been a serious matter of concern from the ecological perspective of the area.

TI  - The many voices in a Muslim self Dialogical self theory in conceptualizing the religious identities and authorities of young European Muslims
T2  - APPROACHING RELIGION
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous research has demonstrated that and religious authority differently from their parental generation. While traditional 'ulama (Islamic scholars) are not about to become obsolete, they are nevertheless increasingly forced to defend their status against competitors. Furthermore, the relationship between many young is marked by ambivalence and complexity. In this article, I suggest the dialogical self theory (DST) as a fruitful approach to conceptualizing the religious identities and authorities of young European Muslims. To illustrate DST, I present a case study of a young Shi'a Muslim who adopts two rather different positions towards religion. The position of 'Doubting Sara' is characterized by an independent search for an intellectually and ethically satisfactory worldview. In turn, the position of 'Pious Sara' emphasizes the peace of tices. Together, 'Doubting Sara' and 'Pious Sara' stability and growth.

TI  - The Concept of Oligarchy in the Ukrainian Economy in the Context of Postmodernism
T2  - POSTMODERN OPENINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article aims to determine socio-economic causes of the emergence of an oligarchy and its functions in the Ukrainian economy in the context of postmodernism.The essence of postmodernism is worldview-philosophical, economic and political systems collapse. This is a kind of opposition to modernism. As for the economy during postmodernism, namely its formation, the changes relate to theview of social relations and human activity. So, oligarchic Ukraine is trying to solve its problems personally. However, a holistic view on the concept of oligarchy is falling apart, since the dominance of financial and industrial groups in the economy of Ukraine monopolizes entire economic sectors, and authorities of different levels in different ways protect not so much the interest of the Ukrainian people, but the interest of its richest layer. Most Ukrainian oligarchs were able to earn their capital in the 1990s, using any opportunity. It was quite cheap redistribution of state property, friendship with the authorities, seizure of someone else's property (raiding). At the same time, oligarchs successfully used imperfect legislation. They simply rewritten it "for themselves", repeatedly using "substitute" politicians.It is concluded that at the present stage of Ukraine's development, the oligarchy has not only ceased to fulfill its stabilizing function, but also turned into the main obstacle to modernization processes. Therefore, the current civilization choice of Ukraine, in particular, is important paradigm of comprehension and strategy of action.

TI  - Active Surveillance via Group Sparse Bayesian Learning
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The key to the effective control of a diffusion system lies in how accurately we could predict its unfolding dynamics based on the observation of its current state. However, in the real-world applications, it is often infeasible to conduct a timely and yet comprehensive observation due to resource constraints. In view of such a practical challenge, the goal of this work is to develop a novel computational method for performing active observations, termed active surveillance, with limited resources. Specifically, we aim to predict the dynamics of a large spatio-temporal diffusion system based on the observations of some of its components. Towards this end, we introduce a novel measure, the y value, that enables us to identify the key components by means of modeling a sentinel network with a row sparsity structure. Having obtained a theoretical understanding of the y value, we design a backward-selection sentinel network mining algorithm (SNMA) for deriving the sentinel network via group sparse Bayesian learning. In order to be practically useful, we further address the issue of scalability in the computation of SNMA, and moreover, extend SNMA to the case of a non-linear dynamical system that could involve complex diffusion mechanisms. We show the effectiveness of SNMA by validating it using both synthetic datasets and five real-world datasets. The experimental results are appealing, which demonstrate that SNMA readily outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - Interactions between Rice Resistance to Planthoppers and Honeydew-Related Egg Parasitism under Varying Levels of Nitrogenous Fertilizer
T2  - INSECTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Planthopper outbreaks in rice are associated with excessive fertilizer applications. Public research has focused on developing resistant rice to combat these outbreaks. However, to preserve ecosystem resilience, natural enemy efficacy should be maintained on resistant and susceptible rice. We examined the impact of egg parasitoids on planthoppers (Nilaparvata lugens (Stal) [BPH] and Sogatella furcifera (Horvath) [WBPH]) and a leafhopper (Nephotettix virescens (Distant) [GLH]) in field plots of resistant (IR62) and susceptible (IR64) rice under low and high nitrogen. GLH and WBPH were more abundant in low-nitrogen plots during dry (GLH) and wet (GLH, WBPH) season sampling at an early crop stage. GLH were also more abundant on IR64. Parasitoids killed between 24 and 52% of planthopper eggs during exposures in trap plants. Parasitism by Oligosita and Anagrus wasps was higher on IR64 (BPH eggs) and in high-nitrogen plots (Oligosita spp. on BPH and WBPH eggs; Anagrus spp. on BPH eggs). Parasitism by Anagrus spp. was associated with the presence of honeydew and was highest where honeydew was derived from BPH feeding on IR62; these effects were only observed under high nitrogen. Results suggest that honeydew from IR62 favors parasitoids when plants are most vulnerable (i.e., under high nitrogen), thereby countering nitrogen-induced declines in host resistance. Host plant resistance is the most researched method for the management of planthoppers and leafhoppers in tropical rice. For optimal effects, resistance should be resilient to fertilizer inputs and work in synergy with natural enemies. In field plot experiments, we examined how rice resistance and fertilizer inputs affect mortality of planthopper and leafhopper eggs by hymenopteran parasitoids. We used IR62 as a variety with resistance to Nilaparvata lugens (Stal) [BPH], Sogatella furcifera (Horvath) [WBPH] and Nephotettix virescens (Distant) [GLH], and IR64 as a susceptible control. The herbivores were more abundant during wet season sampling in low-nitrogen plots. During this study, parasitoids killed between 31 and 38% of BPH eggs and 24 and 52% of WBPH eggs during four days of field exposure. Parasitism, mainly due to Oligosita spp., was generally higher in high-nitrogen and IR64 plots. Similar densities of eggs in exposed plants suggest that these trends were mediated by semiochemicals and therefore support the Optimal Defense Hypothesis. Honeydew from BPH on IR62 had more xylem-derived wastes than honeydew on IR64. We applied honeydew from both varieties to sentinel plants. Parasitism by Anagrus spp. was higher on plants of either variety treated with honeydew derived from IR62; however, the effect was only apparent in high-nitrogen plots. Results suggest that Anagrus spp., by responding to honeydew, will counter the nitrogen-induced enhancement of planthopper fitness on resistant rice.

TI  - Australian Coastal Sea Level Trends Over 16 yr of Reprocessed Jason Altimeter 20-Hz Data Sets
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article analyzes the variation of sea level trends along the Australian coast zone (0-100 km) using 16 yr (2002-2018) of tide gauge records, reprocessed Jason data and European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) sea level product. The reprocessed Jason data are first compared with tide gauge and 3-yr Sentinel-3A data. Then the empirical orthogonal function analysis demonstrates that local sea levels are not only significantly affected by the El Nino Southern Oscillation-related signals, but also moderately correlated with the Indian Ocean Dipole. A multivariate linear regression model with optimized noise model is thus built to reduce the impact of natural variability on the trend estimation. The results show that the geographical pattern of sea level rise from reprocessed Jason data and ESA CCI sea level product are highly consistent, with the rates decreasing from the northeast coast (6-8 mm yr(-1)) anticlockwise to the southeast coast (2-4 mm yr(-1)). The sea level trends from reprocessed Jason data are in good agreement with those from tide gauge records, though they are similar to 1.5 mm yr(-1) higher than those from the ESA CCI data product. The discrepancy between two altimeter datasets is acceptable considering the trend uncertainty (i.e., one standard deviation) from 20-Hz along-track points is at the level of 1-2 mm yr(-1). It is also found that sea level trends decrease significantly from 5.8 +/- 1.5 mm yr(-1) offshore to 3.4 +/- 1.2 mm yr(-1) toward the southeast coasts. This may be because the continental slope precludes the propagation of sea levels from the East Australian Current dominated oceans to the coast.

TI  - Scalable Fire and Smoke Segmentation from Aerial Images Using Convolutional Neural Networks and Quad-Tree Search
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Autonomous systems can help firefighting operations by detecting and locating the fire spot from surveillance images and videos. Similar to many other areas of computer vision, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results for fire and smoke detection and segmentation. In practice, input images to a CNN are usually downsized to fit into the network to avoid computational complexities and restricted memory problems. Although in many applications downsizing is not an issue, in the early phases of fire ignitions downsizing may eliminate the fire regions since the incident regions are small. In this paper, we propose a novel method to segment fire and smoke regions in high resolution images based on a multi-resolution iterative quad-tree search algorithm , which manages the application of classification and segmentation CNNs to focus the attention on informative parts of the image. The proposed method is more computationally efficient compared to processing the whole high resolution input, and contains parameters that can be tuned based on the needed scale precision. The results show that the proposed method is capable of detecting and segmenting fire and smoke with higher accuracy and is useful for segmenting small regions of incident in high resolution aerial images in a computationally efficient way.

TI  - Functional Analysis for Habitat Mapping in a Special Area of Conservation Using Sentinel-2 Time-Series Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The mapping and monitoring of natural and semi-natural habitats are crucial activities and are regulated by European policies and regulations, such as the 92/43/EEC. In the Mediterranean area, which is characterized by high vegetational and environmental diversity, the mapping and monitoring of habitats are particularly difficult and often exclusively based on in situ observations. In this scenario, it is necessary to automate the generation of updated maps to support the decisions of policy makers. At present, the availability of high spatiotemporal resolution data provides new possibilities for improving the mapping and monitoring of habitats. In this work, we present a methodology that, starting from remotely sensed time-series data, generates habitat maps using supervised classification supported by Functional Data Analysis. We constructed the methodology using Sentinel-2 data in the Mediterranean Special Area of Conservation "Gola di Frasassi" (Code: IT5320003). In particular, the training set uses 308 field plots with 11 target classes (five forests, two shrubs, one grassland, one mosaic, one extensive crop, and one urban land). Starting from vegetation index time-series data, Functional Principal Component Analysis was applied to derive FPCA scores and components. In particular, in the classification stage, the FPCA scores are considered as features. The obtained results out-performed a previous map derived from photo-interpretation by domain experts. We obtained an overall accuracy of 85.58% using vegetation index time-series, topography, and lithology data. The main advantages of the proposed approach are the capability to efficiently compress high dimensional data (dense remote-sensing time series) providing results in a compact way (e.g., FPCA scores and mean seasonal time profiles) that: (i) facilitate the link between remote sensing with habitat mapping and monitoring and their ecological interpretation and (ii) could be complementary to species-based approaches in plant community ecology and phytosociology.

TI  - A New Earth Observation Service Based on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Time Series for the Monitoring of Redevelopment Sites in Wallonia, Belgium
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban planning is a challenge, especially when it comes to limiting land take. In former industrial regions such as Wallonia, the presence of a large number of brownfields, here called "redevelopment sites", opens up new opportunities for sustainable urban planning through their revalorization. The Walloon authorities are currently managing an inventory of more than 2200 sites, which requires a significant amount of time and resources to update. In this context, the Sentinel satellites and the Terrascope platform, the Sentinel Collaborative Ground Segment for Belgium, enabled us to deploy SARSAR, an Earth observation service used for the automated monitoring of redevelopment sites that generates regular and automatic change reports that are directly usable by the Walloon authorities. In this paper, we present the methodological aspects and implementation details of the service, which combines two well-known and robust methods: the Pruned Exact Linear Time method for change point detection and threshold-based classification, which assigns the detected changes to three different classes (vegetation, building and soil). The overall accuracy of the system is in the range of 70-90%, depending on the different methods and classes considered. Some remarks on the advantages and possible drawbacks of this approach are also provided.

AB  - Breast and axillary surgery after neoadjuvant systemic treatment for women with breast cancer has undergone multiple paradigm changes within the past years. In this review, we provide a state-of-the-art overview of breast and axillary surgery after neoadjuvant systemic treatment from both, a clinical routine perspective and a clinical research perspective. For axillary disease, axillary lymph node dissection, sentinel lymph node biopsy, or targeted axillary dissection are nowadays recommended depending on the lymph node status before and after neoadjuvant systemic treatment. For the primary tumor in the breast, breast conserving surgery remains the standard of care. The clinical management of exceptional responders to neoadjuvant systemic treatment is a pressing knowledge gap due to the increasing number of patients who achieve a pathologic complete response to neoadjuvant systemic treatment and for whom surgery may have no therapeutic benefit. Current clinical research evaluates whether less invasive procedures can exclude residual cancer after neoadjuvant systemic treatment as reliably as surgery to possibly omit surgery for those patients in the future.

TI  - Soil loss and PM10 emissions from agricultural fields in the Junggar Basin over the past six decades
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Junggar Basin in north Xinjiang Province is regarded as one of the important dust sources in China. There is, however, a lack of information on long-term dust emissions originating from the basin. In these largely agricultural communities, wind erosion is a major concern that results in a threat to sustainable agriculture and environmental quality. This study assesses dust emissions from the agricultural community of the Junggar Basin in north Xinjiang based on soil and land use types extracted from remote sensing data in response to weather and climate over the past six decades. The Wind Erosion Prediction System (WEPS) was used to simulate annual soil loss and PM10 (particulate matter <= 10 mu m in aerodynamic diameter) emissions at 11 meteorological stations across the Junggar Basin. From 1958 to 2018, annual soil loss and PM10 emissions significantly decreased 3.65 and 0.2 kg m-2 y-1, respectively. This decrease was likely due to decreasing wind speed, but also associated with increased precipitation and temperature, and decreased solar radiation. Wind erosion occurred most frequently during April and May, accounting for 39% of the annual soil loss and 40% of the annual PM10 emission. In contrast, no erosion occurred in January, February, and December as a result of low temperature (<-8.6 degrees C), frozen soil conditions, and snow cover. Wind erosion risk appeared to decrease during the past six decades in response to observed climate change across the basin; however the southeast part of the basin experienced increasing wind erosion risk over the six decades. Projects to control wind erosion risk and combat dust emission should be given priority in the southeast part of the basin. Frequency of dust events was compared to simulated erosion; a strong linkage was found between simulated soil loss and frequency of dust storms based on regression analysis. This demonstrated that the modelling was acceptable in the conditions of this study and the results were prone to be reliable.

TI  - Comparative Analysis of "Soft Power" Tools in the Belarusian Higher Education
T2  - CONTEMPORARY EUROPE-SOVREMENNAYA EVROPA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article analyses the mechanisms of "soft power" of the collective West in the Belarusian educational space. The author classifies the main "soft power routes" in the country, describes the processes and identifies programms that contribute to the training of agents of foreign influence both in the country and abroad. The potential danger is posed by the full integration of the national education system into the European educational space, assistance from foundations and diplomatic missions, international cooperation in the implementation of scientific and educational projects, which are financed by government agencies of partner countries, etc. It is concluded that the impact of "soft power" through education has delayed and hardly reversible consequences in the context of ideological challenges and threats to all spheres of national security. Politization of the education sphere leads to the promotion of western values, while Belarusian youth is used as a promotion tool. This impact increases with the usage of social networks and Internet channels. The author gives recommendations on confronting and reducing foreign ideological influence, on increasing the resistance of young people to Western "soft power", which will prevent the "brain drain" to the West and ensure sustainable development of the country. It is necessary to find financial and organisational possibilities to implement Belarusian values and culture, worldview of the Union State of Belarus and Russia.

TI  - Intraoperative prediction of non-sentinel lymph node metastases in breast cancer using cytokeratin 19 mRNA copy number: A retrospective analysis
T2  - MOLECULAR AND CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - One-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) is a molecular procedure used intraoperatively for the detection of sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases. The aim of the present study was to define a cut-off of cytokeratin (CK)19 mRNA copy number predictive of positive completion axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). The OSNA procedure was employed for SLN analysis in 812 patients with Tl-T2 NO breast cancer. A total of 197 patients with SLN metastases were retrospectively analyzed. A total of 40 patients (20%) had non-SLN metastases. Receiver operating characteristics curve analysis established a cut-off of 5,000 CK19 mRNA copy number with 75% sensitivity and 72% specificity. The positive and negative predictive values were 40.5 and 92%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that this cut-off and tumor localization in the outer or lower-outer quadrant of the breast were significantly associated with non-SNL involvement (P<0.001 and P=0.025, respectively). The findings of the present study support the conventional cut-off of 5,000 copies for intraoperative decision to perform ALND, whereas ALND can safely be avoided in patients with tumor located outside the outer or lower-outer quadrant of the breast if the CK19 mRNA copy number is <5,000.

M3  - Book Review
AB  - Matt Taibbi's "Hate, Inc.: Why Today's Media Makes Us Despise Each Other " (OR Books 2021) might make you angry, but it will make you think. Taibbi's takedown of commercial media, now updated in a post-election edition, offers a striking critique of the news media's slow but steady slide toward polarization " horizontal ellipsis skewed by a toxic mix of political and financial considerations " (20). Taibbi convincingly argues, using both historical and modern examples along with personal experience, that the press sells people on a simplified worldview where the two political parties are in a constant and perpetual conflict about everything. While Taibbi does offer some advice for independent-minded journalists seeking to navigate the current media landscape, audiences are left with little in the way of solutions, other than to stop reading (and watching) the news.

AB  - In today's world young people become the object of close attention from various socio-political forces, since an unformed worldview and insufficient experience in social and political analysis represent the very field where one can try to nurture the most exotic interpretations of the reality surrounding us. This article attempts to show the specifics of youth activism in the age of globalization using the example of youth movements for human dignity. In our opinion, stimulating and supporting young people's civic engagement, whether spontaneous or organized into youth movements, has the greatest potential to successfully mobilize young people toward purposeful, conscious and active participation in society and the state. We are convinced that virtually all pro-social youth movements are in one way or other movements for human dignity.

Chlorophyll concentrations at and the number of cyanobacteria cells, relating them to the image processing algorithm of the European Space Agency. Images from European Space Agency's Sentinel 2 satellites were used, with a spatial resolution of 10 m and with Case 2 Regional Coast Color atmospheric correction. Chlorophyll concentrations at data from Companhia Ambiental do Estado de Sao Paulo and those estimated by the algorithm showed high correlation (R-2=0.6052, Normalized Root Mean Square Error=27%, n=8) and were also statistically related to cyanobacteria cells number, which allowed estimating cyanobacteria cells in the number Sentinel 2 images, by means of chlorophyll concentrations. Based on the estimates, Carlos Botelho reservoir showed a eutrophic pattern in the year of 2020; the data suggest the presence and substantial predominance of cyanobacteria in the reservoir in 2020 (a range of 10,000-20,000 cells.mL); in your water, the presence of potentially toxic cyanotoxins has already been found; the reservoir has a public beach, for primary contact recreation; and there are condominiums with houses, clubs, and farms in the surroundings. This set of characteristics should serve as a warning to the local authorities, as there is a need to discuss the monitoring program now underway, with an indication of reducing the monitoring to a minimum of monthly and complementary evaluations, for periodic verification of the presence of cyanotoxins.

TI  - Simulating the spatial and temporal distribution of oil spill over the coral reef environs along the southeast coast of Mauritius: A case study on <i>MV Wakashio</i> vessel wreckage, August 2020
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - An oil spill occurred off Mauritius on 6 August 2020, as merchant vessel (MV) Wakashio, with 3896 tons of heavy fuel oil (HFO) on board, struck the coral reef, causing a significant threat to the coral environment. Approximately 1000 tons of HFO leaked from the vessel. The Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) set-up an oil-spill trajectory model for the Mauritius domain and generated oil drift patterns during the spill period for 1000 tons of HFO. The simulation showed that Mauritius's south-east coast was under threat to receive HFO from the stranded vessel. The simulated oil drift pattern was in good agreement with the oil slick signatures obtained from Sentinel-1A data. The affected zone of coral reef environs during the spill period was also estimated using Sentinel-2 datasets. Our analysis showed that on 8 August the oil spread over 14.58 and 5.52 km(2) of reef flat and algae/seagrass over the reef, respectively. From 15 August onwards, the oil spread gradually decreased and concentrated along the northern coast of Mauritius over mudflat/mud over reef/turbid water zone. On 8 August, the coastal districts of Grand Port and Flacq were highly affected due to oil spillage. The seaward coral reef zones were least affected by oil spill, compared to the coral reefs adjacent to the coast.

AB  - Publicly available Digital Elevation Models (DEM) derived from various space-based platforms (Satellite/Space Shuttle Endeavour) have had a tremendous impact on the quantification of landscape characteristics, and the related processes and products. The accuracy of elevation data from six major public domain satellite-derived Digital Elevation Models (a 30 m grid size-ASTER GDEM version 3 (Ast30), SRTM version 3 (Srt30), CartoDEM version V3R1 (Crt30)-and 90 m grid size-SRTM version 4.1 (Srt90), MERIT (MRT90), and TanDEM-X (TDX90)), as well as the improvement in accuracy achieved by applying a correction (linear fit) using Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) estimates at Ground Control Points (GCPs) is examined in detail. The study area is a hard rock terrain that overall is flat-like with undulating and uneven surfaces (IIT (ISM) Campus and its environs) where the statistical analysis (corrected and uncorrected DEMs), correlation statistics and statistical tests (for elevation and slope), the impact of resampling methods, and the optimum number of GCPs for reduction of error in order to use it in further applications have been presented in detail. As the application of DGPS data at GCPs helps in the substantial reduction of bias by the removal of systematic error, it is recommended that DEMs may be corrected using DGPS before being used in any scientific studies.

TI  - Nonlocal Feature Selection Encoder-Decoder Network for Accurate InSAR Phase Filtering
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate interferometric phase filtering is an essential step in InSAR data processing. The existing deep learning-based phase-filtering methods were developed based on local neighboring pixels and only use local phase information. The idea of nonlocal processing has been proven to be very effective for improving the accuracy of interferometric phase filtering. In this paper, we propose a deep convolutional neural network-based nonlocal InSAR filtering method via a nonlocal phase filtering network (NL-PFNet) based on the encoder-decoder structure and nonlocal feature selection strategy. Thanks to the powerful phase feature extraction ability of the encoder-decoder structure and the utilization of nonlocal phase information, NL-PFNet can predict an accurately filtered interferometric phase after training using a large number of interferometric phase images with different noise levels. Experiments on both simulated and real InSAR data show that the proposed method significantly outperforms three traditional well-established methods and another deep learning-based method. Compared with the InSAR-BM3D filter and another deep learning-based method, the mean square error of the proposed method is 25% and 11% lower when processing simulated data, respectively, and when processing the real Sentinel-1 interferometric phase, the no-reference evaluation metric Q of the proposed method is 25% and 9% higher, respectively. In addition, the running time of the proposed method is tens of times less than that of the traditional filtering methods.

TI  - Uncertainty-Guided Depth Fusion from Multi-View Satellite Images to Improve the Accuracy in Large-Scale DSM Generation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The generation of digital surface models (DSMs) from multi-view high-resolution (VHR) satellite imagery has recently received a great attention due to the increasing availability of such space-based datasets. Existing production-level pipelines primarily adopt a multi-view stereo (MVS) paradigm, which exploit the statistical depth fusion of multiple DSMs generated from individual stereo pairs. To make this process scalable, these depth fusion methods often adopt simple approaches such as the median filter or its variants, which are efficient in computation but lack the flexibility to adapt to heterogenous information of individual pixels. These simple fusion approaches generally discard ancillary information produced by MVS algorithms (such as measurement confidence/uncertainty) that is otherwise extremely useful to enable adaptive fusion. To make use of such information, this paper proposes an efficient and scalable approach that incorporates the matching uncertainty to adaptively guide the fusion process. This seemingly straightforward idea has a higher-level advantage: first, the uncertainty information is obtained from global/semiglobal matching methods, which inherently populate global information of the scene, making the fusion process nonlocal. Secondly, these globally determined uncertainties are operated locally to achieve efficiency for processing large-sized images, making the method extremely practical to implement. The proposed method can exploit results from stereo pairs with small intersection angles to recover details for areas where dense buildings and narrow streets exist, but also to benefit from highly accurate 3D points generated in flat regions under large intersection angles. The proposed method was applied to DSMs generated from Worldview, GeoEye, and Pleiades stereo pairs covering a large area (400 km(2)). Experiments showed that we achieved an RMSE (root-mean-squared error) improvement of approximately 0.1-0.2 m over a typical Median Filter approach for fusion (equivalent to 5-10% of relative accuracy improvement).

TI  - A Comparative Study on Classification Features between High-Resolution and Polarimetric SAR Images through Unsupervised Classification Methods
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Feature extraction and comparison of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data of different modes such as high resolution and full polarization have important guiding significance for SAR image applications. In terms of image and physical domain for higher spatial resolution single-polarized and coarser spatial resolution quad-pol SAR data, this paper analyzes and compares the feature extraction with unsupervised classification methods. We discover the correlation and complementarity between high-resolution image feature and quad-pol physical scattering information. Therefore, we propose an information fusion strategy, that can conduct unsupervised learning of the landcover classes of SAR images obtained from multiple imaging modes. The medium-resolution polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) data and the high-resolution single-polarized data of the Gaofen-3 satellite are adopted for the selected experiments. First, we conduct the Freeman-Durden decomposition and H/alpha-Wishart classification method on PolSAR data for feature extraction and classification, and use the Deep Convolutional Embedding Clustering (DCEC) algorithm on single-polarized data for unsupervised classification. Then, combined with the quantitative evaluation by confusion matrix and mutual information, we analyze the correlation between characteristics of image domain and physics domain and discuss their respective advantages. Finally, based on the analysis, we propose a refined unsupervised classification method combining image information of high-resolution data and physics information of PolSAR data, that optimizes the classification results of both the urban buildings and the vegetation areas. The main contribution of this comparative study is that it promotes the understanding of the landcover classification ability of different SAR imaging modes and also provides some guidance for future work to combine their respective advantages for better image interpretation.

TI  - Evaluation of Sentinel-2/MSI Atmospheric Correction Algorithms over Two Contrasted French Coastal Waters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B satellites, with on-board Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI), and launched on 23 June 2015 and 7 March 2017, respectively, are very useful tools for studying ocean color, even if they were designed for land and vegetation applications. However, the use of these satellites requires a process called "atmospheric correction". This process aims to remove the contribution of the atmosphere from the total top of atmosphere reflectance measured by the remote sensors. For the purpose of assessing this processing, seven atmospheric correction algorithms have been compared over two French coastal regions (English Channel and French Guiana): Image correction for atmospheric effects (iCOR), Atmospheric correction for OLI 'lite' (ACOLITE), Case 2 Regional Coast Colour (C2RCC), Sentinel 2 Correction (Sen2Cor), Polynomial-based algorithm applied to MERIS (Polymer), the standard NASA atmospheric correction (NASA-AC) and the Ocean Color Simultaneous Marine and Aerosol Retrieval Tool (OC-SMART). The satellite-estimated remote-sensing reflectances were spatially and temporally matched with in situ measurements collected by an ASD FieldSpec4 spectrophotometer. Results, based on 28 potential individual match-ups, showed that the best performance processor is OC-SMART with the highest values for the total score S-tot (16.89) and for the coefficient of correlation R-2 (ranging from 0.69 at 443 nm to 0.92 at 665 nm). iCOR and Sen2Cor show the less accurate performances with total score S-tot values of 2.01 and 7.70, respectively. Since the size of the in situ observation platform can be significant compared to the pixel resolution of MSI onboard Sentinel-2, it can create bias in the pixel extraction process. Thus, to study this impact, we used different methods of pixel extraction. However, there are no significant changes in results; some future research may be necessary.

TI  - Acquisition of High Spectral Resolution Diffuse Reflectance Image Cubes (350-2500 nm) from Archaeological Wall Paintings and Other Immovable Heritage Using a Field-Deployable Spatial Scanning Reflectance Spectrometry Hyperspectral System
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - There is growing interest in bringing non-invasive laboratory-based analytical imaging tools to field sites to study wall paintings in order to collect molecular information on the macroscale. Analytical imaging tools, such as reflectance imaging spectrometry, have provided a wealth of information about artist materials and working methods, as well as painting conditions. Currently, scientific analyses of wall paintings have been limited to point-measurement techniques such as reflectance spectroscopy (near-ultraviolet, visible, near-infrared, and mid-infrared), X-ray fluorescence, and Raman spectroscopy. Macroscale data collection methods have been limited to multispectral imaging in reflectance and luminescence modes, which lacks sufficient spectral bands to allow for the mapping and identification of artist materials of interest. The development of laboratory-based reflectance and elemental imaging spectrometers and scanning systems has sparked interest in developing truly portable versions, which can be brought to field sites to study wall paintings where there is insufficient space or electrical power for laboratory instruments. This paper presents the design and testing of a simple hyperspectral system consisting of a 2D spatial spot scanning spectrometer, which provides high spectral resolution diffuse reflectance spectra from 350 to 2500 nm with high signal to noise and moderate spatial resolution (few mm). This spectral range at high spectral resolution was found to provide robust chemical specificity sufficient to identify and map many artists' materials, as well as the byproducts of weathering and conservation coatings across the surface of ancient and Byzantine Cypriot wall paintings. Here, we present a detailed description of the hyperspectral system, its performance, and examples of its use to study wall paintings from Roman tombs in Cyprus. The spectral/spatial image processing workflow to make maps of pigments and constituent painting materials is also discussed. This type of configurable hyperspectral system and the imaging processing workflow offer a new tool for the field study of wall paintings and other immovable heritage.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Surgical Staging for High-Risk Groups of Endometrial Carcinoma Patients
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: In endometrial carcinoma (EC) patients, sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy has shown the potential to reduce post-operative morbidity and long-term complications, and to improve the detection of low-volume metastasis through ultrastaging. However, while it has shown high sensitivity and feasibility in low-risk EC patient groups, its role in high-risk groups is still unclear. Aim: To assess the role of SLN biopsy through the cervical injection of indocyanine green (ICG) in high-risk groups of early-stage EC patients. Materials and methods: Seven electronic databases were searched from their inception to February 2021 for studies that allowed data extraction about detection rate and accuracy of SLN biopsy through the cervical injection of ICG in high-risk groups of early-stage EC patients. We calculated pooled sensitivity, false negative (FN) rate, detection rate of SLN per hemipelvis (DRh), detection rate of SLN per patients (DRp), and bilateral detection rate of SLN (DRb), with 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: Five observational cohort studies (three prospective and two retrospective) assessing 578 high risk EC patients were included. SLN biopsy sensitivity in detecting EC metastasis was 0.90 (95% CI: 0.03-0.95). FN rate was 2.8% (95% CI: 0.6-11.6%). DRh was 88.4% (95% CI: 86-90.5%), DRp was 96.6% (95% CI: 94.7-97.8%), and DRb was 80% (95% CI: 75.4-83.9). Conclusion: SLN biopsy through ICG cervical injection may be routinely adopted instead of systematic pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy in surgical staging for high-risk groups of early-stage EC patients, as well as in low-risk groups.

TI  - Assessment of MV Wakashio oil spill off Mauritius, Indian Ocean through satellite imagery: A case study
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accidental oil spills in the near-shore regions create severe impacts on coastal environments. The bulk carrier MV Wakashio ran aground off Southeastern Mauritius (SEM) on 25 July 2020, resulting in similar to 1000 tons of oil spillage into the Indian Ocean. The Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is used to track and delineate the spilled oil and the affected coastal regions of Mauritius. The results depict that the spilled oil is primarily drifted towards the northwest, and beached along the SEM coastline, covering an area of similar to 24.42 km(2) on 10 August. Within 6 days, the prevailing spill spreading has significantly reduced to similar to 5.1 km(2) (on 16 August) and was almost the same even on 22 August. Subsequently, the spill spreading area has diminished further and more or less disappeared on 15 September. The assessment of SAR imagery corresponding to prevailed winds, tides, Stokes drift and currents illustrated that the spill has primarily drifted northwestwards owing to the force instigated by winds, Stokes drift and tides. This study recommends Sentinel-1 imagery to assess any such oil spill incidents in the future.

TI  - The Geoheritage of Mount Olympus: Ancient Mythology and Modern Geology
T2  - GEOHERITAGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mount Olympos on the border of Thessaly and Central Macedonia (Greece) is the namesake of many mountains over the Earth and even on Mars. The inspiration of Olympos to humanity dates from the earliest settlements of modern peoples at its base (similar to 40,000 years BP) who were witnesses to a period of on-going active glaciation; these inhabitants would have endured the environmental consequences of proximity to the eruption of Thira (Santorini, 1646 BCE); possibly, they also observed a meteor impact. These geologic events can be interpreted from descriptions of activities attributed to the gods in Hesiod's Theogeny (similar to 750 BCE). The incorporation of the mythology of Olympos into the epic tales of Homer and the "Greek Miracle" created a worldview that is significant to the evolution of Western civilization. The geological history of Olympos is perhaps as legendary as its mythology. From a carbonate platform on the Apulian (African) plate with active deposition from the Triassic to Eocene, the rocks of future Olympos were subducted beneath the Pangaean-originated European plate and were then exhumed later in the Cenozoic; the exhumation contact is marked by a ring of blueschist facies rocks and mafic-ultramafic rocks as a remnant of oceanic lithosphere (ophiolitic rocks) at the surface. Cobbles eroded from this exhuming complex found their way to Miocene fluvial depocenters, forming conglomerate formations of Meteora, located similar to 70 km to the SW. Continued uplift of Olympos has created rivers that were considered sacred to the ancient societies, and that contributed to the immense late-Pleistocene cataclysmic release of waters from the inland basin of Thessaly, forming the Vale of Tempe between the mountain of the Olympian gods and Mount Ossa of the Titans. Olympos comprises the oldest National Park of Greece and a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. Despite the significance of Olympos as part of the bedrock of western cultural heritage, as well as the physical geomorphology of Greece, it has yet to be recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage site.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use of radioactive iodine-125 seed (RIS) in breast and/or axillary surgery, in patients with breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC).MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospective study between January 2016 and June 2020. 80 women T1-3,N0-2,M0: 30 RIS marking the breast tumor, 36 both the tumor and the biopsied positive axillary node, and 14 only the axilla. Age: 54.7 ± 11.4 years. Tumor size: 34.1 ± 14.6 mm. Histological type: invasive ductal carcinoma 90.0%. Molecular subtypes: luminal-A 23.8%, luminal-B/HER2- 33.7%, luminal-B/HER2+ 18.8%, HER2+ 7.5%, basal-like 16,2%.RESULTS: Of the 66 patients with RIS marking of the tumor (51 pre-NAC, 15 post-NAC), 92.1% had tumor-free surgical margins, with a specimen volume of 126.7 ± 111.2 cm3. Of the 5 s local excisions, in 3 the resection margin was involved (1 mastectomy). Of the 50 patients N1 with RIS marking (MLN), 44 pre-NAC and 6 post-NAC, MLN was identified in 97.2%: negative 23, positive 26. In 45/50 patients, sentinel node biopsy (SNB) was performed and it was identified in 93.3%: negative 26, positive 16. In 1 case RIS was not placed correctly and SNB was not identified due to non-migration. In 61.9% of the patients, MLN was among the SNB identified in the surgery. In 5 patients with mismatched SNB and MLN, the pathological result of the SNB was negative and the MLN was positive. Axillary lymph node dissection was performed in 53.8% of the patients.CONCLUSION: RIS allow to perform breast-conserving surgery and improve detection of residual axillary disease in patients treated with NAC.

TI  - An Interpretation Approach of Ascending-Descending SAR Data for Landslide Identification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The technique of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) is increasingly employed for landslide detection over large areas, even though the limitations of initial InSAR analysis results have been well acknowledged. Steep terrain in mountainous areas may cause geometric distortions of SAR images, which could affect the accuracy of InSAR analysis results. In addition, due to the existence of massive ground deformation points in the initial InSAR analysis results, accurate landslide recognition from the initial results is challenging. To efficiently identify potential landslide areas from the ascending-descending SAR datasets, this paper presents a novel interpretation approach to analyze the initial time-series InSAR analysis results. Within the context of the proposed approach, SAR visibility analysis, conversion analysis of deformation rates obtained from the time-series InSAR analysis, and spatial analysis and statistics tools for cluster extraction are incorporated. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated through a case study of landslide identification in Danba, a county in Sichuan, China. The potential landslide regions in the study area are identified based on the interpretation of small baseline subset InSAR (SBAS-InSAR) results, obtained with ascending-descending Sentinel-1A datasets. Finally, on the basis of the field survey results, a total of 21 landslides are detected in the potential landslide regions identified, through which the results obtained from the proposed interpretation approach are tested.

TI  - Quantifying Fundamental Vegetation Traits over Europe Using the Sentinel-3 OLCI Catalogue in Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Thanks to the emergence of cloud-computing platforms and the ability of machine learning methods to solve prediction problems efficiently, this work presents a workflow to automate spatiotemporal mapping of essential vegetation traits from Sentinel-3 (S3) imagery. The traits included leaf chlorophyll content (LCC), leaf area index (LAI), fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR), and fractional vegetation cover (FVC), being fundamental for assessing photosynthetic activity on Earth. The workflow involved Gaussian process regression (GPR) algorithms trained on top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance simulations generated by the coupled canopy radiative transfer model (RTM) SCOPE and the atmospheric RTM 6SV. The retrieval models, named to S3-TOA-GPR-1.0, were directly implemented in Google Earth Engine (GEE) to enable the quantification of the traits from TOA data as acquired from the S3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) sensor. Following good to high theoretical validation results with normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) ranging from 5% (FAPAR) to 19% (LAI), a three fold evaluation approach over diverse sites and land cover types was pursued: (1) temporal comparison against LAI and FAPAR products obtained from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for the time window 2016-2020, (2) spatial difference mapping with Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS) estimates, and (3) direct validation using interpolated in situ data from the VALERI network. For all three approaches, promising results were achieved. Selected sites demonstrated coherent seasonal patterns compared to LAI and FAPAR MODIS products, with differences between spatially averaged temporal patterns of only 6.59%. In respect of the spatial mapping comparison, estimates provided by the S3-TOA-GPR-1.0 models indicated highest consistency with FVC and FAPAR CGLS products. Moreover, the direct validation of our S3-TOA-GPR-1.0 models against VALERI estimates indicated good retrieval performance for LAI, FAPAR and FVC. We conclude that our retrieval workflow of spatiotemporal S3 TOA data processing into GEE opens the path towards global monitoring of fundamental vegetation traits, accessible to the whole research community.

TI  - An Object-Based Approach to Map Young Forest and Shrubland Vegetation Based on Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Many remote sensing studies have individually addressed afforestation, forest disturbance and forest regeneration, and considered land use history. However, no single study has simultaneously addressed all of these components that collectively constitute successional stages and pathways of young forest and shrubland at large spatial extents. Our goal was to develop a multi-source, object-based approach that utilized the strengths of Landsat (large spatial extent with good temporal coverage), LiDAR (vegetation height and vertical structure), and aerial imagery (high resolution) to map young forest and shrubland vegetation in a temperate forest. Further, we defined young forest and shrubland vegetation types in terms of vegetation height and structure, to better distinguish them in remote sensing for ecological studies. The multi-source, object-based approach provided an area-adjusted estimate of 42,945 ha of young forest and shrubland vegetation in Connecticut with overall map accuracy of 88.2% (95% CI 2.3%), of which 20,953 ha occurred in complexes >= 2 ha in size. Young forest and shrubland vegetation constituted 3.3% of Connecticut's total land cover and 6.3% of forest cover as of 2018. Although the 2018 estimates are consistent with those of the past 20 years, concerted efforts are needed to restore, maintain, or manage young forest and shrubland vegetation in Connecticut.

TI  - Detailed Mapping of Lava and Ash Deposits at Indonesian Volcanoes by Means of VHR PlanetScope Change Detection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping of lava flows in unvegetated areas of active volcanoes using optical satellite data is challenging due to spectral similarities of volcanic deposits and the surrounding background. Using very high-resolution PlanetScope data, this study introduces a novel object-oriented classification approach for mapping lava flows in both vegetated and unvegetated areas during several eruptive phases of three Indonesian volcanoes (Karangetang 2018/2019, Agung 2017, Krakatau 2018/2019). For this, change detection analysis based on PlanetScope imagery for mapping loss of vegetation due to volcanic activity (e.g., lava flows) is combined with the analysis of changes in texture and brightness, with hydrological runoff modelling and with analysis of thermal anomalies derived from Sentinel-2 or Landsat-8. Qualitative comparison of the mapped lava flows showed good agreement with multispectral false color time series (Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8). Reports of the Global Volcanism Program support the findings, indicating the developed lava mapping approach produces valuable results for monitoring volcanic hazards. Despite the lack of bands in infrared wavelengths, PlanetScope proves beneficial for the assessment of risk and near-real-time monitoring of active volcanoes due to its high spatial (3 m) and temporal resolution (mapping of all subaerial volcanoes on a daily basis).

TI  - An Evaluation of Syndromic Surveillance-Related Practices Among Selected State and Local Health Agencies
T2  - JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH MANAGEMENT AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Context: Syndromic surveillance consists of the systematic collection and use of near real-time data about health-related events for situational awareness and public health action. As syndromic surveillance programs continue to adopt new technologies and expand, it is valuable to evaluate these syndromic surveillance systems and practices to ensure that they meet public health needs. Objective: This assessment's aim is to provide recent information about syndromic surveillance systems and practice characteristics among a group of state and local health departments. Design/Setting: Information was obtained between November 2017 and June 2018 through a telephone survey using an Office of Management and Budget-approved standardized data collection tool. Participants were syndromic surveillance staff from each of 31 state and local health departments participating in the National Syndromic Surveillance Program funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Questions included jurisdictional experience, data sources and analysis systems used, syndromic system data processing characteristics, data quality verification procedures, and surveillance activities conducted with syndromic data. Measures: Practice-specific information such as types of systems and data sources used for syndromic surveillance, data quality monitoring, and uses of data for public health situational awareness (eg, investigating occurrences of or trends in diseases). Results: The survey analysis revealed a wide range of experiences with syndromic surveillance. Participants reported the receipt of data daily or more frequently. Emergency department data were the primary data source; however, other data sources are being integrated into these systems. All health departments routinely monitored data quality. Syndromes of highest priority across the respondents for health events monitoring were influenza-like illness and drug-related syndromes. However, a wide variety of syndromes were reported as priorities across the health departments. Conclusion: Overall, syndromic surveillance was relevantly integrated into the public health surveillance infrastructure. The near real-time nature of the data and its flexibility to monitor different types of health-related issues make it especially useful for public health practitioners. Despite these advances, syndromic surveillance capacity, locally and nationally, must continue to evolve and progress should be monitored to ensure that syndromic surveillance systems and data are optimally able to meet jurisdictional needs.

TI  - Integrating Remote Sensing and Meteorological Data to Predict Wheat Stripe Rust
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wheat stripe rust poses a serious threat to wheat production. An effective prediction method is important for food security. In this study, we developed a prediction model for wheat stripe rust based on vegetation indices and meteorological features. First, based on time-series Sentinel-2 remote sensing images and meteorological data, wheat phenology (jointing date) was estimated using the harmonic analysis of time-series combined with average cumulative temperature. Then, vegetation indices were extracted based on phenological information. Meteorological features were screened using correlation analysis combined with independent t-test analysis. Finally, a random forest (RF) was used to construct a prediction model for wheat stripe rust. The results showed that the RF model using the input combination (phenological information-based vegetation indices and meteorological features) produced a higher prediction accuracy and a kappa coefficient of 88.7% and 0.772, respectively. The prediction model using phenological information-based vegetation indices outperformed the prediction model using single-date image-based vegetation indices, and the overall accuracy improved from 62.9% to 78.4%. These results indicated that the method combining phenological information-based vegetation indices and meteorological features can be used for wheat stripe rust prediction. The results of the prediction model can provide guidance and suggestions for disease prevention in the study area.

To resolve the issue, this paper used the black-necked crane's emergence point data, optical, radar remote sensing data and terrain auxiliary data to obtain the characteristics of habitat and foraging area, and the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model is used to evaluate the habitat suitability of wintering black-necked cranes in Caohai on a fine scale. The results showed that: (1) the use of environmental variables generated by multi-source remote sensing and terrain auxiliary data combined with the MaxEnt to predict the habitat and foraging area of black-necked cranes was excellent, and the Area Under Curve (AUC) values of both were greater than 0. 94. (2) Distance to cultivated land, water, water depth and buildings distance were the main environmental factors affecting the habitat of black-necked cranes, while the main environmental factors that affect the distribution of foraging area were distance to the cultivated land, dominant vegetation, distance to buildings, and water depth. (3) The area of the most suitable area and sub-suitable area for the black-necked cranes habitat and foraging area in Caohai Nature Reserve was relatively small. The sum of the most and sub-suitable areas for habitat and foraging area is 6.404 km<sup>2</sup> and 12. 644 km<sup>2</sup>, respectively, accounting for only 6.43% and 12. 69% of the surveyed area. Through investigations, it was found that the current sources of human disturbance in the nature reserve are mainly tourists and local residents, which potentially threaten the habitat and foraging area of black-necked cranes. Therefore, in order to avoid the degradation of the black-necked cranes habitat and foraging area in the nature reserve, this paper proposed some suggestions, such as to delineate the designated bird watching and shooting places in the nature reserve, enhance the protection awareness of tourists and local residents, and prohibit tourists from entering the habitat privately. These suggestions are expected to promote the protection of black-necked cranes habitat, foraging area and wetland in nature reserves.

TI  - COMPARATIVE ACCURACY ASSESSMENT OF DIGITAL ELEVATION MODELS (SRTM, ALOS WORLD 3D, ASTER GDEM, MERIT DEM) ON THE EXAMPLE OF FOREST AND FLOODLAND ZONES OF THE NATIONAL PARK "NIZHNYAYA KAMA"
T2  - GEOSFERNYE ISSLEDOVANIYA-GEOSPHERE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Digital elevation models are important data sources for solving a number of practical and scientific problems. All available global remote sensing data are digital surface models by definition as they represent an earth surface with all natural and man-made objects on it. At the moment, there is no globally consistent digital terrain model, which is free of building and trees canopy and represents relief itself. A significant contribution to the creation of such models was made by D. Yamazaki et al., presented "Multi-Error-Removed Improved-Terrain DEM" (MERIT DEM). The novelty of this terrain model is that it attempts to remove vegetation bias and other random and systematic errors of the other sources, such as SRTM and ALOS WORLD 3D. The current study was performed to assess the local accuracy of the MERIT DEM, as well as other four open DEMs in comparison to topographical survey data on the example of the forest and floodplain areas. Materials and methods. Accuracy assessment was performed on the example of the National Park "Nizhnyaya Kama", located on the north-east part of the Republic of Tatarstan, Russia (Fig. 1). Four digital elevation models were assessed: SRTM, ASTER GDEM, ALOS WORLD 3D and MERIT DEM. Available data of topographic maps at a scale of 1:100,000 were used as the assessment basis. The topographic data was vectorized and interpolated using Multilevel B-Splines (MBS) (Fig. 2a). A test subset (2,000 points) was sampled from the vectorized topographic data, including contour lines points and single landmark points (Fig. 2b). The test subset was used to calculate accuracy metrics: absolute values of minimal and maximal elevation difference, mean difference, Pearson's correlation coefficient, and root-mean-square error (RMSE). In addition, vertical profiles were extracted from the elevation models. Results. The interpolated elevation model MBS was characterized by the highest accuracy as expected. The RMSE = 1.67, and near-zero mean error allowed to conclude adequate representation of the park's relief. The range of elevation values for the forest areas were 54.27-176.11 m with the mean of 109.39 (Fig 3a). The remote sensed digital elevation models had the lowest accuracies (Table 1). The elevation values were 6.08-15.88 m higher than the actual topographical data. The corrected model MERIT DEM had the lowest error values in comparison to the remote sensed models. Nevertheless, the mean error and RMSE of the MERIT DEM were higher than of the interpolated MBS model. In the floodplain areas the models were ordered in the following order by the increase of the mean elevation: ASTER GDEM (50.1 m) < SRTM (52.3 m) < MBS (55.1 m) < ALOS WORLD 3D (57.2 m) < MERIT DEM (57.4 m). The mean errors and root mean squared errors of the remote sensed DEMs were lower in comparison to the forest areas (Table 2). Conclusion. The results showed that the overall accuracy of open digital elevation models increase in the order of ASTER GDEM < ALOS WORLD 3D < SRTM < MERIT DEM. The vertical profiles showed high noisiness of the ASTER GDEM and ALOS WORLD 3D for the forest and floodplain areas of the park.

TI  - A Case of Benign Breast Inclusions in an Axillary Sentinel Lymph Node Mimicking a Low-Grade Carcinoma
T2  - AJSP-REVIEWS AND REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Benign inclusions in lymph nodes are a rare phenomenon that has been described throughout the body. These foci of nonneoplastic, ectopic tissue in the axillary lymph nodes can mimic low-grade metastatic breast carcinomas and result in a diagnosis of false-positive nodes that would lead to unnecessary treatment. We present a challenging case of a patient with a left breast grade 1 invasive ductal carcinoma undergoing an intraoperative axillary sentinel lymph node frozen-section consultation that contained numerous small tubules in the subcapsular space. The lymph node was interpreted as positive for carcinoma, and the patient underwent an axillary lymph node dissection. On permanent sections, myoepithelial cells and surrounding basement membranes were identified around some of the tubules, and a large, squamous inclusion cyst became visible. Immunohistochemical stains were performed that showed that p63 and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain highlighted myoepithelial cells around the tubules, whereas cytokeratin 5/6 and estrogen receptor stains showed a mosaic pattern of positivity. Combined, these findings supported a revised diagnosis of benign glandular and benign squamous inclusions. This case underscores the importance of thoroughly examining the location and histologic and cytologic features of a low-grade-appearing epithelium before determining lymph node positivity and, if it is unclear, deferring the diagnosis to permanent sections where immunohistochemical stains can be performed. Knowledge of this uncommon finding is important to avoid false-positive results, unnecessary treatments, and their associated comorbidities.

TI  - APPLICATION OF LANDSCAPE METRICS AND OBJECT- ORIENTED REMOTE SENSING TO DETECT THE SPATIAL ARRANGEMENT OF AGRICULTURAL LAND
T2  - QUAESTIONES GEOGRAPHICAE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to investigate crop selection and spatial patterns of agricultural fields in a drought-affected region in Isfahan Province, central Iran. Based on field surveys portraying growth stages of the main crops including wheat, alfalfa, vegetables and fruit trees, three Landsat 8 operational land imager (OLI) images were acquired on March 15 (L1), June 27 (L2) and October 1 (L3), 2015. After performing radiometric and atmospheric corrections, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) maps of the images were produced and introduced to the Multi-Resolution Segmentation algorithm to delineate agricultural fields. An NDVI-based decision algorithm was then developed to identify crops devoted to each field. Finally, a set of landscape metrics including Number of Patches (NP), mean patch size (MPS), mean shape index (MSI), perimeter-to-area ratio (PARA) and Euclidian Nearest Neighborhood Distance (ENN) was utilized to evaluate their respective spatial formation. The results showed that nearly 46% of fields are devoted to wheat indicating that the landscape has been dramatically shifted towards wheat monoculture farming. Moreover, the farmers' inclination to grow crops in large fields (approximate area of 1 ha) with more regular geometric shapes are considered as an effective way of optimising water use efficiency in areas experiencing significant water shortage.

TI  - Translating open-source remote sensing data to crop water productivity improvement actions
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A widely promoted approach to tackle food insecurity and water shortage challenges simultaneously is to enhance crop water productivity (WP). Therefore, multiple international organizations have featured WP improvements as their major policy goal, and substantial public and private investments have been made in this domain. Advances in remote sensing allow accurate, rapid, and cost-effective WP analysis for agricultural monitoring. However, translating the data to actionable information seems fraught with difficulties, as it only provides spatial and temporal variability in WP and no information on the causes of the variability. This paper introduces a standard approach using open-source remote sensing data for diagnosing reasons behind WP variations, comparing high performing fields (bright spots) with low performing fields (hotspots). The framework is applied to a case study on the Bekaa Valley in Lebanon considering wheat, potato and table grapes. Six factors (crop water stress, irrigation uniformity, soil salinity, nitrogen application, crop rotation and soil type) were analysed to identify their influence on WP and yield. This paper reveals that the growth of wheat and potatoes is negatively affected by water stress in the critical crop growth stages, non-uniform irrigation and nitrogen stress. Also, it was found that potatoes grown on clay-loam soil has better WP and yield than potatoes grown loam soil. Such information with regard to WP factors assists practitioners to identify priority areas and actions aiming at cropfield level WP improvement. While acknowledging errors, uncertainties and caveats inherent to the use of remote sensing data, this paper shows the feasibility and practical usefulness of the diagnostic framework.

TI  - Improving nutrition budgeting in health sector plans: Evidence from India's anaemia control strategy
T2  - MATERNAL AND CHILD NUTRITION
M3  - Article
AB  - In India, 15 nutrition interventions are delivered and financed through the National Health Mission (NHM). Programmatic know-how, however, on tracking nutrition budgets in health sector plans is limited. Following the four phases of the budget cycle-planning, allocations, disbursements and expenditure, this paper presents a new method developed by the authors to track nutrition budgets within health sector plans. Using the example of the Anemia Mukt Bharat (AMB) or Anemia Free India strategy, it reports preliminary findings on the application of the first two phases of the method, that is, to track and act for improved planning and allocations, covering 12 states. The paper lists out the budget heads, cost norms and developed tools to plan adequately. Supportive action was undertaken through sharing trends and trainings for AMB's budgeting to create opportunities for improvements. It was observed that the AMB budget increased over 3 years despite the COVID situation. It increased from INR 6184 million in FY 2019-2020 to INR 6293 million, a 2% increase in FY 2020-2021, and to INR 7433 million, an 18% increase in FY 2021-2022. The difference in allocations and planned budgets were low (16%, 4% and 11%, respectively) while the difference in required budgets and planned budgets were significant but reduced consistently (41%, 31% and 22%, respectively). The paper concludes that the methods adopted for tracking and acting for improved nutrition budgets helped in informing national and state governments regarding yearly trends. Such methods can be effective and be developed for other nutrition interventions.

TI  - SOCIAL FOCUS OF THE EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITY IN THE UNIVERSITY: DECLARATION OF PURPOSES AND PRACTICE
T2  - OBRAZOVANIE I NAUKA-EDUCATION AND SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction. These days, destructive manifestations among young people can be observed, and the main reason for it may be the global value and worldview crisis. It consists in the discrepancy of ideals, values, beliefs, knowledge to the tasks of overcoming the instability of modern civilisation. Due to this, there is a need to update the educational questions, which have a so-called "social focus". Among these are: developing the "human" in a person, overcoming disunity (e.g. egoism, individualism), developing social responsibility, etc. In this regard, two factors are of an urgent nature: firstly, systematic studies of the students' socio-cultural identity, and, secondly, the study of the university socio-cultural environment, which influences overcoming the negative consequences of individualism and disunity in the university environment. The focus on the social side of education presupposes the formation of value community in the university environment, while the characteristics of the socio-cultural identity of the members in educational activity and the consideration of research results in practice become decisive.Aim. The aim of the present research work was to identify the conditions of extra-curricular educational activities. These conditions contribute to the formation of a value community in the university environment based on common spiritual and moral ideas. The specific objectives of the research are related to the following aspects: identification of the dominant conceptual approaches to the implementation of educational activities in the system of modern Russian higher education (with a focus on the social focus demanded by society); determination of the differentiated composition of the subjects of educational activity as one of the factors, which determine the cultural identification of students and the development of communities in the socio-cultural environment; establishment of the relevance of diagnostic tools which allow students to track the development of positive social qualities; the disclosure of the general orientation of educational activities in extra-curricular time with social and personal focus.Methodology, methods and techniques. In the course of the research, a qualitative and quantitative content analysis of educational work programmes in 12 universities (multi-profile, humanities and technical) from different regions of the Russian Federation was carried out. The research is based on the environmental approach in education. The research is based on the methodology of the environmental approach in pedagogy and the idea of the event-based mechanism of education. The interpretations of the social focus of students' world outlook orientations are based on the theory of basic personal values.Results. The conditions of extra-curricular educational activity are revealed: goal-setting of extra-curricular activities, which has a predominantly social focus; correspondence of the content of educational activities to the tasks of overcoming individualism and disunity; consideration of the differentiated composition of the subjects of educational activity. The authors posed the scientific problem for a diagnostic apparatus that allows universities to track the process and results of educational work aimed at the development of social values.Scientific novelty. The authors have made a proposal on the need to take into account the differentiated set of members of educational activity with a focus on public interests in priority.Practical significance. The conclusions, which justify the need to consider the moral and ideological positions in order to achieve results in the development of the socially focused qualities, may be of interest to specialists involved in designing and organising educational activities in universities.

TI  - Integrating Ecosystem Vulnerability in the Environmental Regulation Plan of Izmir (Turkey)-What Are the Limits and Potentialities?
T2  - URBAN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The land-use regulatory framework in Turkey is composed of several hierarchical plans. The Environmental Regulation Plan pursues comprehensive planning management, which ranges between 1/100,000 and 1/25,000 and defines the framework for local master plans. Unfortunately, there is scarce knowledge of how these plans effectively protect the environment. Besides, these plans have poor consideration of socio-economic dynamics and the ecosystem vulnerability, while evaluating the actual conflicts or synergies within the localization of ecological conservation and settlement expansion areas. In this work, an ecosystem-based geodatabase was created for the western Izmir area (Turkey). The dataset has been created by employing a supervised classification sampling of Sentinel-2 images acquired on 28 March 2021, while accessing ONDA-DIAS services to L2C products. Then, the InVEST software was used to map the Habitat Quality and the Habitat Decay, while the ArcMap raster analysis tool was employed to generate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. The results were used to classify the ecosystem vulnerability of the western metropolitan area of Izmir and then superimposed to the Environmental Regulation Plan of the city of Izmir (2021), thus evaluating synergies and conflicts. Although integration of the ecosystem services approach into spatial planning is lacking in the planning practice of Turkey, the paper provides an operative methodology to integrate ecosystem evaluation in environmental planning as a basic strategy to support sustainable development.

TI  - Cloud cover and its impact on Brazil's deforestation satellite monitoring program: Evidence from the cerrado biome of the Brazilian Legal Amazon
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The creation of a satellite rapid alert programme (DETER-A) in 2004 was a cornerstone of the Brazilian government's strategy to reduce deforestation. This programme allowed authorities to detect and respond rapidly to periods of deforestation. Due to the fact that the policy instrument was based on multispectral remote radar, weather-related obstacles posed a continuous impediment to the study of deforestation. This paper investigates to what extent cloud cover has reduced the effectiveness of the DETER-A program to detect deforestation. To test this hypothesis, survival model analysis is undertaken on satellite data derived measures of local deforestation. The emphasis is on the state of Maranhao, which is separated into two areas by an arbitrary line of demarcation (Legal Amazon delimitation) where the forest on one side is covered by the satellite monitoring program while the other is not. The results suggest that following the implementation of the satellite monitoring program, there was more deforestation in those years with more cloud persistence in the area covered by the program. Counterfactual simulations indicate that the absence of clouds would have prevented deforestation equivalent to almost 7% of the study region, which is equivalent to 73 million tonnes of CO2 with a value of US$ 366 million. If the current monitoring system was replaced with the experimental policy instrument DETER-C/DETER INTENSO, cloud cover would be less of an impediment to deforestation detection.

TI  - Land Cover Dynamics along the Urban-Rural Gradient of the Port-au-Prince Agglomeration (Republic of Haiti) from 1986 to 2021
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The landscape of the Port-au-Prince agglomeration in the Republic of Haiti has undergone profound changes linked to (peri-)urban expansion supported by rapid demographic growth. We quantify the land cover dynamics along the urban-rural gradient of the Port-au-Prince agglomeration using Landsat images from 1986, 1998, 1999, 2010, and 2021 coupled with geographic information systems and landscape ecology analysis tools. The results show that over 35 years the acreage of the urban zone increased seven-fold while that of the peri-urban area increased five-fold, to the detriment of the rural zone, which was reduced by 14%. The dynamics of the landscape composition along the urban-rural gradient are characterized by a rapid progression of built-up and bare land in urban and peri-urban zones and by fields in the rural zone, in contrast to the more accentuated regression of vegetation in the peri-urban zone. The landscape of the study area has undergone significant changes due to the high demand for housing resulting from rapid population growth, in the context of a lack of territorial development planning by public authorities. This impacts the sustainability of socio-economic and ecological processes in an area where populations are highly dependent on plant resources. Our results underline the necessity to orient territorial development planning in urban, peri-urban and rural zones through an integrated and participatory approach.

TI  - Potential Sea Level Rise Impacts in Acapulco Diamante, Mexico
T2  - CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The potential impacts of sea level in the study region are presented using the Integrated Procedure for Estimate Sea Level Impacts (IPESLI), made up of Landsat images, official databases, and design software for geographic information systems. IPESLI is useful in areas with little georeferenced and validated information. The sea level projections are based on the climate projections, which incorporate the possible attenuation of the ice sheet near the upper end of Antarctica. Flood risk statistics were used to simulate the frequency of extreme flooding across the planet. The IPESLI was calibrated using seven field visits to compare the height values generated by the digital elevation model against the in situ data. The inundation maps generated in the study can be used to find the most vulnerable areas and initiate decision making for coastal adaptation. The IPESLI procedure has the potential to contribute to the formation of a communication bridge between climate change science and policy makers. The projection is profound for all scenarios, but it is particularly devastating for the Acapulco Diamante area if we start with the worst future climate scenario (SSP5-RCP8.5).

TI  - Characterizing Undernourished Children Under-Five Years Old with Diarrhoea in Mozambique: A Hospital Based Cross-Sectional Study, 2015-2019
T2  - NUTRIENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Diarrhoea is associated with undernutrition and this association is related to increased morbidity and mortality in children under-five. In this analysis we aimed to assess the frequency and associated factors of undernutrition in children under-five with diarrhoea. A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted from January 2015 to December 2019 through a surveillance system in five sentinel hospitals in Mozambique. Sociodemographic and clinical information was collected, including anthropometry. A total of 963 children were analysed. The overall undernutrition frequency was 54.1% (95% CI: 50.9-57.2), with 32.5% (95% CI: 29.6-35.5) stunting, 26.6% (95% CI: 23.9-29.6) wasting and 24.7% (95% CI: 22.1-27.5) underweight. Children from Nampula province had 4.7 (p = 0.016) higher odds for stunting compared with children from Maputo. Children whose caregiver was illiterate had higher odds of being underweight 5.24 (p < 0.001), and the wet season was associated with higher odds 1.70 (p = 0.012) of being wasted. Children born under 2500 g of weight had 2.8 (p = 0.001), 2.7 (p < 0.001) and 2.6 (p = 0.010) higher odds for being underweighted, wasted and stunted, respectively. The HIV positive status of the children was associated with higher odds of being underweight 2.6 (p = 0.006), and stunted 3.4 (p = 0.004). The province, caregiver education level, wet season, child's birthweight and HIV status were factors associated with undernutrition in children with diarrhoea. These findings emphasise the need for additional caregiver's education on the child's nutrition and associated infectious diseases. More studies are needed to better understand the social context in which a child with diarrhoea and undernutrition is inserted.

TI  - Crop Monitoring Strategy Based on Remote Sensing Data (Sentinel-2 and Planet), Study Case in a Rice Field after Applying Glycinebetaine
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - World agriculture is facing a great challenge since it is necessary to find a sustainable way to increase food production. Current trends in advancing the agriculture sector are based on leveraging remote sensing technology and the use of biostimulants. However, the efficient implementation of both of these on a commercial scale for the purposes of productivity improvement remains a challenge. Thus, by proposing a crop monitoring strategy based on remote sensing data, this paper aims to verify and anticipate the impact of applying a Glycinebetaine biostimulant (GB) on the final yield. The study was carried out in a rice-producing area in Eastern Spain (Valencia) in 2021. GB was applied by drone 33 days after sowing (tillering phase). Phenology was monitored and crop production parameters were determined. Regarding satellite data, Sentinel-2 cloud-free images were obtained from sowing to harvest, using the bands at 10 m. Planet data were used to evaluate the results from Sentinel-2. The results show that GB applied 33 days after sowing improves both crop productive parameters and commercial yield (13.06% increase). The design of the proposed monitoring strategy was based on the dynamics and correlations between the visible (green and red) and NIR bands. The analysis showed differences when comparing the GB and control areas, and permitted the determination of the moment in which the effect of GB on yield (tillering and maturity) may be greater. In addition, an index was constructed to verify the crop monitoring strategy, its mathematical expression being: NCMI = (NIR - (red + green))/(NIR + red + green). Compared with the other VIs (NDVI, GNDVI and EVI2), the NCMI presents a greater sensitivity to changes in the green, red and NIR bands, a lower saturation phenomenon than NDVI and a better monitoring of rice phenology and management than GNDVI and EVI2. These results were evaluated with Planet images, obtaining similar results. In conclusion, in this study, we confirm the improvement in rice crop productivity by improving sustainable plant nutrition with the use of biostimulants and by increasing the components that define crop yield (productive tillers, spikelets and grains). Additionally, crop monitoring using remote sensing technology permits the anticipation and understanding of the productive behavior and the evolution of the phenological stages of the crop, in accordance with crop management.

TI  - Atypical Ductal Hyperplasia-Ductal Carcinoma In Situ Spectrum: Diagnostic Considerations and Treatment Impact in the Era of Deescalation.
T2  - Surgical pathology clinics
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - As the first node in treatment algorithms for breast disease, pathologists have the potential to play a critical role in refining appropriate therapy for lesions in the atypical ducal hyperplasia-ductal carcinoma in situ (ADH-DCIS) spectrum by conservatively approaching diagnosis of lesions limited in size on core needle biopsy. Appropriate efforts to downgrade the diagnosis of lesions at the borderline of ADH and DCIS will certainly lead to more breast conservation and avoid the common morbidities of mastectomy, sentinel node biopsy, and radiation therapy. Whether results of clinical trials of active surveillance will successfully identify a subset of women who may successfully forgo even limited breast-conserving surgery is eagerly anticipated. Given the increasing concern that a significant number of women with DCIS are overtreated, identification of patients at very low risk for progression who may forgo surgery and radiation therapy safely is of significant interest.

TI  - Dynamics of the Swedish forest carbon pool between 2010 and 2015 estimated from satellite L-band SAR observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of carbon stocks in forests and tracking their dynamics over time requires repeated and spatially dense observations. Sweden is one of the major forested countries on Earth with a carbon pool of approximately 1 PgC. Statistics on forest resources are regularly quantified by data collected at field inventory plots by the Swedish National Forest Inventory (NFI). Nonetheless, the sampling by the inventory does not provide detailed spatial knowledge of carbon stored in forests. Thanks to one of the worldwide densest datasets of L-band satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images collected over the years, we assessed the estimation of carbon density on two years, i.e., 2010 and 2015, at pixel (25 m), landscape, county and national level, and investigated the reliability of changes over five years. While the maps of carbon density were obtained with a well-established approach, the uncertainty of the estimates were obtained with a novel procedure that accounted for observational variances and co-variances. The high spatial resolution of the maps revealed the small-scale patterns of carbon density in Swedish forests. However, the substantial uncertainties at the pixel level (25%-62% of the estimated value) prevented from a reliable estimate of carbon density difference at the pixel level. Average values at landscape and county scale were instead unbiased and in strong agreement with corresponding numbers from the Swedish NFI. The uncertainty at county level was between 3% and 12% of the reference mean value. Overall, the net carbon balance for Sweden was positive, with a magnitude comparable to estimates derived from data collected by the NFI. Between 2010 and 2015, Swedish forests acted as a carbon sink, with a net increase of carbon stocks by 2.5%. The high level of confidence in our results indicate that satellite L-band observations are potentially suitable for tracking large-scale forest carbon dynamics in boreal forests provided that multiple observations are available per year and that they are acquired with the same viewing geometry.

TI  - Application of remote sensing to analyze the loss of natural vegetation in the Jalapao Mosaic (Brazil) before and after the creation of protected area (1970-2018)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to map the changes in land use and land cover between 1970 and 2018, analyzing the influence of the protected area s (PAs) in the Cerrado biome, specifically in the area of the Jalapao Mosaic. Images from the Landsat 1-MSS, 5-TM, and 8-OLI satellites were used and processed in SPRING and ArcGIS software. The analyses were based on three approaches: (1) the boundary of the Jalapao Mosaic, (2) the PAs, and (3) a comparison between the PAs and their surroundings. The Jalapao Mosaic results demonstrated that 26% ( approximately equal to 8410 km(2)) of the area was burned, and 15.5% (4971 km(2)) was anthropized in at least one of the analyzed periods. Among the PAs, the Serra Geral do Tocantins Ecological Station (Integral Protection) presented the largest burned area (43.7% approximately equal to 3095 km(2)); however, there was no significant increase in the anthropized areas due to fire. Meanwhile, the anthropized areas in the Rio Preto and Serra da Tabatinga Environmental Protection Areas (Sustainable Use) increased by 27.5% and by 75%, respectively, due to agricultural expansion. By analyzing the two groups of PAs and their surroundings, it was observed that the loss of natural vegetation was restrained and fires were less intense in the Integral Protection Units; in the Sustainable Use Units, there was a significant increase in the anthropized areas. Furthermore, over 70% of the anthropized areas occurred in the surrounding areas, thus showing the importance of creating PAs.

TI  - Flashy river channel migration and its impact in the Jiadhal river basin of Eastern Himalaya, Assam, India: A long term assessment (1928-2010)
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - River channel migration is a disastrous phenomenon in many parts of the world. It results in large-scale damage to the infrastructure, loss of lives and significantly affects livelihood. It also brings rapid and random changes in land use and land cover (LULC). Jiadhal river is a river of this kind in eastern India. It experiences frequent flooding and channel migration. Thus, the study of river thalweg and bank line migration and its consequences on LULC is pertinent from planning and management perspectives. We utilized topographic maps and multi-temporal satellite data to analyze river channel migration and LULC change dynamics for 1928-2010. We divided the river basin area into 12 segments and measured the thalweg about bank line migration of channels in each segment using the Arc GIS measuring tool. Results show that the riverbank line frequently migrated with maximum migration of 20.56 km in segment A5 during 1967-1973. Moreover, river thalweg migrated 45.6 and 52.6 m/year in segments A11 and A12 from 1928 to 2018. It has been noticed that significant LULC changes occurred during 1967-1973 and 1990-2000. This change might be due to the impact of river channel migration. Mainly, the LULC change was more prevalent in built-up and agriculture classes. We measured a change of 125 ha settlement area during 1967-1973 and 1152 ha agriculture land during 1990-2000 to the river area.

TI  - Merging of the Case 2 Regional Coast Colour and Maximum-Peak Height chlorophyll-a algorithms: validation and demonstration of satellite-derived retrievals across US lakes
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Water quality monitoring is relevant for protecting the designated, or beneficial uses, of water such as drinking, aquatic life, recreation, irrigation, and food supply that support the economy, human well-being, and aquatic ecosystem health. Managing finite water resources to support these designated uses requires information on water quality so that managers can make sustainable decisions. Chlorophyll-a (chl-a, mu g L-1) concentration can serve as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass and may be used as an indicator of increased anthropogenic nutrient stress. Satellite remote sensing may present a complement to in situ measures for assessments of water quality through the retrieval of chl-a with in-water algorithms. Validation of chl-a algorithms across US lakes improves algorithm maturity relevant for monitoring applications. This study compares performance of the Case 2 Regional Coast Colour (C2RCC) chl-a retrieval algorithm, a revised version of the Maximum-Peak Height (MPH(P)) algorithm, and three scenarios merging these two approaches. Satellite data were retrieved from the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) and the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI), while field observations were obtained from 181 lakes matched with U.S. Water Quality Portal chl-a data. The best performance based on mean absolute multiplicative error (MAE(mult)) was demonstrated by the merged algorithm referred to as C-15-M-10 (MAE(mult) = 1.8, bias(mult) = 0.97, n = 836). In the C-15-M-10 algorithm, the MPH(P) chl-a value was retained if it was > 10 mu g L-1; if the MPH(P) value was <= 10 mu g L-1, the C2RCC value was selected, as long as that value was < 15 mu g L-1. Time-series and lake-wide gradients compared against independent assessments from Lake Champlain and long-term ecological research stations in Wisconsin were used as complementary examples supporting water quality reporting requirements. Trophic state assessments for Wisconsin lakes provided examples in support of inland water quality monitoring applications. This study presents and assesses merged adaptations of chl-a algorithms previously reported independently. Additionally, it contributes to the transition of chl-a algorithm maturity by quantifying error statistics for a number of locations and times.

M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents the theory of sainthood found in the writings of Dawud al-Qaysari (d. 751/1350), a major commentator on the Sufi thought of Ibn Arabi (d. 638/1240). Building on previous philosophical interpretations of Ibn Arabi's thought to systematize the worldview now known as the "Oneness of Being" (wahdat al-wujud), Qaysari also developed a sophisticated theory of sainthood that not only described, but explained in detail what a saint was, how to become one, and what made the methods for doing so effective. After a historical introduction, I examine the principles of Qaysari's hagiology in the broader context of his worldview, with special attention to his innovative use of philosophical language. Finally, my analysis of the spiritual path in Qaysari's writings shows the consistency with which his account of Sufi wayfaring reflects these principles, according to which the acquisition of sainthood was a journey from the particular to the universal.

TI  - An ensemble neural network atmospheric correction for Sentinel-3 OLCI over coastal waters providing inherent model uncertainty estimation and sensor noise propagation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate atmospheric correction (AC) is a prerequisite for quantitative ocean colour remote sensing and remains a challenge in particular over coastal waters. Commonly AC algorithms are validated by establishing a mean retrieval error from match-up analysis, which compares the satellite-derived surface reflectance with concurrent ground radiometric observations. Pixel-based reflectance uncertainties however, are rarely provided by AC algorithms and those for the operational Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) marine reflectance product are not yet recommended for use. AC retrieval errors and uncertainties directly determine the quality with which ocean colour products can be estimated from the marine surface reflectance. Increasingly there is also the need for reflectance uncertainty products to be used as data assimilation inputs into biogeochemical models.This paper describes the development of a new coastal AC algorithm for Sentinel-3 OLCI that provides pixel based estimation of the inherent model inversion uncertainty and sensor noise propagation. The algorithm is a full-spectral model-based inversion of radiative transfer (RT) simulations in a coupled atmosphere-ocean system using an ensemble of artificial neural networks (ANN) that were initialized differently during the training process, but composed of the same network architecture. The algorithm has been validated against in-situ radiometric observations across a wide range of optical water types, and has been compared with the latest EUMETSAT operational Level 2 processor IPF-OL-2 v7.01.In this analysis we found that the ensemble ANN showed improved performance over the operational Level 2 processor with a band-averaged (412-708 nm) mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 16% compared to 37% and a four-times lower band-averaged bias of -0.00045 sr(-1).In the ensemble inversion process we account for three uncertainty components: (1) the total model variance that describes the variance of the data from the different ANNs, (2) the prediction variance of the mean, which is based on calculations of the RT simulations and (3) the instrument noise variance of the mean by propagating the OLCI spectral signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). To study algorithm performance and to quantify the contribution of the different uncertainty components to the total uncertainty, we applied the algorithm to an optically complex full resolution (FR) test scene covering coastal waters of the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. The uncertainties associated with the instrument noise variance were found to be two orders of magnitude lower than the uncertainty components of the prediction and total model variances. The overall largest uncertainty component in our uncertainty framework is attributed to the total model inversion error from averaging the responses of the slightly different adapted networks in the ensemble. The algorithm is made publicly available as a Python/C plugin for the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP).

TI  - The Influence of Wetting Agent and Type of Nozzle on Copper Hydroxide Deposit on Sugar Beet Leaves (<i>Beta vulgaris</i> L.)
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Protective fungicides are sensitive to environmental conditions such as rainfall and solar radiation. Therefore, it is important to prolong the biological activity and fungicide resistance to the above-mentioned factors that can be achieved by adding a wetting agent to the working solution. Additionally, the quality and efficiency of preventive contact fungicides significantly depend on the application technique. Thus, it is important to make the right choice of the nozzles and adjust the working parameters of the treatment. The aim of this work is to determine the influence of a wetting agent and type of nozzle on copper hydroxide (2 L ha(-2)) deposits on sugar beet leaves. Experiments are set up under laboratory and field conditions. A pinole-based wetting agent is applied at three rates (0.3, 0.6, and 1.0 L ha(-1)) and two types of nozzles are used (standard with flat jet and modern turbo-drop twin-jet). A brilliant blue tracer is added to a working solution to enable the measurement of copper hydroxide deposits. The deposit amount is recorded before and after the rain simulation (15 L m(-2)) with a spectrophotometer light beam. In order to ensure the timeliness of the application of fungicides, remote sensing of vegetative indices is used as an indicator of disease occurrence. The results indicated an increase in copper hydroxide deposits with the increase in wetting agent rates for both types of nozzles and in both laboratory and field experiments. Moreover, when applying the copper hydroxide mixtures with modern turbo drop nozzles, the increase in copper hydroxide deposit is significant, compared to the standard nozzles.

T2  - REVISTA ENTRELINGUAS
M3  - Article
AB  - The study discusses some aspects of sports communication and linguistic worldview with due regard to national and cultural parameters. In particular, the authors of the article study sport phraseological units with coloronim-components in Russian and French. They describe various components of sports worldview in two linguistic cultures, whose key element is the linguistic personality of a common native speaker. Empirical data are analyzed and interpreted on the basis of the linguo-semiotic approach, i.e., within the framework of a discourse statement and at the level of the nominative fund of Russian and French. Sports terms are considered at the level of general linguistic and ethno-cultural dominants of national jargons. The hypothesis is that the structure of any discourse is based on the use of professional and jargon (in particular sports) terms. Their semantics correlates with the linguistic self-identification of each nation.

TI  - A comprehensive investigation of vortex-induced vibrations and flow-induced rotation of an elliptic cylinder
T2  - PHYSICS OF FLUIDS
M3  - Article
AB  - This work finds its motivation in heat exchanger design and flow control. Flow-induced vibration is studied numerically for combined vortex-induced vibrations and vortex-induced rotations of a horizontally positioned elliptic cylinder. The aspect ratio is taken as 2, and the value of reduced velocities (U-red) considered for the present simulation is between 2 and 12. The body can have to and fro motions in a transverse (y) direction, in-line (x) direction as well as in azimuthal ( theta) direction, which provides three degrees of freedom (DOF) to the body. It is found that for one-DOF (y-direction only) and two-DOF (y and x directions) cases, lock-in regions are the same while it is wider for the case of the three-DOF system. With the rotational DOF, y-directional motion is amplified and when it is compared with the one-DOF and two-DOF cases, difference in peak amplitude is about 30%. The rotational response reaches a maximum value within the synchronization regime, and the frequency behavior of rotational and transverse oscillations is showing the same characteristics. The phase difference is plotted to check their synchronization with respective forces and moments. For all DOFs and U-red, synchronized or desynchronized regions, 2S mode of vortex shedding was observed. For one-DOF and two-DOF cases, the transverse vibrational frequency ratio (f(y)/f(n)) becomes equal to unity for the range 3.75 & LE; U-red & LE; 5. For three-DOF, f(y)/f(n) and rotational frequency ratio (f(R)/f(n)) become close to the unity for 3.75 & LE; U-red & LE; 6. The three-DOF system shows smaller wake width and vortex formation length whereas the vortex strength is maximum.

TI  - Spatio-temporal distribution of sea-ice thickness using a machine learning approach with Google Earth Engine and Sentinel-1 GRD data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of ice thickness and its distribution is of great interest to plan ship and offshore operations in ice areas. It is also a major direct factor in climate change. However, it is currently the most inaccurate sea-ice parameter according to a large majority of the scientific community. Satellite-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data are highly valuable for monitoring daily ice-covered oceans. In this study, we develop a new technique based on a machine learning Random Forest (RF) regression approach using the combination of the in-situ thickness measurements and the backscattering information from Sentinel-1 to retrieve the level first-year ice (FYI) thickness. By applying the technique over the Sentinel-1 ground range detected (GRD) data set available in Google Earth Engine (GEE) over the Beaufort Sea spanning a time period from Apr 2015 to Sep 2018, a thickness of up to 1.5 m with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 22 cm is retrieved.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Cloud Properties Based on Visible-to-Infrared Channel Observation from Passive Remote Sensing Satellites
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds are the main regulators of Earth's radiation budget, water cycle, and biochemical cycle. Since the launch of the first human meteorological satellite (TIROS) in 1960, passive satellite remote sensing has developed into one of the most efficient means to obtain cloud observation data. Passive satellites have the characteristics of large observation range and long time span, in which the remote sensing imagers using visible and infrared bands (0.40-15 mu m) have higher spatial and temporal resolution than hyperspectral and microwave imagers. First, summarizes the observation characteristics of passive satellite observation sensors based on visible and infrared bands for three types of sensors (multispectral imagers, multi-angle polarization imagers onboard polar-orbiting satellites and multispectral imagers onboard the new generation geostationary satellites) are summarized. Then, the principles and application methods for cloud parameters such as cloud detection, cloud phase, cloud top parameters, cloud optical and microphysical parameters are introduced. Finally, some thoughts are provided for the remote sensing study of cloud characteristics of passive satellite visible and infrared data through summary and prospect.

TI  - A Deep-Neural-Network-Based Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) Retrieval from Landsat-8 Top of Atmosphere Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The 30 m resolution Landsat data have been used for high resolution aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieval based on radiative transfer models. In this paper, a Landsat-8 AOD retrieval algorithm is proposed based on the deep neural network (DNN). A total of 6390 samples were obtained for model training and validation by collocating 8 years of Landsat-8 top of atmosphere (TOA) data and aerosol robotic network (AERONET) AOD data acquired from 329 AERONET stations over 30 degrees W-160 degrees E and 60 degrees N-60 degrees S. The Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud-computing platform is used for the collocation to avoid a large download volume of Landsat data. Seventeen predictor variables were used to estimate AOD at 500 nm, including the seven bands TOA reflectance, two bands TOA brightness (BT), solar and viewing zenith and azimuth angles, scattering angle, digital elevation model (DEM), and the meteorological reanalysis total columnar water vapor and ozone concentration. The leave-one-station-out cross-validation showed that the estimated AOD agreed well with AERONET AOD with a correlation coefficient of 0.83, root-mean-square error of 0.15, and approximately 61% AOD retrievals within 0.05 + 20% of the AERONET AOD. Theoretical comparisons with the physical-based methods and the adaptation of the developed DNN method to Sentinel-2 TOA data with a different spectral band configuration are discussed.

TI  - A Qualitative Assessment of the Trends, Distribution and Sources of Methane in South Africa
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Methane (CH4) is the second most important greenhouse gas (GHG) in terms of its concentration and impact on the climate. In the present study, we investigate the trends, sources and distribution of CH4 in South Africa. The study uses satellite datasets from Sentinel-5P and the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS). The study also uses credible datasets from the World Bank, Statistics South Africa and the Global Methane Initiative (GMI). The results show an increasing trend of CH4 from 1970-1989. A turning point is observed in 1989, where a decreasing trend is observed from 1989-2001. An increasing trend is then observed from 2001 to 2021. A high concentration of CH4 is observed in the northern and interior parts of South Africa. The results also show that CH4 concentration is influenced by seasonal variations. The September-October-November (SON) season has the highest CH4 concentration distribution in South Africa. The World Bank, Statistics South Africa and the GMI CH4 indictors show that agricultural activities, i.e., involving livestock, are the greatest emitters of CH4 in South Africa, followed by landfill sites. From the livestock data, sheep are the highest emitters of CH4. The increasing CH4 trend is a concern and efforts need to be made to drastically reduce emissions, if South Africa is to meet the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, 2015 Paris Agreement, sustainable development goal 13 (SDG 13) and the COP26 outcome agreements.

TI  - LEXICO-SEMANTIC SPHERE OF MENTALITY IN POETIC TEXTS OF IGOR SEVERYANIN
T2  - VESTNIK SLAVIANSKIKH KULTUR-BULLETIN OF SLAVIC CULTURES-SCIENTIFIC AND INFORMATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper highlights the development of mental semantics in polysemic words in Igor Severyanin's poetry. The vocabulary of the mental sphere is studied by Russian and foreign scientists, specialists in the field of semantics and related disciplines, since it is through its use that the worldview of nations and their representatives, native speakers, is reflected in language. Frequent use of a word's figurative mental meaning in language makes such a lexico-semantic variant (LSV) commonplace, and leads to the fixation of this new seme in the explanatory dictionary. However, fictional (especially poetic) speech is characterized by greater variability of meanings. Via the author's word use in poems, words that do not have a common mental meaning develop a new semantics existing in a specific context. Severyanin is a poet who assigns an important place to the mental sphere vocabulary in his works, which makes them quite illustrative. Some words that do not have a mental seme according to their dictionary meanings acquire it in context and turn out to be the author's means of artistic expression and semantic neologisms. In a number of other cases, the opposite phenomenon is observed: in the context lexemes lose their usual mental meaning.

TI  - Biogeochemical Model Optimization by Using Satellite-Derived Phytoplankton Functional Type Data and BGC-Argo Observations in the Northern South China Sea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine biogeochemical models have been widely used to understand ecosystem dynamics and biogeochemical cycles. To resolve more processes, models typically increase in complexity, and require optimization of more parameters. Data assimilation is an essential tool for parameter optimization, which can reduce model uncertainty and improve model predictability. At present, model parameters are often adjusted using sporadic in-situ measurements or satellite-derived total chlorophyll-a concentration at sea surface. However, new ocean datasets and satellite products have become available, providing a unique opportunity to further constrain ecosystem models. Biogeochemical-Argo (BGC-Argo) floats are able to observe the ocean interior continuously and satellite phytoplankton functional type (PFT) data has the potential to optimize biogeochemical models with multiple phytoplankton species. In this study, we assess the value of assimilating BGC-Argo measurements and satellite-derived PFT data in a biogeochemical model in the northern South China Sea (SCS) by using a genetic algorithm. The assimilation of the satellite-derived PFT data was found to improve not only the modeled total chlorophyll-a concentration, but also the individual phytoplankton groups at surface. The improvement of simulated surface diatom provided a better representation of subsurface particulate organic carbon (POC). However, using satellite data alone did not improve vertical distributions of chlorophyll-a and POC. Instead, these distributions were improved by combining the satellite data with BGC-Argo data. As the dominant variability of phytoplankton in the northern SCS is at the seasonal timescale, we find that utilizing monthly-averaged BGC-Argo profiles provides an optimal fit between model outputs and measurements in the region, better than using high-frequency measurements.

TI  - Impact of Hydrological Infrastructure Projects on Land Use/Cover and Socioeconomic Development in Arid Regions-Evidence from the Upper Atbara and Setit Dam Complex, Kassala, Eastern Sudan
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, Africa has seen much construction of large-scale hydrological infrastructures in the arid and semi-arid regions of numerous countries. This paper aims to quantify the effects of this form of hydrological infrastructure, especially the Upper Atbara and Setit Dam Complex (UASDC) in Eastern Sudan, on the land use/cover (LUC) and socioeconomic domains. This paper attempts to advance our understanding of this phenomenon by using multiple approaches. A framework using the integration of 3S technologies and a logical approach for quantifying the significance of the results to society has been developed. The method used Landsat5 TM in 2002, Sentinel2A in 2018, and statistical data to create the LUC map. The final map included seven classes; the overall accuracy of changes in LUC patterns was 94.9% in 2002 and 93% in the results reveal that significant changes occurred in terms of LUC, having a considerable effect on socio-economic development. The results were analyzed with the logical approach for overall objectives, where 85% represents S1, 3.3% represents S2, and 11.7% represents S3, respectively. This study provides an insight into further investigations of the dam's effect on climate and groundwater, and offers a new perspective on land use prediction, simulation, and environmental sustainability.

TI  - Did dust intrusion and lofting escalate the catastrophic widespread lightning on 16th April 2019, India?
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - A record for an abysmally high number of lightning discharges in a single day occurred on 16 April 2019, where almost 58,066 flashes (cloud to ground + inter cloud) with a maximum of 179 flashes/min were observed over India. Researchers have hypothesized that an intense Western Disturbance (WD) caused these high numbers of lightning flashes, which prevailed in the northwestern part of India and spread over much of the country. Instead, in this paper, it is suggested and shown through multiple datasets that a dust intrusion into the storm altered cloud characteristics at the microphysical level, most likely favouring charge separation in cloud particles. The back trajectory calculation indicated that there was a south-westerly transport of dust/ aerosol which converged within the secondary flow associated with the WD and lofted into the higher levels. It is hypothesized that the entrainment of dust acting as cloud condensation nuclei as well as ice nuclei induced a favourable condition for charge separation. Also a dust-boosting feedback loop was set up due to the prevailing intense WD which further accelerated the electrification process and led to the catastrophic lightning.

TI  - Research on a Partial Aperture Factor Measurement Method for the AGRI Onboard Calibration Assembly
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - A partial aperture onboard calibration method can solve the onboard calibration problems of some large aperture remote sensors, which is of great significance for the development trend of increasingly large apertures in optical remote sensors. In this paper, the solar diffuser reflectance degradation monitor (SDRDM) in the onboard calibration assembly (CA) of the FengYun-4 (FY-4) advanced geostationary radiance imager (AGRI) was used as the reference radiometer. It was designed for measuring the partial aperture factor (PAF) for the AGRI onboard calibration. First, the linear response count variation relationship between the two was established under the same radiance source input. Then, according to the known bidirectional reflection distribution function (BRDF) of the solar diffuser (SD) in the CA, the relative reflectance ratio coefficient between the AGRI observation direction and the SDRDM observation direction was calculated. On this basis, the response count value of the AGRI and the SDRDM was used to realize the high-precision measurement of the PAF of the AGRI B1~B3 bands by simulating the AGRI onboard calibration measurement under the illumination of a solar simulator in the laboratory. According to the determination process of the relevant parameters of the PAF, the measurement uncertainty of the PAF was analyzed; this uncertainty was greater than 2.04% and provided an important reference for the evaluation of the onboard absolute radiometric calibration uncertainty after launch.

TI  - An Investigation to Identify the Effectiveness of Socioeconomic, Demographic, and Buildings' Characteristics on Surface Urban Heat Island Patterns
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite implementing adaptation strategies and measures to make cities sustainable and resilient, the urban heat island (UHI) has been increasing risks to human health and the urban environment by causing hot spots in city areas. This study investigates the spatial patterns in the surface urban heat island (SUHI) over the study site and develops its relationships to socioeconomic, demographic, and buildings' characteristics. This paper examines the role of building roof types, building roof material, building height, building age, and socioeconomic and demographic factors in driving the SUHI in a city. Numerous studies have focused primarily on the influence of biophysical and meteorological factors on variations in land surface temperatures (LSTs); however, very little attention has been paid to examining the influence of socioeconomic, demographic, and building factors on SUHIs within a city. The analysis has been carried out by processing Landsat based LST data to UHI in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud-based platform. The satellite-based research is further integrated with GIS data acquired from the state government and local city council. Linear regression and multiple regression correlations are further run to examine selected factors' variance on SUHI. Results indicate socioeconomic, demographic, and building factors contribute significantly to SUHI generation; these factors collectively can explain 28% of the variance in SUHI patterns with significant p-values.

TI  - Remote Sensing in Studies of the Growing Season: A Bibliometric Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Analyses of climate change based on point observations indicate an extension of the plant growing season, which may have an impact on plant production and functioning of natural ecosystems. Analyses involving remote sensing methods, which have added more detail to results obtained in the traditional way, have been carried out only since the 1980s. The paper presents the results of a bibliometric analysis of papers related to the growing season published from 2000-2021 included in the Web of Science database. Through filtering, 285 publications were selected and subjected to statistical processing and analysis of their content. This resulted in the identification of author teams that mostly focused their research on vegetation growth and in the selection of the most common keywords describing the beginning, end, and duration of the growing season. It was found that most studies on the growing season were reported from Asia, Europe, and North America (i.e., 32%, 28%, and 28%, respectively). The analyzed articles show the advantage of satellite data over low-altitude and ground-based data in providing information on plant vegetation. Over three quarters of the analyzed publications focused on natural plant communities. In the case of crops, wheat and rice were the most frequently studied plants (i.e., they were analyzed in over 30% and over 20% of publications, respectively).

TI  - Going Conservative or Conventional? Investigating Farm Management Strategies in between Economic and Environmental Sustainability in Southern Italy
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The European "Green Deal" strategy is aimed at making Europe the first climate-neutral continent by 2050 through integrated actions relying on healthier agricultural systems grounded in (environmental and economic) sustainable practices, including soil carbon management and biodiversity enhancement. In this vein, the present study contrasts the economic-environmental performances of conventional (deep tillage) and conservative (no-tillage and soil ripping) practices for two varieties of durum wheat (Triticum turgidum spp. durum), namely a modern (Anco Marzio) and an ancient landrace (Saragolla Lucana) variety in the Basilicata region (Southern Italy). Field and laboratory analysis (granulometry, mineralogy, and geochemistry) as well as satellite data (RapidEye) were used to characterize the soil and vegetation patterns. The empirical results indicate a higher biomass production and vegetative potential together with higher grain yields in soils managed with conventional deep tillage compared with soil managed with conservative practices. Similarly, the modern wheat variety exhibited better performance with respect to the old landrace. The soils managed with conventional practices had a distribution of exchangeable macro-nutrients characterized by a reduction in Ca+ and an increase in Mg2+ and K+ between pre-sowing and post-harvesting. Such a distribution was also genotype-dependent, with a higher variability for Saragolla Lucana than Anco Marzio, showing a diverging adsorption of macro-elements between the modern and ancient landrace varieties.

TI  - Potential of Open Source Remote Sensing Data for Improved Spatiotemporal Monitoring of Inland Water Quality in India: Case Study of Gujarat
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Unison of in situ data with satellite remote sensing data has been widely used for water body quality monitoring; however, the developed synergized model is unique and thus needs to be recalibrated and revalidated before applying to other water bodies. In some Indian locations, water quality monitoring is conducted only once a year due to associated costs and time. To aid such instances, in this study, stepwise linear regression models were developed using in situ (annual) and Landsat 7 (biweekly) remote sensing data and validated for two inland water bodies (Sursagar and Nalsarovar lakes) in Gujarat state for dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, electrical conductivity, pH, and nitrate. Results indicated that all models showed good to excellent performance metrics based on an r value (p < 0.01) ranging from 0.86 to 0.98 and 0.72 to 0.99 for Sursagar and Nalsarovar lakes, respectively. All models had root mean square errors less than 0.5, and residual predictive deviations greater than 2, which depicted good predictability The models were able to increase the water quality assessment from annual resolution to biweekly resolution and provided insights on the dynamics of water quality parameters, improved understanding on key drivers for the change, and identified peak pollution leading to unfit conditions for domestic or agricultural consumption.

TI  - Methods of Sentinel Lymph Node Detection and Management in Urinary Bladder Cancer-A Narrative Review
T2  - CURRENT ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Detection of lymph node status in bladder cancer significantly impacts clinical decisions regarding its management. There is a wide range of detection modalities for this task, including lymphoscintigraphy, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, single-photon emission computed tomography, positron emission tomography, and fluoroscopy. We aimed to study the pre- and intraoperative detection modalities of sentinel lymph nodes in urinary bladder cancer. Method: This narrative review was performed by searching the PubMed and EMBASE libraries using the following search terms: ("Transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder" OR "urothelial cancer" OR "urinary bladder cancer" OR "bladder cancer") AND (("sentinel lymph node") OR ("lymphatic mapping") OR ("lymphoscintigraphy") OR ("lymphangiography") OR ("lymph node metastases")). Studies analysing the effectiveness and outcomes of sentinel lymph node detection in bladder cancer were included, while non-English language, duplicates, and non-article studies were excluded. After analysing the libraries and a further manual search of bibliographies, 31 studies were included in this paper. We followed the RAMESES publication standard for narrative reviews to produce this paper. Results: Of the 31 studies included, 7 studies included multiple detection methods; 5 studies included lymphoscintigraphy; 5 studies included computed tomography and/or single-photon emission computed tomography; 5 studies included fluoroscopy; 4 studies included magnetic resonance imaging; and 5 studies included positron emission tomography. Discussion: Anatomical, radioactive, and functional detection modalities have been studied independently and in combination. The consensus is that preoperative detection with imaging helps guide surgical management and intraoperative detection methods help capture any lymph nodes that may have been missed. Each of these types of detection represent their own set of benefits and drawbacks, but there is currently limited evidence to support any change in overall practice to replace conventional staging.

TI  - The NILS Study Protocol: A Retrospective Validation Study of an Artificial Neural Network Based Preoperative Decision-Making Tool for Noninvasive Lymph Node Staging in Women with Primary Breast Cancer (ISRCTN14341750)
T2  - DIAGNOSTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Newly diagnosed breast cancer (BC) patients with clinical T1-T2 N0 disease undergo sentinel-lymph-node (SLN) biopsy, although most of them have a benign SLN. The pilot noninvasive lymph node staging (NILS) artificial neural network (ANN) model to predict nodal status was published in 2019, showing the potential to identify patients with a low risk of SLN metastasis. The aim of this study is to assess the performance measures of the model after a web-based implementation for the prediction of a healthy SLN in clinically NO BC patients. This retrospective study was designed to validate the NILS prediction model for SLN status using preoperatively available clinicopathological and radiological data. The model results in an estimated probability of a healthy SLN for each study participant. Our primary endpoint is to report on the performance of the NILS prediction model to distinguish between healthy and metastatic SLNs (NO vs. N+) and compare the observed and predicted event rates of benign SLNs. After validation, the prediction model may assist medical professionals and BC patients in shared decision making on omitting SLN biopsies in patients predicted to be node-negative by the NILS model. This study was prospectively registered in the ISRCTN registry (identification number: 14341750).

While this term broadly describes sub-circular mounded sites with two concentric ramparts, it is neither precise nor applicable to all fortified tells of the region. Its widespread application across morphologically heterogeneous sites has led to a distortion of concepts of settlement dynamics and human activity in the GWJ during the Early Bronze Age. This paper uses an intensive remote sensing study and results from past fieldwork to disentangle the term "Kranzhugel" from indiscriminate use and lack of academic dissemination, and build a new typology based upon the absolute morphological forms of fortified GWJ sites. This not only provides a framework for researchers in this region, especially when working with remote sensing data, but also a case study of the pitfalls of terminological ambiguity which are present across many areas of archaeological research.

TI  - Crop Detection Using Time Series of Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 and Existing Land Parcel Information Systems
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite crop detection technologies are focused on the detection of different types of crops in fields. The information of crop-type area is more useful for food security than the earlier phenology stage is. Currently, data obtained from remote sensing (RS) are used to solve tasks related to the identification of the type of agricultural crops; additionally, modern technologies using AI methods are desired in the postprocessing stage. In this paper, we develop a methodology for the supervised classification of time series of Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 data, compare the accuracies based on different input datasets and find how the accuracy of classification develops during the season. In the EU, a unified Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) is available to provide essential field borders. To increase usability, we also provide a classification of the entire field. This field classification also improves overall accuracy.

AB  - The study was carried out in a new relevant linguistic paradigm - migration linguistics. The study of the interaction of Azerbaijanian and German, including multilingualism, language contacts and their linguistic consequences has taken into account cultural data. The description of the language situation is inclusive, i.e. the linguistic and cultural situation is described from the perspective of a migrant. Although the the main point of this study is to do research on the case from linguistics perspectives, the tendency related to the young adults of Azerbaijani migrant families who experienced both positive and negative apsects of second language acquisition was also thorouhgly analyzed. In this study, the method of secondary data analysis was used in order to determine the challenges that young adults encounter and benefits while learning second language including the German language as an example. The data which was obtained on the Internet shows that young adults' linguistic perception was influenced by a wide range of factors including psychological, cultural, and family related issues which are directly connected to foreign language learning too.

TI  - Content of Secondary Education in the Russian Empire in the second half of the 19th century (the Example of Ust-Medveditsky Women's Secondary School of the Don Cossack Host)
T2  - BYLYE GODY
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the article is to analyze the specifics of education in the Russian Empire in the second half of the 19th century. Archival materials covering various activities of the Ust-Medveditskaya women's gymnasium in the last quarter of the 19th century are used as documentary grounds of the study. Researches particularly focus on the content of educational process examining the curricula of Russian literature, geography, history, and foreign languages. They also outlined scientific discussions on content of educational process in Russian province of the 19th century and the relations of the process with the general trends of education development in the country. According to studied materials education in the Russian Empire was not solely limited to the purpose of transferring knowledge and skills, but aimed to develop values in students' worldview be means of teaching certain subjects. The main sources of the paper are examination sheets, pedagogical council and general annual reports of Ust-Medveditskaya women's gymnasium. After reviewing archival documents and scientific sources, the authors concluded that the learning process included a significant number of positions whose purpose was educational impact on students, the formation of the system of values and proper behavior, which follows them. In addition, the test assignments allow us to judge that the pedagogical concepts assumed an interest in the personality of pupils and the support of their cognitive activity. The authors also put forward a hypothesis according to which the development of female education could become the reason for a change in the value-targeted foundations of educational activities in the future - the transition from the exclusively educational orientation of teachers to an educational and organizational one.

TI  - Deriving Nutrient Concentrations from Sentinel-3 OLCI Data in North-Eastern Baltic Sea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Nutrients are important elements in marine ecosystems and water quality, and have a major role in the eutrophication of water bodies. Monitoring nutrient loads is especially important for the Baltic Sea, which is especially sensitive to the eutrophication. Using optical remote sensing data in mapping total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) is challenging because these substances do not have a direct influence on the water optics that remote sensing sensors can detect. On the other hand, it would be very rewarding. In this study, more than 25,000 Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) data algorithms were tested in order to detect the TN and TP concentrations in the Estonian marine waters between 2016-2021. The TN estimations were well derived for Estonian marine waters (R-2 = 0.73, RMSE = 4.87 mu molN L-1, MAPE = 14%, n = 708), while the TP estimations were weaker (R-2 = 0.38, RMSE = 0.23 mu molP L-1, MAPE = 24%, n = 730). The Estonian marine waters were divided into six geographic regions in order to study the effect of regional water quality on the TN and TP retrievals. The nutrient concentrations were derived in every region when spring and summer periods were treated separately. In this study, the detection of both nutrients was more successful in more closed areas with P deficiency, while in open sea areas it was more challenging. This study shows that it is possible to estimate nutrients, especially TN, from remote sensing data. Consequently, remote sensing could provide a reliable support to the conventional monitoring by covering large marine areas with high temporal and spatial resolution data.

TI  - Mediterranean Coastal Lagoons Review: Sites to Visit before Disappearance
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal lagoons are an established priority habitat in the European environment because of the biological communities that inhabit them. Their origin is related to the transport of sediments from a nearby river or the movement of sands by the marine currents that produce the closure of a gulf. Therefore, they are recent geological formations, which also disappear quickly if environmental conditions change. The 37 coastal lagoons with a surface area greater than 10 km(2) located in the Mediterranean basin have been identified. Fishing has been the traditional use of these lagoons, in addition to their use as a navigation harbor when they are open to the sea. Pollution, quality problems and their consequences are the most studied topics in recent publications. Sentinel-2 images taken in the summer of 2020 have been used to study water transparency, suspended matter and chlorophyll a concentration. The result was that only six of them are in good ecological condition, but most of them are eutrophic due to the impacts on their environment and the inflow of poor quality water. The cultural values of these lagoons must also be protected and preserved.

TI  - Towards the Combination of C2RCC Processors for Improving Water Quality Retrieval in Inland and Coastal Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-2 offers great potential for monitoring water quality in inland and coastal waters. However, atmospheric correction in these waters is challenging, and there is no standardized approach yet, but different methods coexist under constant development. The atmospheric correction Case 2 Regional Coast Colour (C2RCC) processor has been recently updated with the C2X-COMPLEX (C2XC). This study is one of the first attempts at exploring its performance, in comparison with C2RCC and C2X, in inland and coastal waters in the east of the Iberian Peninsula, in retrieving water surface reflectance and estimating chlorophyll-a ([Chl-a]), total suspended matter ([TSM]), and Secchi disk depth (Z(SD)). The relationship between in situ Z(SD) and Kd_z90max product (i.e., the depth of the water column from which 90% of the water-leaving irradiance is derived) of the C2RCC processors demonstrated the potential of this product for estimating water clarity (r > 0.75). However, [TSM] and [Chl-a] derived from the different processors with default calibration factors were not suitable within the targeted scenarios, requiring recalibration based on optical water types or a shift to dynamic algorithm blending approaches. This would benefit from switching between C2RCC and C2XC, which extends the potential for improving surface reflectance estimates to a wide range of scenarios and suggests a promising future for C2-Nets in operational monitoring of water quality.

TI  - Multi-Temporal Analysis of the Glacier Retreat Using Landsat Satellite Images in the Nevado of the Ampay National Sanctuary, Peru
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF ENERGY WATER AND ENVIRONMENT SYSTEMS-JSDEWES
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers arc humanity's most extraordinary water reservoirs, covering approximately 10% of the total Earth surface. The investigation of the retreat of the glacier surface in the Ampay National Sanctuary' is carried out using the historical series of Landsat images and applying the normalized snow differential index between the years 1991 to 2017. The meteorological data from the Tamburco and Abancay stations have been considered to determine the deglaciation and quantify the retreat of the Ampay glacier. The supervised classification spatial visualization method for the Landsat 2 Multispectral Scanner image and the normalized snow differential index have been used to determine the glacier cover area with Landsat 5, Landsat 7, and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager/Thermal Infrared Sensor images. The results show a significant decrease in the surface of the Ampay glacier due to the increase in temperature. The surface of the Ampay glacier in 1991 was 2.13 km(2) and in 2017 - 1.09 km(2), showing a loss of 1.04 km(2) (48.92%) as a consequence of significant climate variability (temperature and precipitation). In 2015, an apparent accumulation of snow was recorded on the Ampay glacier, reaching 2.595 km(2), but in the following years, the glacier surface has been decreasing until it reached 1.086 km(2) in 2017. It is concluded that the glacial retreat of the Ampay National Sanctuary in the last 25 years with a tendency to continuous deglaciation puts the water resource at risk.

TI  - LIBERAL NATURALISM WITH(OUT) REENCHANTMENT
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a close conceptual relation between the notions of religious disenchantment and scientific naturalism. One way of resisting philosophical and cultural implications of the scientific image and the subsequent process of disenchantment can be found in attempts at sketching a reenchanted worldview. The main issue of accounts of reenchantment can be a rejection of scientific results in a way that flies in the face of good reason. Opposed to such reenchantment is scientific naturalism which implies an entirely disenchanted worldview. However, one of the main problems of scientific naturalism are placement problems. A reenchanted worldview does have the conceptual resources to avoid placement problems, yet seems to throw out the baby (a reasonable appeal to science as an authority) with the bathwater (placement problems). A dilemma results: the Scylla of an undesirable scientific naturalism and the Charybdis of a rampant, seemingly prescientific reenchanted worldview. In this article I argue that there is a safe middle passage between these two options, i.e. the recently proposed liberal naturalism which allows for a moderate normative reenchantment. Liberal naturalism lets us have it both ways: avoiding the placement problems while retaining a necessary and reasonable adherence to science, thereby avoiding both an all-too restrictive scientific naturalism.

TI  - Assessing the Spectral Information of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Satellites for Above-Ground Biomass Retrieval of a Tropical Forest
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth Observation (EO) spectral indices have been an important tool for quantifying and monitoring forest biomass. Nevertheless, the selection of the bands and their combination is often realized based on preceding studies or generic assumptions. The current study investigates the relationship between satellite spectral information and the Above Ground Biomass (AGB) of a major private forest on the island of Java, Indonesia. Biomass-related traits from a total of 1517 trees were sampled in situ and their AGB were estimated from species-specific allometric models. In parallel, the exhaustive band combinations of the Ratio Spectral Index (RSI) were derived from near-concurrently acquired Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images. By applying scenarios based on the entire dataset, the prevalence and monodominance of acacia, mahogany, and teak tree species were investigated. The best-performing index for the entire dataset yielded R-2 = 0.70 (R-2 = 0.78 when considering only monodominant plots). An application of eight traditional vegetation indices provided, at best, R-2 = 0.65 for EVI, which is considerably lower compared to the RSI best combination. We suggest that an investigation of the complete band combinations as a proxy of retrieving biophysical parameters may provide more accurate results than the blind application of popular spectral indices and that this would take advantage of the amplified information obtained from modern satellite systems.

TI  - Variation and Driving Factor of Aerosol Optical Depth over the South China Sea from 1980 to 2020
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial and temporal variation of aerosol optical depth (AOD) and optical depth of different aerosol types derived from the second Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2) over the South China Sea (SCS) between 1980 and 2020 were studied. AOD distribution showed different characteristics throughout the entire SCS. Sulfate Aerosol Optical Depth (SO(4)AOD) and Sea Salt Aerosol Optical Depth (SSAOD) mainly contributed to the spatial and temporal variation of AOD over the SCS. A significant increasing trend followed by a decreasing trend of AOD could be observed in the north of the SCS from 1980 to 2020. Mean MERRA-2 AOD between 1980 and 2020 showed that AOD was high in the north and low in the south and that AOD gradually decreased from north to south over the SCS. AOD after 2000 was obviously higher than that of the 1980s and 1990s. Higher AOD appeared in the spring and winter, and low AOD appeared in the summer. The spatial distribution of scattering aerosol optical depth (SAOD) was similar to AOD distribution over the SCS. SO(4)AOD and SSAOD were obviously higher than black carbon aerosol optical depth (BCAOD), organic carbon aerosol optical depth (OCAOD), and dust aerosol optical depth (DUAOD) over the SCS. SO(4)AOD accounted for over 50% of total AOD (TAOD) over the north of the SCS, while BCAOD and DUAOD accounted for less than 10% of TAOD over the entire SCS. An obvious annual mean TAOD increase between 1980 and 2007 could be observed over the northern part of the SCS (NSCS), while a TAOD decrease happened from 2008 to 2020 in this region. The correlation coefficient between TAOD and SO(4)AOD over NSCS from 1980 to 2020 was about 0.93, indicating SO(4)AOD was the driving factor of TAOD variation in this area. Different AOD variation trends over the different areas of the SCS could be observed during the two periods including 1980-2007 and 2008-2020. AOD increase appeared over most of the SCS during the period from 1980 to 2007, while AOD decrease could be observed over most of the SCS from 2008 to 2020.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) project has provided the climate community 20 years of globally observed top of the atmosphere (TOA) fluxes critical for climate and cloud feedback studies. The CERES Flux By Cloud Type (FBCT) product contains radiative fluxes by cloud type, which can provide more stringent constraints when validating models and also reveal more insight into the interactions between clouds and climate. The FBCT product provides 1 degrees regional daily and monthly shortwave (SW) and longwave (LW) cloud-type fluxes and cloud properties sorted by seven pressure layers and six optical depth bins. Historically, cloud-type fluxes have been computed using radiative transfer models based on observed cloud properties. Instead of relying on radiative transfer models, the FBCT product utilizes Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) radiances partitioned by cloud type within a CERES footprint to estimate the cloud-type broadband fluxes. The MODIS multichannel derived broadband fluxes were compared with the CERES observed footprint fluxes and were found to be within 1% and 2.5% for LW and SW, respectively, as well as being mostly free of cloud property dependencies. These biases are mitigated by constraining the cloud-type fluxes within each footprint with the CERES Single Scanner Footprint (SSF) observed flux. The FBCT all-sky and clear-sky monthly averaged fluxes were found to be consistent with the CERES SSF1deg product. Several examples of FBCT data are presented to highlight its utility for scientific applications.

TI  - Estimation of soil organic matter content using selected spectral subset of hyperspectral data
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic matter (SOM) content plays an important role in the global carbon cycle and agricultural activities. Reflectance spectroscopy has been recognized as a promising method to rapidly estimate SOM content. However, the existing estimation methods mainly apply partial least squares regression (PLSR) to the entire spectral region of hyperspectral data. Here we proposed a method to extract the informative spectral subset based on spectral characteristics of soil constituents, which was then used to estimate SOM content with PLSR. Genetic algorithm (GA) and variable importance in the projection (VIP) score of PLSR were adopted to further select spectral bands separately. Both laboratory spectra of soil samples collected from an agricultural area and a hyperspectral sat-ellite image were used to evaluate the performance of the method. For the estimations of SOM content using laboratory spectra, compared with the estimation using the entire spectral region of 400-2400 nm, the model accuracy was improved by using the spectral bands associated with clay minerals and the combined spectral bands of organic matter and clay minerals. For the estimations using soil spectra from hyperspectral remote sensing image, the RMSE and R-2 values were improved from 0.91% and 0.34 to 0.55% and 0.76 by using the spectral bands associated with organic matter in comparison with the entire spectral region of 390-1029 nm. The estimation model developed with GA-PLSR using soil spectra from the hyperspectral satellite image was applied to map SOM content. Results suggest that estimating SOM content using informative spectral subset is promising and can be transferred to the hyperspectral satellite image to map SOM content.

TI  - SPATIAL VARIATION OF NO<sub>2</sub> LEVELS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN THE BALI TOURISM AREA
T2  - GEOGRAPHIA TECHNICA
M3  - Article
AB  - NO2 levels that exceed quality standards will negatively impact the environment and human health. The purpose of this study was to determine changes in the content of NO2 temporally. The method used is descriptive quantitative, with data analysis using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and remote sensing data extraction using Google Earth Engine (GEE). The remote sensing data used is Sentinel 5p - TROPOMI whose sensors have the ability to detect air pollution. The results of this study indicate the occurrence of different variations during the Covid-19 Pandemic in the Bali Tourism Area, decreasing or increasing NO2 levels. The decrease in NO2 levels in the air is due to reduced human activities outside the home due to the implementation of the Indonesian Government's policies in the form of Large-Scale Restrictions, Work From Home (WFH), and the religious traditions of Hindus in Bali (Nyepi Day on March 25, 2020). NO2 levels increase again after a long holiday in Indonesia on November-December 2020, due to the large number of tourists visiting Bali Province. The arrival of these tourists increases human activities around the tourism area, such as opening hotels, restaurants, and means of land, sea, and air transportation. Tourism areas tend to have high building density and population. Thus, making green open space low. Whereas green open space is very useful in absorbing air pollution, it is recommended to add green open space or revegetation in every hotel building to maintain good air quality.

TI  - Random Forest Classification of Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) Using Sentinel-2 Data-A Case Study of Czechia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) is a greenhouse gas inventory sector that evaluates greenhouse gas changes in the atmosphere from land use and land-use change. This study focuses on the development of a Sentinel-2 data classification according to the LULUCF requirements on the cloud-based platform Google Earth Engine (GEE). The methods are tested in selected larger territorial regions (two Czech NUTS 2 units) using data collected in 2018. The Random Forest method was used for classification. In terms of classification accuracy, a combination of these parameters was tested: The Number of Trees (NT), the Variables per Split (VPS) and the Bag Fraction (BF). A total of 450 combinations of different parameters were tested. The highest accuracy classification with an overall accuracy = 89.1% and Cohen's Kappa = 0.84 had the following combination: NT = 150, VPS = 3 and BF = 0.1. For classification purposes, a mosaic was created using the median method. The resulting mosaic consisted of all Sentinel-2 bands in 10 and 20 m spatial resolution. Altitude values derived from SRTM and NDVI variance values were also included in the classification. These added bands were the most significant in terms of Gini importance.

TI  - Differential exponential entropy-based multilevel threshold selection methodology for colour satellite images using equilibrium-cuckoo search optimizer
T2  - ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, the entropic based multilevel threshold selection methods use 2D histogram, which is constructed using the local averages, leading to a loss of edges. Further, the computation of the entropy using the diagonal pixel values only leads to a loss of information. Nevertheless, traditional 2D histogram based multilevel thresholding methods suffer from efficiently retaining the spatial correlation information. In addition, the conventional entropy uses logarithmic function, which has inherent problems, thereby, reducing the accuracy at some situations. To solve these issues, a differential exponential entropy (DEE) -based multilevel threshold selection methodology is proposed. To suppress the high magnitude peaks in the 2D histogram, the normalized local variance is used while the construction. A novel objective function is suggested to compute the DEE. A new Equilibrium-Cuckoo Search Optimizer (ECSO) is suggested to maximize the DEE. For testing, standard benchmark functions are used. The results are compared with the physics-based Equilibrium Optimizer (EO) and the nature-inspired Cuckoo Search Algorithm (CSA). Different benchmark colour satellite images are acquired from the Landsat Image Gallery database for the experiment. The performances are compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Different metrics such as PSNR, SSIM and FSIM are used for the image quality assessment. A statistical analysis is presented in terms of the Box plots. Our proposed DEE-ECSO outperforms the other techniques. The suggested algorithm would be useful for segmentation of the brain MR images for biomedical engineering applications.

TI  - Harmonization of Multi-Mission High-Resolution Time Series: Application to BELAIR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution data are increasingly used for various applications, yet the revisit time is still low for some applications, particularly in frequently cloud-covered areas. Therefore, sensors are often combined, which raises issues on data consistency. In this study, we start from L1 to L3 data, and investigate the impact of harmonization measures, correcting for difference in radiometric gain and spectral response function (SRF), and the use of a common processing chain with the same atmospheric correction for Sentinel-2A/B, Landsat-8, DEIMOS-1, and Proba-V center cameras. These harmonization measures are evaluated step-wise in two applications: (1) agricultural monitoring, and (2) hydrological modelling in an urban context, using biophysical parameters and NDVI. The evaluation includes validation with in situ data, relative consistency analysis between different sensors, and the evaluation of the time series noise. A higher accuracy was not obtained when validating against in situ data. Yet, the relative analysis and the time series noise analysis clearly demonstrated that the largest improvement in consistency between sensors was obtained when applying the same atmospheric correction to all sensors. The gain correction obtained and its impact on the results was small, indicating that the sensors were already well calibrated. We could not demonstrate an improved consistency after SRF correction. It is likely that other factors, such as anisotropy effects, play a larger role, requiring further research.

TI  - Habitat Changes along Ipoly River Valley (Hungary) in Extreme Wet and Dry Years
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ipoly Valley is a natural habitat along the Ipoly River, only slightly affected by water management; therefore, this is an especially sensitive area and reflects well the vegetation changes in the driest (2020) and wettest (2010) years. The study's aim is to identify natural changes within habitats and the evaluation of habitat types' boundaries. For the study, a hand-held GPS device was applied on-site. The habitat identification is based on the General National Habitat Classification System (a-NeR). In addition to on-site data, Sentinel-2A satellite data were used to compare different extreme years 2020 and 2021-changes in different habitat patches using different vegetation indices. A change in precipitation causes shifts in the vegetation, this is shown on a map. As we predicted, decreasing the precipitation results in a decrease of the area of wet habitat patches. The satellite image shows a more accurate picture of the real location of the associations, which is important for long-term research. In addition, we can get accurate data on the situation of areas (roads and paths) affected by anthropogenic factors.

T2  - PEDIATRIC INFECTIOUS DISEASE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Incidences of community-acquired infectious diseases other than COVID-19 decreased during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic; however, exanthema subitum incidence before (2016-2019) and during the pandemic (2020) in Niigata, Japan, did not substantially differ, although the proportion of age less than 1-year-old was lower in 2020. These findings suggest that exanthema subitum is transmitted mainly among family members, not in the community.

TI  - On-Orbit Absolute Radiometric Calibration and Validation of ZY3-02 Satellite Multispectral Sensor
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study described the on-orbit vicarious radiometric calibration of Chinese civilian high-resolution stereo mapping satellite ZY3-02 multispectral imager (MUX). The calibration was based on gray-scale permanent artificial targets, and multiple radiometric calibration tarpaulins (tarps) using a reflectance-based approach between July and September 2016 at Baotou calibration site in China was described. The calibration results reveal a good linear relationship between DN and TOA radiances of ZY3-02 MUX. The uncertainty of this radiometric calibration was 4.33%, indicating that radiometric coefficients of ZY3-02 MUX are reliable. A detailed discussion on the validation analysis of the comparison results between the different radiometric calibration coefficients is presented in this paper. To further validate the reliability of the three coefficients, the calibrated ZY3-02 MUX was compared with Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI). The results also indicate that radiometric characteristics of ZY3-02 MUX imagery are reliable and highly accurate for quantitative applications.

TI  - Improved Spectral Water Index Combined with Otsu Algorithm to Extract Muddy Coastline Data
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the spectral reflection characteristics analysis of the muddy coastline in Jiangsu, an improved spectral water index (IWI) combined with the Otsu algorithm is proposed to extract muddy coastlines from Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) images. The IWI-extracted coastline results are compared with those extracted by the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), enhanced water index (EWI), revised normalized different water index (RNDWI) and automated water extraction index (AWEI). The results show that the IWI is not affected by tidal conditions or sand content in the water, can reduce the "salt-and-pepper" phenomenon in the Otsu algorithm classification, can accurately identify water boundaries and can extract silty mudflats and marine buildings with high accuracy. It can also significantly increase the degree of automation of coastline extraction. The IWI combined with the Otsu algorithm demonstrates high accuracy of over 84% in the extraction muddy coastline data with one-pixel tolerance, which is twice as accurate as other indices. The accuracy of extraction for all other types of coastlines is over 81%. Therefore, the IWI index combined with the Otsu algorithm is reliable for studies of sea-land processes and coastline evolutions.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Evolution and Prediction of AOT in Coal Resource Cities: A Case Study of Shanxi Province, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - As aerosols in the air have a great influence on the health of residents of coal resource-based cities, these municipalities are confronting the dilemma of air pollution that is caused by the increase of suspended particles in the atmosphere and their development process. Aerosol optical thickness could be used to explore the aerosol temporal and spatial variations and to develop accurate prediction models, which is of great significance to the control of air pollution in coal resource-based cities. This paper explored the temporal spatial variation characteristics of aerosols in coal resource-based regions. A total of 11 typical coal-resource prefecture-level cities in the Shanxi Province were studied and inverted the aerosol optical thickness (AOT) among these cities based on MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data and analyzed the significant factors affecting AOT. Through inputting significant correlation factors as the input variables of NARX (nonlinear auto regressive models with exogenous inputs) neural network, the monthly average AOTs in the Shanxi Province were predicted between 2011 and 2019. The results showed that, in terms of time series, AOT increased from January to July and decreased from July to December, the maximum AOT was 0.66 in summer and the minimum was 0.2 in autumn, and it was related to the local monsoon, temperature, and humidity. While as far as the space alignment is concerned, the figure for AOT in Shanxi Province varied significantly. High AOT was mainly concentrated in the centre and south and low AOT was focused on the northwestern part. Among the positively correlated factors, the correlation coefficient of population density and temperature exceeded 0.8, which was highly positive, and among the negatively correlated factors, the correlation coefficient of NDVI exceeded -0.8, which was highly negative. After improving the model by adding the important factors that were mentioned before, the error between the predicted mean value and the actual mean value was no more than 0.06. Considering this charge, the NARX neural network with multiple inputs can contribute to better prediction results.

TI  - Exploratory Study of Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Dose Optimization in Breast Cancer Sentinel Lymph Node Identification Using a Handheld Magnetic Probe and Iron Quantitation
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) using super magnetic iron oxide (SPIO) and magnetic probes is expected to be a simple and safe method of detecting cancerous lymph nodes without using radioisotopes (RIs). A multicenter trial of SLNB was conducted using a handheld magnetic probe and SPIO (Rizobist(R)) and its non-inferiority with the conventional RI method. The quantity of iron in SLN was measured to examine the necessary dosage and administration method for sufficient SLN detection in the case of this test. Further, a clinical trial was conducted to determine the possibility of SLNB with a half-dose of SPIO (1.0 mL (R) 0.5 mL), and the resulting iron volume measured at that time was also examined. This study demonstrates that sufficient iron content reaches SLN even at an SPIO dose of 0.5 mL. This exploratory study compared doses of ferucarbotran, a superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle, in sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) and quantified the SLN iron load by dose and localization. Eighteen females aged >= 20 years scheduled for an SLN biopsy with node-negative breast cancer were divided into two equal groups and administered either 1 mL or 0.5 mL ferucarbotran. Iron content was evaluated with a handheld magnetometer and quantification device. The average iron content was 42.8 mu g (range, 1.3-95.0; 0.15% of the injected dose) and 21.9 mu g (1.1-71.0; 0.16%) in the 1-mL and 0.5-mL groups, respectively (p = 0.131). The iron content of the closest SLN compared to the second SLN was 53.0 vs. 10.0 mu g (19% of the injected dose) and 34.8 vs. 4.1 mu g (11.1%) for the 1-mL and 0.5-mL groups, respectively (p = 0.001 for both). The magnetic field was high in both groups (average 7.30 mu T and 6.00 mu T in the 1-mL and 0.5-mL groups, respectively) but was not statistically significant (p = 0.918). The magnetic field and iron content were correlated (overall SLNs, p = 0.02; 1-mL, p = 0.014; 0.5-mL, p = 0.010). A 0.5-mL dose was sufficient for SLN identification. Primary and secondary SLNs could be differentiated based on iron content. Handheld magnetometers could be used to assess the SLN iron content.

TI  - A Review of Current and New Optical Techniques for Coral Monitoring
T2  - OCEANS-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Review
AB  - Monitoring the health of coral reefs is essential to understanding the damaging impacts of anthropogenic climate change as such non-invasive methods to survey coral reefs are the most desirable. Optics-based surveys, ranging from simple photography to multispectral satellite imaging are well established. Herein, we review these techniques, focusing on their value for coral monitoring and health diagnosis. The techniques are broadly separated by the primary method in which data are collected: by divers and/or robots directly within the environment or by remote sensing where data are captured above the water's surface by planes, drones, or satellites. The review outlines a new emerging technology, low-cost hyperspectral imagery, which is capable of simultaneously producing hyperspectral and photogrammetric outputs, thereby providing integrated information of the reef structure and physiology in a single data capture.

TI  - Comparison of landuse/landcover classifier for monitoring urban dynamics using spatially enhanced landsat dataset
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban dynamics refers to a phenomenon wherein certain factors contribute to imparting changes to an urban area. These factors can aid in either growth or deterioration of the city. One important factor that acts as a threat to the urban environment is rapid urbanization. To monitor and control such urban expansion, prediction is a necessity. It will throw some light on how the city grows and how it will affect the environment and living conditions. A precise and accurate dataset on land use/land cover (LULC) is a must for such analysis. Several methods exist to classify satellite data based on spectral reflectance with advancements in satellite technology and the means to process it. One problem is that there is no single classifier that can produce accurate results on LULC predictions. Each classifier varies in its performance based on several factors. Hence this research was carried out by choosing three classifiers, namely maximum likelihood (MLC), random forest algorithm (RFA) as well as support vector machines (SVM), which are commonly used. Its performance is then evaluated for a pan-sharpened Landsat 8 data of the study area, i.e., Salem and its surrounding urban agglomerations. From the results, it was inferred that the overall accuracies of MLC, SVM and RFA are 0.885, 0.930 and 0.945, respectively. Though the MLC accuracy is acceptable, it had many misclassifications of other classes into built-up classes. SVM and RFA performances were found good overall, but SVM had fewer misclassifications compared to RFA. SVM produced results close to reality and was concluded as the best classification method for pan-sharpened Landsat 8 data for Salem and its surrounding area.

TI  - A Novel Spectral Index for Automatic Canola Mapping by Using Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Because canola is a major oilseed crop, accurately determining its planting areas is crucial for ensuring food security and achieving UN 2030 sustainable development goals. However, when canola is extracted using remote-sensing data, winter wheat causes serious interference because it has a similar growth cycle and spectral reflectance characteristics. This interference seriously limits the classification accuracy of canola, especially in mixed planting areas. Here, a novel canola flower index (CFI) is proposed based on the red, green, blue, and near-infrared bands of Sentinel-2 images to improve the accuracy of canola mapping, based on the finding that spectral reflectance of canola on the red and green bands is higher than that of winter wheat during the canola flowering period. To investigate the potential of the CFI for extracting canola, the IsoData, support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF) classification methods were used to extract canola based on Sentinel-2 raw images and CFI images. The results show that the average overall accuracy and kappa coefficient based on CFI images were 94.77% and 0.89, respectively, which were 1.05% and 0.02, respectively, higher than those of the Sentinel-2 raw images. Then we found that a threshold of 0.14 on the CFI image could accurately distinguish canola from non-canola vegetation, which provides a solution for automatic mapping of canola. The overall classification accuracy and kappa coefficient of this threshold method were 96.02% and 0.92, which were very similar to those of the SVM and RF methods. Moreover, the advantage of the threshold classification method is that it reduces the dependence on training samples and has good robustness and high classification efficiency. Overall, this study shows that CFI and Sentinel-2 images provide a solution for automatic and accurate canola extraction.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Changes and Driving Force Analysis of Wetlands in Jiaozhou Bay
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Jiaozhou Bay is the largest bay-type coastal wetland with high biodiversity in Shandong Peninsula. In recent years, the wetland of Jiaozhou Bay has been reduced dramatically due to urban expansion. It is significant to study the characteristics and causes of the wetland changes in the past 40 years for the rational exploitation and sustainable development of coastal wetland resources. The types, spatial distribution, and area information of the wetland from 1983 to 2019 are obtained by artificial visual interpretation and supervised classification using ten Landsat remote sensing images, assisted by Google images. The research analyzes the conversion of land use types and the change rule of landscape pattern in the wetland, as well as the driving forces of the wetland evolution and the uncertainty factors affecting the analysis results. The results indicate that the wetland area shows an overall decreasing trend from 1983 to 2019, 77% of which are converted into nonwetland. The wetland area increases initially, followed by a decrease from 1990 to 2000, but then continues to decrease slowly from 2000 to 2019. There are many types of land use changes from coastal tidal flats to other land use types such as construction land or pond, and the landscape pattern has been gradually fragmented. The continuous increase in temperature is the main natural cause for the degradation of the wetland. Population factor is the most important driving force for the change of the wetland. The main uncertain factors affecting the analysis results are the capture time of remote sensing image, tidal level correction, wetland classification system, and method. The results provide a basis for the decision-making of wetland protection. The quantitative data will provide a reference for the construction of a multiyear wetland dataset in Jiaozhou Bay.

TI  - Development of a Multi-Index Method Based on Landsat Reflectance Data to Map Open Water in a Complex Environment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping surface water extent is important for managing water supply for agriculture and the environment. Remote sensing technologies, such as Landsat, provide an affordable means of capturing surface water extent with reasonable spatial and temporal coverage suited to this purpose. Many methods are available for mapping surface water including the modified Normalised Difference Water Index (mNDWI), Fisher's water index (FWI), Water Observations from Space (WOfS), and the Tasseled Cap Wetness index (TCW). While these methods can discriminate water, they have their strengths and weaknesses, and perform at their best in different environments, and with different threshold values. This study combines the strengths of these indices by developing rules that applies an index to the environment where they perform best. It compares these indices across the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) in southeast Australia, to assess performance and compile a heuristic rule set for accurate application across the MDB. The results found that all single indices perform well with the Kappa statistic showing strong agreement, ranging from 0.78 for WOfS to 0.84 for TCW (with threshold -0.035), with improvement in the overall output when the index best suited for an environment was selected. mNDWI (using a threshold of -0.3) works well within river channels, while TCW (with threshold -0.035) is best for wetlands and flooded vegetation. FWI and mNDWI (with threshold 0.63 and 0, respectively) work well for remaining areas. Selecting the appropriate index for an environment increases the overall Kappa statistic to 0.88 with a water pixel accuracy of 90.5% and a dry pixel accuracy of 94.8%. An independent assessment illustrates the benefit of using the multi-index approach, making it suitable for regional-scale multi-temporal analysis.

TI  - Soil erosion response to land use change in a mountainous rural area of Son La Province of Vietnam
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the changes in soil erosion associated with land use change from 2000 to 2020 in a mountainous rural area. Land use change was detected using Landsat images and soil erosion was estimated using the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE). The results show that deforestation and fallow cultivation caused substantial soil loss, whereas conversion from uncultivated land to cropland reduced soil erosion. A conversion from 711 ha cropland and 234 ha forestland to uncultivated land increased the average soil loss from 17 ton center dot ha(-1)center dot year(-1) to 42 ton center dot ha(-1)center dot year(-1) and the area of eroded soil at the very high level from 276 to 1058 ha between 2000 and 2010. In contrast, a wide expansion of cropland from 637 ha uncultivated land decreased the average soil loss from 42 ton center dot ha(-1)center dot year(-1) to 32 ton center dot ha(-1)center dot year(-1) and the area of eroded soil at the very high level from 1058 to 690 ha between 2010 and 2020. We suggest management measures such as forest protection, afforestation, reforestation, fruit tree development, and soil erosion control practices in coffee and maize cultivation to reduce soil erosion.

TI  - Effect of duration of deployment on parasitism and predation of <i>Halyomorpha halys</i> (Stal) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) sentinel egg masses in various host plants
T2  - FLORIDA ENTOMOLOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - The invasive brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys (St($)over-circlel) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), is an agricultural and nuisance pest in Georgia and Alabama, USA. Natural enemies may provide significant suppression of the brown marmorated stink bug, and sentinel egg masses are deployed commonly on plants in the field to measure their effects. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of deployment duration (2-5 d) on parasitism and predation of brown marmorated stink bug sentinel egg masses in plum, peach, blueberry, tomato, sassafras, corn, and soybean in these 2 states. Retrieved egg masses were processed to quantify rates of predation and parasitism and identify parasitoid species and predation types. Across crops, predation and parasitism were higher significantly in plum at 5 d compared to 2 d deployment but was similar in soybean regardless of exposure time in 2017. Predation and parasitism were higher significantly after 5 d of exposure compared to 2 d and 3 d whereas parasitism was significantly higher at 3 d compared to 2 d exposure in 2018 to 2020. For individual crop trials, though, effects of time of exposure were tested in different yr, sampling dates, and crops with variable results. When significant differences were detected for parasitism in plum, peach, tomato, and sassafras, a 5 d deployment resulted in higher parasitism compared to 2 d. Given the variability of factors that affect parasitism and predation under field conditions, we conclude that a 5 d deployment is optimal and a 3 d exposure time is minimal for assessing predation and parasitism. An additional benefit for a 5 d exposure is that it increases the probability of detecting hyperparasitism.

T2  - JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the accuracy of the one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) assay for the diagnosis of lymph node (LN) metastasis in uterine cancer. Methods: A total of 116 LNs from 30 patients with cervical and endometrial cancer, enrolled in this prospective study, were used. Excised LNs were cut into 4 to 6 blocks at 2 mm intervals, and nonadjacent blocks were alternately subjected to either histological examination or the OSNA assay. Results: The concordance rate between histological examination and the OSNA assay in cervical cancer and in endometrial cancer was 95.9% and 95.2%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value of the OSNA assay were 80%, 97.7%, and 97.7% in cervical cancer, and 85.7%, 93.3%, and 98.2% in endometrial cancer, respectively. In cervical cancer, discordant results were observed in 2 out of 49 LNs (4.1%); 1 was OSNA assay-positive and histological examination-negative, and 1 was OSNA assay-negative and histological examination-positive. In endometrial cancer, discordant results were observed in 5 out of 67 LNs (7.5%); 4 were OSNA assay-positive and histological examination-negative, and 1 was OSNA assay-negative and histological examination-positive. Conclusion: The OSNA assay showed high concordance rate with histological examination, sensitivity, and specificity in uterine cancer, suggesting that it could enhance the accuracy of conventional pathological examination for the detection of LN metastasis by reducing false negative rate.

TI  - Manual Lymph Drainage With Progressive Arm Exercises for Axillary Web Syndrome After Breast Cancer Surgery: A Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - PHYSICAL THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of a physical therapist-designed program tailored to axillary web syndrome (AWS) in women after breast cancer surgery. Methods A prospective, single-center, assessor-blinded, randomized controlled trial was conducted at the Physiotherapy in Women's Health Research Unit of the Alcala University (Madrid, Spain). Ninety-six women with AWS were assigned to the physical therapy group (manual lymph drainage [MLD] using resorption strokes and arm exercises as if performing median nerve neurodynamic glide exercises with no neural loading; n = 48) or the control group (standard arm exercises; n = 48), with both groups receiving treatment 3 times a week for 3 weeks. Both interventions included an educational component. Results Compared with the control group, the physical therapy group showed significant and clinically relevant improvements in the primary outcome (self-reported pain intensity) at the primary and 3-month follow-ups. Significant and clinically relevant differences between groups were also found in the secondary outcomes (shoulder active range of motion, shoulder disability, and physical and functional aspects of health-related quality of life) at the primary follow-up and in the secondary outcomes as well as the trial outcome index at the 3-month follow-up. No significant differences were found at the 6-month follow-up in either primary or secondary outcomes. Conclusion The physical therapy program tailored to AWS was found to be effective for AWS symptoms in women after breast cancer surgery, both immediately after the program and after 3 months. Impact To our knowledge, this is the first appropriately designed study to demonstrate the effectiveness of MLD with progressive arm exercises for AWS. Clinicians and health service providers should consider how to provide survivors of breast cancer with AWS the opportunity to participate in physical therapy programs, including MLD with progressive arm exercises. Lay Summary For axillary web syndrome following breast cancer surgery, a physical therapist can design a treatment program including manual lymph drainage and progressive arm exercises, which has been shown to result in reduced pain and improved motion compared with standard arm exercises.

TI  - Development of Semantic Maps of Vegetation Cover from UAV Images to Support Planning and Management in Fine-Grained Fire-Prone Landscapes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In Mediterranean landscapes, the encroachment of pyrophytic shrubs is a driver of more frequent and larger wildfires. The high-resolution mapping of vegetation cover is essential for sustainable land planning and the management for wildfire prevention. Here, we propose methods to simplify and automate the segmentation of shrub cover in high-resolution RGB images acquired by UAVs. The main contribution is a systematic exploration of the best practices to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a segmentation network architecture (U-Net) to detect shrubs in heterogeneous landscapes. Several semantic segmentation models were trained and tested in partitions of the provided data with alternative methods of data augmentation, patch cropping, rescaling and hyperparameter tuning (the number of filters, dropout rate and batch size). The most effective practices were data augmentation, patch cropping and rescaling. The developed classification model achieved an average F1 score of 0.72 on three separate test datasets even though it was trained on a relatively small training dataset. This study demonstrates the ability of state-of-the-art CNNs to map fine-grained land cover patterns from RGB remote sensing data. Because model performance is affected by the quality of data and labeling, an optimal selection of pre-processing practices is a requisite to improve the results.

TI  - Do Optimists Like Vaccines? The Effect of Perceived Vaccine Novelty and Beliefs in the World's Positivity and Orderliness on the Attitudes toward COVID-19 Vaccinations-The Case of European Young Adults
T2  - VACCINES
M3  - Article
AB  - The public debate over COVID-19 vaccinations tends to focus on vaccine-related arguments, such as their effectiveness and safety. However, the characteristics of a person's worldview, such as beliefs about the world's positivity and orderliness, may also shape attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccinations. These relationships were investigated using schema incongruity theory. The degree of the vaccine's incongruence with the world's order schema existing in people's minds was represented by perceived vaccine novelty. Accordingly, the results of an online survey among European young adults (N = 435) indicate that perceived vaccine novelty negatively affects behavioral outcomes (vaccination intent, willingness to pay for vaccinations, and vaccination advocacy). Moreover, there occurred a negative interaction effect of positivity and orderliness beliefs on behavioral outcomes. Specifically, an effect of positivity was more positive when people perceived the world as less ordered. Furthermore, this interaction effect was more negative when perceived vaccine novelty was higher. A mediating role of perceived vaccine effectiveness was demonstrated for the above relationships. The results extend the existing literature on people's worldviews into the domain of vaccine attitudes, and provide new insights on the role of perceived vaccine novelty. For vaccination policymakers and marketers, the paper suggests how to promote vaccinations with consideration of orderliness/positivity beliefs and vaccine novelty perception.

TI  - Earth Observation Data Exploitation in Urban Surface Modelling: The Urban Energy Balance Response to a Suburban Park Development
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cities are developing rapidly as an increasing percentage of the global population resides in urban areas. In the face of climate change, the sustainable development of cities is crucial for the well-being and safety of urban populations. The potential of planning interventions towards improving of urban resilience can be evaluated based on methodological approaches used in the domain of urban climate. In this study, we present how Earth Observation (EO) can be systematically used to evaluate urban planning interventions, based on Urban Surface Models (USM) simulations. More specifically, the impact of a suburban park development in Heraklion, Crete, was assessed based on simulations of the USM SUEWS (Surface Urban Energy and Water Balance Scheme), which was forced by EO data. Multi-source satellite data were analyzed to provide information on urban form, highlighting the importance of EO data in evaluating the environmental sustainability potential of urban planning interventions. The modifications caused by this planning intervention to surface energy fluxes were simulated. The scale (10(2) m) and the type (no-use vegetated area changed to recreational vegetated) of the intervention triggered minor responses in the Urban Energy Balance (UEB) at neighborhood scale, since the change of the relevant surface fluxes was not greater than 10 W m(-2), on average, assuming no irrigation and no important changes in soil moisture. However, the planned substitution of grass and bare soil with paved surfaces and trees was found to increase the overall net change in heat storage, therefore contributing to the urban heat island development.

TI  - Evaluation of Satellite-Derived Estimates of Lake Ice Cover Timing on Linnevatnet, Kapp Linne, Svalbard Using In-Situ Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Arctic lakes are sensitive to climate change, and the timing and duration of ice presence and absence (i.e., ice phenology) on the lake surface can be used as a climate indicator. In this study of Linnevatnet, one of the largest lakes on Svalbard, we compare inferences of lake ice duration from satellite data with continuously monitored lake water temperature and photographs from automatic cameras. Visible surface reflectance data from the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) were used to observe the change in the lake-wide mean surface reflectance of Linnevatnet from 2003-2019, and smoothing splines were applied to the to determine the date of summer ice-off (also called "break-up end"-BUE). Similarly, BUE and fall ice-on (or "freeze-up end"-FUE) were determined from lake-wide mean time series of Sentinel-1 microwave backscatter from 2014-2019. Overall, the ice timing dates identified from the satellite observations agree well with the in-situ observations (RMSE values of approximately 2-7 days for BUE and FUE, depending on the method and in-situ dataset), lending confidence to the accuracy of remote sensing of lake ice phenology in remote Arctic regions. Our observations of Linnevatnet indicate that BUE dates do not have a significant trend, while FUE dates have been occurring approximately 1.5 days later per year during the study period. These results support an overall decrease in annual duration of lake ice cover in this part of Svalbard.

TI  - Assessing changes in flora distribution of Akoka forest ecosystem, 52 years after urban encroachment using field surveys and integrated remote sensing data
T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
M3  - Article
AB  - The numerous benefits and the need to conserve urban forest is increasingly been acknowledged by scientists, land managers as well as decision makers. However, unlike the developed regions of the world, urban forest composition and structure in developing countries such as Nigeria remains the most threatened and least-studied. Using intensive field surveys and remote sensing data, this study investigated changes in species composition and structure of nine vegetation types in Akoka between 1962 and 2014. Field data on individual species was collected along a belt transect laid across the nine vegetation boundaries. Species composition, richness and diversity differed among the vegetation types as well as between 1962 and 2014. Species composition ranged from 3 to 19 across the vegetation types and was highest in fresh water swamp forest. While brackish marsh land had highest total number of individual, fresh water swamp forest located near the parks and garden had the least likely due to its nearness to ceaseless human disturbance. The species diversity was generally low across the vegetation types, and varied between 1.32 in brackish marsh land to 2.63 in mangrove swamp forest. The overall initial vegetation of Akoka had significantly fragmented and diminished between 1962 and 2014. Compared to 1962, the percentage vegetation cover by the major vegetation types had reduced, indicating that while anthropogenic disturbance persisted, little or no effort was put in place to improve their restoration. Overall, our findings pointed to the needs for sustainable management of urban forest with keen attention being paid to restoration.

TI  - Surface parameters and bedrock properties covary across a mountainous watershed: Insights from machine learning and geophysics
T2  - SCIENCE ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Bedrock property quantification is critical for predicting the hydrological response of watersheds to climate disturbances. Estimating bedrock hydraulic properties over watershed scales is inherently difficult, particularly in fracture-dominated regions. Our analysis tests the covariability of above- and belowground features on a watershed scale, by linking borehole geophysical data, near-surface geophysics, and remote sensing data. We use machine learning to quantify the relationships between bedrock geophysical/hydrological properties and geomorphological/vegetation indices and show that machine learning relationships can estimate most of their covariability. Although we can predict the electrical resistivity variation across the watershed, regions of lower variability in the input parameters are shown to provide better estimates, indicating a limitation of commonly applied geomorphological models. Our results emphasize that such an integrated approach can be used to derive detailed bedrock characteristics, allowing for identification of small-scale variations across an entire watershed that may be critical to assess the impact of disturbances on hydrological systems.

TI  - A Flexible Multi-Temporal and Multi-Modal Framework for Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Analysis Ready Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rich, complementary data provided by Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite constellations host considerable potential to transform Earth observation (EO) applications. However, a substantial amount of effort and infrastructure is still required for the generation of analysis-ready data (ARD) from the low-level products provided by the European Space Agency (ESA). Here, a flexible Python framework able to generate a range of consistent ARD aligned with the ESA-recommended processing pipeline is detailed. Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data are radiometrically calibrated, speckle-filtered and terrain-corrected, and Sentinel-2 multi-spectral data resampled in order to harmonise the spatial resolution between the two streams and to allow stacking with multiple scene classification masks. The global coverage and flexibility of the framework allows users to define a specific region of interest (ROI) and time window to create geo-referenced Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images, or a combination of both with closest temporal alignment. The framework can be applied to any location and is user-centric and versatile in generating multi-modal and multi-temporal ARD. Finally, the framework handles automatically the inherent challenges in processing Sentinel data, such as boundary regions with missing values within Sentinel-1 and the filtering of Sentinel-2 scenes based on ROI cloud coverage.

TI  - Characterizing chemical signaling between engineered "microbial sentinels" in porous microplates
T2  - MOLECULAR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Living materials combine a material scaffold, that is often porous, with engineered cells that perform sensing, computing, and biosynthetic tasks. Designing such systems is difficult because little is known regarding signaling transport parameters in the material. Here, the development of a porous microplate is presented. Hydrogel barriers between wells have a porosity of 60% and a tortuosity factor of 1.6, allowing molecular diffusion between wells. The permeability of dyes, antibiotics, inducers, and quorum signals between wells were characterized. A "sentinel" strain was constructed by introducing orthogonal sensors into the genome of Escherichia coli MG1655 for IPTG, anhydrotetracycline, L-arabinose, and four quorum signals. The strain's response to inducer diffusion through the wells was quantified up to 14 mm, and quorum and antibacterial signaling were measured over 16 h. Signaling distance is dictated by hydrogel adsorption, quantified using a linear finite element model that yields adsorption coefficients from 0 to 0.1 mol m(-3). Parameters derived herein will aid the design of living materials for pathogen remediation, computation, and self-organizing biofilms.

TI  - Physical Limnology and Sediment Dynamics of Lago Argentino, the World's Largest Ice-Contact Lake
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Proglacial lakes, whose numbers have been growing around the world, may drive accelerated glacier retreat and provide valuable records of past glacier and climatic changes. Despite their importance, few studies have investigated the sedimentary properties and processes acting within large proglacial lakes. Lago Argentino (LArg) is a 1,500 km(2) ice-contact lake on the eastern flank of the Southern Patagonian Icefield. Here, we describe the results from a detailed analysis of 47 sediment cores obtained throughout this lake basin, supplemented with remotely sensed data. We show that: (a) LArg exhibits a seasonal variation in sediment properties (varves); (b) varve formation results from three distinct processes, driven by seasonal changes in glacial sediment input, seasonal changes in fluvial sediment input, and seasonal variations in lake mixing; and (c) distance from glacier calving fronts provides the first-order control on sediment grain size and accumulation rate. Our findings highlight the exceptional preservation of annual laminations within proglacial lakes, their potential for reconstructing past glacier changes, and their relevance for forecasting future glacier-lake interactions.

TI  - The 27 September 2021 Earthquake in Central Crete (Greece)-Detailed Analysis of the Earthquake Sequence and Indications for Contemporary Arc-Parallel Extension to the Hellenic Arc
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Featured Application Field validation of combined remote sensing and seismological data after a large earthquake. The Arkalochori village in central Crete was hit by a large earthquake (M-w = 6.0) on 27 September 2021, causing casualties, injuries, and severe damage to the infrastructure. Due to the absence of apparent surface rupture and the initial focal mechanism solution of the seismic event, we initiated complementary, multi-disciplinary research by combining seismological and remote sensing data processing, followed by extensive field validation. Detailed geological mapping, fault surface measuring accompanied with tectonic analysis, fault photorealistic model creation by unmanned aerial system data processing, post-seismic surface deformation analysis by DInSAR image interpretation coupled with accurately relocated epicenters recorded by locally established seismographs have been carried out. The combination of the results obtained from these techniques led to the determination of the contemporary tectonic stress regime that caused the earthquake in central Crete, which was found compatible with extensional processes parallel to the Hellenic arc.

TI  - Air Quality Analysis in Lima, Peru Using the NO<sub>2</sub> Levels during the COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The emergence of the new COVID-19 virus in Peru forced the Peruvian government to take swift measures to stop its proliferation. Consequently, a state of emergency was declared, which included mandatory social isolation and quarantine. This action meant that people would transit only in emergency cases. In this context, this study's objective is to analyze the air quality changes in terms of the capital city's NO2 levels due to these government decisions using satellite imagery data obtained from the Sentinel-5P satellite. One critical problem is the lack of spatially distributed air quality data. The Peruvian Meteorological Service only monitors air quality in Lima, the capital city. In addition, the air quality ground stations are not always functioning. Thus, there is a need to find new reliable methods to complement the official data obtained. One method of doing so is the use of remote sensing products, although the accuracy and applicability are yet to be determined; therefore, this is the article's focus. A temporal and spatial analysis was developed quantitatively and qualitatively to measure the levels of NO2 in eighteen regions of Lima to contrast the quarantine's effect on polluting gas emission levels. The measurements are also compared with the official Peruvian data from ground sensors using Pearson correlation coefficients, thus, showing that Sentinel-5P data can be used for changes in the mean daily concentration of NO2. We also developed the first version of an open platform that converts the satellite data into a friendly format for visualization. The results show NO2 ambient concentration reductions compared to 2019 of between 60% and 40% in the first two weeks and between 50% and 25% in the following two weeks of the COVID-19 lockdown. However, this effect could not be observed two months after the start of the lockdown.

TI  - Mapping Canopy Cover in African Dry Forests from the Combined Use of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Data: Application to Tanzania for the Year 2018
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution Earth observation data is routinely used to monitor tropical forests. However, the seasonality and openness of the canopy of dry tropical forests remains a challenge for optical sensors. In this study, we demonstrate the potential of combining Sentinel-1 (S1) SAR and Sentinel-2 (S2) optical sensors in order to map the tree cover in East Africa. The overall methodology consists of: (i) the generation of S1 and S2 layers, (ii) the collection of an expert-based training/validation dataset and (iii) the classification of the satellite data. Three different classification workflows, together with different approaches to incorporating the spatial information to train the classifiers, are explored. Two types of maps were derived from these mapping approaches over Tanzania: (i) binary tree cover-no tree cover (TC/NTC) maps, and (ii) maps of the canopy cover classes. The overall accuracy of the maps is >95% for the TC/NTC maps and >85% for the forest types maps. Considering the neighboring pixels for training the classification improved the mapping of the areas that are covered by 1-10% tree cover. The study relied on open data and publicly available tools and can be integrated into national monitoring systems.

TI  - Progress in Developing Scale-Able Approaches to Field-Scale Water Accounting Based on Remote Sensing
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - To increase water productivity and assess water footprints in irrigated systems, there is a need to develop cheap and readily available estimates of components of water balance at fine spatial scales. Recent developments in satellite remote sensing platforms and modelling capacities have opened opportunities to address this need, such as those being developed in the WaterSENSE project. This paper showed how evapotranspiration, soil moisture, and farm-dam water volumes can be quantified based on the Copernicus data from the Sentinel satellite constellation. This highlights distinct differences between energy balance and crop factor approaches and estimates that can be derived from the point scale to the landscape scale. Differences in the results are related to assumptions in deriving evapotranspiration from remote sensing data. Advances in different parts of the water cycle and opportunities for crop detection and yield forecasting mean that crop water productivity can be quantified at field to landscape scales, but uncertainties are highly dependent on input data availability and reference validation data.

TI  - CONSTRUCTING AN EFFICIENT CLASSIFIER MODEL FOR NATURAL VEGETATION USING REGIONAL CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE SCIENCE AND PHARMA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The computation of natural vegetation is a time-consuming and carried out monotonous. This work concentrates on providing a sensor-based natural vegetation process or monitoring system. The significant element for this vegetation process is based on IoT sensors with micro-controllers for system processing, establishing communications among the interconnected nodes and various connected sensors. Some real-time data access is performed with the remote monitoring technologies. An available online dataset is considered for validation using Regional- Convolutional Neural Networks (R-CNN) and a rule-based system model. This approach is used for analyzing the standardized values. When the collected values are higher than the fixed threshold value, an alert is generated and moved to the remote location. The efficiency of the proposed R-CNN model is used to acquire natural vegetation monitoring system with lower power devices, higher mobility, and precision values.The sensitivity of R-CNN model is 98.58%, 94.50% specificity, 98.89% PPV, 96.58% NPV, and 96.58% prediction accuracy.

T2  - RUSIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper analyses the legacy of Stanislav Orekhovsky, who identified himself with the Rusins.He lived in the culture of the borderland, combining various cultural elements and stereotypes, which formed his original philosophical, religious, and socio-political ideas. The study of his work helps to determine the complex processes of the formation of the socio-cultural space and consciousness of the Rusins during the Renaissance. Moreover, understanding these processes provides a broader view of the events of that time in Europe. The originality of Orekhovsky's socio-political views is rooted in the intercultural dominant of his worldview. His socio-political views are determined by the idea of justice as a basic social value. Mentality and national character inf.luence the formation of ideas in the same way as education, ethnocultural self-awareness, and religion. Orekhovsky's socio-political views advanced those of other prominent representatives of the Enlightenment, in particular, his concept of equality of all under the law. His works provide a most deep and comprehensive picture of general trends in the development of cultural, philosophical, and socio-political thought of that time in the interaction of various aspects of human activity and the assimilation of cultures.

TI  - Combined satellite and portable XRF exploration mapping of the Zaaiplaats tin field, South Africa
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Zaaiplaats tin field is host to two of the historically most significant tin mines in South Africa. The geological maps of Zaaiplaats and Groenfontein have not been updated since the 1980s and 1950s respectively and warrant a renewed investigation. Cassiterite is hosted in the Bobbejaankop and Lease granites, of the Zaaiplaats and Groenfontein tin mines, which are part of the Lebowa Granite Suite of the Bushveld Complex. Tin mineralisation is primarily hosted as low-grade disseminations and within networks of high-grade hydrothermal pipes and lenticular ore-bodies. One difficulty in mapping such formations arises from the limited lithological variability between mineralised and unmineralised granitic facies. In order to map the granitic lithologies and discriminate alteration zones, an integrated approach is applied by combining remote sensing and in situ portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) mapping. The pXRF large ion lithophile (LIL) element distribution mapping, specifically correlating Rb, Sr and Ba with Sn, points to the concentration of late-stage magmatic-hydrothermal fluids, which are associated with endogranitic mineralisation. The use of the Rb/Ba ratio highlights regions of late-stage magmatic-hydrothermal alteration, effectively delineates granitic facies and identifies zones of potential tin mineralisation. Spectral image processing techniques were used as tools to support the mapping of these granites, their variable degrees of magmatic-hydrothermal alteration and regions of endogranitic disseminated mineralisation. We thus exemplify that an expert-based and synergic approach, combining inexpensive in situ pXRF and freely available satellite remote sensing data, supports the mapping and identification of endogranitic mineralisation in early exploration stages. Furthermore, due to its versatility, this approach can easily be applied to other styles of plutonic mineralisation.

TI  - A neural network-based method for satellite-based mapping of sediment-laden sea ice in the Arctic
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Sediment-laden sea ice is a ubiquitous phenomenon in the Arctic Ocean and its marginal seas. This study presents a satellite-based approach at quantifying the distribution of sediment-laden ice that allows for more extensive observations in both time and space to monitor spatiotemporal variations in sediment-laden ice. A structural-optical model coupled with a four-stream multilayer discrete ordinates method radiative transfer model was used to examine surface spectral albedo for four surface types: clean ice, sediment-laden ice with 15 different sediment loadings from 25 to 1000 g m(-3), ponded ice, and ice-free open water. Based on the fact that the spectral characteristics of sediment-laden ice differ from those other surface types, fractions of sediment-laden ice were estimated from the remotely-sensed surface reflectance by a spectral unmixing algorithm using a least square method. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that a combination of sediment loads of 50 and 500 g m(-3) effectively represents the areal fraction of sediment-laden ice with a wide range of sediment loads. The estimated fractions of each surface type and corresponding remotely-sensed surface reflectances were used to train an artificial neural network to speed up processing relative to the least squares method. Comparing the fractions of sediment-laden ice derived from these two approaches yielded good agreements for areal fractions of sediment-laden ice, highlighting the superior performance of the neural network for processing large datasets. Although our approach contains potential uncertainties associated with methodological limitations, spatiotemporal variations in sediment-laden ice exhibited reasonable agreement with spatial patterns and seasonal variations reported in the literature on in situ observations of sediment-laden ice. Systematic satellite-based monitoring of sediment-laden ice distribution can provide extensive, sustained, and cost-effective observations to foster our under-standing of the role of sediment-laden ice in a wide variety of research fields including sediment transport and biogeochemical cycling.

TI  - Effects of Land Use/Cover on Regional Habitat Quality under Different Geomorphic Types Based on InVEST Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Research on habitat quality change is of great significance for regional ecological security. Analysis of spatiotemporal change of habitat quality based on different geomorphic types can restore the background of ecological environment in historical periods and provide scientific support for revealing the evolution law of regional ecological environment quality and ecological restoration. This study aimed to identify the change in habitat quality under different geomorphic types from 1995 to 2018. Based on DEM data, geomorphic types of different scales were divided. The InVEST habitat quality model was used to analyze the spatiotemporal change in habitat quality in individual land use types in the Altay region. The spatiotemporal changes and main influencing factors of habitat quality under the background of different geomorphic types were explored. Remote sensing data was used to analyze the land use/cover changes. Sixteen threat sources, their maximum distance of impact, mode of decay, and sensitivity to threats were also estimated for each land use type. The results showed that habitat quality decreased significantly in 2015, which was related to the rapid expansion of cultivated and construction land as threat sources, as well as the decrease of forestland and grassland as sensitive factors. However, habitat quality improved significantly in 2018, because of the implementation of ecological restoration policy in 2015. Affected by elevation and topographic relief, the geomorphic type with the best habitat quality index was the large undulating middle mountain (0.927) and the worst was the medium altitude platform (0.351). Woodland contributed the most to habitat quality in large undulating middle mountain (35.07), and bare rock gravel land contributed the most to medium altitude platform (127.68). Habitat quality of different geomorphic types showed obvious spatial aggregation, and from high altitude to low altitude showed a banded ladder-like distribution. Changes in habitat quality during the past three decades suggested that the conservation and restoration strategies applied in regional ecosystem were effective. On the basis of the analysis results, four types of zoning management schemes were divided, and the ecological management and conservation measures were put forward. Therefore, this study can help decision makers, especially regarding the lack of data on biodiversity.

TI  - SDTGAN: Generation Adversarial Network for Spectral Domain Translation of Remote Sensing Images of the Earth Background Based on Shared Latent Domain
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The synthesis of spectral remote sensing images of the Earth's background is affected by various factors such as the atmosphere, illumination and terrain, which makes it difficult to simulate random disturbance and real textures. Based on the shared latent domain hypothesis and generation adversarial network, this paper proposes the SDTGAN method to mine the correlation between the spectrum and directly generate target spectral remote sensing images of the Earth's background according to the source spectral images. The introduction of shared latent domain allows multi-spectral domains connect to each other without the need to build a one-to-one model. Meanwhile, additional feature maps are introduced to fill in the lack of information in the spectrum and improve the geographic accuracy. Through supervised training with a paired dataset, cycle consistency loss, and perceptual loss, the uniqueness of the output result is guaranteed. Finally, the experiments on the Fengyun satellite observation data show that the proposed SDTGAN method performs better than the baseline models in remote sensing image spectrum translation.

TI  - A Detection Method for Collapsed Buildings Combining Post-Earthquake High-Resolution Optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The detection of collapsed buildings based on post-earthquake remote sensing images is conducive to eliminating the dependence on pre-earthquake data, which is of great significance to carry out emergency response in time. The difficulties in obtaining or lack of elevation information, as strong evidence to determine whether buildings collapse or not, is the main challenge in the practical application of this method. On the one hand, the introduction of double bounce features in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images are helpful to judge whether buildings collapse or not. On the other hand, because SAR images are limited by imaging mechanisms, it is necessary to introduce spatial details in optical images as supplements in the detection of collapsed buildings. Therefore, a detection method for collapsed buildings combining post-earthquake high-resolution optical and SAR images was proposed by mining complementary information between traditional visual features and double bounce features from multi-source data. In this method, a strategy of optical and SAR object set extraction based on an inscribed center (OpticalandSAR-ObjectsExtraction) was first put forward to extract a unified optical-SAR object set. Based on this, a quantitative representation of collapse semantic knowledge in double bounce (DoubleBounceCollapseSemantic) was designed to bridge a semantic gap between double bounce and collapse features of buildings. Ultimately, the final detection results were obtained based on the improved active learning support vector machines (SVMs). The multi-group experimental results of post-earthquake multi-source images show that the overall accuracy (OA) and the detection accuracy for collapsed buildings (P-cb) of the proposed method can reach more than 82.39% and 75.47%. Therefore, the proposed method is significantly superior to many advanced methods for comparison.

TI  - Navigation Observation of Reflectance Spectrum of Water Surface in Inland Rivers
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - In situ measurement of water spectrum is one of the indispensable basic works in the research of water optical properties and watercolor remote sensing inversion modeling. The conventional oblique observation method is restricted by its strict observation geometric conditions, it is necessary to constantly adjust the observation angle according to the position of the ship and the azimuth of the sun, especially for the spectral observation of river water, need to consider the river direction, shoreline shelter and other conditions. Therefore, only a few stations can be set for observation of discrete sample points, it is not easy to carry out rapid observation for continuous navigation in the river water with complex environments around the shoreline. The rapid observation for continuous navigation of the field water spectrum can obtain the reflectance spectrum of large samples of water from different local times, enrich the understanding of the bidirectional reflection characteristics of water, and establish more accurate inversion models, which plays an extremely important role in the study of watercolor remote sensing. Because of this, a rapid observation method for continuous navigation of reflectance spectrum of inland river surface water based on vertical observation geometry is designed in this study, and then obtained the full-wavelength remote sensing reflectance data of the whole river through Spatio-temporal matching technology. The experiments in some sections of XiXiao River in Hangzhou show that the correlation coefficient between remote sensing reflectance obtained by this method and the watercolor components such as chlorophyll concentration and turbidity measured synchronically is strong, the determination coefficients R-2 are all greater than 0. 855 at the characteristic bands selected in this study. The observation zenith angle of Sentinel-2 is close to 0, close to vertical observation. In this study, use the spectral response function of Sentinel-2B to perform equivalent spectral simulation of the measured spectrum and converts it into the equivalent remote sensing reflectance of the corresponding bands. The inversion result is modeled with the sensing reflectance data after atmospheric correction based on Sen2Cor. The analysis results show that the remote sensing reflectance data after atmospheric correction based on Sen2Cor is obviously overestimated. At the same time, use of Sentinel-2B's atmospheric apparent reflectance to deduce the radiance, then used FLAASH atmospheric correction to obtain the remote sensing reflectance of Sentinel-2B. By modeling and analyzing the equivalent remote sensing reflectance, the remote sensing reflectance data after atmospheric correction based on FLAASH is also overestimated when it is less than 0. 02 sr(-1), but obviously underestimated when it is greater than 0. 02 sr(-1). Research shows that the large sample measured remote sensing reflectance data obtained by this method has the application potential to verify the authenticity of satellite reflectance products.

TI  - A Modified ALOS Method of Path Tracking for AUVs with Reinforcement Learning Accelerated by Dynamic Data-Driven AUV Model
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & ROBOTIC SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Path tracking has a significant impact on the success of long-term autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) missions in terms of safety, energy-saving, and efficiency. However, it is a challenging problem due to the model uncertainty, and ocean current disturbance. Moreover, the widely used line of sight (LOS) algorithm with fixed lookahead distance does not perform well because it requires an urgent need for the automatic adjustment of the parameter. Considering the above, this study proposes an adaptive line-of-sight (ALOS) guidance method with reinforcement learning (RL) based on the dynamic data-driven AUV model (DDDAM). Firstly, we introduced a detailed AUV dynamic model mainly including the models with and without current influence. Next, we conducted a detailed analysis of the path tracking error dynamics and the factors influencing the tracking performance based on the model proposed above. We then used the DDDAM (using long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network) to pre-train the RL framework to generate more samples for online learning in order to speed up the learning process. Finally, the deterministic policy gradient (DPG) based RL was designed to optimize the continuously varying lookahead distance considering the previously analyzed factors. Collectively, this paper presents simulation cases and an evaluation of the algorithm. Our results indicate that the proposed method significantly improves the performance of path tracking with effectiveness and robustness.

TI  - Estimating High-Resolution PM<sub>2.5</sub> Concentrations by Fusing Satellite AOD and Smartphone Photographs Using a Convolutional Neural Network and Ensemble Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol optical depth (AOD) data derived from satellite products have been widely used to estimate fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations. However, existing approaches to estimate PM2.5 concentrations are invariably limited by the availability of AOD data, which can be missing over large areas due to satellite measurements being obstructed by, for example, clouds, snow cover or high concentrations of air pollution. In this study, we addressed this shortcoming by developing a novel method for determining PM2.5 concentrations with high spatial coverage by integrating AOD-based estimations and smartphone photograph-based estimations. We first developed a multiple-input fuzzy neural network (MIFNN) model to measure PM2.5 concentrations from smartphone photographs. We then designed an ensemble learning model (AutoELM) to determine PM2.5 concentrations based on the Collection-6 Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction AOD product. The R-2 values of the MIFNN model and AutoELM model are 0.85 and 0.80, respectively, which are superior to those of other state-of-the-art models. Subsequently, we used crowdsourced smartphone photographs obtained from social media to validate the transferability of the MIFNN model, which we then applied to generate smartphone photograph-based estimates of PM2.5 concentrations. These estimates were fused with AOD-based estimates to generate a new PM2.5 distribution product with broader coverage than existing products, equating to an average increase of 12% in map coverage of PM2.5 concentrations, which grows to an impressive 25% increase in map coverage in densely populated areas. Our findings indicate that the robust estimation accuracy of the ensemble learning model is due to its detection of nonlinear correlations and high-order interactions. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that the synergy of smartphone photograph-based estimations and AOD-based estimations generates significantly greater spatial coverage of PM2.5 distribution than AOD-based estimations alone, especially in densely populated areas where more smartphone photographs are available.

TI  - Towards Consistent Soil Moisture Records from China's FengYun-3 Microwave Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture plays an essential role in the land-atmosphere interface. It has become necessary to develop quality large-scale soil moisture data from satellite observations for relevant applications in climate, hydrology, agriculture, etc. Specifically, microwave-based observations provide more consistent land surface records because they are unhindered by cloud conditions. The recent microwave radiometers onboard FY-3B, FY-3C and FY-3D satellites launched by China's Meteorological Administration (CMA) extend the number of available microwave observations, covering late 2011 up until the present. These microwave observations have the potential to provide consistent global soil moisture records to date, filling the data gaps where soil moisture estimates are missing in the existing records. Along these lines, we studied the FY-3C to understand its added value due to its unique time of observation in a day (ascending: 22:15, descending: 10:15) absent from the existing satellite soil moisture records. Here, we used the triple collocation technique to optimize a benchmark retrieval model of land surface temperature (LST) tailored to the observation time of FY3C, by evaluating various soil moisture scenarios obtained with different bias-imposed LSTs from 2014 to 2016. The globally optimized LST was used as an input for the land parameter retrieval model (LPRM) algorithm to obtain optimized global soil moisture estimates. The obtained FY-3C soil moisture observations were evaluated with global in situ and reanalysis datasets relative to FY3B soil moisture products to understand their differences and consistencies. We found that the RMSEs of their anomalies were mostly concentrated between 0.05 and 0.15 m(3) m(-3), and correlation coefficients were between 0.4 and 0.7. The results showed that the FY-3C ascending data could better capture soil moisture dynamics than the FY-3B estimates. Both products were found to consistently complement the skill of each other over space and time globally. Finally, a linear combination approach that maximizes temporal correlations merged the ascending and descending soil moisture observations separately. The results indicated that superior soil moisture estimates are obtained from the combined product, which provides more reliable global soil moisture records both day and night. Therefore, this study aims to show that there is merit to the combined usage of the two FY-3 products, which will be extended to the FY-3D, to fill the gap in existing long-term global satellite soil moisture records.

TI  - A Hybrid Multivariate Deep Learning Network for Multistep Ahead Sea Level Anomaly Forecasting
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The accumulated remote sensing data of altimeters and scatterometers have provided new opportunities for ocean state forecasting and have improved our knowledge of ocean-atmosphere exchanges. Studies on multivariate, multistep, spatiotemporal sequence forecasts of sea level anomalies (SLA) for different modalities, however, remain problematic. In this paper, we present a novel hybrid and multivariate deep neural network, named HMnet3, which can be used for SLA forecasting in the South China Sea (SCS). First, a spatiotemporal sequence forecasting network is trained by an improved convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) network using a channelwise attention mechanism and multivariate data from 1993 to 2015. Then a time series forecasting network is trained by an improved long short-term memory (LSTM) network, which is realized by ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD). Finally, the two networks are combined by a successive correction method to produce SLA forecasts for lead times of up to 15 days, with a special focus on the open sea and coastal regions of the SCS. During the testing period of 2016-18, the performance of HMnet3 with sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA), wind speed anomaly (SPDA), and SLA data is much better than those of state-of-the-art dynamic and statistical (ConvLSTM, persistence, and climatology) forecast models. Stricter testbeds for trial simulation experiments with real-time datasets are investigated, where the eddy classification metrics of HMnet3 are favorable for all properties, especially for those of small-scale eddies.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Extraction of Surface Waterbody and Its Response of Extreme Climate along the Upper Huaihe River
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The upper Huaihe River is the water-producing area of the Huaihe River Basin and the major grain and oil-producing area in China. The changing global climate over the recent years has increased the frequency of extreme weather in the upper reaches of the Huaihe River. Research on the responses of surface water bodies to extreme climates has become increasingly important. Based on all utilizable Landsat 4-8 T1-SR data and frequency mapping, the spatio-temporal extraction of surface water and its response to extreme climate were studied. We generated high-precision frequency maps of surface water, and a comparison of cartographic accuracy evaluation indices and spatial consistency was also carried out. The high-precision interpretation of small waterbodies constructs a surface water distribution with better continuity and integrity. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of El Nino/La Nina events on precipitation, temperature, and surface water along the upper Huaihe River, using the Mann-Kendall mutation tests. The results show: in 1987-2018, periods of abrupt changes in precipitation coincide with EI Nino/La Nina events, indicating that the precipitation was sensitive to EI Nino/La Nina events, which also strongly correlated with surface water area during wet and dry years. The effect of extreme events on seasonal water was smaller than permanent water. Surface water area showed an insignificant declining trend after 1999 and a significant drop in 2012. The phenomenon of topographic enhancement of precipitation controlled the spatial distribution of permanent water, with human activities having a substantial effect on the landscape pattern of seasonal water. Finally, discussions and applications related to the Markov Chain probability calculation theory in the paper contributed to enriching the theories on frequency mapping. The relevant results provide a theoretical basis and case support for the formulation of long-term water resources utilization and allocation policies.

TI  - Bathymetry Inversion Method Based on Adaptive Empricial Semi-Analytical Model without <i>in situ</i> Data-A Case Study in South China Sea
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - As a supplementary means of acoustic measurement, satellite depth inversion plays an important role in disputed islands and reefs. However, due to the lack of measured water depth data and the limitation of the number of visible light segments in multi-spectral images, the traditional empirical model and semi-analytical model can not be used. Aiming at the remote sensing images with only three visible bands, an adaptive empirical semi-analytical model without measured water depth data is proposed. The new model is based on the partial pixel water depth obtained by the joint semi-analytical model and two empirical models, and the cooperative adaptive linear ratio model can determine the final result. The Sentinel-2 image (spatial resolution is 10 m) is used to test the AESM model, Log_ratio model and Log-ratio and Semianalytical (L-S) model in Ganquan island and Langhua reef, and the calculated results are compared with the water depth data. The results show that the root mean square error (RMSE) of the new model is 1. 14 m in Ganquan island and 1.55 m in Langhua reef, respectively. The inversion accuracy of the new model is slightly better than that of the Log_ratio model trained with 200 water depth data. Compared with the L-S model, which also does not require water depth data, the RMSE of the new model is reduced by 0.12 m and 1.25 m, respectively.

TI  - Coupling Relationship of Urban Development and the Eco-Environment in Guanzhong Region, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the 21st century, China's rapid urban development has had profound impacts on the regional eco-environment and posed severe threats to regional sustainable development. In order to scientifically evaluate the coupling relationship between urban development and the eco-environment in the Guanzhong region, in this paper, by combining nighttime lighting data and MODIS data in 2001, 2010 and 2018, we applied an overall coupling model and a coordination model to discuss the spatial-temporal coupling and coordination relationship between urban development and the eco-environment. The results showed the following: (1) From 2001 to 2018, the urbanization development in the Guanzhong region significantly improved and the links between cities were continuously strengthened, but the degree of contact still needed to be improved. (2) The eco-environment quality in the Guanzhong region slightly increased, but the overall level was low. The structure of the eco-environment quality grade changed greatly, and "Good" grades changed to "Very Good". (3) During 2001-2018, the overall coupling situation between urban development and the eco-environment strengthened and the degree of coordination increased. The coupling coordinator subtype gradually transformed from system balanced development into system balanced development, the ecology lag type, and the urban development lag type coexisting phenomenon. The results of the study suggest that future urban development planning and ecological protection policies need to take the coordinated coupling between urban development and the eco-environment into account.

TI  - Consistency Analysis and Accuracy Assessment of Three Global Ten-Meter Land Cover Products in Rocky Desertification Region-A Case Study of Southwest China
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Rocky desertification is one of the most critical ecological and environmental problems in areas underlain by carbonate rocks globally. Land cover and land use in the region affects large-scale ecosystem processes on a global scale, and many Earth system models rely on accurate land cover information. Therefore, it is important to evaluate current global land cover products and to understand the differences between them, and the findings of these studies can provide guidance to different researchers when using or making land cover products. Whereas there are many studies on the assessment of coarser resolution land cover products, there are few studies on the assessment of higher resolution land cover products (10 m). In order to provide guidance for users of 10 m data, this paper uses the rock deserted southwest region of China as the experimental area. We analyzed the consistency and accuracy of the FROM-GLC, ESA WorldCover 10 and ESRI products using spatial pattern consistency, absolute accuracy assessment of three validation samples, and analyzed their intrinsic relationships among classification systems, classification methods, and validation samples. The results show that (1) the overall accuracy of the FROM-GLC product is the highest, ranging from 49.47 to 62.42%; followed by the overall accuracy of the ESA product, ranging from 45.13 to 64.50%; and the overall accuracy of the ESRI product is the lowest, between 39.03 and 61.94%. (2) The consistency between FROM-GLC and ESA is higher than the consistency between other products, with an area correlation coefficient of 0.94. Analysis of the spatial consistency of the three products shows that the proportion of perfectly consistent areas is low at 44.89%, mainly in areas with low surface heterogeneity and more homogeneous cover types. (3) Across the study area, the main land cover types such as forest and water bodies were the most consistent across the three product species, while the grassland, shrubland, and bareland were lower. All products showed high accuracy in homogeneous areas, with local accuracy varied in other areas, especially at high altitudes in the central and western regions. Therefore, land cover users cannot use these products directly when conducting relevant studies in rocky desertification areas, as their use may introduce serious errors.

TI  - MULTI-FACTOR STATUS PREDICTION BY 4D FRACTAL CNN BASED ON REMOTE SENSING IMAGES
T2  - FRACTALS-COMPLEX GEOMETRY PATTERNS AND SCALING IN NATURE AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - With the acceleration of industrialization and urbanization, most lakes and reservoirs have been in eutrophication state. Eutrophication of water body will produce a series of environmental problems, among which cyanobacteria bloom is one of the most studied and seriously polluted problems. It is of great significance to effectively control the occurrence of cyanobacteria blooms by predicting and simulating the outbreak process of cyanobacteria blooms and accurately forecasting the relevant governance departments. However, there are two problems in the existing analysis of algal blooms: on the one hand, it is difficult to consider the impact of other factors on cyanobacteria blooms by taking chlorophyll concentration as the main influencing factor, and it is also unable to determine the relationship between various factors. On the other hand, only based on the field monitoring data research, lack of comprehensive analysis of the whole water area. The remote sensing image can reflect the change of the whole water area, but the traditional analysis method is difficult to deal with the massive remote sensing data effectively. In this study, eutrophication level was used as characterization index of cyanobacteria bloom, and the remote sensing image and its inversion map were taken as the main research data, and a new method of cyanobacteria bloom prediction based on four-dimensional (4D) fractal CNN was proposed. The prediction model uses 4D fractal CNN to extract the features of multi factor remote sensing images, capture the temporal and spatial characteristics and the interaction between multiple factors, and predict the eutrophication level of water body. In this study, a total of 216 remote sensing images of Taihu Lake Basin were selected from 29 groups with fine weather from 2009 to 2010 obtained by MODIS satellite. The simulation results show that the method proposed in this paper has excellent prediction performance, and the accuracy rate of 85.71% is better than that of common 3D CNN and 4D CNN models.

TI  - Incorporation of Net Radiation Model Considering Complex Terrain in Evapotranspiration Determination with Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is the primary mechanism of water transformation between the land surface and atmosphere. Accurate ET estimation given complex terrain conditions is essential to guide water resource management in mountainous areas. This study is based on the ETWatch model driven by Sentinel-2 remote sensing data at a spatial resolution of 10 m incorporating a net radiation model considering the impact of a complex terrain. We tested our model with two years of data in two regions with a high relief near the Huairou (2020) and Baotianman (2019) weather stations. Regarding the validation results of the ET model, the coefficient of determination (R-2) reached 0.84 in Huairou and 0.86 in Baotianman, while the root mean square error (RMSE) value reached 0.59 mm in Baotianman and 0.82 mm in Huairou. The validation results indicated that the model is applicable in regions with a complex terrain, and the ET results can capture topographic textures. In terms of the slope aspect, the ET value on south-facing slopes is higher than that on north-facing slopes in both study areas. Accurate ET monitoring in mountainous regions with a high relief yields a profound meaning in obtaining a better understanding of the characteristics of heat and water fluxes at different vegetation growth stages and underlying surface types, which can provide constructive suggestions for water management in mountainous areas.

TI  - Evaluation of survey and remote sensing data products used to estimate land use change in the United States: Evolving issues and emerging opportunities
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
M3  - Review
AB  - Transparent, consistent, and statistically reliable land use/ land cover area estimates are needed to assess land use change and greenhouse gas emissions associated with biofuel production and other land uses that are influenced by policy. As relevant studies have increased rapidly during past decades, the methods used to combine data extracted from land use land cover (LULC) surveys and remote sensing-based products and track or report sources of uncertainty vary notably. This paper reviews six data sources that are most commonly used to investigate LULC and change in the contiguous U.S. by highlighting the main characteristics, strengths and weaknesses and considering how uncertainty is assessed by the June Area Survey (JAS), the Census of Agri-culture (COA), the Farm Survey Agency (FSA) acreage, the National Resources Inventory (NRI), the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI), and the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA); and two remote sensing-based data products, the Cropland Data Layer (CDL) and the National Land Cover Database (NLCD). The summary and conclusion identify important research gaps or challenges limiting current land use/land cover and change studies (e.g., lack of high-quality reference data and uncertainty quantification, etc.) and opportunities and emerging techniques (data fusion and machine learning) that will improve reliability of land use/land cover assessments and associated policies. Blended approaches that marry high quality ground truth data that are more finely resolved than data supplied by government surveys with multitemporal imagery are needed track use of non-agricultural lands vulnerable to agricultural expansion. These considerations are notably important as the U. S. considers the renewal and possibly revision of its Renewable Fuel Standard, which includes provisions that require monitoring of agricultural land expansion.

TI  - A framework for determining the total salt content of soil profiles using time-series Sentinel-2 images and a random forest-temporal convolution network
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization causes a deterioration in soil health and threatens crop growth. Rapid identification of salini-zation in farmlands is of great significance to improve soil functions and to maintain sustainable land man-agement. As salt moves in soil profiles during plowing and irrigation, the commonly used protocol for measuring and monitoring salt content in topsoil does not provide a thorough assessment. In order to quantify and comprehensively evaluate the salt content in deep soil, this study developed a novel framework for monitoring total salt content in the soil profile to a depth of 1 m by combining information from time-series satellite images and machine learning. The field experiments were conducted in Alar, Southern Xinjiang, with a total of 120 soil samples and 582 measurements of EM38-MK2 apparent electrical conductivity in 2019 and 2020 to quantify the vertical variation in the salt content. A total of 42 covariates derived from time-series Sentinel-2 images, including 20 salinity indices, 10 soil indices, and 12 vegetation indices were used for modeling salinity in the soil profile. From the total covariates, 22 were selected using the Random Forest. Soil salinity which was modeled using a Temporal Convolution Network in 2019 and 2020 and forecast for 2021. The model effectively revealed the spatial and temporal variability of the salt content in the soil profile with R-2 of 0.71 and 0.65 for 2019 and 2020, respectively. The proposed new framework provides an effective method to estimate the salt content in the soil profile for precision agriculture in arid and semi-arid regions.

TI  - The Prediction of Storm-Time Thermospheric Mass Density by LSTM-Based Ensemble Learning
T2  - SPACE WEATHER-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate prediction of storm-time thermospheric mass density is always critically important and also a challenge. In this paper, an available prediction model is established by Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based ensemble learning algorithms. However, the generalization ability of the deep learning model is often suspicious since training data and testing data are from the same data set in the conventional method. Therefore, in order to objectively validate the performance and generalization of the model, we utilize the GOCE data for training and the SWARM-C data for testing to verify its performance mainly during the geomagnetic storm period. The results show that the LSTM-based ensemble learning model (LELM) is robust under different geomagnetic activity levels and has good generalization ability for the different satellite data set. The prediction accuracy of the LELM is proved to be better than a common-used empirical model (NRLMSISE-00). Thus, our approach provides a promising way to give reliable and stable predictions of thermospheric mass density.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The ocean is of great significance in the climate system, global resources and strategic decision making. With the continuous improvement in remote sensing technology, ocean remote sensing research has increasingly become an important topic for resource development and environmental protection. This paper uses bibliometric analysis method and VOSviewer visual software to conduct analysis. The analysis focuses on the period from 1990 to 2020. The analysis results show that articles have been steadily increasing over the past two decades. Scholars and researchers form the United States, China and Europe (mainly Western European countries), as well as NASA, Chinese Academy of Sciences and NOAA have bigger influence in this field to some extent. Among them, the United States and NASA holds the core leading position. Moreover, global cooperation in this field presents certain characteristics of geographical distribution. This study also reveals journals that include the most publications and subject categories that are highly relevant to related fields. Cluster analysis shows that remote sensing, ocean color, MODIS (or Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), chlorophy, sea ice and climate change are main research hotspots. In addition, in the context of climate warming, researchers have improved monitoring technology for remote sensing to warn and protect ocean ecosystems in hotspots (the Arctic and Antarctica). The valuable results obtained from this study will help academic professionals keep informed of the latest developments and identify future research directions in the field related to ocean remote sensing.

TI  - Controls on Larsen C Ice Shelf Retreat From a 60-Year Satellite Data Record
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid retreat of the Larsen A and B ice shelves has provided important clues about the ice shelf destabilization processes. The Larsen C Ice Shelf, the largest remaining ice shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula, may also be vulnerable to future collapse in a warming climate. Here, we utilize multisource satellite images collected over 1963-2020 to derive multidecadal time series of ice front, flow velocities, and critical rift features over Larsen C, with the aim of understanding the controls on its retreat. We complement these observations with modeling experiments using the Ice-sheet and Sea-level System Model to examine how front geometry conditions and mechanical weakening due to rifts affect ice shelf dynamics. Over the past six decades, Larsen C lost over 20% of its area, dominated by rift-induced tabular iceberg calving. The Bawden Ice Rise and Gipps Ice Rise are critical areas for rift formation, through their impact on the longitudinal deviatoric stress field. Mechanical weakening around Gipps Ice Rise is found to be an important control on localized flow acceleration and the propagation of two rifts that caused a major calving event in 2017. Capturing the time-varying effects of rifts on ice rigidity in ice shelf models is essential for making realistic predictions of ice shelf flow dynamics and instability. In the context of the Larsen A and Larsen B collapses, we infer a chronology of destabilization processes for embayment-confined ice shelves, which provides a useful framework for understanding the historical and future destabilization of Antarctic ice shelves.

TI  - The Mitigation Effect of Park Landscape on Thermal Environment in Shanghai City Based on Remote Sensing Retrieval Method
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The mitigation effects of park green space on Urban Heat Island (UHI) have been extensively documented. However, the relative effects of the configuration of park components on land surface temperature (LST) inside the park and indicators (i.e., park cooling intensity and distance) surrounding the park is largely unknown. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to explore the quantitative impacts of configuration and morphology features under different urban park scales on the cooling effect. In this study, based on Landsat-8 OLI/TIRS images on 3 August 2015 and 16 August 2020 during summer daytime, the LSTs of Shanghai City were retrieved by atmospheric correction method. Then, the relationships of park landscape features with LSTs in the park and typical indicators representing cooling efficiency of 24 parks on different grades were analyzed. The results showed that the average temperature in urban parks was, respectively, 1.46 degrees C and 1.66 degrees C lower than that in the main city of Shanghai in 2015 and 2020, suggesting that urban parks form cold islands in the city. The landscape metrics of park area (PA), park perimeter (PP), green area (GA) and water area (WA), were key characteristics that strong negatively affect the internal park LSTs. However, the park perimeter-to-area ratio (PPAR) had a significant positive power correlation with the park LSTs. Buffer zone analysis showed that LST cools down by about 0.67 degrees C when the distance from the park increases by 100 m. The Maximum Cooling Distance (MCD) for 2015 and 2020 had a significant correlation with PA, PC, PPAR, GA and WA, and increased sharply within the park area of 20 ha. However, the medium park group had the largest Maximum Cooling Intensity (MCI) in both periods, followed by the small park group. There could be a trade-off relationship between the MCD and MCI in urban parks, which is worth pondering to research. This study could be of great significance for planning and constructing park landscapes, alleviating Urban Heat Island effect and improving urban livability.

TI  - Smoke Injection Heights from Forest and Grassland Fires in Southwest China Observed by CALIPSO
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Smoke injection height (SIH) determines the distance and direction of smoke transport, thus impacting the atmospheric environment. In this study, we used Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations data coupled with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data and the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory model to derive the SIH values during the peak forest and grassland fire seasons from 2012 to 2017 in Southwest China. The results suggest that the SIH values ranged from 2500 m to 2890 m. An analysis of the dependence of SIH on fire characteristics revealed no obvious correlation between SIH and fire radiative power (FRP) because other factors in addition to FRP have an important impact on SIH. Moreover, MODIS FRP data has a drawback in representing the energy released by real fires, also leading to this result. The topographic variables of forest and grassland fires in Southwest China are very different. Complex topography affects SIH by affecting fire intensity and interactions with wind. A comparison of the SIHs with boundary layer height reveals that 75% of the SIHs are above the boundary layer. Compared with other areas, a higher percentage of free troposphere injection occurs in Southwest China, indicating that smoke can cause air pollution over large ranges. Our work provides a better understanding of the transport and vertical distribution of smoke in Southwest China.

TI  - Satellite solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence and near-infrared reflectance capture complementary aspects of dryland vegetation productivity dynamics
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mounting evidence indicates dryland ecosystems play an important role in driving the interannual variability and trend of the terrestrial carbon sink. Nevertheless, our understanding of the seasonal dynamics of dryland ecosystem carbon uptake through photosynthesis [gross primary productivity (GPP)] remains relatively limited due in part to the limited availability of long-term data and unique challenges associated with satellite remote sensing across dryland ecosystems. Here, we comprehensively evaluated longstanding and emerging satellite vegetation proxies in their ability to capture seasonal dryland GPP dynamics. Specifically, we evaluated: 1) reflectance-based proxies normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), near infrared reflectance index (NIRv), and kernel NDVI (kNDVI) from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS); and 2) newly available physiologically-based proxy solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). As a performance benchmark, we used GPP estimates from a robust network of 21 western United States eddy covariance tower sites that span representative gradients in dryland ecosystem climate and functional composition. We found that NIRv and SIF were the best performing GPP proxies and captured complementary aspects of seasonal GPP dynamics across dryland ecosystem types. NIRv offered better performance than the other proxies across relatively low-productivity, sparsely non-evergreen vegetated sites (R2 = 0.59 +/- 0.13); whereas SIF best captured seasonal dynamics across relatively high-productivity sites, including evergreen-dominated sites (R2 = 0.74 +/- 0.07). Notably, across grass-dominated sites, all reflectance-based proxies (NDVI, SAVI, NIRv and kNDVI) showed significant seasonal bias (hysteresis) that strengthened with the total fraction of woody vegetation cover, likely due to seasonal patterns in woody vegetation reflectance that are unrelated to or decoupled from GPP. Future efforts to fully integrate the complementary strengths of NIRv and SIF could significantly improve our understanding and representation of dryland GPP dynamics in satellite-based models.

TI  - Cloud-Snow Confusion with MODIS Snow Products in Boreal Forest Regions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable cloud masks in Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow cover products have a high potential to improve the retrieval of snow properties. However, cloud-snow confusion is a popular problem in MODIS snow cover products, especially in boreal forest areas. A large amount of forest snow is misclassified as clouds because of the low normalized difference snow index (NDSI), and excessive cloud masks limit the application of snow products. In addition, ice clouds are easily misclassified as snow due to their similar spectral characteristics, which leads to snow commission errors. In this paper, we quantitatively evaluated the cloud-snow confusion in Northeast China and found that snow-covered forests and transition zones from snow-covered to snow-free areas are prone to being misclassified as clouds, while clouds are less likely to be misclassified as snow. A temporal-sequence cloud-snow-distinguishing algorithm based on the high-frequency observation characteristics of the Himawarri-8 geostationary meteorological satellite is proposed. In the temporal-sequence images acquired from that satellite, the NDSI variance in cloud pixels should be greater than that of snow because clouds vary over time, while snow is relatively stable. In the MODIS snow cover products, the cloud pixels with NDSI variance lower than a threshold are identified as cloud-free areas and attributed their raw NDSI value, while the snow pixels with NDSI variance greater than the threshold are marked as clouds. We applied this method to MOD10A1 C6 in Northeast China. The results showed that the excessive cloud masks were greatly eliminated, and the new cloud mask was in good agreement with the real cloud distribution. At the same time, some possible ice clouds which had been misclassified as snow for their spectral characteristics similar to those of snow were identified correctly.

TI  - An Intercomparison of Satellite Derived Arctic Sea Ice Motion Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Arctic sea ice motion information provides an important scientific basis for revealing the changing mechanism of Arctic sea ice and assessing the navigational safety of Arctic waterways. For now, many satellite derived Arctic sea ice motion products have been released but few studies have conducted comparisons of these products. In this study, eleven satellite sea ice motion products from the Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI SAF), the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), and the French Research Institute for the Exploitation of the Seas (Ifremer) were systematically evaluated and compared based on buoys from the International Arctic Buoy Program (IABP) and the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) over 2018-2020. The results show that the mean absolute errors (MAEs) of ice speed for these products are 1.15-2.26 km/d and the MAEs of ice motion angle are 14.93-23.19 degrees. Among all products, Ifremer_AMSR2 achieves the best accuracy in terms of speed error, NSIDC_Pathfinder shows the lowest angle error and OSI-405-c_Merged performs best in sea-ice drift trajectory reconstruction. Moreover, season, region, data source, ice drift tracking algorithm, and time interval all influence the accuracy of these products: (1) The sea ice motion bias in the freezing season (1.04-1.96 km/d and 11.93-22.41 degrees) is smaller than that in the melting season (1.13-3.90 km/d and 14.41-27.41 degrees) for most of the products. (2) Most products perform worst in East Greenland, where ice movements are fast and complex. (3) The accuracies of the products derived from AMSR-2 remotely sensed data are better than those from other data sources. (4) The continuous maximum cross-correlation (CMCC) algorithm outperforms the maximum cross-correlation (MCC) algorithm in sea ice drift retrieval. (5) The MAEs of sea ice motion with longer time interval are relatively smaller. Overall, the results indicate that the eleven remote sensing Arctic sea ice drift products are of practical use for data assimilation and model validation if uncertainties are appropriately considered. Furthermore, this study provides some improvement directions for sea ice drift retrieval from satellite data.

TI  - A Two-Stage Pansharpening Method for the Fusion of Remote-Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The pansharpening (PS) of remote-sensing images aims to fuse a high-resolution panchromatic image with several low-resolution multispectral images for obtaining a high-resolution multispectral image. In this work, a two-stage PS model is proposed by integrating the ideas of component replacement and the variational method. The global sparse gradient of the panchromatic image is extracted by variational method, and the weight function is constructed by combining the gradient of multispectral image in which the global sparse gradient can provide more robust gradient information. Furthermore, we refine the results in order to reduce spatial and spectral distortions. Experimental results show that our method had high generalization ability for QuickBird, Gaofen-1, and WorldView-4 satellite data. Experimental results evaluated by seven metrics demonstrate that the proposed two-stage method enhanced spatial details subjective visual effects better than other state-of-the-art methods do. At the same time, in the process of quantitative evaluation, the method in this paper had high improvement compared with that other methods, and some of them can reach a maximal improvement of 60%.

TI  - Monitoring the Spatio-Temporal Dynamics of Shale Oil/Gas Development with Landsat Time Series: Case Studies in the USA
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Shale oil/gas extraction has expanded rapidly in the last two decades due to the rising energy prices and the advancement of technologies. Its development can have huge impacts on and, at the same time, is also deeply affected by energy markets, especially in an era with high economic uncertainty. Understanding and monitoring shale oil/gas development over large regions are critical for both energy policies and environmental protection. However, there are currently no applicable methods to track the spatio-temporal dynamics of shale oil/gas development. To fill this gap, we propose a new NDVI Trajectroy Matching algorithm to track shale oil/gas development using the annual Landsat NDVI composite time series from 2000 to 2020. The results reveal that our algorithm can accurately extract the location and time of shale oil/gas exploitation in Eagle Ford and Three Forks, with an accuracy of 83.80% and 81.40%, respectively. In the Eagle Ford area, accuracy for all disturbance year detection was greater than 66.67%, with the best in 2011 and 2019 at 90.00%. The lowest accuracy in the Three Forks area was 63.33% in 2002, while the highest accuracy was 93.33% in 2019. In conclusion, the algorithm can effectively track shale oil/gas development with considerable accuracy and simplicity. We believe that the algorithm has enormous potential for other applications, such as built-up regions, forests, farmlands, and water body expansion and contraction involving vegetation damage.

TI  - Seasonal Contrast and Interactive Effects of Potential Drivers on Land Surface Temperature in the Sichuan Basin, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Little is known about the seasonal heterogeneity of land surface temperature (LST) and the interaction relationship between potential drivers in Sichuan Basin, China. In this study, based on exploring the spatial heterogeneity of LST in Sichuan Basin, China, multi-source remote sensing data as potential drivers were selected and a Geo-detector model was applied to analyze the main drivers and the interactive relationship between drivers on LST during different seasons. The results showed that the high-temperature areas in Sichuan Basin in different seasons all appeared in the cities near the high mountains on the edge of the basin. This phenomenon was summarized as "sinking heat island" by us. From the driving factors, the biophysical parameters (DEM, SLOPE and NDVI) had the greatest impact on LST in each season, reaching the peak in the transition season. The climate parameters (WIND, HUM, PRE and TEM) and socioeconomic parameters (LIGHT, POP and ROAD) also had a certain impact on LST. The influence of a single landscape parameter (SHDI, PD, LPI, ED and LSI) on LST is limited. From the effect of factor interaction on LST, the interaction of biophysical parameters, climatic parameters and landscape parameters from summer to the transitional season was strengthened obviously, and it showed a downward trend in the winter; in contrast, the socioeconomic parameters showed the opposite characteristics, indicating that the interaction between human activities and other factors affected LST more obviously in the winter. The results of this study are not only valuable for understanding the spatial features of LST but also important for formulating mitigation strategies and sustainable development of urban heat island in Sichuan Basin.

TI  - Oil Palm Yield Estimation Based on Vegetation and Humidity Indices Generated from Satellite Images and Machine Learning Techniques
T2  - AGRIENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Palm oil has become one of the most consumed vegetable oils in the world, and it is a key element in profitable global value chains. In Costa Rica, oil palm cultivation is one of the three crops with the largest occupied agricultural area. The objective of this study was to explain and predict yield in safe time lags for production management by using free-access satellite images. To this end, machine learning methods were performed to a 20-year data set of an oil palm plantation located in the Central Pacific Region of Costa Rica and the corresponding vegetation indices obtained from LANDSAT satellite images. Since the best correlations corresponded to a one-year time lag, the predictive models Random Forest (RF), Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Recursive Partitioning and Regression Trees (RPART), and Neural Network (NN) were built for a Time-lag 1. These models were applied to all genetic material and to the predominant variety (AVROS) separately. While NN showed the best performance for multispecies information (r(2) = 0.8139, NSE = 0.8131, RMSE = 0.3437, MAE = 0.2605), RF showed a better fit for AVROS (r(2) = 0.8214, NSE = 0.8020, RMSE = 0.3452, MAE = 0.2669). The most relevant vegetation indices (NDMI, MSI) are related to water in the plant. The study also determined that data distribution must be considered for the prediction and evaluation of the oil palm yield in the area under study. The estimation methods of this study provide information on the identification of important variables (NDMI) to characterize palm oil yield. Additionally, it generates a scenario with acceptable uncertainties on the yield forecast one year in advance. This information is of direct interest to the oil palm industry.

TI  - An Approach to Improve the Spatial Resolution and Accuracy of AMSR2 Passive Microwave Snow Depth Product Using Machine Learning in Northeast China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover plays a highly critical role in the global water cycle and energy exchange. Accurate snow depth (SD) data are important for research on hydrologic processes, climate change, and natural disaster prediction. However, existing passive microwave (PMW) SD products have high uncertainty in Northeast China owing to their coarse spatial resolution. Surface environment parameters should also be considered to reduce errors in existing SD products. Otherwise, it is difficult to accurately capture snow spatiotemporal variations, especially in a complex environment (e.g., mountain or forests areas). To improve the inversion accuracy and spatial resolution of existing SD products in Northeast China, a multifactor SD downscaling model was developed by combining PMW SD data from the AMSR2 sensor, optical snow cover extent data, and surface environmental parameters to produce fine scale (500 m x 500 m) and high precision SD data. Validations at 98 ground meteorological stations show that the developed model greatly improved the spatial resolution and inversion accuracy of the raw AMSR2 SD product; its root-mean-square error (RMSE) reduced from 26.15 cm of the raw product to 7.58 cm, and the correlation coefficient (R) increased from 0.39 to 0.53. For other SD products (WESTDC and FY), the multifactor SD downscaling model still has good applicability, it could further improve the performance of the WESTDC and FY SD products in time and space and achieve better inversion accuracy than raw SD products. Furthermore, the proposed model exhibited good agreement with the observed SD data in a field quadrat (3 km x 2 km) within the fine scale, with an error ranging between -2 and 2 cm. Compared with the existing downscaling methods, the proposed model presented the best performance.

TI  - Crystallography relevant to Mars and Galilean icy moons: crystal behavior of kieserite-type monohydrate sulfates at extraterrestrial conditions down to 15 K
T2  - IUCRJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Monohydrate sulfate kieserites (M2+SO4 center dot H2O) and their solid solutions are essential constituents on the surface of Mars and most likely also on Galilean icy moons in our solar system. Phase stabilities of end-member representatives (M2+ = Mg, Fe, Co, Ni) have been examined crystallographically using single-crystal X-ray diffraction at 1 bar and temperatures down to 15 K, by means of applying open He cryojet techniques at in-house laboratory instrumentation. All four representative phases show a comparable, highly anisotropic thermal expansion behavior with a remarkable negative thermal expansion along the monoclinic b axis and a pronounced anisotropic expansion perpendicular to it. The lattice changes down to 15 K correspond to an `inverse thermal pressure' of approximately 0.7 GPa, which is far below the critical pressures of transition under hydrostatic compression (P-c >= 2.40 GPa). Consequently, no equivalent structural phase transition was observed for any compound, and neither dehydration nor rearrangements of the hydrogen bonding schemes have been observed. The M2+SO4 center dot H2O (M2+ = Mg, Fe, Co, Ni) end-member phases preserve the kieserite-type C2/c symmetry; hydrogen bonds and other structural details were found to vary smoothly down to the lowest experimental temperature. These findings serve as an important basis for the assignment of sulfate-related signals in remote-sensing data obtained from orbiters at celestial bodies, as well as for thermodynamic considerations and modeling of properties of kieserite-type sulfate monohydrates relevant to extraterrestrial sulfate associations at very low temperatures.

TI  - Shoreline variability and coastal vulnerability: Mossel Bay, South Africa
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal erosion may cause significant damage to property and infrastructure with far reaching socio-economic consequences. Assessing the site-specific shoreline dynamics is fundamental to understand the morphodynamic behaviour of a particular coastal area, as well as the associated coastal hazards. However, changes in shoreline position, even when significant, are not necessarily associated with increased coastal hazards. In this contribution we investigate the impact of short-term changes in shoreline position within a crenulated embayment of Mossel Bay. The 30 km-long embayment, located in the Western Cape region of South Africa, lies in a high-energy wave-dominated, micro-tidal setting. Mossel Bay is heavily populated and experiences an influx of tourists year-round. Much of the coastal community and infrastructure lies within 25-40 m of the foredune toe.Georeferenced Landsat 7/8 and Sentinel 2A scenes are used to manually digitise shoreline position in ArcMap, using the "wet/dry " line as a shoreline position proxy. The Digital Shoreline Analysis System was then used to generate shoreline change statistical metrics. Wave conditions were modelled using SWAN wave model, implemented using a nested grid approach with a high-resolution (10 m) inshore grid, and a lower resolution (50 m) offshore regional grid. The nearshore wave field during mean and storm conditions was obtained along the 15 m isobaths along the entire embayment.The embayment's orientation in relation to the prevailing swell direction results in significant alongshore variability in nearshore wave conditions; wave heights increase towards the east along the embayment. This variability in wave forcing is reflected by the changes in shoreline position in both long and short-term, computed using the end-point rate method. However, the areas of higher shoreline change are not those experiencing the worst detrimental effects.Over the long-term, the present-day Mossel Bay embayment is relatively stable, with no significant signs of extensive accretion or erosion. However, rapid migration the shoreline is documented on a seasonal scale (short-term) with significant change proximal to river mouths, areas influenced by megacusps, and regions where the highly dynamic shoreline behaviour is constrained by rocky platforms and unable to freely adjust to variations in forcing. Thus, Mossel Bay is divided into three sub-cells in terms of coastal processes and coastal vulnerability with hazards associated with the location of such infrastructure rather than the specific patterns of shoreline change.

TI  - Comparing Sentinel-2 and WorldView-3 Imagery for Coastal Bottom Habitat Mapping in Atlantic Canada
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing is a valuable tool to map and monitor the distribution of marine macrophytes such as seagrass and seaweeds that perform many ecological functions and services in coastal habitats. Various satellites have been used to map the distribution of these coastal bottom habitat-forming species, with each sensor providing unique benefits. In this study, we first explored optimal methods to create bottom habitat maps using WorldView-3 satellite imagery. We secondly compared the WorldView-3 bottom habitat maps to previously produced Sentinel-2 maps in a temperate, optically complex environment in Nova Scotia, Canada to identify the top performing classification and the advantages and disadvantages of each sensor. Sentinel-2 provides a global, freely accessible dataset where four bands are available at a 10-m spatial resolution in the visible and near infrared spectrum. Conversely, WorldView-3 is a commercial satellite where eight bands are available at a 2-m spatial resolution in the visible and near infrared spectrum, but data catalogs are costly and limited in scope. Our optimal WorldView-3 workflow processed images from digital numbers to habitat classification maps, and included a semiautomatic stripe correction. Our comparison of bottom habitat maps explored the impact of improved WorldView-3 spatial resolution in isolation, and the combined advantage of both WorldView's increased spatial and spectral resolution relative to Sentinel-2. We further explored the effect of tidal height on classification success, and relative changes in water clarity between images collected at different dates. As expected, both sensors are suitable for bottom habitat mapping. The value of WorldView-3 came from both its increased spatial and spectral resolution, particularly for fragmented vegetation, and the value of Sentinel-2 imagery comes from its global dataset that readily allows for large scale habitat mapping. Given the variation in scale, cost and resolution of the two sensors, we provide recommendations on their use for mapping and monitoring marine macrophyte habitat in Atlantic Canada, with potential applications to other coastal areas of the world.

TI  - Mapping Restoration Activities on Dirk Hartog Island Using Remotely Piloted Aircraft Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Conservation practitioners require cost-effective and repeatable remotely sensed data for assistive monitoring. This paper tests the ability of standard remotely piloted aircraft (DJI Phantom 4 Pro) imagery to discriminate between plant species in a rangeland environment. Flights were performed over two 0.3-0.4 ha exclusion plot sites, established as controls to protect vegetation from translocated animal disturbance on Dirk Hartog Island, Western Australia. Comparisons of discriminatory variables, classification potential, and optimal flight height were made between plot sites with different plant species diversity. We found reflectance bands and height variables to have high differentiation potential, whilst measures of texture were less useful for multisegmented plant canopies. Discrimination between species varied with omission errors ranging from 13 to 93%. Purposely resampling c. 5 mm imagery as captured at 20-25 m above terrain identified that a flight height of 120 m would improve capture efficiency in future surveys without hindering accuracy. Overall accuracy at a site with low species diversity (n = 4) was 70%, which is an encouraging result given the imagery is limited to visible spectral bands. With higher species diversity (n = 10), the accuracy reduced to 53%, although it is expected to improve with additional bands or grouping like species. Findings suggest that in rangeland environments with low species diversity, monitoring using a standard RPA is viable.

TI  - Comparison of Impervious Surface Dynamics through Vegetation/High-Albedo/Low-Albedo/Soil Model and Socio-Economic Factors
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Hong Kong and Shenzhen have entirely different land-use development policies, resulting in a disparity in the increase rate of impervious surface area. Impervious surface estimation is a significant method for evaluating urbanization, so that countries and cities can deal with their growing populations. The impervious surface area was estimated through Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) image extraction, the V-H-L-S (vegetation, high-albedo, low-albedo, and soil) model, and linear spectral un-mixing analysis (LSUM). Changes in fractions of endmembers over periods of time were identified and employed to analyze changes in land use and land cover (LULC). The research adopting the V-H-L-S model for classifying land cover and exploring the association of change in impervious surface areas and socio-economic growth over a period of time is limited. In this study, impervious surface estimations for Hong Kong and Shenzhen in 1995, 2005, and 2016 were compared, selecting vegetation, high-albedo, low-albedo, and soil as endmembers. The change rate of the fractions in the four endmembers was calculated to identify changes in land use and land cover during these three specific time periods. The impervious surface was determined to constitute a combination of high-albedo and low-albedo. Moreover, a proportional relationship exists between the increase in impervious surface area, population rate, GDP, and GDP per capita in both Hong Kong and Shenzhen. However, there was a difference in the increase in impervious surface area between Hong Kong and Shenzhen due to the different land-use policies in the country's two systems.

TI  - Utilization and survival benefit of adjuvant immunotherapy in resected high-risk stage II melanoma
T2  - SURGERY IN PRACTICE AND SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The risk of locoregional and distant recurrence of stage IIB/IIC cutaneous melanoma is high, and limited evidence exists on the clinical benefit of adjuvant immunotherapy (aIMT). This is the first retrospective study to evaluate the utilization and survival benefit of adjuvant immunotherapy (aIMT) for high-risk stage II cutaneous melanoma. Methods: The National Cancer Database (NCDB) was queried for stage IIB/IIC melanoma patients who underwent resection and sentinel lymph node biopsy. Chi-square tests and multivariable logistic regression examined associations between utilization of aIMT and socioeconomic and clinical characteristics. Propensity score weighted Cox proportional hazards model assessed impact of aIMT on overall survival.Results: Of the 8,549 patients with pathologic stage IIB/IIC melanoma, 344 (4.02%) patients received aIMT. Patients with pT4b disease or positive surgical margins were more likely to receive aIMT than patients with pT3b disease or negative margins (OR=3.10, OR=2.71, respectively, all P<0.001). Females or patients less than age 65 were more likely to receive aIMT (OR=1.36, OR=2.77, respectively, P<0.05). The Cox proportional hazard model demonstrated that receiving aIMT was associated with longer survival (HR=0.66, P<0.01).Conclusions: This study observed a survival advantage with utilization of immunotherapy for patients with resectable stage IIB/IIC melanoma. Sociodemographic differences on the receipt of aIMT warrant further attention.

TI  - Local climate impacts from ongoing restoration of a peatland
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - We hypothesize that peatlands represent a cool humid island in their landscape context and that this cool humid island effect could be brought about by successful peatland restoration. This study used 20 years of Earth observation data for land surface temperature (day- and night- time LST), albedo (near infra-red white sky albedo) and vegetation indices measured for 42 one km(2) grid squares across two peatlands and their surrounding arable fields. The peatlands have undergone restoration (re-vegetation and raising of water tables) since 2004. The results show that over the restored peatlands: Day time temperatures over the peatlands cooled relative to the surrounding arable-land by up to 1.1 K (degrees C), but there was no significant change in night time temperatures. Over the peatlands the average amplitude of the diurnal temperature cycle decreased by up to 2.4 K (degrees C) over the period of the restoration. Comparison to vegetation indices and albedo shows the cooling effect of increasing albedo was smaller than warming effect of changes aerodynamic resistance brought about by development of shrubby vegetation. The presence of an overall cooling effect, despite a warming effect due to vegetation development, means that a rising water table led to a lowering of the Bowen ratio. Peatlands revegetated to, or dominated by, moss carpets rather than shrubby vegetation will maximise the potential cooling effect, whereas shrub development across peatlands without a rise in water table would lead to warming.

TI  - A Three Stages Detail Injection Network for Remote Sensing Images Pansharpening
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multispectral (MS) pansharpening is crucial to improve the spatial resolution of MS images. MS pansharpening has the potential to provide images with high spatial and spectral resolutions. Pansharpening technique based on deep learning is a topical issue to deal with the distortion of spatio-spectral information. To improve the preservation of spatio-spectral information, we propose a novel three-stage detail injection pansharpening network (TDPNet) for remote sensing images. First, we put forward a dual-branch multiscale feature extraction block, which extracts four scale details of panchromatic (PAN) images and the difference between duplicated PAN and MS images. Next, cascade cross-scale fusion (CCSF) employs fine-scale fusion information as prior knowledge for the coarse-scale fusion to compensate for the lost information during downsampling and retain high-frequency details. CCSF combines the fine-scale and coarse-scale fusion based on residual learning and prior information of four scales. Last, we design a multiscale detail compensation mechanism and a multiscale skip connection block to reconstruct injecting details, which strengthen spatial details and reduce parameters. Abundant experiments implemented on three satellite data sets at degraded and full resolutions confirm that TDPNet trades off the spectral information and spatial details and improves the fidelity of sharper MS images. Both the quantitative and subjective evaluation results indicate that TDPNet outperforms the compared state-of-the-art approaches in generating MS images with high spatial resolution.

TI  - Emerging investigator series: the <i>red sky</i>: investigating the hurricane Ophelia Saharan dust and biomass burning aerosol event
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - On 16th October 2017 ex-hurricane Ophelia passed over the UK, bringing with it a unique mixture of particulates which caused the sky to turn a dramatic red colour. Here we use an ensemble of modelling and remote sensing techniques in a 'top-down, bottom-up' approach comprising instruments onboard orbital platforms and a ground-based lidar, to interrogate the particle loading to determine its composition and origins. Using a novel, miniature lidar system and back-trajectory modelling to link the measurements to sources, we show that the event comprised two distinct phases, the first dominated by Saharan dust (volume depolarisation ratio at 532 nm; delta = 0.15-0.25) and the second by an optically dense layer, starting at similar to 0.7 km, comprising a mixture of Saharan dust and biomass burning particles (delta = 0.08-0.18) originating from intense wildfires in the Iberian Peninsula. CO levels in the weather system were measured as high as similar to 273 ppbV and the aerosol index to be >5. Also, the Ophelia system was probed for the first time using multi-spectral imaging data from the Multispectral Instrument (MSI) onboard Sentinel-2. This allowed the differentiation of cloud composition types from above by virtue of the different spectral signatures of the components of the cloud matrix and in doing so gave important supporting evidence to complement the ground-based lidar observations.

TI  - Identifying Reservoirs and Estimating Evaporation Losses in a Large Arid Inland Basin in Northwestern China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Reservoirs play a vital role in agricultural irrigation, food security, and ecological protection in arid and semi-arid areas where water resources are scarce. In the Tarim Basin (TB) in northwestern China, a large number of reservoirs have been built or are being built, resulting in significant evaporation losses. However, information about the distribution, area and evaporation rate of the reservoirs in TB is limited. To contribute, we present an inventory of reservoirs and calculate their monthly surface area and evaporation rate during the study period of 1990-2019, using the TerraClimate dataset, Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, Landtrendr algorithm, Penman method, and Landsat images. The results suggest: (1) The inventory of 167 reservoirs in TB consists of 142 existing reservoirs (built before 1990), 5 new reservoirs (mountain reservoirs, built during 1990-2019), and 20 dried-up reservoirs (plain reservoirs that went extinct during 1990-2019). (2) The reservoir types in TB are mainly plain reservoirs with an altitude of less than 1500 m and an area of less than 10 km(2), accounting for about 88% of the total number of reservoirs. (3) The surface area of the reservoirs increased at a significant rate (p < 0.05) of 12.45 km(2)/y from 401 km(2) in 1990 to 766 km(2) in 2019. (4) The evaporation rate of the reservoirs increased at a slight trend of 0.004 mm/d/a and varied from 2.57 mm/d in 1990 to 2.39 mm/d in 2019. Lastly, (5) The evaporation losses of reservoirs in TB significantly increased (p < 0.05) from 4.72 x 10(8) m(3) to 4.92 x 10(8) m(3) due to the significant increase in reservoir surface area (p < 0.05) and the slight increase in evaporation rate from 1990 to 2019. This study provides essentials of the reservoir inventory, surface area, and evaporation rate with considerable baseline inferences for TB that may be beneficial for long-term investigations and assist in local water resources decision support and sustainable management in arid regions.

TI  - Revealing the Morphological Evolution of Krakatau Volcano by Integrating SAR and Optical Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On 22 December 2018, volcano Anak Krakatau, located in Indonesia, erupted and experienced a major lateral collapse. The triggered tsunami killed at least 437 people by the 13-m-high tide. Traditional optical imagery plays a great role in monitoring volcanic activities, but it is susceptible to cloud and fog interference and has low temporal resolution. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery can monitor volcanic activities at a high temporal resolution, and it is immune to the influence of clouds. In this paper, we propose an automatic method to accurately extract the volcano boundary from SAR images by combining multi-polarized water enhancement and the Nobuyuki Otsu (OTSU) method. We extract the area change of the volcano in 2018-2019 from Sentinel-1 images and ALOS-2 imagesThe area change and evolution are verified and analyzed by combing the results from SAR and optical data. The results show that the southeastern part of the volcano expanded significantly after the eruption, and the western part experienced collapse and recovery. The volcano morphology change experienced a slow-fast-slow process in the two years.

TI  - Columnar Water Vapor Retrieval by Using Data from the Polarized Scanning Atmospheric Corrector (PSAC) Onboard HJ-2 A/B Satellites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As the latest members of Chinese Environmental Protection and Disaster Monitoring Satellite Constellation, the first two of HuanjingJianzai-2 (HJ-2) series satellites were launched on 27 September 2020 by China and are usually abbreviated as HJ-2 A/B satellites. The polarized scanning atmospheric corrector (PSAC) is one of main sensors onboard HJ-2 A/B satellites, which is mainly used to monitor atmospheric components such as water vapor and aerosols. In this study, a columnar water vapor (CWV) retrieval algorithm using two bands (865 and 910 nm) is developed for PSAC. The validation results of PSAC CWV data based on ground-based CWV data derived from Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) show that PSAC CWV data has a high accuracy, and all statistical parameters of PSAC CWV data are better than those of Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) CWV data released by NASA. Overall, there is no obvious overestimation or underestimation in PSAC CWV data. The root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), relative error (RE), and percentage of CWV data with error within +/-(0.05 + 0.10 * CWVAERONET) (PER10) of PSAC CWV data are 0.17 cm, 0.13 cm, 0.08, and 78.19%, respectively. The RMSE, MAE, RE, and PER10 of MODIS CWV data are 0.59 cm, 0.48 cm, 0.28, and 16.55%, respectively. Compared with MODIS CWV data, PSAC CWV data shows a 71% decrease in RMSE, a 73% decrease in MAE, a 71% decrease in RE, and a 372% increase in PER10. In addition, the results of day-to-day comparisons between PSAC CWV data and AERONET data show that PSAC CWV data can effectively characterize the change trend of CWV.

TI  - Long-Term Monitoring of Vegetation Dynamics in the Rhodopi Mountain Range National Park-Greece
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - While deforestation is a major environmental issue in the tropics, with thousands of hectares converted to agricultural land every year, in Europe the opposite trend is observed, with land abandonment in mountainous and semi-mountainous areas allowing the afforestation of former agricultural and pastoral land. This trend allows semi-natural ecosystems to recover after a prolonged period of exploitation and often over-exploitation, but it may also lead to significant loss of landscape heterogeneity with potentially detrimental effects on biodiversity. The current study aims to monitor changes in the vegetation coverage across a period of 35 years (between 1984 and 2019) in the Rhodopi Mountains range National Park in northern Greece. A time series of LANDSAT TM (16 images), LANDSAT ETM + (1 image) and LANDSAT 8 OLI/TIRS (4 images) were employed. One data transformation method was applied (TCT), and five vegetation indices (NDVI, NDWI, SAVI, EVI2 and BSI) were calculated to capture the land cover transition during the study period. The obtained results and all used indices suggest that over the study period there was a continuous trend of vegetation cover increasing, with open areas decreasing. The observed trend was further confirmed using Object Oriented Image Analysis on two pairs of images sensed in 1984 and 2019, respectively. The results suggest that almost 22.000 ha of open habitats have been lost to broadleaved and conifer woodlands, while the former also appear to be advancing into conifer-covered areas. This trend has led to significant loss of landscape heterogeneity and to a broadleaf-dominated landscape. The results are discussed in relation to their driving forces, the potential implications on biodiversity and the risk of wildfires in the near future.

TI  - Reducing the Residual Topography Phase for the Robust Landscape Deformation Monitoring of Architectural Heritage Sites in Mountain Areas: The Pseudo-Combination SBAS Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring deformation of architectural heritage sites is important for the quantitative evaluation of their stability. However, deformation monitoring of sites in mountainous areas remains challenging whether utilizing global navigation satellite system (GNSS) or interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) techniques. In this study, we improved the small baseline subset (SBAS) approach by introducing the pseudo-baseline combination strategy to avoid the errors caused by inaccurate external DEM, resulting in robust deformation estimations in mountainous areas where the architectural heritage site of the Great Wall is located. First, a simulated dataset and a real dataset were used to verify the reliability and effectiveness of the algorithm, respectively. Subsequently, the algorithm was applied in the landscape deformation monitoring of the Shanhaiguan section of the Great Wall using 51 Sentinel-1 scenes acquired from 2016 to 2018. A thematic stability map of the Shanhaiguan Great Wall corridor was generated, revealing that the landscape was generally stable save for local instabilities due to to unstable rocks and wall monuments. This study demonstrated the capabilities of adaptive multitemporal InSAR (MTInSAR) approaches in the preventive landscape deformation monitoring of large-scale architectural heritage sites in complex terrain.

TI  - Global patterns and ecological implications of diurnal hysteretic response of ecosystem water consumption to vapor pressure deficit
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing vapor pressure deficit (VPD) has led to widespread reductions in vegetation carbon uptake by stomatal hydraulic regulation. The response of vegetation to VPD is therefore paramount in the global water and carbon cycle, and draws worldwide attention. However, the hysteretic response of ecosystem water consumption to VPD, although widely reported across the world, is still lack of systematic and consistent research on its global patterns and ecological implications. Based on a newly developed hourly dataset of land-atmosphere fluxes, this study finds that hysteresis increases with climatic aridity and long hysteresis mainly occurs in water-limited areas; the hysteretic response of water consumption to VPD for woody ecosystems is shorter than that for the herbaceous ecosystems; interestingly, gross primary productivity (GPP) increases with hysteresis at the high hysteresis ends in dry environments (dry-humid, semi-arid and arid zones), which might suggest an existence of drought-adapting mechanisms of vegetation growth that is relevant to hysteresis but overlooked before. This study provides important information for projecting future shifts of ecosystem functions under increasing atmospheric dry stress.

TI  - Monitoring the Severity of <i>Pantana phyllostachysae</i> Chao Infestation in Moso Bamboo Forests Based on UAV Multi-Spectral Remote Sensing Feature Selection
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the rapid development of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing technology has provided a new means to efficiently monitor forest resources and effectively prevent and control pests and diseases. This study aims to develop a detection model to study the damage caused to Moso bamboo forests by Pantana phyllostachysae Chao (PPC), a major leaf-eating pest, at 5 cm resolution. Damage sensitive features were extracted from multispectral images acquired by UAVs and used to train detection models based on support vector machines (SVM), random forests (RF), and extreme gradient boosting tree (XGBoost) machine learning algorithms. The overall detection accuracy (OA) and Kappa coefficient of SVM, RF, and XGBoost were 81.95%, 0.733, 85.71%, 0.805, and 86.47%, 0.811, respectively. Meanwhile, the detection accuracies of SVM, RF, and XGBoost were 78.26%, 76.19%, and 80.95% for healthy, 75.00%, 83.87%, and 79.17% for mild damage, 83.33%, 86.49%, and 85.00% for moderate damage, and 82.5%, 90.91%, and 93.75% for severe damage Moso bamboo, respectively. Overall, XGBoost exhibited the best detection performance, followed by RF and SVM. Thus, the study findings provide a technical reference for the regional monitoring and control of PPC in Moso bamboo.

TI  - Daily monitoring of marine mucilage using the MODIS products: a case study of 2021 mucilage bloom in the Sea of Marmara, Turkey
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and global warming along with human activities have caused abrupt changes in the atmosphere, marine, and terrestrial ecosystems. One of these changes is the rising number of mucilage events in marine ecosystems. During the recent two decades, mucilage blooms have begun to appear more frequently in the Sea of Marmara in Turkey, surrounded by seven densely populated cities with various anthropogenic activities including household pollution, heavy industrialization, agricultural pollution, commercial fishing, shipyards, and specialized marine terminals with high maritime traffic density. In Spring 2021, a massive mucilage event observed in the Sea of Marmara plagued the entire ecosystem and raised awareness among the government and the public to detect and monitor this phenomenon. In this research, daily monitoring and detection of mucilage formations from the coarse spatial resolution MODIS products were investigated during the 2021 bloom period. The results were validated with the reference mucilage datasets derived from Sentinel-2A imagery and in situ spectroradiometer measurements over mucilage formations. The results revealed that the MODIS surface reflectance profiles were highly correlated with the field spectral measurements and estimated mucilage formations were spatially overlapped with Sentinel-2A. Overall, the produced maps accurately depicted the mucilage-covered areas despite the limitations of unreliable estimates along the land-water transition lines, and no-data areas due to the low-quality observations and high cloud coverage.

T2  - Retinal cases & brief reports
M3  - Case Reports
AB  - PURPOSE: BAP1 germline mutation can promote risk of uveal melanoma and mesothelioma. In this study, we report a patient with BAP1 germline mutation and uveal melanoma who developed a rare form of mesothelioma in the peritoneum.METHOD: Case report.RESULTS: A 55-year-old white man noted blurred vision in the left eye. Examination revealed superotemporal episcleral sentinel vessels and a dark brown iris mass suspicious for melanoma, with angle invasion and involvement of the ciliochoroidal region. The tumor measured 14 mm in diameter and 10.3 mm in thickness. A diagnosis of iridociliochoroidal melanoma was rendered and plaque radiotherapy applied. Genetic testing revealed BAP1 germline mutation. At 3.5-year follow-up, tumor control was achieved, but radiation-related complications led to enucleation. At 5.5-year follow-up, incidental findings by laparoscopy revealed multiple peritoneal tumors, histopathologically proven to be malignant peritoneal mesothelioma. Lung evaluation was normal, and there was no melanoma-related or mesothelioma-related metastasis. Likewise, magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen showed no evidence of hepatic metastasis.CONCLUSION: BAP1 tumor predisposition syndrome can promote risk of uveal melanoma and malignant peritoneal mesothelioma. Cancer screening for these malignancies is warranted.

TI  - Improved U-Net Remote Sensing Classification Algorithm Based on Multi-Feature Fusion Perception
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The selection and representation of remote sensing image classification features play crucial roles in image classification accuracy. To effectively improve the classification accuracy of features, an improved U-Net network framework based on multi-feature fusion perception is proposed in this paper. This framework adds the channel attention module (CAM-UNet) to the original U-Net framework and cascades the shallow features with the deep semantic features, replaces the classification layer in the original U-Net network with a support vector machine, and finally uses the majority voting game theory algorithm to fuse the multifeature classification results and obtain the final classification results. This study used the forest distribution in Xingbin District, Laibin City, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region as the research object, which is based on Landsat 8 multispectral remote sensing images, and, by combining spectral features, spatial features, and advanced semantic features, overcame the influence of the reduction in spatial resolution that occurs with the deepening of the network on the classification results. The experimental results showed that the improved algorithm can improve classification accuracy. Before the improvement, the overall segmentation accuracy and segmentation accuracy of the forestland increased from 90.50% to 92.82% and from 95.66% to 97.16%, respectively. The forest cover results obtained by the algorithm proposed in this paper can be used as input data for regional ecological models, which is conducive to the development of accurate and real-time vegetation growth change models.

TI  - Characterizing Garden Greenspace in a Medieval European City: Added Values of Spatial Resolution and Multi-Temporal Stereo Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Domestic gardens provide residents with immediate access to landscape amenities and numerous ecological provisions. These ecological provisions have been proven to be largely determined by greenspace composition and landscape, but the fragmentation and heterogeneity of garden environments present challenges to greenspace mapping. Here, we first developed a recognition method to create a garden parcel data set in the medieval Leuven city of Belgium, based on the land use layers and agricultural land parcels. Then, we applied multi-sourced satellite imagery to evaluate the added value of spatial resolution, plant phenology and 3D structure in identifying four vegetation types. Finally, we characterized the greenspace landscapes in garden parcels. Compared with single ALOS-2 imagery, SPOT-7 imagery and Pleiades-1A imagery increased the overall accuracy by 4% and 8%, respectively. The accuracy improvement (21%) produced from multi-temporal stereo Pleiades-1A imagery strongly verified the significance of plant phenology and 3D structure in garden mapping. The average greenspace cover in garden parcels was 71% but varied from 56% in urban gardens to 82% in rural gardens. The garden greenspace landscape is fragmented by the artificial structures in urban areas but has a more aggregated size and less complex shapes in rural areas. This study calls for greater attention to be paid to gardens, and for multi-disciplinary studies conducted in collaboration with urban ecologists and landscape designers to maximize the benefits to residents of both immediate landscape amenities and ecological provisions, in the face of global environmental changes and public health risks.

TI  - Inter-Comparison of Four Models for Detecting Forest Fire Disturbance from MOD13A2 Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Many models for change point detection from time series remote sensing images have been developed to date. For forest ecosystems, fire disturbance detection models have always been an important topic. However, due to a lack of benchmark datasets, it is difficult to determine which model is appropriate. Therefore, we collected and generated a benchmark dataset specifically for forest fire disturbance detection, named CUG-FFireMCD1. The CUG-FFireMCD1 contains a total of 132 pieces of MODIS MOD13A2 time series, and each time series contains at least one fire disturbance. The occurrence time for a forest fire disturbance was determined using the National Cryosphere DesertDataCenter(NCDC) website, and the precise latitude and longitude coordinates were determined using the FireCCI51 dataset. In addition, we selected four commonly used time series change detection models and validate the advantages and limitations of the four models through dataset analysis. Finally, we use the detection results of the models and their applicable scenarios to label the additional change points. The four models we used are breaks for additive season and trend (BFAST), Prophet, continuous change detection and classification (CCDC), and Landsat-based detection of trends in disturbance and recovery (LandTrendR). The experiments show that the BFAST outperformed the other three models in forest fire disturbance detection from MOD13A2 time series, with the successful-detection-proportion rate of 96.2% with the benchmark dataset. The detection effect of the Prophet model is not as good as that of BFAST, but it also performs well, with the successful-detection-proportion rate of 87.9%. The detection results of CCDC and LandTrendR are similar, and the detection success rate is lower than that of BFAST and Prophet, but their detection results can be used as data support for labeling work. However, to apply them perfectly to MOD13A2 time series change detection, it is best to do some model adaptation. In summary, the CUG-FFireMCD1 data were verified using different types of time series change detection models, and the change points we marked are credible. The CUG-FFireMCD1 will surely provide a reliable benchmark for model optimization and the accuracy verification of remote sensing time series change detection.

TI  - Glacier Mass Balance in the Manas River Using Ascending and Descending Pass of Sentinel 1A/1B Data and SRTM DEM
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mountain glaciers monitoring is important for water resource management and climate changes but is limited by the lack of a high-quality Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and field measurements. Sentinel 1A/1B satellites provide alternative data for glacier mass balance. In this study, we tried to generate DEMs from C-band Sentinel 1A/1B ascending and descending pass SLC images and evaluate the overall accuracy of INSAR DEMs based on Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM and ICESat/GLAS. The low Standard Deviation (STD)and Root Means Square Error (RMSE) displayed the feasibility of Sentinel 1A/1B satellites for DEM generation. Glacier elevation changes and glacier mass balance were estimated based on INSAR DEM and SRTM DEM. The results showed that the most glaciers have exhibited obvious thinning, and the mean annual glacier mass balance between 2000 and 2020 was -0.18 +/- 0.1 m w.e.a(-1). The south-facing and-east facing aspects, slope and elevation play an important role on glacier melt. This study demonstrates that ascending and descending orbit data of Sentinel-1A/1B satellites are promising for the detailed retrieval of surface elevation changes and mass balance in mountain glaciers.

Forty- year-old woman with left breast cancer underwent breast-conserving surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy. The diagnosis was papillotubular carcinoma, pT1pN0, ER(+), PgR(+), HER2(-). Tweleb years later, the examination of diplopia revealed left abducens nerve palsy for sphenoid bone metastasis from breast cancer. Radiation therapy(a total dose of 36 Gy with VMAT)was administrated as topical treatment, but diplopia did not improve. After that, systemic treatment was performed, and 2 years and 6 months have passed since the recurrence was found, she is still alive. We need to be careful of orbital metastasis as a symptom of metastasis from breast cancer.

TI  - Enhanced Chlorophyll-a in the Coastal Waters near the Eastern Guangdong during the Downwelling Favorable Wind Period
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Phytoplankton dynamics, which are highly sensitive to the ecosystem condition and change, are different in coastal waters and open ocean. Previous researches mainly focused on the open ocean dynamic in the South China Sea (SCS), but few research on the Eastern Guangdong (EGD), especially during a period of downwelling-favorable winds. In fact, the influence of topographic irregularities, downwelling, continental outflows, and cold, nutrient-rich currents from Fujian-Zhejiang coastal waters (ZFC) of the East China Sea (ECS) on the spatial distribution of Chlorophyll a (Chl a) in EGD coastal waters could be significant. This study utilized ocean color time series and meteorological and hydrographic data jointly from July 2002 to June 2020 to investigate the heterogeneous regional specific distribution pattern of Chl a in EGD and the environmental determinants in different regions subdivided by water depth. Then the temporal and spatial distribution pattern of Chl a in EGD in winter were discussed in detail by applying an Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis, GaoFeng-1 (GF-1) satellite data and in situ measured dataset. The sea surface temperature (SST) in February was negatively related with Chl a in shallow coastal waters less than 60 m deep due to the nutrient-rich, cold waters from ZFC. The monthly mean photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and precipitation showed significant effects on the phytoplankton growth over regions with a depth less than 10 m. An area with higher Chl a concentration in the downwelling zone were detected in winter. By an examining the temporal variability in meridional distribution of the mean Chl a at 22.41 degrees N and 22.21 degrees N, a symmetrical peak was observed. The coastal fronts extended southwestward from the southeastern coast of Guangdong Province to Dangan Island in the SCS. In addition, a cross-shelf filament was detected near the coast of Shanwei, Guangdong, China on 8 January 2020.

TI  - Simulation of critical transitions and vulnerability assessment of Tibetan Plateau key ecosystems
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Critical transitions in ecosystems may imply risks of unexpected collapse under climate changes, especially vegetation often responds sensitively to climate change. The type of vegetation ecosystem states could present alternative stable states, and its type could signal the critical transitions at tipping points because of changed climate or other drivers. This study analyzed the distribution of four key vegetation ecosystem types: desert, grassland, forest-steppe ecotone and forest, in Tibetan Plateau in China, using the latent class analysis method based on remote sensing data and climate data. This study analyzed the impacts of three key climate factors, precipitation, temperature, and sunshine duration, on the vegetation states, and calculated the critical transition tipping point of potential changes in vegetation type in Tibetan Plateau with the logistic regression model. The studied results showed that climatic factors greatly affect the vegetation states and vulnerability of the Tibetan Plateau. In comparison with temperature and sunshine duration, precipitation shows more obvious impact on differentiations of the vegetations status probability. The precipitation tipping point for desert and grassland transition is averagely 48.0 mm/month, 70.7 mm/month for grassland and forest-steppe ecotone, and 115.0 mm/month for forest-steppe ecotone and forest. Both temperature and sunshine duration only show different probability change between vegetation and non-vegetation type, but produce opposite impacts. In Tibetan Plateau, the transition tipping points of vegetation and non-vegetation are about 12.1 degrees C/month and 173.6 h/month for the temperature and sunshine duration, respectively. Further, vulnerability maps calculated with the logistic regression results presented the distribution of vulnerability of Tibetan Plateau key ecosystems. The vulnerability of the typical ecosystems in the Tibetan Plateau is low in the southeast and is high in the northwest. The meteorological factors affect tree cover as well as the transition probability that occurs in different vegetation states. This study can provide reference for local government agencies to formulate regional development strategies and environmental protection laws and regulations.

TI  - Water Quality Chl-a Inversion Based on Spatio-Temporal Fusion and Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The combination of remote sensing technology and traditional field sampling provides a convenient way to monitor inland water. However, limited by the resolution of remote sensing images and cloud contamination, the current water quality inversion products do not provide both high temporal resolution and high spatial resolution. By using the spatio-temporal fusion (STF) method, high spatial resolution and temporal fusion images were generated with Landsat, Sentinel-2, and GaoFen-2 data. Then, a Chl-a inversion model was designed based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) with the structure of 4-(136-236-340)-1-1. Finally, the results of the Chl-a concentrations were corrected using a pixel correction algorithm. The images generated from STF can maintain the spectral characteristics of the low-resolution images with the R-2 between 0.7 and 0.9. The Chl-a inversion results based on the spatio-temporal fused images and CNN were verified with measured data (R-2 = 0.803), and then the results were improved (R-2 = 0.879) after further combining them with the pixel correction algorithm. The correlation R-2 between the Chl-a results of GF2-like and Sentinel-2 were both greater than 0.8. The differences in the spatial distribution of Chl-a concentrations in the BYD lake gradually increased from July to August. Remote sensing water quality inversion based on STF and CNN can effectively achieve high frequency in time and fine resolution in space, which provide a stronger scientific basis for rapid diagnosis of eutrophication in inland lakes.

TI  - Dominant Factors and Spatial Heterogeneity of Land Surface Temperatures in Urban Areas: A Case Study in Fuzhou, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon caused by rapid urbanization has become an important global ecological and environmental problem that cannot be ignored. In this study, the UHI effect was quantified using Landsat 8 image inversion land surface temperatures (LSTs). With the spatial scale of street units in Fuzhou City, China, using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, geographically weighted regression (GWR) models, and multi-scale geographically weighted regression (MGWR), we explored the spatial heterogeneities of the influencing factors and LST. The results indicated that, compared with traditional OLS models, GWR improved the model fit by considering spatial heterogeneity, whereas MGWR outperformed OLS and GWR in terms of goodness of fit by considering the effects of different bandwidths on LST. Building density (BD), normalized difference impervious surface index (NDISI), and the sky view factor (SVF) were important influences on elevated LST, while building height (BH), forest land percentage (Forest_per), and waterbody percentage (Water_per) were negatively correlated with LST. In addition, built-up percentage (Built_per) and population density (Pop_Den) showed significant spatial non-stationary characteristics. These findings suggest the need to consider spatial heterogeneity in analyses of impact factors. This study can be used to provide guidance on mitigation strategies for UHIs in different regions.

M3  - Article
AB  - To characterize the spatiotemporal variations of glacier surface speed on the Kenai Peninsula, Alaska (similar to 3,900 km(2)), we derived 92 surface speed fields between October 2014 and December 2019 using intensity offset tracking on Sentinel-1 data. On average, speeds are 50% greater in spring (March-May) than the annual mean (69 m a(-1)) while winter speeds are close to the annual mean. While marine-terminating glaciers have their maximum speed near the terminus, both land- and lake-terminating glaciers flow fastest around the median glacier elevation. On average, the lake-terminating and tidewater glaciers flow 1.7 and 2.3 times faster than the land-terminating glaciers, respectively. Monthly variations over the 5-year period are strikingly synchronous regardless of terminus type suggesting that regional-scale meteorological drivers govern the temporal variability. Mean annual speeds fluctuate roughly +/- 10% of the period mean without an apparent trend. At lake-terminating Bear Glacier, a short-term tripling in ice speed in fall 2019 over the area below an ice-dammed lake coincides with an observed glacier lake outburst flood (GLOF). An earlier GLOF caused a persistent breach of the beach barrier between the proglacial lake and ocean which likely led to overall speed-up of the lower glacier part throughout 2019. A significant speedup was also observed at the lower part of the lake-terminating Ellsworth Glacier and attributed to rapid glacier retreat and lake expansion, probably further amplified by the terminus area becoming buoyant and a large tabular iceberg breaking off. Our results highlight the impact of GLOFs and proglacial characteristics in spatial and temporal glacier speed variations.

TI  - Extracting Disaster-Related Location Information through Social Media to Assist Remote Sensing for Disaster Analysis: The Case of the Flood Disaster in the Yangtze River Basin in China in 2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Social media texts spontaneously produced and uploaded by the public contain a wealth of disaster information. As a supplementary data source for remote sensing, they have played an important role in disaster reduction and emergency response in recent years. However, social media also has certain flaws, such as insufficient location information, etc. This affects the efficiency of combining these data with remote sensing data. For flood disasters in particular, extensively flooded areas limit the distribution of social media data, which makes it difficult for these data to function as they should. In this paper, we propose a disaster reduction framework to solve these problems. We first used an approach that was based on search engine and lexical rules to automatically extract disaster-related location information from social media texts. Then, we combined the extracted information with the upload location of social media itself to construct location-pointing relationships. These relationships were used to build a new social network, which can be used in combination with remote sensing images for disaster analysis. The analysis integrated the advantages of social media and remote sensing. It can not only provide macro disaster information in the study area but can also assist in evaluating the disaster situation in different flooded areas from the perspective of public observation. In addition, the timeliness of social media data also improved the continuity and situational awareness of flood monitoring. A case study of the flood disaster in the Yangtze River Basin in China in 2020 was used to verify the effectiveness of the method described in this paper.

TI  - Inversion of Rice Leaf Chlorophyll Content Based on Sentinel-2 Satellite Data
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll content is an important indicator of crop health, plant productivity, and environmental stress. Real-time, fast and accurate acquisition of leaf chlorophyll content of crops is of significant for monitoring crop growth. Remote sensing is an effective way to retrieve leaf chlorophyll content of crops at regional and global scales. However, previous studies retrieving leaf chlorophyll content of crops does not fully consider the impact of underlying surface background, limiting retrieval accuracy. To this end, this paper aims at the inversion of rice leaf chlorophyll content from Sentinel-2 remote sensing satellite data using a look-up table based approach. The look-up table was simulated using the PRAOSAIL radiation transfer model. The applicability of chlorophyll indices (CI) calculated from the reflectance of the green band and different red-edge bands and the spectral index (Zarco and Miller, ZM) constructed by two different red edge bands in inverting leaf chlorophyll content was evaluated using field measurements. The greenness index (G) was integrated with CI and ZM to constrain the impact of background on the inversion of leaf chlorophyll content. The main findings of this study are: (1) The accuracy of leaf element content inversion based on the spectral index constructed in different bands is different, and CI740 performed the best (R-2 = 0. 79, RMSE= 9. 02 mu g.cm(-2)), followed by ZM (R-2 =0. 71, RMSE=10. 53 mu g.cm(-2)) , CI705 (R-2 =0. 69, RMSE=9. 17 mu g.cm(-2)), and CI783 (R-2 =0. 67, RMSE= 10. 84 mu g.cm(-2)); (2) The inverted leaf chlorophyll content is significantly affected by the background, especially at the early stage of rice growth. The inverted leaf chlorophyll content was systematically lower than observations (mean relative error (MRE) in the range from 18. 87% to 31. 94%) owing to strong background interference; (3) CI/G and ZM/G can effectively eliminate the influence of background and improve the accuracy of rice leaf chlorophyll inversion. At the early stage of rice growth, inversion based on CI/G and ZM/G significantly improves agreement between inverted and observed leaf chlorophyll content (MRE in the range from 8. 11% to 18.11%). These findings are of great significance for improving the inversion of leaf chlorophyll content under different leaf area index levels of rice from remote sensing data.

TI  - A Block Shuffle Network with Superpixel Optimization for Landsat Image Semantic Segmentation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, with the development of deep learning in remotely sensed big data, semantic segmentation has been widely used in large-scale landcover classification. Landsat imagery has the advantages of wide coverage, easy acquisition, and good quality. However, there are two significant challenges for the semantic segmentation of mid-resolution remote sensing images: the insufficient feature extraction capability of deep convolutional neural network (DCNN); low edge contour accuracy. In this paper, we propose a block shuffle module to enhance the feature extraction capability of DCNN, a differentiable superpixel branch to optimize the feature of small objects and the accuracy of edge contours, and a self-boosting method to fuse semantic information and edge contour information to further optimize the fine-grained edge contour. We label three sets of Landsat landcover classification datasets, and achieved an overall accuracy of 86.3%, 83.2%, and 73.4% on the three datasets, respectively. Compared with other mainstream semantic segmentation networks, our proposed block shuffle network achieves state-of-the-art performance, and has good generalization ability.

T2  - RUSIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The article studies the original psychologism in the interpretation of the land image in Ukrainian folk dumas and short stories by Vasyl Stefanyk, who was a representatives of the "Pokutia triad" (Vasyl Stefanyk, Les Martovych, Marko Cheremshyna). Using the comparative method, the semantic-cognitive and the concept-analysis, the authors determine the national peculiarities of worldview of the heroes, the role of the author's principle, the transformation of linguistic signs of nationally marked lexes, expressing the worldview of ethnocultural groups of Galicia, Pokuttya and Steppe Ukraine in their dialectical unity. The article emphasizes that the symbolism of the land in Ukrainian folk dumas and short stories by Stefanyk is expressed in the paradigm of the concepts "land - breadwinner", "land - family", "land - will", "land - glory", "land - life". It is noted that for the Galician peasants the land was of the greatest value and holiness, which is most often expressed in the image of "land - breadwinner", while for the heroes of Ukrainian folk dumas, the land is a symbol of freedom. The focus on the originality of the poetic means, which reveal the national characteristics of the heroes. Such a comparative research has been conducted for the first time to be further expanded in future in the folklore and literary studies.

TI  - A Neural Network Based Single Footprint Temperature Retrieval for Atmospheric Infrared Sounder Measurements and Its Application to Study on Stratospheric Gravity Wave
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite hyperspectral infrared sounder measurements have better horizontal resolution than other sounding techniques as it boasts the stratospheric gravity wave (GW) analysis. To accurately and efficiently derive the three-dimensional structure of the stratospheric GWs from the single-field-of-view (SFOV) Atmospheric InfraRed Sounder (AIRS) observations, this paper firstly focuses on the retrieval of the atmospheric temperature profiles in the altitude range of 20-60 km with an artificial neural network approach (ANN). The simulation experiments show that the retrieval bias is less than 0.5 K, and the root mean square error (RMSE) ranges from 1.8 to 4 K. Moreover, the retrieval results from 20 granules of the AIRS observations with the trained neural network (AIRS_SFOV) and the corresponding operational AIRS products (AIRS_L2) as well as the dual-regression results from the Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies (CIMSS) (AIRS_DR) are compared respectively with ECMWF T799 data. The comparison indicates that the standard deviation of the ANN retrieval errors is significantly less than that of the AIRS_DR. Furthermore, the analysis of the typical GW events induced by the mountain Andes and the typhoon "Soulik" using different data indicates that the AIRS_SFOV results capture more details of the stratospheric gravity waves in the perturbation amplitude and pattern than the operational AIRS products do.

TI  - Remote Sensing Approaches for Meteorological Disaster Monitoring: Recent Achievements and New Challenges
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Meteorological disaster monitoring is an important research direction in remote sensing technology in the field of meteorology, which can serve many meteorological disaster management tasks. The key issues in the remote sensing monitoring of meteorological disasters are monitoring task arrangement and organization, meteorological disaster information extraction, and multi-temporal disaster information change detection. To accurately represent the monitoring tasks, it is necessary to determine the timescale, perform sensor planning, and construct a representation model to monitor information. On this basis, the meteorological disaster information is extracted by remote sensing data-processing approaches. Furthermore, the multi-temporal meteorological disaster information is compared to detect the evolution of meteorological disasters. Due to the highly dynamic nature of meteorological disasters, the process characteristics of meteorological disasters monitoring have attracted more attention. Although many remote sensing approaches were successfully used for meteorological disaster monitoring, there are still gaps in process monitoring. In future, research on sensor planning, information representation models, multi-source data fusion, etc., will provide an important basis and direction to promote meteorological disaster process monitoring. The process monitoring strategy will further promote the discovery of correlations and impact mechanisms in the evolution of meteorological disasters.

TI  - Axillary Lymph Node Swelling Mimicking Breast Cancer Metastasis After COVID-19 Vaccination: A Japanese Case Report and Literature Review
T2  - IN VIVO
M3  - Review
AB  - Background/Aim: COVID-19 started to spread as a pandemic in December 2019 and COVID-19 vaccination has been initiated worldwide. The efficacy of vaccination has been scientifically proven, but it might cause axillary lymph node swelling. To diagnose patients with axillary lymph node swelling caused by COVID-19 vaccination, we herein reviewed existing literature on this symptom. Case Report: We report the case of a 70-year-old woman with a breast tumour. She had undergone cecum cancer surgery and regular computed tomography (CT). During breast tumour follow-up, she received scheduled CT that indicated severe axillary lymph node swelling mimicking breast cancer metastasis. We performed aspiration biopsy cytology of that lymph node, and determined this was not cancer metastasis but an effect of the COVID-19 vaccine. We confirmed this diagnosis at one month after computed tomography showed that the lymph node swelling had improved. Conclusion: Axillary lymph node swelling can occur after COVID-19 vaccination. Therefore, it is important to consider the effect of the COVID-19 vaccination on axillary lymph node swelling when diagnosing breast tumours.

AB  - The study was carried out to establish soil map. Land evaluation was made according to MicroLEIS models. The study area is Naghamish valley, North Western coast of Egypt. The study indicated that the study area could be distinguished into seven landforms. Twenty-two soil profiles, spatially distributed upon Sentinel-2A satellite image classification to represent the landforms of wadi Naghamish's basin. They were morphologically described, their chemical and physical properties were determined, and their diagnostic characteristics were pointed. Results point out, in terms of topography, profile depth and soil texture, ten soil units could be identified. The study area could be distinguished into five sub great soil groups. Cervatana model reveals that 6425% of soils are considered non-productive, 22.64% is moderately capable, whereas only 0.54% and 2.64% of the total area range from excellent to good capable land for agricultural production, respectively. The rest of the area occupying 9.94% is associated with urban settlement and escarpment landform units. At subclass level, there are S3l and S3r, referring to moderate capability with slight constraint severity and S3lr specifying those affected by severe soil constraints and erosion risk Regarding soil suitability for some selected crops, the results of Almagra model indicated that the soils formed on the coastal plain vary from suitable to marginally suitable, in contradiction of soils formed on the wadi course, piedmont plain and tableland of plateau vary from marginally suitable to unsuitable in general for most tested crop as affected by limiting factors related to very shallow to shallow depth, high lime content, light soil texture and very poor to poor drainage.

TI  - Temporal Monitoring and Predicting of the Abundance of Malaria Vectors Using Time Series Analysis of Remote Sensing Data through Google Earth Engine
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In many studies regarding the field of malaria, environmental factors have been acquired in single-time, multi-time or a short-time series using remote sensing and meteorological data. Selecting the best periods of the year to monitor the habitats of Anopheles larvae can be effective in better and faster control of malaria outbreaks. In this article, high-risk times for three regions in Iran, including Qaleh-Ganj, Sarbaz and Bashagard counties with a history of malaria prevalence were estimated. For this purpose, a series of environmental factors affecting the growth and survival of Anopheles were used over a seven-year period through the Google Earth Engine. The results of this study indicated two high-risk times for Qaleh-Ganj and Bashagard counties and three high-risk times for Sarbaz county over the course of a year observing an increase in the abundance of Anopheles mosquitoes. Further evaluation of the results against the entomological data available in previous studies showed that the high-risk times predicted in this study were consistent with an increase in the abundance of Anopheles mosquitoes in the study areas. The proposed method is extremely useful for temporal prediction of the increase in abundance of Anopheles mosquitoes in addition to the use of optimal data aimed at monitoring the exact location of Anopheles habitats.

TI  - Effects of Urban Vibrancy on an Urban Eco-Environment: Case Study on Wuhan City
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of rapid urbanisation and an emerging need for a healthy urban environment, revitalising urban spaces and its effects on the urban eco-environment in Chinese cities have attracted widespread attention. This study assessed urban vibrancy from the dimensions of density, accessibility, liveability, diversity, and human activity, with various indicators using an adjusted spatial TOPSIS (technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution) method. The study also explored the effects of urban vibrancy on the urban eco-environment by interpreting PM 2.5 and land surface temperature using "big" and "dynamic" data, such as those from mobile and social network data. Thereafter, spatial modelling was performed to investigate the influence of urban vibrancy on air pollution and temperature with inverted and extracted remote sensing data. This process identified spatial heterogeneity and spatial autocorrelation. The majority of the dimensions, such as density, accessibility, liveability, and diversity, are negatively correlated with PM 2.5, thereby indicating that the advancement of urban vibrancy in these dimensions potentially improves air quality. Conversely, improved accessibility increases the surface temperature in most of the districts, and large-scale infrastructure construction generally contributes to the increase. Diversity and human activity appear to have a cooling effect. In the future, applying spatial heterogeneity is advised to assess urban vibrancy and its effect on the urban eco-environment, to provide valuable references for spatial urban planning, improve public health and human wellbeing, and ensure sustainable urban development.

TI  - Deep Ensemble Machine Learning Framework for the Estimation of PM<sub>2.5</sub> Concentrations
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate estimation of historical PM2.5 (particle matter with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 mu m) is critical and essential for environmental health risk assessment.OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to develop a multiple-level stacked ensemble machine learning framework for improving the estimation of the daily ground-level PM2.5 concentrations.METHODS: An innovative deep ensemble machine learning framework (DEML) was developed to estimate the daily PM2.5 concentrations. The framework has a three-stage structure: At the first stage, four base models [gradient boosting machine (GBM), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)] were used to generate a new data set of PM2.5 concentrations for training the next-stage learners. At the second stage, three meta-models [RF, XGBoost, and Generalized Linear Model (GLM)] were used to estimate PM2.5 concentrations using a combination of the original data set and the predictions from the first-stage models. At the third stage, a nonnegative least squares (NNLS) algorithm was employed to obtain the optimal weights for PM2.5 estimation. We took the data from 133 monitoring stations in Italy as an example to implement the DEML to predict daily PM(2)(.5 )at each 1 km x 1 km grid cell from 2015 to 2019 across Italy. We evaluated the model performance by performing 10-fold cross-validation (CV) and compared it with five benchmark algorithms [GBM, SVM, RF, XGBoost, and Super Learner (SL)].RESULTS: The results revealed that the PM2.5 prediction performance of DEML [coefficients of determination (R-2) = 0.87 and root mean square error (RMSE) =5.38 mu g/m(3)] was superior to any benchmark models (with R-2 of 0.51, 0.76, 0.83, 0.70, and 0.83 for GBM, SVM, RF, XGBoost, and SL approach. respectively). DEML displayed reliable performance in capturing the spatiotemporal variations of PM2.5 in Italy.DISCUSSION: The proposed DEML framework achieved an outstanding performance in PM(2)(.5 )estimation, which could be used as a tool for more accurate environmental exposure assessment.

TI  - Effect of Cloud Droplet Spectrum Distribution on Retrievals of Water Cloud Optical Thickness and Effective Particle Radius by AGRI Onboard FY-4A Satellite
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to quantitatively evaluate the effect of log-normal spectral distribution assumption on retrieval of cloud optical thickness (COT) and effective particle radius (Re), the reflectance of water clouds with log-normal spectrum and modified Gamma spectrum was simulated for the 2nd and 5th channels of the AGRI (Advanced Geosynchronous Radiation Imager) onboard FY-4A satellite by the RTTOV (Radiative Transfer for the TIROSOperational Vertical Sounder) model developed by the European Center for Medium-Range Numerical Weather Forecasts. The variation characteristics of water cloud reflectivity with COT and Re under these spectral distribution assumptions were analyzed. On this basis, the look-up tables of COT and Re under two kinds of spectral distribution conditions are established, and the influence of cloud droplet spectral distribution type on cloud parameter inversion results is quantitatively analyzed based on a primary convective cloud in summer of 2020. The results indicate that for the 2nd channel, reflectance difference under the assumption of two cloud droplet spectra is within 0.1%-2%, whereas for the 5th channel, the reflectance calculated with the modified Gamma cloud droplet spectrum is 10%-20 A lower than that calculated with the log-normal cloud droplet spectrum. The retrival results show that the effective particle radius r(eff) retrieved with the log-normal cloud droplet spectrum is larger than that retrieved with the modified Gamma cloud droplet spectrum. The former is concentrated in 15-35 mu m, while the latter is within 10-30 mu m. The differences of COT retrieved with the two cloud drop spectra are relatively small, ranging from 2% to 5%.

TI  - Identifying Grassland Distribution in a Mountainous Region in Southwest China Using Multi-Source Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Southwest China has abundant grassland resources, but they are mainly scattered across fragmented mountainous terrain with frequently cloudy and rainy weather, making their accurate identification by remote sensing challenging. Therefore, the goal of this study was to generate prefecture-level city-scale mountainous grassland distribution data to support the development of sustainable grassland husbandry. Here, we proposed a sample selection method and comprehensively utilized multi-source data to obtain the quasi-10 m southwest grassland distribution data. The sample selection method was to first determine the sample selection range based on multi-source land use/cover database, and then to randomly select the samples under the constraint of secondary land use types, multiple factors of terrain and pure pixels. This method can deal with the difficulty in identifying the fragmented grassland distribution caused by steep mountains and hills. In addition, a multispectral time series dataset was constructed based on the fusion of Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel-2A/B data due to cloudy and rainy weather and was used as one of the input features along with synthetic aperture radar Sentinel-1 time series data and the terrain multi-factor data. Finally, a remote sensing method to accurately identify grassland distribution in southwest China was constructed based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Taking Zhaotong City, a prefecture-level city in Yunnan Province, as an example, a thematic map of grassland distribution with an overall accuracy of 88.21% was obtained using the above method. This map has been used by the local government of Zhaotong City in their planning of the development of sustainable grassland husbandry.

TI  - Spectral Characteristics of Desertified Black-Earth Pastures
T2  - ARID ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Modern geosystems in desertified areas of the Republic of Kalmykia are exposed to increasingly intense anthropogenic pressure and adverse weather events, including dust storms. Such weather events often reduce the productivity of pastures and forage base; as a result, livestock numbers decrease. Therefore, it becomes increasingly relevant to determine the spectral characteristics of desertified pastures with ground-based methods. Such methods identify the distribution of reflected energy over spectrum bands (which is important in itself for the subsequent verification of remote-sensing data collected for the studied pastures) and also make it possible to obtain normalized index values both for plant communities and for specific plant species and soil types, including the formation of a spatial database. The following test sites were selected to study natural phytocoenoses of desertified black-earth pastures: Smushkovoe, Molodezhnyi, Privol'nyi, Dlinnye Sagi, and Tavn-Gashun. Geobotanical and spectrometric studies were carried out on these test sites, and spatially referenced data on the spectral characteristics of their plant communities were collected. Spectrometric studies of phytocoenoses were conducted to assess their state based on ground-based and remote-sensing spectrozonal surveys. The following predominant communities on the Tavn-Gashun test site were selected to present the results of the spectrometric assessment of the vegetation cover on degraded pastures: (1) bulbous bluegrass with the participation of flixweed (Poa bulbosa +Descurainiasophia) with a projective cover of 45%; (2) bulbous bluegrass-needle grass (Poa bulbosa-Stipa capillata) with a projective cover of 40%; and (3) bare soil (slightly humic sand). The ground studies were performed with a PSR-1100 field spectroradiometer. The collected data on the reflective radiation spectra of the studied plant communities and underlying soils made it possible to identify characteristic features of the reflected and absorbed energy distribution and compile a catalog of their individual spectra and normalized indices. Individual spectral characteristics were determined for the Poa bulbosa+Descurainiasophia phytocoenosis: the average reflected energy over all spectral bands is 20.2 mW/(m(2)center dot sr center dot nm), the standard reflected energy deviation is 9.90, and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is 0.208. For Stipa capillata, the average reflected energy over all spectral bands is 20.5 mW/(m(2) sr nm), and the standard reflected energy deviation is 12.36, and NDVI = 0.316. For Calligonum aphyllum, the average reflected energy over all spectral bands is 47.2 mW/(m(2) sr nm), the standard reflected energy deviation is 9.81, and NDVI = 0.354. For the upper soil layer, the average reflected energy over all spectral bands is 30.3 mW/(m(2) sr nm), and the standard reflected energy deviation is 9.28, and NDVI = 0.106. The highest average NDVI value was registered for Calligonum aphyllum.

TI  - Implementation of Vocational Education Standards in the Context of Postmodern Trends
T2  - POSTMODERN OPENINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - Our research involves the study of vocational education in the context of postmodern trends in society. We analyzed how postmodern manifestations of the 21st century have affected vocational education standards. The main theoretical and methodological approaches to the formation of postmodernism and the process of formation of standards of vocational education were studied. Based on the results of the research, the main approach to the basics and basic trends in the formation of standards of vocational education was established. Education as a process is relevant throughout historical development, because everyone understands his importance in society, realizes his responsibility to him since the early days of man needs new knowledge to continue living. The formation of the process of professional education itself begins several centuries ago, which confirms the maturation of man in social development. The period of postmodernism in the educational process is marked by globalization and the integration of society. This trend requires continuous professional growth. The worker in the conditions of postmodernism must be able to quickly change their skills, adapt to new challenges that may constantly evolve due to the rapid development of information technology. In the course of our research the integration method of synthesis of figurative structure, and the analysis, the characteristic of pedagogical activity at the formation of professional education is used. There are methods of synthesis, analysis, and interpretation of postmodernism in educational development. The results of the research confirm the postmodern trends in the formation of vocational education.

TI  - Combining Crop Modeling with Remote Sensing Data Using a Particle Filtering Technique to Produce Real-Time Forecasts of Winter Wheat Yields under Uncertain Boundary Conditions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Within-season crop yield forecasting at national and regional levels is crucial to ensure food security. Yet, forecasting is a challenge because of incomplete knowledge about the heterogeneity of factors determining crop growth, above all management and cultivars. This motivates us to propose a method for early forecasting of winter wheat yields in low-information systems regarding crop management and cultivars, and uncertain weather condition. The study was performed in two contrasting regions in southwest Germany, Kraichgau and Swabian Jura. We used in-season green leaf area index (LAI) as a proxy for end-of-season grain yield. We applied PILOTE, a simple and computationally inexpensive semi-empirical radiative transfer model to produce yield forecasts and assimilated LAI data measured in-situ and sensed by satellites (Landsat and Sentinel-2). To assimilate the LAI data into the PILOTE model, we used the particle filtering method. Both weather and sowing data were treated as random variables, acknowledging principal sources of uncertainties to yield forecasting. As such, we used the stochastic weather generator MarkSim(R) GCM to produce an ensemble of uncertain meteorological boundary conditions until the end of the season. Sowing dates were assumed normally distributed. To evaluate the performance of the data assimilation scheme, we set up the PILOTE model without data assimilation, treating weather data and sowing dates as random variables (baseline Monte Carlo simulation). Data assimilation increased the accuracy and precision of LAI simulation. Increasing the number of assimilation times decreased the mean absolute error (MAE) of LAI prediction from satellite data by similar to 1 to 0.2 m(2)/m(2). Yield prediction was improved by data assimilation as compared to the baseline Monte Carlo simulation in both regions. Yield prediction by assimilating satellite-derived LAI showed similar statistics as assimilating the LAI data measured in-situ. The error in yield prediction by assimilating satellite-derived LAI was 7% in Kraichgau and 4% in Swabian Jura, whereas the yield prediction error by Monte Carlo simulation was 10 percent in both regions. Overall, we conclude that assimilating even noisy LAI data before anthesis substantially improves forecasting of winter wheat grain yield by reducing prediction errors caused by uncertainties in weather data, incomplete knowledge about management, and model calibration uncertainty.

TI  - Prediction of groundwater level variations based on gravity recovery and climate experiment (GRACE) satellite data and a time-series analysis: a case study in the Lake Urmia basin, Iran
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The proper management and planning of groundwater resources depends on the awareness of the process of spatial and temporal changes of groundwater levels in aquifers. For the Lake Urmia basin in northwestern Iran, average groundwater levels have been obtained from existing GRACE satellite data, including CSR, GFZ and JPL, in conjunction with the Google Earth Engine for the period 2002-2016. The Mann-Kendall test shows a significant decreasing trend in groundwater level for all three GRACE datasets during the study period. Parametric time-series models, including ARIMA, MARS, PROPHET and ETS, were fitted to GRACE data. For all three datasets, the PROPHET model had the highest coefficients of R-2 (0.81-0.85) and the lowest MAE model error coefficients and RMASE The residuals of the PROPHET model are normally distributed, which indicates this model could be reliable for predictive purposes. For all three GRACE datasets, the PROPHET model shows a declining trend of groundwater levels in the Uremia Lake basin during the period 2017-2024.

TI  - Level I axillary dissection in patients with breast cancer and tumor-involved sentinel lymph node after NAC is not sufficient for adequate nodal staging
T2  - TURKISH JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The purpose of the study was to investigate the oncological sufficiency of level I axillary dissection for adequate histological nodal staging (ypN) in patients with breast cancer and tumor-involved sentinel lymph node (SLN) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC).Material and Methods: A prospective multicentre pilot study took place from 01.01.2018 to 30.11.2020 in three mammary centres in the Czech Republic in patients with breast cancer after NAC (NCT03556397). Patients in the cohort with positive histological frozen section of SLN were indicated to separate axillary dissection of levels I and II.Results: Sixty-one patients with breast cancer after NAC were included in the study according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Twelve patients with breast cancer and tumour involved SLN after NAC were further included in the analysis. Two (16.7%) patients had positive non-sentinel lymph nodes in level I only, one (8.3%) patient had positive lymph nodes in level II only, and seven (58.3%) patients had positive lymph nodes in both levels. Level I axillary dissection in a patient with tumour involved SLN after NAC would have resulted in understaging in five (41.7%) patients, mostly ypN1 instead of ypN2.Conclusion: According to our pilot result, level I axillary dissection is not sufficient in terms of adequate histological nodal staging in breast cancer patients after NAC, and level II axillary dissection should not be omitted.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Dynamics and Climate Influence of Forest Fires in Fujian Province, China
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate determines the spatiotemporal distribution pattern of forest fires by affecting vegetation and the extent of drought. Thus, analyzing the dynamic change of the forest fire season and its response to climate change will play an important role in targeted adjustments of forest fire management policies and practices. In this study, we studied the spatiotemporal variations in forest fire occurrence in Fujian Province, China using the Mann-Kendall trend test and correlation analysis to analyze Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data from 2001 to 2016 and meteorological data. The results show that forest fire occurrence rose first and then declined over the years, but the proportion of forest fires during the fire prevention period decreased. The forest fires increased significantly in spring and summer, exceeding the forest fires occurring in the fire prevention period in 2010. The spatial distribution of forest fires decreased from northwest to southeast coastal areas, among which the number of forest fires in the northwest mountainous areas was large in autumn and winter. The fire risk weather index was strongly and positively correlated with forest fire occurrence across various sites in the province. The findings accentuate the need for properly adjusting the fire prevention period and resource allocation, strengthening the monitoring and early warning of high fire risk weather, and publicizing wildfire safety in spring and summer. As the forest fire occurrence frequency is high in the western and northwest mountainous areas, more observation towers and forest fire monitoring facilities should be installed.

TI  - Remote monitoring of total dissolved phosphorus in eutrophic Lake Taihu based on a novel algorithm: Implications for contributing factors and lake management
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of total dissolved phosphorus concentration (C-TDP) and its regulatory factors is essential to improving our understanding of its impact on inland water eutrophication, but few studies have assessed this in eutrophic inland lakes due to a lack of suitable bio-optical algorithms allowing the use of remote sensing data. We developed a novel semi-analytical algorithm for this purpose and tested it in the eutrophic Lake Taihu, China. Our algorithm produced robust results with a mean absolute square percentage error of 29.65% and root mean square error of 9.54 mu g/L. Meanwhile, the new algorithm demonstrates good portability to other waters with different optical properties and could be applied to various image data, including Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS), and Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI). Further analysis based on Geostationary Ocean Color Imager observations from 2011 to 2020 revealed a significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity of C-TDP in Lake Taihu. Correlation analysis of the long-term trend between C-TDP and driving factors demonstrated that air temperature is the dominant regulating factor in variations of C-TDP. This study provides a novel algorithm allowing remote-sensing monitoring of C-TDP in eutrophic lakes and can lead to new insights into the role of dissolved phosphorus in water eutrophication.

TI  - Extracting Lotus Fields Using the Spectral Characteristics of GF-1 Satellite Data
T2  - PHYTON-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - The lotus (Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn) is an aquatic plant that grows in shallow water and has long been cultivated in South China. It can improve the incomes of farmers and plays an important role in alleviating poverty in rural China. However, a modern method is required to accurately estimate the area of lotus fields. Lotus has spectral characteristics similar to those of rice, grassland, and shrubs. The features surrounding areas where it is grown are complex, small, and fragmented. Few studies have examined the remote sensing extraction of lotus fields, and automatic extraction and mapping are still challenging methods. Here, we compared the spectral characteristics of lotus fields and other ground objects and devised a remote sensing method for the rapid extraction of lotus fields. Using this method, the extraction accuracy of lotus was 96.3%. The Kappa coefficient was 0.926, which is higher than those of the unsupervised K-means classification, Mahalanobis distance, and support vector machine supervised classification, and demonstrates the potential of this method for extracting and mapping lotus fields by remote sensing.

TI  - Space-Based Detection of Significant Water-Depth Increase Induced by Hurricane Irma in the Everglades Wetlands Using Sentinel-1 SAR Backscatter Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Extreme rainfall, induced by severe weather events, such as hurricanes, impacts wetlands because rapid water-depth increases can lead to flora and fauna mortality. This study developed an innovative algorithm to detect significant water-depth increases (SWDI, defined as water-depth increases above a threshold) in wetlands, using Sentinel-1 SAR backscatter. We used Hurricane Irma as an example that made landfall in the south Florida Everglades wetlands in September 2017 and produced tremendous rainfall. The algorithm detects SWDI for during- and post-event SAR acquisition dates, using pre-event water-depth as a baseline. The algorithm calculates Normalized Difference Backscatter Index (NDBI), using pre-, during-, and post-event backscatter, at a 20-m SAR resolution, as an indicator of the likelihood of SWDI, and detects SWDI using all NDBI values in a 400-m resolution pixel. The algorithm successfully detected large SWDI areas for the during-event date and progressive expansion of non-SWDI areas (water-depth differences less than the threshold) for five post-event dates in the following two months. The algorithm achieved good performance in both 'herbaceous dominant' and 'trees embedded within herbaceous matrix' land covers, with an overall accuracy of 81%. This study provides a solution for accurate mapping of SWDI and can be used in global wetlands, vulnerable to extreme rainfall.

TI  - Estimation of Global Irrigation Water Use by the Integration of Multiple Satellite Observations
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantification of the global irrigation water use (IWU) is crucial to understanding the anthropogenic disturbance of the natural hydrological cycle and optimal agricultural water management. However, it is challenging to obtain time series data with the conventional survey-based approach, while the current satellite-based IWU estimations are subject to data gaps and the model structure. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive framework to couple the different processes associated with irrigation and integrate multiple satellite observations to estimate the global IWU. The ensemble IWU estimate demonstrates an improved performance when compared to the IWU obtained from individual satellite observations. The results show reasonable correlation with the survey-based irrigation water withdrawal in states of the US (bias = -0.42 km(3)), provinces of China (bias = -3.10 km(3)), and country statistics from the Food and Agriculture Organization (bias = -10.84 km(3)). Large amounts of IWU are apparent in India, China, the US, Europe, and Pakistan, making up >70% of the global IWU. A general underestimation of IWU is found both in this work and previous studies, due to the coarse resolution and asynchronism of the various satellite products, the changes in irrigated areas, and the deficiency in detecting irrigation events under the case of saturated soil moisture. Nevertheless, we demonstrate advantages in integrating multiple satellite observations to reduce the uncertainty in estimating global IWU. However, additional efforts are needed to produce high-quality and finer spatiotemporal resolution satellite-based products, to further improve the accuracy of the global IWU estimation.

TI  - Assessing the contemporary status of Nebraska's eastern saline wetlands by using a machine learning algorithm on the Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Nebraska's eastern saline wetlands are globally unique and highly vulnerable inland salt marsh ecosystems. This research aims to evaluate the status of the saline wetlands in eastern Nebraska to discover the conditions of saline wetland hydrology, hydrophytes, and hydraulic soil. The research adopts machine learning and Google Earth Engine to classify Sentinel-2 imagery for water and vegetation classification and the National Agriculture Imagery Program imagery for salinity conditions. Six machine learning models are applied in water, soil, and vegetation detection in the study area. The optimal model (linear kernel SVM) generates an overall accuracy of 99.95% for water classification. For saline vegetation classification, the optimal model is the gradient tree boost with an overall accuracy of 94.07%. The overall accuracy values of saline soil classification using the optimal model (linear kernel SVM) varied among different years. The results of this study show the possibility of an observation approach for continuously monitoring Nebraska's eastern saline wetlands. The water classification results show that the saline wetlands in this area all have a similar temporal water cover pattern within each year. For saline vegetation, the peak season in this area is between June and July. The years 2019 (19.00%) and 2018 (17.69%) had higher saline vegetation cover rates than 2017 (10.54%). The saline soil classification shows that the saline soil area is highly variable in response to changes in the water and vegetation conditions. The research findings provide solid scientific evidence for conservation decision-making in these saline wetland areas.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Patterns and Driving Force of Urbanization and Its Impact on Urban Ecology
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization inevitably poses a threat to urban ecology by altering its external structure and internal attributes. Nighttime light (NTL) has become increasingly extensive and practical, offering a special perspective on the world in revealing urbanization. In this study, we applied the Normalized Impervious Surface Index (NISI) constructed by NTL and MODIS NDVI to examine the urbanization process in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD). Geographical detectors combined with factors involving human and natural influences were utilized to investigate the drive mechanism. Urban ecology stress was evaluated based on changes in urban morphological patterns and fractional vegetation cover (FVC). The results showed that the NISI can largely overcome the obstacle of directly coupling NTL data in performing urbanization and has efficient applicability in the long-term pixel scale. Built-up areas in the YRD increased by 2.83 times during the past two decades, from 2053.5 to 7872.5 km(2). Urbanization intensity has saturated the city center and is spilling over into the suburbs, which show a "cold to hot" spatial clustering distribution. Economic factors are the primary forces driving urbanization, and road network density is becoming essential as factor that reflects urban infrastructure. Urban geometry pattern changes in fractal dimension (FD) and compactness revealed the ecological stress from changing urban external structure, and internal ecological stress was clear from the negative effect on 63.4% FVC. This impact gradually increased in urban expanded area and synchronously decreased when urbanization saturated the core area. An analysis of ecological stress caused by urbanization from changing physical structure and social attributes can provide evidence for urban management and coordinated development.

TI  - Adaptive Square-Root Unscented Kalman Filter Phase Unwrapping with Modified Phase Gradient Estimation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Phase unwrapping (PU) is a key program in data processing in the interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technique, and its accuracy directly affects the quality of final SAR data products. However, PU in regions with large gradient changes and high noise has always been a difficult problem. To overcome the limitation, this article proposes an adaptive square-root unscented Kalman filter PU method. Specifically, a modified phase gradient estimation (PGE) algorithm is proposed, in which a Butterworth low-pass filter is embedded, and the PGE window can be adaptively adjusted according to phase root-mean-square errors of pixels. Furthermore, the outliers of the PGE results are detected and revised to obtain high-precision vertical and horizontal phase gradients. Finally, the unwrapped phase is calculated by the adaptive square-root unscented Kalman filter method. To the best of our knowledge, this article is the first to combine the modified PGE with an adaptive square-root unscented Kalman filter for PU. Two sets of simulated data and a set of TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X real data were used for experimental verification. The experimental results demonstrated that the various improvement measures proposed in this article were effective. Additionally, compared with the minimum-cost flow algorithm (MCF), statistical-cost network-flow algorithm (SNAPHU) and unscented Kalman filter PU (UKFPU), the proposed method had better accuracy and model robustness.

TI  - Shape-Constrained Method of Remote Sensing Monitoring of Marine Raft Aquaculture Areas on Multitemporal Synthetic Sentinel-1 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale and periodic remote sensing monitoring of marine raft aquaculture areas is significant for scientific planning of their layout and for promoting sustainable development of marine ecology. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an important tool for stable monitoring of marine raft aquaculture areas since it is all-weather, all-day, and cloud-penetrating. However, the scattering signal of marine raft aquaculture areas is affected by speckle noise and sea state, so their features in SAR images are complex. Thus, it is challenging to extract marine raft aquaculture areas from SAR images. In this paper, we propose a method to extract marine raft aquaculture areas from Sentinel-1 images based on the analysis of the features for marine raft aquaculture areas. First, the data are preprocessed using multitemporal phase synthesis to weaken the noise interference, enhance the signal of marine raft aquaculture areas, and improve the significance of the characteristics of raft aquaculture areas. Second, the geometric features of the marine raft aquaculture area are combined to design the model structure and introduce the shape constraint module, which adds a priori knowledge to guide the model convergence direction during the training process. Experiments verify that the method outperforms the popular semantic segmentation model with an F1 of 84.52%.

TI  - Temporal Characteristics of Stress Signals Using GRU Algorithm for Heavy Metal Detection in Rice Based on Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Heavy metal stress, which is a serious environmental problem, affects both animal and human health through the food chain. However, such subtle stress information is difficult to detect in remote sensing images. Therefore, enhancing the stress signal is key to accurately identifying heavy metal contamination in crops. The aim of this study was to identify heavy metal stress in rice at a regional scale by mining the time-series characteristics of rice growth under heavy metal stress using the gated recurrent unit (GRU) algorithm. The experimental area was located in Zhuzhou City, Hunan Province, China. We collected situ-measured data and Sentinel-2A images corresponding to the 2019-2021 period. First, the spatial distribution of the rice in the study area was extracted using the random forest algorithm based on the Sentinel 2 images. Second, the time-series characteristics were analyzed, sensitive parameters were selected, and a GRU classification model was constructed. Third, the model was used to identify the heavy metals in rice and then assess the accuracy of the classification results using performance metrics such as the accuracy rate, precision, recall rate (recall), and F1-score (F1-score). The results showed that the GRU model based on the time series of the red-edge location feature index has a good classification performance with an overall accuracy of 93.5% and a Kappa coefficient of 85.6%. This study shows that regional heavy metal stress in crops can be accurately detected using the GRU algorithm. A combination of spectrum and temporal information appears to be a promising method for monitoring crops under various types of stress.

TI  - Simulation of Glacial Lake Outburst Flood in Southeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau-A Case Study of JiwenCo Glacial Lake
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) is one of the main natural disasters in alpine areas, which can cause extreme destruction to downstream settlements and infrastructures. A moraine-dammed lake named JiwenCo glacial lake (JGL) in the southeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau failed on 26 June 2020, destroying many buildings, roads, bridges, and farmlands along the flow path. We reconstructed the process of this GLOF event by the Hydrological Engineering Center's River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) and examined the JGL's evolution (area, length, and volume) before its outburst, based on the measured cross sections and hydrological data, videos, and pictures taken by inhabitants, DEM data, and Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)/Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+)/Operational Land Imager (OLI) images. The result showed that area, length, and volume of the JGL increased by 0.20 +/- 0.07 km(2), 0.66 +/- 0.03 km, and 0.03 +/- 0.001 km(3) from 1988 to 2020 (before the outburst), respectively. Approximately 0.05 km(3) of water volume was discharged with the dropped water level of 15.63 m after the outburst. The peak flow was 534.4 m(3)/s at breach and increased to 1,408.11 m(3)/s at Zhongyu town. The difference between the simulated and measured peak flows in Zhongyu town was 41.88 m(3)/s (3.53%), showing the high accuracy of the modeling results. For villages along the river-channel, the highest velocity was found in Yiga village (14.23 m/s) and the lowest was in Gongwa village (1.22 m/s). The maximum depth was gradually increased as the river reached downstream, 8.03 m in Yiga village and 50.96 m in Duiba village. The combination of landslide, high temperature, and extremely heavy precipitation resulted in this GLOF disaster. An integrated disaster prevention and mitigation plan needs to be developed for susceptible areas such as Niduzangbo basin that experienced two GLOFs in recent 10 years.

TI  - Intraoperative fluorescence molecular imaging accelerates the coming of precision surgery in China
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose China has the largest cancer population globally. Surgery is the main choice for most solid cancer patients. Intraoperative fluorescence molecular imaging (FMI) has shown its great potential in assisting surgeons in achieving precise resection. We summarized the typical applications of intraoperative FMI and several new trends to promote the development of precision surgery. Methods The academic database and NIH clinical trial platform were systematically evaluated. We focused on the clinical application of intraoperative FMI in China. Special emphasis was placed on a series of typical studies with new technologies or high-level evidence. The emerging strategy of combining FMI with other modalities was also discussed. Results The clinical applications of clinically approved indocyanine green (ICG), methylene blue (MB), or fluorescein are on the rise in different surgical departments. Intraoperative FMI has achieved precise lesion detection, sentinel lymph node mapping, and lymphangiography for many cancers. Nerve imaging is also exploring to reduce iatrogenic injuries. Through different administration routes, these fluorescent imaging agents provided encouraging results in surgical navigation. Meanwhile, designing new cancer-specific fluorescent tracers is expected to be a promising trend to further improve the surgical outcome. Conclusions Intraoperative FMI is in a rapid development in China. In-depth understanding of cancer-related molecular mechanisms is necessary to achieve precision surgery. Molecular-targeted fluorescent agents and multi-modal imaging techniques might play crucial roles in the era of precision surgery.

TI  - Spatio-temporal assessing of natural vegetation regulation on SO<sub>2</sub> absorption coupling ecosystem process model and OMI satellite data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying the contribution of natural ecosystems on air quality regulation can help to lay the foundation for ecological construction, and to promote the sustainable development of natural ecosystems. To identify the spatio-temporal dynamic changes of natural vegetation regulation on SO2 absorption and the underlying mechanism of these changes in Qinghai Province, an important ecological barrier and the unique natural ecosystems, the Biome-BGC model was improved to simulate the canopy conductance to SO2 and leaf area index (LAI) on the daily scale, and then the SO2 absorption by vegetation was estimated coupling SO2 concentration from satellite data. Our results showed that the annual average SO2 absorption of the natural ecosystems in Qinghai Province was 4.74 x 10(4) tons yr(-1) from 2005 to 2018, accounting for about 40% of the total emissions. Spatially, the ecosystem service of SO2 absorption gradually decreased from southeast to northwest, and varied from 0 in Haixi state to 14.37 kg SO2 ha(-1) yr(-1) in Haibei state. The annual average SO2 absorption in unit area was 0.68 kg SO2 ha(-1) yr(-1), and significantly higher SO2 absorption was observed in summer with 0.45 kg SO2 ha(-1) quarterly. The canopy conductance and LAI controlled by climate variables would be the dominant driving factors for the variation of SO2 absorption for natural ecosystems. The sensitivity analysis showed that SO2 concentration contributed more to the uncertainties of SO2 absorption than the conductance in this study. Our results could provide powerful supports for realistic eco-environmental policy and decision making.

TI  - Decadal Variation and Regulation Mechanisms of the Suspended Sediment Concentration in the Bohai Sea, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Bohai Sea, with the highest suspended sediment concentration in the world, has experienced a sharp decrease in sea surface suspended sediment concentration (SSSC) in the latest two decades. However, limited by the shortage of long-term field observations, the spatiotemporal characteristics and mechanisms of the long-term variation in the SSSC are still unclear. Based on remote sensing data, this study reconstructed the spatiotemporal SSSC distribution from 2003 to 2016, and found significant spatial difference in decadal SSSC variation in the Bohai Sea. The largest decadal SSSC decrease was observed in the southern Bohai Sea with an average annual decrease of 1.3 mg/L (decrease of 4.4% per year), while significant SSSC increase was observed in the central Bohai Sea with largest annual increase of 0.4 mg/L (increase of 5.0% per year). Significant seasonal differences in the SSSC decreasing were also revealed, and the SSSC decrease in winter and spring (0.46 mg/L/a) was 27.8% higher than that in summer and autumn (0.36 mg/L/a). Decadal wind speed data measured at 14 meteorological stations around the Bohai Sea indicated that wind speed reduction played the most important role in the decadal decrease in SSSCs, and significant SSSC decrease can only be found in sea areas with a significantly reduced wind speed. In addition, although the runoff and sediment discharge of the Yellow River also decreased during 2003-2016, they were not related to the spatiotemporal variation of SSSCs and their direct impact was limited to the range of 15 km from the estuary.

TI  - Study of Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Retrieval Method Based on Normalized Sensitivity
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The satellite-based remote-sensing detection of CO2 can provide long-term and continuous observations at the global scale, and is the primary observational approach to monitoring CO2 changes. Surface albedo and aerosol are two significant challenges for retrieving CO2 concentrations from near-infrared remote-sensing data. This research addressed the dependence of radiance sensitivities on CO2 concentration, aerosol, surface albedo, and water vapor. The band ratio method was used to retrieve CO2 with band selection of the high- and low-sensitivity channels to restrain the influence of surface albedo and aerosol. Results showed that the band ratio method had better efficiency at reducing the impact of aerosol and surface albedo than that of the optical estimation method. The retrieval error of aerosol was reduced by 2.5% overall. We validated the band ratio method retrieval results with two TCCON sites and the GOSAT L3 product. Pearson's correlation coefficient, mean bias, mean absolute bias, and root mean squared error of the monthly retrieval data of the band ratio method showed high agreement between the TCCON in Park Falls and Wollongong. These results indicate that the band ratio method based on normalized sensitivity can effectively reduce the influence of surface albedo and aerosol.

TI  - Progress of Multimodal Photoacoustic Imaging and its Application in Ophthalmology
T2  - LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Photoacoustic imaging technology is a novel noninvasive and nonionizing biomedical-imaging method. It effectively combines the advantages of ultrasonic and optical imaging to obtain high-resolution and high- contrast biological tissue structure images, which provide an important basis for the early diagnosis and the curative effect evaluation of diseases. However, any single imaging technology has its unique imaging advantages and inevitably some limitations. Combining photoacoustic imaging with other imaging technologies such as optical coherence tomography and ultrasonic imaging to form a multimodal imaging system can realize the complementary advantages of each imaging technology, make it have better imaging depth and spatial resolution, and provide more comprehensive biological tissue information. Multimodal photoacoustic imaging technology has been applied to the diagnosis and the treatment of various diseases, and its application potential in ophthalmology is being explored. Multimodal photoacoustic eye imaging can not only provide ocular anatomy information but also provide certain functional information. In the process of the occurrence and the development of certain eye diseases, a few parameters and indicators will change, such as blood oxygen saturation, oxygen metabolic rate, and molecular markers. Eye diseases can be accurately monitored and diagnosed in the early stages through the real-time quantitative measurement of the changes of relevant parameters in the eye. This paper summarizes the research progress of multimodal photoacoustic imaging technology and its application in ophthalmology, as well as the attempts to discuss its future development.

T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - As the roof of the world, the Mt. Qomolangma National Nature Reserve and adjacent regions have a fragile environment and are very sensitive to global climate change. Based on the MODIS and SPOT remote sensing data during 2000-2018, we aimed to explore the change trend and driving factors of grassland in this area under the dual influence of climate change and human activities. Here, temperature and precipitation data were enrolled as the main indicators of climate change, while the number of livestock at the end of the year was regarded as the key indicator of grazing. The results showed that: (1) during 2000-2018, the grassland NDVI reflected an overall increasing trend, and the impact of precipitation was more significant than those of temperature and grazing at both pixel and county levels; (2) probably due to the large population and high grazing intensity, the grassland NDVI in Tingri County was controlled by both precipitation and grazing. In general, precipitation exerts a greater impact on the NDVI changes since this region is characterized by arid and semiarid climates. In some areas, vegetation growth is simultaneously affected by both grazing and climate factors due to the relatively greater pressure of grazing. In the context of future warming, control of the number of tourists for Mt. Qomolangma, as well as that of livestock in Tingri County, will help improve sustainability development and to reduce the adverse effects of grassland degradation.

TI  - Disturbances Brought about by Human Activities in Relation to the Eco-Environment of the Main Stream of the Tarim River, 2000-2020
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The main stream of the Tarim River in China is typical of ecologically sensitive areas that have been heavily disturbed by human activities; as such, the monitoring of the quality of its eco-environment constitutes an important task for researchers. By using GlobeLand30 data and applying the disturbance degree model and revised ecosystem service value (ESV) model, the study presented in this paper undertook a quantitative estimation of the effects of the disturbance impacts of human activities on the eco-environment of this area in the period of 2000 to 2020. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) disturbance index values, which reflect disturbance to the local ecosystem by human activities, increased over the study period. Further, cultivated land experienced the largest increase, which, in turn, brought about the most significant disturbance to the eco-environment. High disturbance index values presented a patchy distribution in the west of the main stream of the Tarim River and formed bands and dots in the east; the area of land characterized by high and moderate disturbance index values increased, with growth areas taking on a scattered distribution of patches, bands, and dots without significant spatial continuity. (2) The total ESV increased, indicating the quality of the eco-environment improved. The increase of cultivated land offset the increase in ESV, which counteracted the effects of ecological governance measures. Areas with high ESV values were mainly located in the western and central parts of the study area, while low values were found in the middle east and east. Areas with higher increases in ESV were mainly located in the western and the western part of the middle reaches and took on a zonal distribution, while areas of decrease followed a scattered distribution, presenting as dots or patches. Using the quantitative analysis methods and high-resolution remote sensing data to evaluate the changes in the eco-environment was considered as the innovation of this study, and the findings are useful in exploring the influence of human activities on ecosystems and evaluating the eco-environment in the minor watershed of an arid area. This piece of quantitative research contributes to the task of monitoring eco-environmental changes using remote sensing techniques in ecologically sensitive areas.

TI  - Study of Mixed Pollution of Haze and Dust in Jinan Based on LiDAR
T2  - PHOTONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - From 26 March to 30 March 2021, a severe mixed haze and dust pollution process occurred in Jinan, China. Ground light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and satellite radar were used to observe and analyze the mixed pollution. In this study, a variety of data, including the pollutant concentration, meteorological factors, radiosonde data, and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) satellite data, as well as back-trajectory analysis, were employed to analyze the causes of the mixed pollution. The results show that, at the beginning of this weather process, fine particulate matter such as PM2.5 was the main source of pollution, and the low air mass transporting the main pollution originated from nearby cities and polluted industrial areas. After 28 March, due to the influence of a high-altitude Mongolian air mass, the concentration of coarse particulate matter such as PM10 increased significantly. The surface temperature, humidity, and wind speed also affected the accumulation of pollutants, which affected the timely diffusion of the pollution. In this study, ground LiDAR and satellite-based radar were used to detect the pollution. On the basis of a comprehensive analysis of the various meteorological factors, the formation and influence of the pollution were investigated from various perspectives. The extinction coefficient reflected the PM2.5 concentration, verifying the effectiveness of LiDAR in pollution concentration detection. The variation in the boundary layer height also had an important effect on pollution dissipation.

TI  - The thermal infrared optical depth of mineral dust retrieved from integrated CALIOP and IIR observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent studies have suggested that global climate models tend to underestimate dust particle size in particular, the very coarse mode, leading to an underestimated direct radiative effect (DRE) of dust in the longwave (LW) thermal infrared (TIR) region. However, the magnitude of LW DRE remains highly uncertain, because of limited observations of dust optical depth at the TIR (DAOD(TIR)). This study presents a simple approach to retrieve the DAOD(TIR) over the oceans during nighttime through synergistic use of observations from the Infrared Imaging Radiometer (IIR) and the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP), both onboard of the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) mission. For each cloud-free dust-laden profile identified by the IIR-CALIOP observation, a Lookup-Table (LUT) of the 10.6 mu m IIR band brightness temperatures (BT) difference (dBT) under different DAOD(TIR) with respect to their dust-free BTs is constructed based on the CALIOP retrieved dust vertical profile and a priori dust scattering properties using a fast radiative transfer model. Then the DAOD(TIR) is retrieved by projecting the IIR-observed dBT on the LUT. Sensitivity studies show that the DAOD(TIR) retrieval at 10.6 mu m is more susceptible to the dust particle size distribution (PSD) assumption than dust refractive indices. To estimate the uncertainty caused by PSD assumption, two DAOD(TIR) retrieval products, one based on the dust PSD from the AERONET at Cape Verde and the other on an in situ measured PSD from the recent Fennec campaign, are provided. The retrieval uncertainty is mainly contributed by the BT difference between the observation and simulation using auxiliary atmospheric data. The climatology of the retrieval from 2013 to 2019 shows reasonable spatiotemporal variations of DAOD(TIR) with the global-averaged value of 0.008 and 0.013 based on different pre-assumed dust PSDs. Climatological results agree reasonably well with two independent DAOD(TIR) retrieval products based on the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) over the active dust transport regions, such as North and Tropical Atlantic (r = 0.9 and r = 0.8) and Indian Ocean (r = 0.8). The seasonal and interannual variation is also well-compared (r = 0.76) with AERONET coarse-mode AOD at 97 selected sites. The synergic CALIOP observation allows the retrieved DAOD(TIR) to directly compare with the extrapolated DAOD(TIR) from DAOD in the visible (i.e., 532 nm), which helps evaluate the observational constraints on DAOD(TIR). Our study clearly reveals that the retrieved DAOD(TIR) from IIR is much less susceptible to various uncertainties than converted results from CALIOP. It also offers a unique prospect of collocated active lidar and passive IR observations for retrieving dust DAOD(TIR).

TI  - Development of a Phenology-Based Method for Identifying Sugarcane Plantation Areas in China Using High-Resolution Satellite Datasets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sugarcane is an important sugar and biofuel crop with high socio-economic importance, and its planted area has increased rapidly in recent years. China is the world's third or fourth sugarcane producer. However, to our knowledge, no study has investigated the mapping of sugarcane cultivation areas across entire China. In this study, we developed a phenology-based method to identify sugarcane plantations in China at 30-m spatial resolution from 2016-2020 using the time-series of Landsat and Sentinel-1/2 images derived from Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The method worked by comparing the phenological similarity in normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) series between unknown pixels and sugarcane samples. The phenological similarity was assessed using the time-weighted dynamic time warping method (TWDTW), which has less sensitivity to training samples than machine learning methods and therefore can be easily applied to large areas with limited samples. More importantly, our method introduced multiple and moving time standard phenological curves of sugarcane to the TWDTW by fully considering the variable crop life-cycle of sugarcane, particularly its long harvest season spanning from December to March of the following year. Validations showed the method performed well in 2019, with overall accuracies of 93.47% and 92.74% for surface reflectance (SR) and top of atmosphere reflectance (TOA) data, respectively. The sugarcane maps agreed well with the agricultural statistical areas from 2016-2020. The mapping accuracies using TOA data were comparable to SR data in 2019-2020, but outperformed SR data in 2016-2018 when SR data had lower availability on GEE. The sugarcane maps produced in this study can be used to monitor growing conditions and production of sugarcane and, therefore, can benefit sugarcane management, sustainable sugarcane production, and national food security.

TI  - Simulation of Soil Organic Carbon Content Based on Laboratory Spectrum in the Three-Rivers Source Region of China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) changes affect the land carbon cycle and are also closely related to climate change. Visible-near infrared spectroscopy (Vis-NIRS) has proven to be an effective tool in predicting soil properties. Spectral transformations are necessary to reduce noise and ensemble learning methods can improve the estimation accuracy of SOC. Yet, it is still unclear which is the optimal ensemble learning method exploiting the results of spectral transformations to accurately simulate SOC content changes in the Three-Rivers Source Region of China. In this study, 272 soil samples were collected and used to build the Vis-NIRS simulation models for SOC content. The ensemble learning was conducted by the building of stack models. Sixteen combinations were produced by eight spectral transformations (S-G, LR, MSC, CR, FD, LRFD, MSCFD and CRFD) and two machine learning models of RF and XGBoost. Then, the prediction results of these 16 combinations were used to build the first-step stack models (Stack1, Stack2, Stack3). The next-step stack models (Stack4, Stack5, Stack6) were then made after the input variables were optimized based on the threshold of the feature importance of the first-step stack models (importance > 0.05). The results in this study showed that the stack models method obtained higher accuracy than the single model and transformations method. Among the six stack models, Stack 6 (5 selected combinations + XGBoost) showed the best simulation performance (RMSE = 7.3511, R-2 = 0.8963, and RPD = 3.0139, RPIQ = 3.339), and obtained higher accuracy than Stack3 (16 combinations + XGBoost). Overall, our results suggested that the ensemble learning of spectral transformations and simulation models can improve the estimation accuracy of the SOC content. This study can provide useful suggestions for the high-precision estimation of SOC in the alpine ecosystem.

TI  - Dissecting the Mutual Response of Potential Evapotranspiration with Vegetation Cover/Land Use over Heilongjiang River Basin, China
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal changes in potential evapotranspiration (PET) are important referential data for monitoring the variation in ecohydrology under climate change. As the key area of agricultural/forestry reserves and trade, research on the interactions between vegetation cover and land use with accurate PET among the Heilongjiang River basin, China is vital for the sustainability of this cross-border region. To obtain high-suitability PET estimation based on the proven Penman-Monteith (PM) principle, two schemes were adopted using 36-year in situ meteorological data (1984-2019) and derived remote-sensing product MOD16A2 from 2001 to 2019. At meteorological sites with heterogeneous underlying surfaces, the coefficients of the evaluation factors between MOD_PET and the referrable observations were better. This suggests that remotely sensed estimation was preferentially chosen as the input to study the mutual responses. The results indicated that the annual PET and fractional vegetation cover (FVC) changes differed significantly depending on the land use. The proportions of PET according to equal intervals initially increased and then decreased with increasing vegetation coverage, and changing trends indicated a negative correlation. The strongest correlations appeared in the middle to northern sub-basins, which were affected by their distinctive climatic characteristics. The response of PET was reverse-related with changes in the area of each selected land type, but could change with the expected climatic conditions.

TI  - Research on Classification of Open-Pit Mineral Exploiting Information Based on OOB RFE Feature Optimization
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mineral exploiting information is an important indicator to reflect regional mineral activities. Accurate extraction of this information is essential to mineral management and environmental protection. In recent years, there are an increasingly large number of pieces of research on land surface information classification by conducting multi-source remote sensing data. However, in order to achieve the best classification result, how to select the optimal feature combination is the key issue. This study creatively combines Out of Bag data with Recursive Feature Elimination (OOB RFE) to optimize the feature combination of the mineral exploiting information of non-metallic building materials in Fujian province, China. We acquired and integrated Ziyuan-1-02D (ZY-1-02D) hyperspectral imagery, landsat-8 multispectral imagery, and Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery to gain spectrum, heat, polarization, and texture features; also, two machine learning methods were adopted to classify the mineral exploiting information in our study area. After assessment and comparison on accuracy, it proves that the classification generated from our new OOB RFE method, which combine with random forest (RF), can achieve the highest overall accuracy 93.64% (with a kappa coefficient of 0.926). Comparing with Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) alone, OOB REF can precisely filter the feature combination and lead to optimal result. Under the same feature scheme, RF is effective on classifying the mineral exploiting information of the research field. The feature optimization method and optimal feature combination proposed in our study can provide technical support and theoretical reference for extraction and classification of mineral exploiting information applied in other regions.

TI  - In-Flight Relative Radiometric Calibration of a Wide Field of View Directional Polarimetric Camera Based on the Rayleigh Scattering over Ocean
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The directional polarimetric camera (DPC) is a Chinese satellite sensor with a large field of view (FOV) (+/- 50 degrees both along-track and cross-track) and a high spatial resolution (about 3.3 km at nadir) that operates in a sun-synchronous orbit. It is a difficult task to calibrate the in-flight relative radiometric variation of the sensors with such a wide FOV. In this study, a new method based on Rayleigh scattering over the ocean is developed to estimate the radiometric sensitivity variation over the whole FOV of DPC. Firstly, the theoretical uncertainty of the method is analyzed to calibrate the relative radiometric response. The calibration uncertainties are about 2-6.9% (depending on the wavelength) when the view zenith angle (VZA) is 0 degrees and decrease to about 1-3.8% when VZA increases to 70 degrees. Then, the method is applied to evaluate the long-term radiometric drift of the DPC. It is found that the radiometric response of DPC/GaoFen-5 over the whole FOV is progressively drifting over time. The sensitivity at shorter bands decreases more strongly than longer bands, and at the central part of the optics decreases more strongly than the marginal part. During the 14 months (from March 2019 to April 2020) of operational running in-orbit, the DPC radiometric responses of 443 nm, 490 nm, 565 nm, and 670 nm bands drifted by about 4.44-23.08%, 4.75-16.22%, 3.86-9.81%, and 4.7-16.86%, respectively, from the marginal to the central part of the FOV. The radiometric sensitivity has become more stable since January 2020. The monthly radiometric drift is separated into the relative radiometric part and the absolute radiometric part. The relative radiometric drift of DPC is found to be smoothly varying with VZA, which can be parameterized as a polynomial function via VZA. At last, the temporal radiometric drift of DPC/GaoFen-5 is corrected by combining the relative and absolute radiometric coefficients. The correction is convincing by cross calibration with MODIS/Aqua observation over the desert sites and improving the aerosol retrievals. The Rayleigh method in this study is efficient for the radiometric sensitivity calibration of wide FOV satellite sensors.

TI  - Study on the Classification and Change Detection Methods of Drylands in Arid and Semi-Arid Regions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to clarify the distribution of irrigated drylands in arid and semi-arid areas, where complex terrain, diverse crops and staggered cultivated lands exist. This paper studied the classification methods of irrigated drylands based on temperature, precipitation, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) from Landsat data in the one-harvest area of the northern Loess Plateau of China by using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. An extraction method was proposed for irrigated drylands in arid and semi-arid regions of northwest China. In addition, the change types of irrigated and rainfed drylands in the two periods were classified, and a method was also put forward to directly classify the change types by using the image differences between the two periods combined with the classification results of each period. It was found that combining the ratio of NDVI and NDWI with the accumulated values of temperature and precipitation of the 30 days before imaging could effectively improve the classification accuracy. Moreover, directly classifying the gaps of remote sensing factors in the time dimension before combining spatial clustering information could yield a more accurate type of change, because the accumulation of errors in the change maps obtained from the overlay analysis of distribution maps of the two periods could be avoided. The accuracy of classification could be improved by introducing the dynamic information of time dimension into the classification of historical periods. This study complements the extraction method for this type of irrigated dryland, and the classification results can improve the accuracy of existing products in terms of spatial resolution, which can fill the shortage of detailed distribution data for irrigated and rainfed drylands in this region.

TI  - Research on Vegetation Coverage Dynamics and Prediction in the Taitema Lake Region
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tarim River is the largest inland river in China, which plays a crucial role in maintaining regional ecological security and carbon cycle/dynamic. However, the "green corridor" in the Taitema Lake region at the lower reaches of the Tarim River has unclear environmental changes and future dynamics due to the influence of the ecological water conveyance. Hence, protecting the "green corridor" at the lower reaches of the Tarim River in China is strategically important not only ecologically but also socially and economically. In this paper, the temporal and spatial features of the fractional vegetation coverage (FVC) dynamics in the Taitema Lake region at the lower reaches of the Tarim River in 2000-2018 are analyzed and calculated using Landsat TM/OLI remote sensing images and MODIS data products. Additionally, the future trend of FVC dynamics in the study region are predicted using trend analysis and the pixel-based Hurst index. The results show that FVC in the Taitema Lake region exhibit a positive development after the implementation of ecological water conveyance. Specifically, from 2000 to 2018, the areas of low, medium, and high FVC expanded from 1.28 km(2) to 179.87 km(2), resulting in an increase of 140.52%. Spatially, the regions around the lake entrance channel of the Tarim River saw a significant increase in FVC of 9.71%. The middle part of the study region, accounting for only 1.96% of the area, displayed relatively high and high fluctuations in FVC. In the future, the regions at the middle part of the lake and around the lake entrance channel of the Tarim River, accounting for 11.33% of the area, will likely show an increasing trend in FVC. The regions with either extremely low or low FVC are predicted to decrease to 14.16% of the overall area. Because the positive effects of ecological water conveyance were more significant on FVC in the study region than the influences of either temperature or precipitation, ecological water conveyance should remain the primary means of ecological restoration for Taitema Lake.

TI  - The use of Sentinel-1 OCN products for preliminary deep offshore wind energy potential estimation: A case study on Ionian sea
T2  - ENGINEERING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL-JESTECH
M3  - Article
AB  - The exploitation of wind energy potential has been strongly limited in the Mediterranean area due to its critical bathymetry. However, the spread of new deep offshore technologies such as floating turbines could drastically change the actual scenario, allowing wind energy to be exploited even in areas with critical bathymetric conditions. In such framework, remote sensing technologies could significantly help the development of offshore wind farms and may represent a valid resource for better planning wind energy solutions. In this article, a satellite based methodology for assessing the wind energy potential of offshore areas is presented and applied on a study case in the Ionian sea to identify the most effective areas for energy harvesting. The study is based on the use of the Sentinel-1 OCeaN (OCN) products, which are Level-2 sea-based data products provided by Copernicus (the principle European Union's earth observation programme), containing wind retrieval information. Despite their proven accuracy and their ease of use, OCN products have been rarely used in recent scientific production for energetic purposes. An initial investigation on wind speed characteristics has been carried out using as reference data-set the one provided by the Global Wind Atlas (GWA). A sub-area with maximum coastal wind speed gradient has been identified in the Region of Interest (ROI). Afterwards, 54 Sentinel-1 images have been processed. Data have been aggregated on a monthly domain (February 2020 -January 2021) to produce 12 wind speed maps of the ROI sub-area. A productivity analysis has been carried out in three specific sites. Results show: (i) the effectiveness of an OCN products based methodology for wind energy solutions planning, (ii) the reliability of the monthly based data aggregation (proven by a spatial dispersion analysis) and (iii) the specific wind energy production potentialities of the chosen ROI, where a single wind turbine installation could ensure an annual power production up to 19.06 GWh.(c) 2022 The Authors.

TI  - GIS-Based Water Budget Estimation of the Kizilirmak River Basin using GLDAS-2.1 Noah and CLSM Models and Remote Sensing Observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing products are becoming increasingly important in water resources management. Monitoring water availability and demand within a basin is a primary requirement of effective and sustainable river basin management. In this study, monthly and annual water budget components of the Kizilirmak River Basin were estimated from satellite observations and GLDAS-2.1 Noah and CLSM models for the hydrological years 2014 and 2015. Precipitation (P), evapotranspiration (ET), terrestrial water storage (TWS), and runoff (R) datasets were taken from different sources (GPM IMERG, CHIRPS, MODIS, SSEBop, GRACE, CLSM, Noah, and streamflow gauge). Since R is not directly available from remote sensing observations, it was inferred from the water balance equation as a residual. The datasets were processed, analyzed, and intercompared. The performance of satellite remote sensing in water budget estimation was evaluated, and the consistency of spatial patterns between satellite data and earth system-modeled data was analyzed. As a result of the analysis, remotely sensed P showed good consistencies; however, ET and TWS change showed large uncertainties. Inferred runoff from remote sensing and model outputs showed significant differences from the observed streamflow measurements; nevertheless, Noah demonstrated better consistency with the gauge observations. Our study revealed the strengths and limitations of satellite-based remote sensing and GLDAS-2.1 CLSM and Noah models in estimating water budget. Caution should be exercised when using remote sensing and modeled data in ungauged regions because human influence is not included in such datasets. Despite the uncertainties in GLDAS and remote sensing datasets, such data can be quite useful for evaluating seasonal and interannual changes in water components and river basin management, particularly in data-sparse regions.

TI  - Doubling of annual forest carbon loss over the tropics during the early twenty-first century
T2  - NATURE SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous estimates of tropical forest carbon loss in the twenty-first century using satellite data typically focus on its magnitude, whereas regional loss trajectories and associated drivers are rarely reported. Here we used different high-resolution satellite datasets to show a doubling of gross tropical forest carbon loss worldwide from 0.97 +/- 0.16 PgC yr(-1) in 2001-2005 to 1.99 +/- 0.13 PgC yr(-1) in 2015-2019. This increase in carbon loss from forest conversion is higher than in bookkeeping models forced by land-use statistical data, which show no trend or a slight decline in land-use emissions in the early twenty-first century. Most (82%) of the forest carbon loss is at some stages associated with large-scale commodity or small-scale agriculture activities, particularly in Africa and Southeast Asia. We find that similar to 70% of former forest lands converted to agriculture in 2001-2019 remained so in 2020, confirming a dominant role of agriculture in long-term pan-tropical carbon reductions on formerly forested landscapes. The acceleration and high rate of forest carbon loss in the twenty-first century suggest that existing strategies to reduce forest loss are not successful; and this failure underscores the importance of monitoring deforestation trends following the new pledges made in Glasgow.

TI  - Climate Change Impacts on the Patagonian Shelf Break Front
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We characterize long-term trends of sea surface temperature (SST), absolute dynamic topography, and chlorophyll-a (CHL) in the Patagonian shelf break front (SBF) using 27 years (1993-2019) of satellite data. Warming of the Argentinean shelf waters and the southwestward displacement of the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence (BMC) impact the northernmost extension of the SBF. Cooling of the Malvinas Current (MC) and the concurrent warming of the adjacent shelf waters lead to a significant increase of SST gradients along the outer shelf. The southwestward displacement of the BMC implies a similar shift of the SBF. An increase in CHL trend appears to be associated with southerly wind anomalies along the shelf break. We estimate a southward shift of the northernmost penetration of the MC of -0.11 +/- 0.076 degrees/decade.

TI  - Association of perinatal sentinel events, placental pathology and cerebral MRI in neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy receiving therapeutic hypothermia
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERINATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Placental pathology might provide information on the etiology of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). To evaluate the association of perinatal sentinel events (PSE), placental pathology and cerebral MRI in cooled neonates with moderate/severe HIE. Study design Retrospective analysis of 52 neonates with HIE registered in the Swiss National Asphyxia and Cooling Register 2011-2019. PSE and Non-PSE groups were tested for association with placental pathology. Placental pathology categories were correlated with MRI scores. Results In total, 14/52 neonates (27%) had a PSE, 38 neonates (73%) did not have a PSE. There was no evidence for an association of occurrence of PSE and placental pathologies (p = 0.364). Neonates with high MRI scores tended to have more often chronic pathologies in their placentas than acute pathologies or normal placentas (p = 0.067). Conclusion Independent of the occurrence of PSE, chronic placental pathologies might be associated with more severe brain injury and needs further study.

TI  - Assessing the impact of sampling strategy in random forest-based predicting of soil nutrients: a study case from northern Morocco
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, we tested different combinations of sampling strategies, random sampling and conditioned Latin Hypercube sampling (cLHS)] and sample ratios (10% = 147 and 25% = 368) to predict soil phosphorus and potassium contents, previously estimated using standard laboratory protocols. Other environmental covariates, used as input data for prediction, were obtained from different sources (multispectral Landsat-OLI 8 image, WorldClim database, ISRIC soil database, and ASTER-GDEM). Our findings showed that random sampling was suitable for predicting phosphorus, while the conditioned Latin Hypercube sampling was suitable for predicting potassium. Furthermore, we observed that when the sample ratio increased from 10 to 25%, model accuracy improved in random sampling and cLHS for phosphorus and potassium prediction. However, before generalizing these findings, we recommend that further studies be conducted under different conditions (climate, soil types and parent materials) and testing other sample ratios to determine the best sampling strategy with the optimum ratio to predict soil nutrients better.

TI  - Women Leadership, Culture, and Islam: Female Voices from Jordan
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper aims to explore the experiences of female leaders considering the interplay of gender, religion, and culture. Drawing on an inductive-qualitative study, the paper examines perceptions regarding the role of religion and cultural norms in women's ascension into leadership positions in Jordan. The results indicated that Jordanian women leaders adopted an Islamic feminist worldview and did not embrace a liberal nor a socialist/Marxist feminist worldview. Women leaders seemed wanting to claim their religion back from those forces that are reportedly holding their aspirations hostage to monolithic interpretations of religious texts. By constantly referring to their religion, female leaders wanted to be granted spaces of trust and responsibility in leadership positions that they did not see contradictory to the way they understood their faith. The paper provides insights into how women leaders understand prejudicial stereotypes and discrimination in their society, explaining how those are linked to patriarchal socio-cultural traditions emphasizing male control.

TI  - GCDB-UNet: A novel robust cloud detection approach for remote sensing images
T2  - KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud detection is a prerequisite in many remote sensing applications, and it has been tackled through different approaches from simple thresholding to complicated deep network training. On the other hand, existing approaches are susceptible to failures while handling thin clouds, largely because of their small sizes, sparse distributions, as well as high transparency and similarity to the non-cloud background regions. This paper presents global context dense block U-Net (GCDB-UNet), a robust cloud detection network that embeds global context dense block (GCDB) into the U-Net framework and is capable of detecting thin clouds effectively. GCDB consists of two feature extraction units for addressing the challenges in thin cloud detection, namely, a non-local self-attention unit that extracts sample correlation features by aggregating the sparsely distributed thin clouds and a squeeze excitation unit that extracts channel correlated features by differentiating their importance. In addition, a dense connection scheme is designed to exploit the multi-level fine-grained representations from the two types of extracted features and a recurrent refinement module is introduced for gradual enhancement of the predicted classification map. We also created a fully annotated cloud detection MODIS dataset that consists of 1192 training images, 80 validation images and 150 test images. Extensive experiments on Landsat8, SPARCS and MODIS datasets show that the proposed GCDB-UNet achieves superior cloud detection performance as compared with state-of-the-art methods. Our created MODIS cloud detection dataset is available at https://github.com/xiachangxue/MODIS-Dataset-for-Cloud-Detection.(c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Engineering of ultrasound contracts agents-focused cabazitaxel-loaded microbubbles nanomaterials induces cell proliferation and enhancing apoptosis in cancer cells
T2  - APPLIED NANOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tumour-induced sentinel lymph node diagnosis and metastatic therapeutic techniques are limited by current strategies nowadays. Herein, we combined iron oxide nanomaterials with chemotherapy drugs in poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) multifunctional microbubbles (MMBs) to develop and visualize tumour lymph node treatment. Fabrication and loading of perfluorocarbon gas-filled PLGA microbubbles with co-encapsulated cabazitaxel (CTX) and Fe3O4 nanomaterials were accomplished. Ultrasound (US) imaging enhancement and US-induced drug delivery have been investigated in vitro and in vivo to improve the outcomes. The MMBs had a mean size of 881.45 +/- 70.19 nm, with a narrow size dispersion and a smooth surface. It was also shown that the amount of Fe3O4 nanomaterials in the MBs did not affect the CTX drug loading efficiency or encapsulation. Our outcomes showed that these MMBs could improve ultrasound imaging in vitro and in vivo and improve tumour lymph node signals. Biomarkers of tumour proliferation profile and micro blood/lymphatic vessel density were used to assess the anti-tumour efficacy of MMBs-mediated chemotherapy in vivo. These markers were consistently lower after MMBs + sonication treatment than controls. The tumour cell apoptosis index was shown to be highest following MMBs plus sonication treatment, which is in line with this finding. A cabazitaxel-loaded PLGA-Fe3O4 nanomaterials therapeutic and diagnostic agent for low-frequency US-triggered US imaging of the lymph node metastasis has been developed successfully. It may provide an approach for the chemotherapy and imaging of primary metastasis tumours.

TI  - Assessment and calibration of FY-4A AGRI total precipitable water products based on CMONOC
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - FengYun 4A (FY-4A) is the first flight unit of the second-generation geostationary meteorological satellite in China (FengYun 4 series, FY-4 series). The Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI) onboard it can provide high spatial resolution precipitable water vapor (PWV) products. This study used Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) observations from 230 ground-based GNSS stations within the Crustal Movement Observation Network of China (CMONOC) from March 1, 2019 to February 29, 2020 to obtain PWV, also called total precipitable water (TPW). The Chinese mainland was divided into 13 regions based on climate classifica-tion, latitude, and altitude, and GNSS PWV was used to verify the FY-4A AGRI TPW and make calibrations when necessary. The results reveal that the accuracy of FY-4A AGRI TPW shows significant spatial and temporal dif-ferences in mainland China. Overall, FY-4A AGRI TPW and GNSS PWV are strongly positively correlated over China, and the correlation coefficients (R) between the two PWV products are highest in autumn (0.78-0.972) while lowest in winter (0.556-0.956). FY-4A AGRI TPW is underestimated in most regions, and the mean bias (MB) values are higher in regions with high PWV content. The root means square error (RMSE) of FY-4A AGRI TPW in all regions are highest in summer (3.34-9.05 mm) and lowest in winter (0.87-3.83 mm). The accuracy of FY-4A AGRI TPW exhibits significant regional and seasonal differences, with higher R, RMSE, and MB in wet seasons and regions, while lower R, RMSE, and MB in dry seasons and regions. This study constructed the calibration model of FY-4A AGRI TPW was based on GNSS PWV in 13 regions. After calibration, the RMSEs can be reduced by 6.6% -32.1%, 5.1% -45%, 5.7% -31.6%, and 7.1% -30.8% in four seasons, respectively, and the MB mainly fluctuates around 0. The accuracy of generated FY-4A AGRI TPW is further improved on the basis of the high resolution.

TI  - Warming, increase in precipitation, and irrigation enhance greening in High Mountain Asia
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Greening in high mountain Asia between 2003 and 2020 was driven by warming at high elevations, increased precipitation in forested regions and enhanced irrigation in croplands, according to a multivariate analysis of remote sensing data.High-Mountain Asia exhibits one of the highest increases in vegetation greenness on Earth, subsequently influencing the exchange of water and energy between the land surface and the atmosphere. Given the strong interactions between the hydrosphere, the biosphere, and the cryosphere, understanding the drivers of greening in this highly complex region with significant land cover heterogeneity is essential to assess the changes in the regional water budget. Here, we perform a holistic multivariate remote sensing analysis to simultaneously examine the primary components of the terrestrial water cycle from 2003 to 2020 and decipher the principal drivers of greening in High-Mountain Asia. We identified three drivers of greening: (1) precipitation drives greening in mid and low elevation areas covered by evergreen and mixed forests (e.g., Irrawaddy basin), (2) decreases in snow enhance greening in most of the hydrologic basins, and (3) irrigation induces greening in irrigated lands (Ganges-Brahmaputra and Indus).

TI  - Remote sensing for natural disaster recovery: Lessons learned from Hurricanes Irma and Maria in Puerto Rico
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - In September 2017, Hurricanes Irma and Maria devastated the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Following these hurricanes, comprehensive and timely data collection was, and continues to be, required to assess both the severity of damage across Puerto Rico and to inform recovery and mitigation strategies. In this manuscript, we present how remote sensing data was incorporated into this assessment and planning process, focusing on the applications for Puerto Rico's natural resources in the months following the hurricanes. We first describe how different types of satellite and airborne remote sensing data, along with existing and newly developed data processing methodologies, were applied to the damage assessment and recovery planning process for three natural resource applications: terrestrial forests, landslides, and coastal systems. We show that while remote sensing data offered a critical first assessment of the damage caused by the hurricanes, it was not always easily integrated into the recovery planning process and the variable timelines required by decisionmakers. Remote sensing data remains a powerful, if sometimes underutilized, tool in immediate and long-term disaster recovery efforts, and we conclude by suggesting future areas for improvement to facilitate the integration into natural disaster planning, assessment, and response.

T2  - AUSTRALASIAN PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective This study aims to describe the trends in community incidence, community prevalence, mortality, overnight hospital admission rates and average overnight inpatient length of stay (ALOS) for anorexia nervosa (AN) amongst young females aged 15-29 in Australia, between 1998-2018. Methods Hospitalisation and ALOS data was obtained from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare principal data cubes. Epidemiological data relating to community-level incidence, community-level prevalence, disability adjusted life years (DALY) and mortality were obtained from the Global Health Data Exchange. We analysed the community and hospital rates for AN in 3 female age groups, 15-19, 20-24 and 25-29. Results Overnight hospital female admission rates for AN have substantially increased over the past two decades, with a higher rate increase between 2008-2018 for 15-29 age groups. The largest absolute increases were seen in the 15-19 female age group. Community prevalence and DALYs increased slightly, whilst community incidence has remained relatively stable. During the study period, mortality rates and the average hospital inpatient length of stay for AN declined for females 15-29 years. Conclusion Overnight hospitalisation rates for AN particularly increased amongst young females (15-29) in Australia over the past decade. Less substantial increases in community incidence, community prevalence and DALYs, and declining mortality were also observed.

TI  - A prediction model for early systemic recurrence in breast cancer using a molecular diagnostic analysis of sentinel lymph nodes: A large-scale, multicenter cohort study
T2  - CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) assay can quantify the cytokeratin 19 messenger RNA copy number as a proxy for sentinel lymph node (SN) metastasis in breast cancer. A large-scale, multicenter cohort study was performed to determine the prognostic value of the SN tumor burden based on a molecular readout and to establish a model for the prediction of early systemic recurrence in patients using the OSNA assay. Methods SN biopsies from 4757 patients with breast cancer were analyzed with the OSNA assay. The patients were randomly assigned to the training or validation cohort at a ratio of 2:1. On the basis of the training cohort, the threshold SN tumor burden value for stratifying distant recurrence was determined with Youden's index; predictors of distant recurrence were investigated via multivariable analyses. Based on the selected predictors, a model for estimating 5-year distant recurrence-free survival was constructed, and predictive performance was measured with the validation cohort. Results The prognostic cutoff value for the SN tumor burden was 1100 copies/mu L. The following variables were significantly associated with distant recurrence and were used to construct the prediction model: SN tumor burden, age, pT classification, grade, progesterone receptor, adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy, and adjuvant anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 therapy. The values for the area under the curve, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the prediction model were 0.83, 63.4%, 81.7%, and 81.1%, respectively. Conclusions Using the OSNA assay, the molecular readout-based SN tumor burden is an independent prognostic factor for early breast cancer. This model accurately predicts early systemic recurrence and may facilitate decision-making related to treatment.

TI  - Ovarian microcystic stromal tumour: from morphological observations to syndromic associations
T2  - HISTOPATHOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Microcystic stromal tumour (MST) is a rare, usually benign, ovarian neoplasm characterized morphologically in its classic form by a distinctive triad of features comprising microcysts, solid cellular regions and fibrous stroma. Variant morphology also occurs, including the presence of nests, tubules, cords and signet ring cells. Immunohistochemically, this neoplasm is characterized by diffuse nuclear expression of beta-catenin, cyclin D1, Wilms' tumour 1 (WT1) and steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1), as well as diffuse staining with forkhead box ligand 2 (FoxL2) and CD10. Inhibin and calretinin are typically negative. At the genomic level, these neoplasms harbour mutually exclusive mutations in CTNNB1 or APC genes, with the former being significantly more common. This molecular characteristic raises possible links to other rare ovarian lesions, including solid pseudopapillary tumour, signet-ring stromal tumour and Sertoli cell tumour. Rarely, MST is an extracolonic manifestation of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and serves as a sentinel event that could trigger the identification of the syndrome. Herein, we review the published literature on ovarian MST and provide practical advice for pathologists reporting these rare neoplasms.

TI  - Hospitalist Co-Management of a Vascular Surgery Service Improves Quality Outcomes and Reduces Cost
T2  - ANNALS OF VASCULAR SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Hospitalists can be instrumental in management of inpatients with multiple comorbidities requiring complex medical care such as vascular surgery patients, as well as an expertise in health care delivery. We instituted a unique hospitalist co-management program and assessed length of stay, 30-day readmission rates and mortality, and performed an overall cost-analysis.Methods: Hospitalist co-management of vascular surgery inpatients was implemented beginning April 2019, and data was studied until March 2020. We compared this data to an eight-month period prior to implementing co-management (7/2018 - 3/2019). Patient-related outcomes that were assessed include length of stay, re-admission index, mortality index, case-mix index. Cost-analysis was performed to look at indirect and direct cost of care.Results: A total of 1,062 patients were included in the study 520 pre co-management and 542 patients were post-comanagement. Baseline case-mix index was 2.47, and post-comanagement was 2.46 (P >0.05). In terms of average length of stay (aLOS), the baseline aLOS was 5.16 days per patient, while after co-management it was significantly decreased by 1.25 days to 3.91 days (P <0.05). This improvement in length of stay opened an average of 2.4 telemetry beds per day. Similarly, excess days per patient which reflects the expected length of stay based on comorbidities, improved from -0.59 to -1.65, an improvement of -1.46.Conclusions: Hospitalist co-management improves outcomes for vascular surgery inpatients, decreases length of stay, re-admission and mortality while providing a significant cost-savings. The overall average variable direct cost decreased by $1,732 per patient.

TI  - MRI-Based Radiomics Nomogram: Prediction of Axillary Non-Sentinel Lymph Node Metastasis in Patients With Sentinel Lymph Node-Positive Breast Cancer
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundOvertreatment of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) may occur in patients with axillary positive sentinel lymph node (SLN) but negative non-SLN (NSLN). Developing a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based radiomics nomogram to predict axillary NSLN metastasis in patients with SLN-positive breast cancer could effectively decrease the probability of overtreatment and optimize a personalized axillary surgical strategy. MethodsThis retrospective study included 285 patients with positive SLN breast cancer. Fifty five of them had metastatic NSLNs and 230 had non-metastatic NSLNs. MRI-based radiomic features of primary tumors were extracted and MRI morphologic findings of the primary tumor and axillary lymph nodes were assessed. Four models, namely, a radiomics signature, an MRI-clinical nomogram, and two MRI-clinical-radiomics nomograms were established based on MRI morphologic findings, clinicopathologic characteristics, and MRI-based radiomic features to predict the NSLN status. The optimal predictors in each model were selected using the 5-fold cross-validation (CV) method. Their predictive performances were determined by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves analysis. The area under the curves (AUCs) of different models was compared by the Delong test. Their discrimination capability, calibration curve, and clinical usefulness were also assessed. ResultsThe 5-fold CV analysis showed that the AUCs ranged from 0.770 to 0.847 for the radiomics signature, from 0.720 to 0.824 for the MRI-clinical nomogram, from 0.843 to 0.932 for the MRI-clinical-radiomics nomogram. The optimal predictive factors in the radiomics signature, MRI-clinical nomogram, and MRI-clinical-radiomics nomogram were one texture feature of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), two clinicopathologic features together with one MRI morphologic finding, and the DWI-based texture feature together with the two clinicopathologic features plus the one MRI morphologic finding, respectively. The MRI-clinical-radiomics nomogram with CA 15-3 included achieved the highest AUC compared with the radiomics signature (0.868 vs. 0.806, P <0.001) and MRI-clinical nomogram (0.868 vs. 0.761; P <0.001). In addition, the MRI-clinical-radiomics nomogram without CA 15-3 showed a higher performance than that of the radiomics signature (AUC, 0.852 vs. 0.806, P = 0.016) and the MRI-clinical nomogram (AUC, 0.852 vs. 0.761, P = 0.007). The MRI-clinical-radiomics nomograms showed good discrimination and good calibration. Decision curve analysis demonstrated that the MRI-clinical-radiomics nomograms were clinically useful. ConclusionThe MRI-clinical-radiomics nomograms developed in our study showed high predictive performance, which can be used to predict the axillary NSLN status in SLN-positive breast cancer patients before surgery.

TI  - Reconstruction of extreme flood events by performing integrated real-time and probabilistic flood modeling in the Periyar river basin, Southern India
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The main purpose of this study is to mitigate the flood impact which may be caused by uncertain future extreme high rainfall-runoff events. To accomplish the objective, an integrated hydrologic-hydrodynamic flood modeling has been performed in the Periyar river basin by utilizing the HEC-RTS framework including reservoir simulation, optimization and calibration of modeling parameters. For the reconstruction of historical floods, seven historical extreme high rainfall-runoff events have been identified (2002 to 2018) and the event-based flood modeling and continuous flood modeling were performed. Simulated floods showed a good agreement with reference to observed floods (at Neeleswaram gauge) (where R-2 is recorded as 0.80 and 0.67 for flood event 2018 and continuous simulation, respectively). The historical flood event (i.e., July-August 2018) was reconstructed using HEC-RESSIM and the operating rules were modified for Mullaperiyar and Idukki reservoirs. The regulated flood flows were generated for all seven historical extreme events utilizing the daily meteorological time series datasets. The flood frequency analysis (FFA) has been performed to generate the return period floods and probabilistic flood maps. For hydrodynamic flood simulation, one-dimensional (1D) flood routing was performed in the downstream sections. For the accuracy assessment, the computed flood inundation area and depths were compared with the existing reference datasets like (i) Central Water Commission (CWC) flood data, (ii) real-time flood inundation captured in Sentinel satellite data and (iii) flood maps prepared by DARTMOUTH Flood Agency USA, which showed a reliable agreement.

TI  - Study the Effect of MRF Model on Fuzzy c Means Classifiers with Different Parameters and Distance Measures
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Image classification used to organize pixels of an image into specific land-cover classes. There are various algorithms for classifying images. Fuzzy c-Means (FCM) is one of the essential fuzzy classifiers, but it does not consider the neighborhood pixel information. In this paper, the MRF model is applied in the FCM classifier to enhance the output of image classification. FCM classifier with MRF Model (DA(H1), DA(H2), DA(H3), DA(H4), and SP) has been studied with different distance measures and parameters to identify which parameter combination provides the best result. This best algorithm was identified by classifying the Dense Forest, Eucalyptus, Riverine sand, Water, Wheat, and Grassland classes applying the multispectral image of Landsat-8 and Formosat-2 of the Haridwar area. These classified image's Overall Accuracy (OA) are calculated using the FERM (Fuzzy Error Matrix) technique. It was observed that Mean Absolute Difference distance measures at m = 1.1, lambda = 0.9, and gamma = 0.5 for DA (H1) using the base FCM classifier yield the highest overall accuracy (82.06%) irrespective of the classifier.

TI  - Phenological Changes in Alpine Grasslands and Their Influencing Factors in Seasonally Frozen Ground Regions Across the Three Parallel Rivers Region, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Alpine ecosystems are sensitive and vulnerable to climate change. In this study, we extracted three phonological parameters, viz. the start of the growing season (SOS), the end of the growing season (EOS), and the length of the growing season (LOS) from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) dataset during 2000-2019 for alpine grasslands across the three parallel rivers region (TPRR), and also examined the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the three phenological parameters in seasonally frozen ground regions (hereafter referred to as SFGR) in response to climate change. The results showed that the multiyear mean SOS gradually delayed from 100 to 160 days along higher elevation, EOS advanced as a whole (from 320 to 280 days), and LOS shortened (from 210 to 130 days). The multiyear mean spatial distribution of all the three parameters showed significant north-to-south differences in the TPRR. In general, the variation trends in all the phenological parameters were not significant (p > 0.05) in the past 20 years, where SOS was advanced by 0.16 days year(-l), EOS delayed by 0.08 days year(-l), and consequently LOS extended at a rate of 0.07 days year(-l), likely due to the warming and drying climate during the study period. In addition, annual mean temperature (AMT) was negatively correlated with SOS (50.26%) and positively correlated with EOS and LOS (72.25 and 60%, respectively). As for the annual mean total precipitation (AMP), it was positively correlated with SOS and EOS (50.77 and 52.97%, respectively) and negatively correlated with LOS (52.07%). Furthermore, a higher freezing index led to a delayed SOS and an advanced EOS and a shortened LOS at the regional scale. Similar to AMT, a higher thawing index advanced the SOS, delayed the EOS, and extended the LOS. Our results confirmed the importance of climate and permafrost status on vegetation phenological processes and also contributed toward understanding the response of cold region ecosystems to global climate change.

TI  - Identifying urban ventilation corridors through quantitative analysis of ventilation potential and wind characteristics
T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban heat islands (UHIs) are mainly caused by mismanaged urban development. Urban ventilation corridors (UVCs) can effectively reduce UHIs. Hangzhou, a large, dense city in eastern China, is one of the nation's hottest cities and must urgently improve its ventilation. In this study, a newly developed method combining land surface temperature retrieval, GIS spatial analysis, and weather data was employed to design city-level UVCs. The functional space and compensation space of UVCs are identified based on the LandsatETM8 image data inversion of surface temperature. The contribution of affect factors, such as building density, building height, green land area, waterbody, roads, and urban terrain, to the urban ventilation potential is calculated using AHP and GIS. Areas with tremendous ventilation potential were identified as possible ventilation corridors by using an evaluation model and considering wind characteristics. Fifty-four high-temperature zones and 48 low-temperature zones were identified as functional and compensative spaces in Hangzhou, respectively. On the urban scale, green space (area >500ha), water bodies (area >300ha or width >100 m), and roads (width >50 m) were considered to be the factors that have the greatest impact on urban ventilation potential. The LCP method was used to verify the accuracy and rationality of the method proposed in this study to determine the city-scale UVC. UVC planning schemes and construction measures were proposed to provide rich information and a reference basis for the new general land and space planning of Hangzhou. However, to improve the accuracy of the potential ventilation results, the urban underlying surface criteria should be re-evaluated more comprehensively.

TI  - Severe Lake Heatwaves Attributable to Human-Induced Global Warming
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Much of the focus of global warming impacts on lakes have focused on changes in mean temperature. However, lakes are also highly vulnerable to thermal extremes. Such extremes occur, by definition, during lake heatwaves. Heatwaves in lakes have occurred globally in recent decades and have had severe negative impacts. However, unlike their atmospheric counterparts, it is currently unknown to what extent lake heatwaves are altered by human-induced climate change. Here, we estimate the human contribution to lake heatwaves, specifically focusing on the most severe events. We demonstrate that the occurrence probabilities of severe lake heatwaves increase substantially due to human influence. Our analysis suggests that 94% of severe heatwaves observed during the satellite data-taking period have an anthropogenic contribution. Globally, we suggest that severe heatwaves are 3 and 25- times more likely in a 1.5 degrees C and 3.5 degrees C warmer world, respectively, compared to a world without anthropogenic influence.Plain Language Summary Lake heatwaves are occurring globally with severe negative impacts on lake ecosystems. However, it is currently unclear whether, and by how much, human-induced global warming contributes to their occurrence. Here, we show that the occurrence probabilities of some of the most severe lake heatwaves observed are extremely sensitive to human influence. We estimated that 94% of severe heatwaves observed in recent decades have an anthropogenic contribution. Globally, severe heatwaves are 3 times more likely in a 1.5 degrees C warmer world and 25 times more likely in a 3.5 degrees C warmer world, compared to a world without anthropogenic warming. To prevent lake ecosystems being adversely affected by the projected increased occurrence of severe heatwaves, ambitious climate targets are of paramount importance.

TI  - Verification Control Algorithm of Data Integrity Verification in Remote Data sharing
T2  - KSII TRANSACTIONS ON INTERNET AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud storage's elastic expansibility not only provides flexible services for data owners to store their data remotely, but also reduces storage operation and management costs of their data sharing. The data outsourced remotely in the storage space of cloud service provider also brings data security concerns about data integrity. Data integrity verification has become an important technology for detecting the integrity of remote shared data. However, users without data access rights to verify the data integrity will cause unnecessary overhead to data owner and cloud service provider. Especially malicious users who constantly launch data integrity verification will greatly waste service resources. Since data owner is a consumer purchasing cloud services, he needs to bear both the cost of data storage and that of data verification. This paper proposes a verification control algorithm in data integrity verification for remotely outsourced data. It designs an attribute-based encryption verification control algorithm for multiple verifiers. Moreover, data owner and cloud service provider construct a common access structure together and generate a verification sentinel to verify the authority of verifiers according to the access structure. Finally, since cloud service provider cannot know the access structure and the sentry generation operation, it can only authenticate verifiers with satisfying access policy to verify the data integrity for the corresponding outsourced data. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves fine-grained access control to multiple verifiers for the data integrity verification.

TI  - Fluorescence Imaging Using Methylene Blue Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Melanoma
T2  - SURGICAL INNOVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Fluorescence imaging of sentinel node biopsy in melanoma is a novel method. Both indocyanine green (ICG) and methylene blue (MB) have fluorescent properties. The aim of this study was to present, for the first time in a clinical series of patients, the possible usage of MB as a fluorescent dye for sentinel node biopsy during surgery for melanoma. Material and methods Twenty patients with skin melanoma, who were candidates for sentinel node biopsy were enrolled in our study. All patients underwent simultaneous use of standard nanocolloid and blue dye. Transcutaneous visualization of the sentinel node, visualization of lymphatic channels as well as sentinel node fluorescent visualization were all measured. We also performed calculations of Signal to Background ratios (SBR). Results In 15% (3/20) of patients, the fluorescent sentinel node was visible through the skin. The median SBR for the sentinel node visualization by fluorescence was 3.15 (range, 2.7-3.5). Lymphatic channels were visible in lymphatic tissue via fluorescence before visualization by the naked eye in 4 patients (20%). The median SBR ratio was 3.69 (range, 2.7-4.2). Sentinel nodes were visible by fluorescence in 13 cases (65%). The median SBR ratio was 2.49 (range, 1.5-5.7). No factors were found to be associated with fluorescent MB visualization of a sentinel node during biopsy. Conclusion This is the first clinical study presenting the usefulness of fluorescent sentinel node biopsy in melanoma patients using MB as a fluorophore. Further studies are necessary to provide methods for its' clinical implementation.

TI  - A simple method for algal species discrimination in East China Sea, using multiple satellite imagery
T2  - GEOSCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellites can help monitor harmful algal blooms in coastal regions. Methods have been developed using different satellite missions. However, it is necessary to develop a simple and useful method for discriminating harmful algal species that could be applied to multi-source satellite remote sensing reflectance spectra (R-rs(lambda)). In this study, based on the bio-optical model, a backscattering indicator, b(bp-index) (green), was found to be useful for species identification (Karenia mikimotoi and Prorocentrum donghaiense) combined with the red tide index (RI) in water blooms in the East China Sea (ECS). The MODIS, GOCI, and MERIS data collected between 2004 and 2020 were consistent for bloom discrimination, determining that K. mikimotoi exhibited lower b(bp-index) (green) values than P. donghaiense. The classification of the blooms is based on the following criteria: R-rs(555) < 0.014-sr(-1) and RI > 2.8 and (1) b(bp-index) (green) > 1.2 x10(-3), classified as P. donghaiense blooms or (2) b(bp-index) (green) < 1.2 x10(-3), classified as K. mikimotoi blooms. The inclusion of the RI is necessary to directly detect the bloom area. Local bloom reports have confirmed the effectiveness of the bloom discrimination method. In addition, the advantages and limitations of the proposed method are discussed.

TI  - Forest water use is increasingly decoupled from water availability even during severe drought
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context Key to understanding forest water balances is the role of tree species regulating evapotranspiration (ET), but the synergistic impact of forest species composition, topography, and water availability on ET and how this shapes drought sensitivity across the landscape remains unclear. Objectives Our aims were to quantify (1) the effect of forest composition and topography including elevation and hillslope gradients on the relationship between ET and water availability, and (2) whether the relationship has changed over time. Methods We used remotely sensed Landsat and MODIS ET to quantify forest ET across the Blue Ridge ecoregion of the southeastern USA. Then quantified metrics describing ET responses to water availability and trends in responses over time and assessed how these metrics varied across elevation, hillslope, and forest composition gradients. Results We demonstrated forest ET is becoming less constrained by water availability at the expense of lateral flow. Drought impacts on ET diverged along elevation and hillslope gradients, and that divergence was more pronounced with increasingly severe drought, indicating high elevation and drier, upslope regions tend to maintain ET rates even during extreme drought. We identified a decoupling of ET from water availability over time, and found this process was accelerated at higher elevations and in areas with more diffuse-porous trees. Conclusions Given the large proportion of forests on the landscape distributed across high elevation and upslope positions, reductions in downslope water availability could be widespread, amplifying vulnerability of runoff, the health of downslope vegetation, and aquatic biodiversity.

TI  - Enhancing the Quality and Quantity of Date Palm (<i>Phoenix Dactylifera</i>) by Micronutrients under Calcareous Soils with a High pH Level
T2  - JOURNAL OF NATURAL FIBERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Date palm is an important fruit for many human populations, especially in arid and semiarid regions. In addition, the fibers of the plant have the capability to remove various pollutants such as dyes, heavy metal ions, and phosphates. In the present study, micronutrients were used for enhancing various features pertaining to qualitative and quantitative aspects in date plants under the aforementioned soil. Six micronutrient levels were used as treatments, i.e. control (without micronutrients), zinc sulfate (ZnSO4), copper sulfate (CuSO4), sulfur (S), manganese sulfate (MnSO4), and iron chelate (Fe). According to the results of the combined analysis, the effects of micronutrients were significant on fruit yield (FY), 10 seeds mass (TSM), fruit diameter (FD), fruit length (FL), seed diameter (SD), and sucrose (P < .05). The results demonstrated that iron (Fe) significantly enhanced the FY, FD, FL, TSM in comparison with the control. Based on the cluster analysis, the Fe treatment separated from the other treatments, indicating the extent of difference that this treatment had on the plants in comparison with other treatments. Finally, the results suggested that the application of Fe could improve several features of date palm fruits, especially the FY in the said soils.

AB  - Ship-track-like polluted cloud tracks provide a direct way to study aerosol-cloud interactions. Here, we study environmental conditions favorable for pollution tracks' formation. We study polluted cloud tracks forming downwind of localized anthropogenic air pollution hot spots of Norilsk and Cherepovets in Russia and Thompson in Canada. Polluted cloud tracks form on 20%-37% of days with liquid-phase clouds. The large-scale atmospheric circulation largely determines the occurrence of track-favoring conditions. Tracks tend to form in clean and thin clouds under stable and dry conditions that are more often associated with anticyclonic large-scale flow in the studied locations.Plain Language Summary Tiny solid and liquid air pollution particles called aerosols offset an unknown fraction of the greenhouse gas warming. Here, we study under which conditions aerosols have strong impacts on clouds leading to a cooling effect on Earth's climate. We study clouds downwind of anthropogenic air pollution hot spots. We compare the conditions where air pollution changes the properties of clouds to the conditions where the influence of air pollution is not seen. Anthropogenic air pollution particles more readily lead to changes in the properties of clean and thin clouds under stable and dry conditions that are more often associated with anticyclonic large-scale airflow in the studied locations. Our results help reduce the uncertainty related to the anthropogenic aerosol impacts on clouds and Earth's climate.

M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionMale breast cancer is uncommon and managed on the guidelines of female breast cancer due to tumor rarity. We sought to identify the incidence, clinicopathological features, and survival of all male breast cancer patients managed in our hospital.MethodsA retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted at Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH), Karachi, Pakistan, from January 1986 to December 2018. Demographic data, treatment records, and follow-up data of all male breast cancer patients who were treated at AKUH was reviewed.ResultsThirty-eight out of 42 patients who presented over a period of 32 years were included. The mean age was 63 years. The most common tumor type and subtype were invasive ductal carcinoma (89.5%) and luminal A (73.7%), respectively. The majority (36.8%) of the patients presented at stage III. Among 30 (78.9%) patients who underwent surgery, mastectomy was performed in 30 (78.9%), upfront axillary clearance in 24 (63.2%), axillary sampling in five (15.1%) cases, and sentinel lymph node biopsy in one (2.6%) case. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was given to 10 (26.3%) patients, and adjuvant chemotherapy to eight (21.1%) patients. Adjuvant hormonal treatment was administered to 22 (57.9%) patients, and 13 (34%) patients received adjuvant radiation to the chest wall. The five-year overall survival was 38.2% and the median survival was 36 months. The five-year disease-free survival (DFS) was found to be 33.7%.ConclusionBreast cancer in males presents at an advanced stage with poor survival. Multicenter studies are required to accurately identify incidence, prognostic factors, and outcomes in order to have a better understanding of its management.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variations and underlying mechanism of the floodplain wetlands in the meandering Yellow River in arid and semi-arid regions
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Floodplain wetlands in the arid and semi-arid regions are highly threatened by complex changing environments. In order to better understand the response of wetland landscape patterns to floodplain hydro-geomorphology and landuse changes in drylands, this study aims to explore the spatiotemporal variation and underlying mechanisms of the floodplain wetland landscape patterns of the Yellow River in the arid and semi-arid region during 1973-2014. Based on the time-series Landsat observations, land use and hydrological data, the directional distribution, connectivity indicators, as well as univariate and multivariate linear regressions were used to analyze the trends and variations of wetland landscape pattern changes and their relationship with floodplain hydro-geomorphology and land use changes. Our results showed that the floodplain wetlands became more fragmented during 1973-2014, characterized by a decrease (6756 ha) in the total wetland patch area and an increase (353) in the number of patches. The center point of the wetlands in the whole study area migrated from the southwestern to northeastern part (0.8 km in the east direction and 1.7 km in the north direction). The greatest migration of the center point of wetlands occurred during the combined operation of the Longliu reservoirs, indicating that the decreasing frequency of large floods and unstable channel resulted in the fragmentation and migration of the overall wetlands. In addition, the operation of dam augmented the influence of hydro-geomorphology on the wetlands. Ice flooding benefed the formation of new wetlands and accelerated the migration of the overall wetlands. Land use changes due to the practice of various protection policies did not pose impact on the spatiotemporal changes of wetlands. Thus, a better understanding of the wetland landscape pattern changes in unstable floodplains requires considering both the floodplain hydro-geomorphology and land use changes, which is supportive to sustainable river floodplain management.

TI  - Ammonium nitrate explosion at the main port in Beirut (Lebanon) and air pollution: an analysis of the spatiotemporal distribution of nitrogen dioxide
T2  - EURO-MEDITERRANEAN JOURNAL FOR ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRATION
M3  - Article
AB  - An explosion of the ammonium nitrate (AN) stored at Beirut Port devastated the city on Tuesday 4 August 2020. Such an explosion produces pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx). The most common NOx is nitrogen dioxide (NO2), which is present in the atmosphere due to natural and anthropogenic processes. The presence of NO2 is used as indicator of air pollution. However, the specific contribution of NO2 to air quality is uncertain due to the presence of other constituents, especially particulate matter (PM10). Research has shown that extended exposure to NO2 may result in serious health effects. This study investigated the impact of the explosion on NO2 levels in the atmosphere above Beirut and the surrounding area. NO2 data from the Sentinel-5P program were used to map the levels of NO2. Furthermore, ground-monitoring data were used to assess the levels of PM10 and ozone (O-3) due to the evident association between these constituents and NO2. Results showed that NO2 levels were higher than before the blast. However, 7 days after the explosion, NO2 levels had returned to normal, while the levels of PM10 and O-3 remained normal following the explosion. However, a slight increase in the daily average atmospheric pressure was noticed after the explosion, which was attributed to the decomposition of ammonium nitrate.

TI  - Diagnostic accuracy of sentinel node biopsy in non-endometrioid, high-grade and/or deep myoinvasive endometrial cancer: A Turkish gynecologic oncology group study (TRSGO-SLN-006)
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping algorithm in high-risk endometrial cancer patients.Methods. Two hundred forty-four patients with non-endometrioid histology, grade 3 endometrioid tumors and/or tumors with deep myometrial invasion were enrolled in this retrospective, multicentric study. After removal of SLNs, all patients underwent pelvic +/- paraaortic lymphadenectomy. Operations were performed via laparotomy, laparoscopy or robotic surgery. Indocyanine green (ICG) and methylene blue (MB) were used as tracers. SLN detection rate, sensitivity, negative predictive value (NPV) and false-negative rate (FNR) were calculated.Results. Surgeries were performed via laparotomy in 132 (54.1%) patients and 152 (62.3%) underwent both bilateral pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy. At least 1 SLN was detected in 222 (91%) patients. Fifty-five (225%) patients had lymphatic metastasis and 45 patients had at least 1 metastatic SLN. Lymphatic metastases were detected by side-specific lymphadenectomy in 8 patients and 2 patients had isolated paraaortic metastasis. Overall sensitivity, NPV and FNR of SLN biopsy were 81.8%, 95% and 182%, respectively. By applying SLN algorithm steps, sensitivity and NPV improved to 96.4% and 98.9%, respectively. For grade 3 tumors, sensitivity, NPV and FNR of the SLN algorithm were 97.1%, 98.9% and 2.9%.Conclusion. SLN algorithm had high diagnostic accuracy in high-risk endometrial cancer. All pelvic metastases were detected by the SLN algorithm and the isolated paraaortic metastasis rate was ignorable. But long-term survival studies are necessary before this approach becomes standard of care. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Population-level trends and outcomes of sentinel lymph node biopsy in vulvar cancer surgery in the United States
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. To examine population-level trends, characteristics, and outcomes related to nodal assessment for vulvar cancer surgery in the United States.Methods. This is a retrospective cohort study querying the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program. The study population was 5604 women with T1 b or T2-smaller(<= 4 an) squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva who underwent primary vulvectomy from 2003 to 2018. The exposure allocation was based on nodal evaluation type: lymphadenectomy (LND; n = 3319, 59.2%), sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy Or 751, 13.4%), or no surgical nodal evaluation (n = 1534, 27.4%). The main outcomes were (i) trends and characteristics related to SLN biopsy assessed by multinomial regression model, and (ii) vulvar cancer-specific survival assessed by competing risk analysis and inverse probability of treatment weighting propensity score. Sensitivity analysis included evaluation of external cohort with T1a disease (n = 1291).Results. The utilization of SLN biopsy increased from 5.7% to 23.3% in 2006-2018, while the proportion of LND decreased from 64.1% to 48.8% in 2010-2018, and these associations remained independent in multivariable analysis (adjusted-P < 0.05). In the propensity score weighted model, 5-year cumulative rate for vulvar cancer-specific mortality was 152% (interquartile range 12.1-18.9) for the SLN biopsy group and 16.9% (interquartile range 15.6-18.3) for the LND group (subdistribution-hazard ratio 0.90, 95% confidence interval 0.76-1.06, P = 0217). The increasing SLN biopsy use was also observed in T1a disease from 1.3% to 7.3% during the study period (P < 0.001).Conclusion. The landscape of surgical nodal evaluation is shifting from lymphadenectomy to SLN biopsy in vulvar cancer surgery in the United States. SIN biopsy-incorporated treatment approach was not associated with worse survival compared to LND. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variation and provincial scale differences of the AOD across China during 2000-2021
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatiotemporal variation of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) over China was studied using MODIS data retrieved with the MAIAC algorithm. Time series were extended to July 2021. The study area is defined as the mainland of South-Eastern China Below the Hu line, with Hebei as the most northerly province (in short SECBH) and includes 16 provinces, 4 central government-controlled municipalities and one autonomous region, all referred to here as provinces. The extended time series and provincial-scale averaging of the AOD provide more detailed and new information on the spatiotemporal variation across the SECBH. Differences in temporal behaviour are observed between the north, central-south and south of the SEBCH. The AOD increased in southern China before it increased in the northern provinces. The AOD was high between 2006 and 2014, with strong interannual fluctuations in response to the emission reduction policy opposed by economic developments, and decreased significantly from 2013/2014, in response to the Clean Air Action Plan (2013-2017). However, during the period 2017-2020 the AOD stabilized and fluctuated within 10% of the average value for these years which was similar to, and in part of the study area lower than, the AOD in 2000. Exceptions are Guangxi, Guangdong, Jiangxi and part of Shandong, where the AOD in 2020 was slightly higher than in 2000. The extension of the AOD time series until July 2021 shows that earlier derived trends do not continue and the emission reduction policy needs to be extended to achieve the earlier air quality goals.

TI  - Spatio-temporal assessment of natural lakes in Turkey
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Even though some individual studies on natural lakes spread around Turkey over time have been conducted to analyze their preceding characteristics and to monitor their temporal changes, a nation-wide study was lacking. With this study, country-based classification of natural lakes >2000 ha was realized via the use of remote sensing technology and Google Earth Engine platform coupled with different intrinsic properties of the lakes like geographical location, altitude, water-type, intended use, depth. Following a general evaluation of the overall 27 selected lakes in the long- and short-term covering 35 years and 5 years, respectively, some individual lakes were screened representing different water types and more focus on their areal changes in the long- and short-term were analyzed. Landsat images were utilized for the long-term investigation on the areal changes and Sentinel-2 was used in the short-term analysis. The aim of individual inspection of some of the lakes was to put forth a guideline on investigating the cause-and-effect relationship of the areal variations over time/season and thus, to enlighten the decision-makers. Moreover, the long-term meteorological values of the nearest stations to two of the lakes that have been suffering from continuous loss in their surface areas over time were further inspected. As expected, 2(o)C temperature increase over 35 years has shown its alerting signs over the long-term inspection on both of the lakes.

TI  - Angular effect of algorithms for monitoring leaf nitrogen concentration of wheat using multi-angle remote sensing data
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC) is a key indicator of crops' growth status, and the timely and accurate large-scale area monitoring of LNC is crucial for guiding field management. Here, we collected LNC data and hyperspectral data at the canopy scale, from 13 view zenith angles (VZAs) and two locations (Zhengzhou and Shangshui, in China) across 2 years (2012-2014). Four data processing methods-vegetation indices (VIs), back-propagation neural network (BPNN), eXtreme gradient boost (XGBoost), and partial least squares regression (PLSR)-were applied and compared for their ability to estimate LNC under 13 VZAs. These results revealed consistent trends in the performance of the four algorithms at 13 VZAs: the nadir direction is better than the extreme angle, and the best performance is obtained for the range of -30 degrees to 0 degrees (R-2 >= 0.83; RMSE <= 0.41%). The number of bands is a critical factor affecting the accuracy of LNC monitoring: including red edge bands can alleviate angular effect to some extent. The accuracy of PLSR for monitoring LNC is not only superior near the nadir direction (R-2 = 0.91), but also better than that provided VIs (16%-17%), BPNN (15%-16%), or XGBoost (29%-58%) at +/- 60 degrees. Therefore, it is strongly recommended the PLSR algorithm be used to process multi-angle remote sensing data to estimate the LNC of field crops. This work provides a timely reference basis for selecting the appropriate flight angle and the number and positioning of bands for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and satellite applications in the future.

AB  - The aquaculture expansion has made significant contributions to global food security, socio-economic development and, if implemented sustainably, can help preserve stable coastal environments. This study explicitly details the rapid expansion of large-scale aquaculture growth across the Kolleru and Upputeru regions of South India. We developed a novel classification method for automated extraction of aquaculture ponds in the Kolleru zone using the Canny Edge-Otsu algorithm to segment and extract the ponds applied to SAR-VV images in Google Earth Engine. This approach enables the area estimation of dense aquaculture ponds are essential for monitoring and management purposes. The results indicated that this method could effectively map the aquaculture ponds and the overall accuracy achieved in 2020 for the Kolleru and Upputeru areas by 90.6% and 95.7%, respectively. The aquaculture maps of this study can help government organizations, resource managers, stakeholders, and decision-makers understand the dynamics and plan sustainable measures in this area.

TI  - Extraction and analysis of surface lake flow direction in Poyang Lake based on texture enhancement and hough transform
T2  - WATER SUPPLY
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake flow is one of the common hydrological phenomena in nature. The water exchange of lakes and the circulation of natural water resources are realized by the water movement caused by various factors. Lake current is of great significance in the hydrological and ecological environment and it is one of the focuses of scholars' research. This paper takes Poyang Lake as the research area, and uses three texture enhancement methods of Laws, Gabor, and LBP operators to enhance the texture features of images based on multi-source remote sensing data, and uses the Hough transform to extract the flow direction of the Poyang Lake area. The results show that the three texture enhancement methods combined with Hough transform can extract the flow direction, but the Gabor filter has the best flow direction effect and the highest extraction accuracy. Gabor filter is the most adaptable for texture enhancement of images with different resolutions.

TI  - Nutritional Support and Duration of Drainage Recommendations for Endoscopic Internal Drainage: Review of the Literature and Initial Experience
T2  - OBESITY SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction Anastomotic leaks following foregut surgery pose a difficult scenario for surgeons. While definitive surgical options are more invasive and may result in diversion requiring subsequent surgeries, endoscopic management of these leaks has been shown to work as an alternative platform for management. An evolving option is endoscopic internal drainage. We have reviewed our experience using endoscopic internal drainage and report our outcomes.Materials and Methods An institution review board approved prospectively gathered database was used to identify all patients undergoing endoscopic internal drainage following esophageal and gastric leaks. Patient demographics, sentinel operation causing the leak, and outcomes of therapy were collected. The rate of healing and complications with the drainage catheter in place were the primary endpoints.Results Sixteen patients were identified (5 male, 11 female) that underwent endoscopic internal drainage with a mean age of 48 and mean BMI of 30.8. Overall success rate was 69% (11/16), where 4 patients required a definitive surgery, and one healed with endoluminal vacuum therapy. Of the 4 failures, 1 patient required esophagojejunostomy, 2 patients required a fistulojejunostomy, and one required a partial gastrectomy. A total of 12 patients (75%) had a prior endoscopic procedure that was unsuccessful. The mean duration of drainage catheter in place was 48 days. While the catheter was in place, 4 patients were allowed minimal PO intake in conjunction with total parenteral nutrition or tube feeds. The rest of the patients were strict NPO with other means of nutrition. There were no complications with the drainage catheters and no deaths.Conclusion Leaks following esophagogastric surgery are difficult to manage; however, endoscopic internal drainage has been shown to be effective. Duration of the technique should be around 6 to 8 weeks with nutritional support guided by the comfort of the managing clinician.

AB  - Context Regional conservation efforts should incorporate fine scale landscape genetic and habitat suitability data for management decisions. This information permits conservation measures to be tailored to a specific landscape. Objectives We investigated the landscape determinants of gene flow and habitat suitability for the state-threatened Blanding's turtle (Emydoidea blandingii) in northeastern New York (NNY). We applied the results from each to examine their complementary contributions to local connectivity and genetic structuring. Methods We conducted population and individual-based genetic analyses with microsatellite data to evaluate genetic structuring and landscape genetics in NNY. We coupled these genetic analyses with species distribution modeling (SDM) to estimate the extent of suitable habitat across this important region for species persistence in the state. Results Gene flow was strongly associated with open water and cultivated land, indicating the role open water channels play in connecting neighboring activity centers, and the propensity of females to select cultivated land to nest. Species distribution models based on Landsat-derived vegetation indices and percentage of scrub-shrub wetlands accurately identified Blanding's turtle habitat. Connectivity estimates from our NNY focal area using landscape genetic and SDM resistance surfaces showed potential movement constraints between the two genetic clusters. Conclusions Land cover better explained genetic distance data than geographic distance for Blanding's turtles in our focal area. Accurate SDMs were developed for our focal area with a small number of occurrences (< 50). Using both gene flow and habitat-informed resistance surfaces revealed localized connectivity constraints associated with each, permitting more comprehensive landscape planning.

TI  - Rock mass characterisation and distinct element modelling of a deep-seated rock slide influenced by glacier retreat
T2  - ENGINEERING GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The active deep-seated Marzellkamm rock slide is situated in the high mountainous region of Tyrol (Austria), which has been subjected to the most recent deglaciation since the Little Ice Age (LIA). This study presents the investigation of initial rock slide formation and deformation mechanisms with respect to the structural geological inventory and the recent glacier retreat of approximately 2.2 km in length and 160 m in thickness since 1893. An integrated approach comprising field-based rock mass characterisation, glacier reconstruction based on historical maps (1893-1949) and remote sensing data (1953-2017), multi-temporal morphological analysis (1971-2019), and 2D distinct element modelling was applied. We show that deformation features mapped on the surface are reproduced by numerical modelling, and that (i) rock slide formation and slab development originates along pre-existing fault zones, (ii) a sliding mechanism occurs along a predefined fully persistent, curved but non-circular basal shear zone, and (iii) meso-scale fractures (e.g. joints) have only a minor impact on rock slide formation. Glacier reconstruction and deformation analysis show that increased slope displacements are directly associated with accelerated deglaciation rates between 1893 and 2017. Stable slope conditions were obtained by modelling as long as half to one third of the lower slope was covered by glacier ice, i.e. before the 1969 glacier stage. Rock slide movement is assumed to have initiated during the basal shear zone formation from 1949 onwards. Triggered by the general sliding movement, shear displacement along pre-existing fault zones led to the formation of rock slide structures and the separation in individual slabs and blocks. Our study shows that detailed geological mapping and deformation monitoring in combination with numerical modelling techniques can create a promising rock slide model.

TI  - Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter for the CBERS-4 attitude and gyros bias estimation
T2  - ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter (RaoBPF) and the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) were applied in this work to attitude and gyros bias estimation using simulated orbit and attitude measurement data for CBERS-4 (China Brazil Earth Resources Satellite 4) recently in operation. CBERS-4 was launched in 2014, controlled and operated in shifts by China (Xi'an Control Center) and Brazil (Satellite Control Center). Its orbit is heliosynchronous with an inclination of 98.504 degrees, a semi-major axis of 7148.865 km, eccentricity 1.1x10(-3), crossing equador line at 10 h30 min in a descending direction with perigee frozen at 90 degrees, which establishes a commitment relationship between a satisfactory amount of solar irradiance, contrast between targets, and the presence of clouds. This configuration provides global coverage every 26 days. The real orbit and attitude measurements were provided by the Satellite Control Center of the National Institute for Space Research (CCS - INPE) from September 1st, 2015. The dynamic attitude model is described by quaternions. The available attitude sensors are two Digital Sun Sensors (DSS), two Infrared Earth Sensor (IRES) and a triad of mechanical gyroscopes. The two IRES give direct measurements of roll and pitch angles with a certain level of error. The two DSS are nonlinear functions of roll, pitch, and yaw attitude angles. The gyros furnish the angular measurements in the body frame reference system. Gyros provide direct incremental angles or angular velocities; however, they present several sources of error, and the drift is the most troublesome. Such drifts yield along time an accumulation of errors which must be accounted in the attitude determination process. The RaoBPF estimation method used to attitude and gyros bias estimation is a technique that exploits the state space structure in order to reduce the number of particles, decreasing the processing time, avoiding the computational effort common to the standard particle filter. The logical extension of the RaoBPF provides a more general model that can be divided into purely non-linear and conditionally linear-Gaussian aspects, which explores this structure, marginalizing the conditional linear parts and estimating them using exact fillers, such as the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). The results show that it is possible to achieve precision in determining attitudes within the prescribed requirements using the RaoBPF, with lower computational cost when compared to the standard particle filter and its branches, in addition to have competitive results such as the UKF.

TI  - SENTIREC - The sentinel node mapping in women with cervical cancer study - Patient-reported early lymphedema and its impact on quality of life
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. To evaluate patient-reported incidence and severity of early lymphedema and its impact on quality of life (QoL) after sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping only and after SLN and pelvic lymphadenectomy (PL) in women undergoing surgery for early-stage cervical cancer.Methods. In a national prospective multicenter study, we included women with early-stage cervical cancer from March 2017-January 2021 to undergo radical surgery including SLN mapping. Women with tumors >20 mm underwent completion PL. The incidence and severity of early lymphedema and its influence on QoL were evaluated using validated patient-reported outcome measures before surgery and three months postoperative. We investigated changes over time using linear regression.Results. Two hundred of 245 (81.6%) included women completed questionnaires at baseline and three months postoperatively. The incidence of early lymphedema was 5.6% (95% CI 2.1-11.8%) and 32.3% (95% CI 22.9-42.7%) in women who underwent SLN mapping only and SUN + PL, respectively. Lymphedema symptoms in the legs, genitals, and groins increased in both groups postoperatively but three times more in women who underwent PL. Lymphedema symptoms after SLN + PL significantly impaired physical performance (p = 0.001) and appearance (p = 0.007). Reporting lymphedema was significantly associated with impaired body image, physical-, role-, and social functioning, and a high level of fatigue.Conclusions. SLN mapping alone carries a low risk of lymphedema in women undergoing surgery for early-stage cervical cancer. In contrast, completion PL is associated with a high incidence of early lymphedema. Reporting lymphedema is associated with significant impairment of several physical, psychological, and social aspects of QoL. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - <i>Fiat Lux/Fiat Lex</i>: A Canticle for Leibowitz, Reason and Law
T2  - LAW & LITERATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Walter M. Miller Jr's A Canticle for Leibowitz (1959) is an enigmatic text. It is a depressing tale of the evitability of technoscientific civilization ending in apocalypse, a comedic story of ignorant monks producing gold-embellished illuminated copies of electronic circuit blueprints and an ambiguous examination of the tensions between faith and science. This paper reads A Canticle for Leibowitz as an examination of legality. Drawing inspiration from Carl Schmitt's observation that Catholicism has a "juridical logic," this paper identifies that A Canticle for Leibowitz brings to life, and questions, the Thomist worldview of reason, reasonability and layered orders. It is a novel that brings to life, but also interrogates, Catholic intellectualism. It is tempting to conclude that Miller argues for a Thomist ethic of responsibility to temper technoscientific self-destruction. However, that is not where the novel ends. Its endings are hopeful, notwithstanding the nuclear holocaust in the final pages. There are suggestions of new nomoi: In the diasporic human extra-terrestrial colonies, ministered to by a nomadic Church, and a radiated Eden inherited by humanity's prelapsarian successors anticipated in the coming to life of Rachel.

TI  - Mapping disturbance in mangrove ecosystems: Incorporating landscape metrics and PCA-based spatial analysis
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove ecosystems are of high ecological value and occur in tropical and subtropical coastal areas. They consist of salt-tolerant woody plants and are highly complex and productive.Here, a novel approach was developed to map disturbances and evaluate the ecological status of Iranian mangroves based on multispectral WorldView-2 and Sentinel-2 and remote sensing techniques. A land cover map was generated that serves as basis to assess changes in the composition and structure of mangrove ecosystems. The spatial disturbance index (SDI) was calculated based on landscape metrics and principal component analysis (PCA) in order to detect mangroves degraded on Qeshm Island, Iran. The approach comprised: (I) selection of landscape metrics, (II) definition of the hexagon cell scale, (III) completion of a PCA of the standardized values of eight selected metrics, and (IV) modeling of the SDI based on eigenvalues and a loading factor. For validation, the variance inflation factor (VIF) was used. The results indicate that the best set of key metrics to quantify SDI comprises the eight metrics patch density (PD), total edge (TE), mean patch size (MPS), mean shape index (MSI), Euclidean nearest neighbor distance (ENND), contagion (CONT), splitting index (SPLIT), and Shannon's diversity index (SHDI). The first three components of the PCA explained in total 87% (47%, 27%, and 13%, respectively) of the variance of information distribution, demonstrating the effectiveness of the PCA. Then, based on the disturbance index, five spatial levels, ranging from very low to very high disturbances, were identified. This approach enabled to detect the zonation of disturbance that has occurred in the region and supports the sustainable management of mangrove ecosystems and future planning efforts, thus making their conservation more realistic.

TI  - Dynamic monitoring and analysis of the earthquake Worst-hit area based on remote sensing
T2  - ALEXANDRIA ENGINEERING JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The earthquake and its secondary geological disasters have some long-term effects on vegetation recovery, and the spatiotemporal differentiation of vegetation coverage in earthquake stricken areas are often not valued by researchers. Beichuan County in Sichuan Province is the worst-hit area during Wenchuan earthquake, tracking the vegetation coverage in this disaster area can provide feedback for post-earthquake ecological restoration. Based on remote sensing (RS) and Geographic information system (GIS), this paper relies on dimidiate pixel model (DPM) and vegetation coverage transfer matrix to explore the vegetation coverage of the earthquake worst-hit area. The results show that the overall level of vegetation coverage in Beichuan county is high, and earthquakes are dominant in the areas with high vegetation coverage. Besides, earthquake can do most severe damages to the areas with high vegetation coverage, followed by medium damage impacting to the areas with medium vegetation coverage, but the damage of other areas are relatively small. From 2007 to 2020, the average vegetation coverage in Beichuan County decreased from 0.835 in 2007 to 0.755 in 2008, then gradually recovered to 0.826 in 2020, experiencing a sharp decline and then a steady increase. The recovery of vegetation coverage is improved over time, but the spatiotemporal differences of the recovery process are obvious. Elevation has the largest driving force on vegetation coverage (q = 0.569, p less than 0.001), followed by temperature and rainfall; the interaction between factors has a significant increasement in the spatial differentiation of vegetation coverage, indicating that vegetation coverage is a combination result of multiple factors. The research findings can help construct the scientific management of the eco-environment in the disaster area, it can also help builda medium to long-term ecological restoration plan according to the variation in vegetation coverage.(c) 2022 THE AUTHORS.

TI  - Landscape and vegetation traits of urban green space can predict local surface temperature
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Societal and technological advances have triggered demands to improve urban environmental quality. Urban green space (UGS) can provide effective cooling service and thermal comfort to alleviate warming impacts. We investigated the relative influence of a comprehensive spectrum of UGS landscape and vegetation factors on surface temperature in arid Urumqi city in northwest China. Built-up area range was extracted from Luojia 1-01 (LJ1-01) satellite data, and within this range, the landscape metric information and vegetation index information of UGS were obtained based on PlanetScope data, and a total of 439 sampling grids (1 km x 1 km) were generated. The urban surface temperature of built-up areas was extracted from Landsat8-TIRS images. The 12 landscape metrics and 14 vegetation indexes were assigned as independent variables, and surface temperature the dependent variable. Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gradient Boost Regression Tree (GBRT) and Random Forest (RF) were enlisted to establish numerical models to predict surface temperature. The results showed that: (1) It was feasible to predict local surface temperature using a combination of landscape metrics and vegetation indexes. Among the three models, RF demonstrated the best accuracy. (2) Collectively, all the factors play a role in the surface-temperature prediction. The most influential factor was Difference Vegetation Index (DVI), followed by Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI), Class Area (CA) and AREA. This study developed remote sensing techniques to extract a basket of UGS factors to predict the surface temperature at local urban sites. The methods could be applied to other cities to evaluate the cooling impacts of green infrastructures. The findings could provide a scientific basis for ecological spatial planning of UGS to optimize cooling benefits in the arid region.

TI  - Breast cancer-related lymphedema rates after modern axillary treatments: How accurate are our estimates?
T2  - SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Clinical trials have demonstrated methods to minimize the risk of breast cancer-related lymphedema while preserving regional control. We sought to determine the percent lifetime-risk of breast cancer-related lymphedema that surgeons and radiation oncologists discuss with patients before axillary interventions.Methods: A nationwide survey of surgeons and radiation oncologists was performed from July to August 2020. Participants were asked to identify what number they discuss with patients when estimating the percent lifetime-risk of breast cancer-related lymphedema after different axillary interventions.Results: Six hundred and eighty surgeons and 324 radiation oncologists responded (14% response rate). While the estimated rate after sentinel lymph node biopsy was clinically similar between surgeons and radiation oncologists, statistically surgeons quoted a higher percent lifetime-risk (5.7% vs 5.0%, P = .03). Surgeons estimated significantly higher rates of breast cancer-related lymphedema compared with radiation oncologists (P < .001) for axillary lymph node dissection (21.8% vs 17.5%), sentinel lymph node biopsy with regional nodal irradiation (14.1% vs 11.2%), and axillary lymph node dissection with regional nodal irradiation (34.8% vs 26.2%).Conclusion: There is variability in the estimated rates of breast cancer-related lymphedema providers discuss with patients. These findings highlight the need for physician education on the current evidence of percent lifetime-risk of breast cancer-related lymphedema to provide patients with accurate estimates before axillary interventions.

TI  - Assessing functional characteristics of a braided river in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Functional characteristics of braided rivers with very high elevations (>3400 m) located in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China provide unique insight into fully understanding global braided river functioning, but have not yet been explored because of their remote locations and harsh physiographic conditions. In this study, we un -veiled these characteristics at the reach spatial scale over three decades in one of these braided rivers, the Upper Lancang River (ULR). Using Google Earth Engine resources and a specific selection of Landsat images obtained between 1989 and 2018 during the dry season (November to early May when water levels were low and com-parable over years), we analyzed water area, extracted flowing and non-flowing channels, active channel widths (unvegetated bars and water channels), and calculated lateral shifting rates of the main channel for 13 sub-periods. We also developed an empirical method for estimating vegetated areas in the selected years. We found that (1) this braided system is partly controlled by peak flows and flood durations and the braiding activity evolved through time according to braided planform characteristics, (2) braiding intensity is high during low discharges, suggesting that the ULR is a very well-connected braided system with groundwater, but we observed higher braiding activity in spring than in fall, suggesting other factors than groundwater recharge also control non-flowing channel occurrence, and (3) the ULR supports a vegetation mosaic that is dynamic at a multi-year scale with period of declines that can be caused by scouring and rapid growth in an optimal recruitment window. These findings lead to our interpretation of vegetation behavior and surficial water - groundwater interactions, which needs future field validation.

TI  - Pectoserratus plane block versus erector spinae plane block for postoperative opioid consumption and acute and chronic pain after breast cancer surgery: A randomized controlled trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ANESTHESIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Study objective: Breast cancer is quite common in women, and surgery is the most effective treatment in most cases. This study compared the effects of ultrasound (US)-guided erector spinae plane block (ESPB) and pectoserratus plane block (PSPB) on the postoperative opioid consumption and acute and chronic pain in patients after breast cancer surgery. Design: Prospective, randomized, single-blind. Setting: University hospital. Patients: This study included 90 patients (ASA I-II) who underwent segmental mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy at the hospital of Ondokuz Mayis University, Samsun. Interventions: The patients were divided into the ESPB group, PSPB group, and control group. Intraoperatively, all patients were administered intravenous tenoxicam (20 mg) and paracetamol (1 g) as part of multimodal analgesia. Intravenous morphine via patient-controlled analgesia was administered in all groups postoperatively. Measurements: The primary outcome was the total morphine consumption in the first 24 h after surgery. The secondary outcomes included visual analog scale pain scores of the arm at rest and at abduction in the first 24 h and at 3 months postoperatively, intraoperative remifentanil consumption, number of patients requesting rescue analgesia, incidence of nausea and vomiting, time to the first request for analgesia via patient-controlled analgesia. Main results: Postoperative 24-h morphine consumption, visual analog scale scores at rest and at abduction, and intraoperative remifentanil consumption were lower in the ESPB and PSPB groups than in the control group. Time to the first request for analgesia via patient controlled analgesia was longer in the ESPB and PSPB groups than in the control group. In the PSPB group, none of the patients needed rescue analgesia. Conclusions: US-guided ESPB and PSPB performed in patients who underwent breast cancer surgery showed similar and modest analgesic effects on the postoperative opioid consumption and acute and chronic pain scores.

TI  - Vegetation dynamics in response to climate change and human activities in the Hulun Lake basin from 1981 to 2019
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring long-term vegetation dynamics is essential for developing adaptation strategy to address the challenges to the ecosystem posed by climate change and human activities. This study analyzed spatio-temporal changes of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in the Hulun Lake Basin (HLB) from 1981 to 2019, and explored the relationship between climatic factors and NDVI datasets. Furthermore, the residual trend (RESTREND) method was used to distinguish between the impacts of changes in climate and human activities on vegetation dynamics. The results showed that NDVI of the basin initially increased to the 1990s, then decreased to the mid-2000s, and finally rebounded to 2019 owing to the periodic fluctuations in precipitation. There were 28.32% of the NDVI pixels significantly increasing and 13.85% of the pixels significantly decreasing. The increase proportion of vegetation coverage in forest, wetland and cultivated land was higher than other vegetation types. NDVI in the China Grass Zone (CGZ) significantly degraded by 20.39% compared with the Mongolia Grass Zone (MGZ) significantly degraded by 5.60%. NDVI was significantly correlated with precipitation and weakly correlated with temperature in the HLB, and precipitation was the principal factor influencing vegetation coverage. The results of RESTREND revealed that farmland reclamation, over-grazing, and open-pit mining led to greater browning of vegetation in the CGZ than in the MGZ. Meanwhile, the implementation of ecological protection and restoration projects have helped the greening of the vegetation in the CGZ (20.91%) compared with the MGZ (7.45%). China's ecological restoration projects are important for Mongolia to reverse the trend of serious ecological degradation. Our results can provide scientific decision-making for the local government to formulate differentiated vegetation ecological protection and restoration measures.

TI  - Forest height mapping using inventory and multi-source satellite data over Hunan Province in southern China
T2  - FOREST ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Accurate mapping of forest canopy heights at a fine spatial resolution over large geographical areas is challenging. It is essential for the estimation of forest aboveground biomass and the evaluation of forest ecosystems. Yet current regional to national scale forest height maps were mainly produced at coarse-scale. Such maps lack spatial details for decision-making at local scales. Recent advances in remote sensing provide great opportunities to fill this gap.Method: In this study, we evaluated the utility of multi-source satellite data for mapping forest heights over Hunan Province in China. A total of 523 plot data collected from 2017 to 2018 were utilized for calibration and validation of forest height models. Specifically, the relationships between three types of in-situ measured tree heights (maximum-, averaged-, and basal area-weighted- tree heights) and plot-level remote sensing metrics (multispectral, radar, and topo variables from Landsat, Sentinel-1/PALSAR-2, and SRTM) were analyzed. Three types of models (multilinear regression, random forest, and support vector regression) were evaluated. Feature variables were selected by two types of variable selection approaches (stepwise regression and random forest). Model parameters and model performances for different models were tuned and evaluated via a 10-fold cross-validation approach. Then, tuned models were applied to generate wall-to-wall forest height maps for Hunan Province.Results: The best estimation of plot-level tree heights (R-2 ranged from 0.47 to 0.52, RMSE ranged from 3.8 to 5.3 m, and rRMSE ranged from 28% to 31%) was achieved using the random forest model. A comparison with existing forest height maps showed similar estimates of mean height, however, the ranges varied under different definitions of forest and types of tree height.Conclusions: Primary results indicate that there are small biases in estimated heights at the province scale. This study provides a framework toward establishing regional to national scale maps of vertical forest structure.

TI  - Recovery of tree community composition across different types of anthropogenic disturbances and characterization of their effect using Landsat time series in Bornean tropical montane forest
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic pressure in tropical montane forests is rapidly increasing, becoming a major threat to these complex ecosystems. Studies have shown that the wide variety of human activities in tropical uplands results in different ecological responses of secondary forests, but basic information on the disturbance impacts and underlying recovery processes is lacking. Here, we compared structural characteristics and tree community composition of old growth forest and secondary forests in a montane region of Sabah, Malaysia, which experienced five different anthropogenic disturbances. We also investigated the use of metrics from spectral trajectories of a Landsat time series (LTS) change detection algorithm (LandTrendr) to identify characteristics of disturbance events and their linkage to the recovery of tree community composition, with field validation. Five LTS metrics-time since the greatest disturbance (TSD), magnitude of disturbance (MD), distance to undisturbed forests (d_UND), recovery indicator (RI), and years to recovery (Y2R) were derived and were related to field-based tree community composition. Our analysis revealed a gradient of recovery patterns in community composition and structural attributes among forest disturbance types, suggesting the importance of community composition as an indicator of forest recovery. Among derived LTS metrics, TSD, MD, d_UND, and Y2R 100% were significantly related with the similarity in community composition. Our results suggest that spectral trajectories from LTS can serve as a useful predictor of community composition change in recovering stands. This approach provides an efficient means for developing systematic conservation strategies for high-elevation regions in the tropics, where human-modified landscapes are expanding.

TI  - An efficient method for acquisition of spectral BRDFs in real-world scenarios
T2  - COMPUTERS & GRAPHICS-UK
M3  - Article
AB  - Modelling of material appearance from reflectance measurements has become increasingly prevalent due to the development of novel methodologies in Computer Graphics. In the last few years, some advances have been made in measuring the light-material interactions, by employing goniometers/reflectometers under specific laboratory's constraints. A wide range of applications benefit from data-driven appearance modelling techniques and material databases to create photorealistic scenarios and physically based simulations. However, important limitations arise from the current material scanning process, mostly related to the high diversity of existing materials in the real-world, the tedious process for material scanning and the spectral characterisation behaviour. Consequently, new approaches are required both for the automatic material acquisition process and for the generation of measured material databases. In this study, a novel approach for material appearance acquisition using hyperspectral data is proposed. A dense 3D point cloud filled with spectral data was generated from the images obtained by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with an RGB camera and a hyperspectral sensor. The observed hyperspectral signatures were used to recognise natural and artificial materials in the 3D point cloud according to spectral similarity. Then, a parametrisation of Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) was carried out by sampling the BRDF space for each material. Consequently, each material is characterised by multiple samples with different incoming and outgoing angles. Finally, an analysis of BRDF sample completeness is performed considering four sunlight positions and 16x16 resolution for each material. The results demonstrated the capability of the used technology and the effectiveness of our method to be used in applications such as spectral rendering and real-word material acquisition and classification.

TI  - DKDFN: Domain Knowledge-Guided deep collaborative fusion network for multimodal unitemporal remote sensing land cover classification
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover maps provide fundamental information that has been used in different types of studies, ranging from public health to carbon cycling. However, the existing remote sensing image classification methods thus far suffer from the insufficient usage of multiple modalities, underconsideration of prior domain knowledge, and poor performance on minority classes. To alleviate these problems, we propose a novel domain knowledge guided deep collaborative fusion network (DKDFN) with performance boosting for minority categories for land cover classification. More specifically, the DKDFN adopts a multihead encoder and a multibranch decoder structure. The architecture of the encoder probablizes sufficient mining of complementary information from multiple modalities, which are Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1, and SRTM Digital Elevation Data (SRTM) in our case. The multibranch decoder enables land cover classification in a multitask learning setup, performing semantic segmentation and reconstructing multimodal remote sensing indices, which are selected as representatives of domain knowledge. This design incorporates domain knowledge in an effective end-to-end manner. The training stage of our DKDFN is supervised by our proposed asymmetry loss function (ALF), which boosts performance on nearly all categories, especially the categories with a low frequency of occurrence. Ablation studies of the network suggest that our design logic is worth testing in any network with an encoder-decoder structure. The study is conducted in Hunan, China and is verified using a self-labeled multimodal unitemporal remote sensing image dataset. The comparative experiments between DKDFN and 6 state-of-the-art models (U-Net, SegNet, PSPNet, DeepLab, HRNet, MP-ResNet) testify to the superiority of our method and suggest its potential to be applied more widely to map land cover in other geographical areas given the availability of Sentinel-2, Sentinel 1, and SRTM data.

TI  - Estimating aboveground biomass of urban forest trees with dual-source UAV acquired point clouds
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban forest is a crucial part of urban ecological environment. The accurate estimation of its tree aboveground biomass (AGB) is of significant value to evaluate urban ecological functions and estimate urban forest carbon storage. It has a high accuracy to estimate the forest AGB with field measured canopy structure parameters, but unsuitable for large-scale operations. Limited by low spatial resolution or spectral saturation, the estimated forest AGBs based on various satellite remotely sensed data have relatively low accuracies. In contrast, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) remote sensing provides a promising way to accurately estimate the tree AGB of fragmented urban forest. In this study, taking an artificial urban forest in Ma'anxi Wetland Park in Chongqing City, China as an example, we used UAVs equipped with a digital camera and a LiDAR to acquire two point cloud data. One was produced from overlapping images using Structure from Motion (SfM) photogrammetry, and the other was resolved from laser scanned raw data. The dual point clouds were combined to extract individual tree height (H) and canopy radius (R-c), which were then input to the newly established allometric equation with tree H and R-c as predictor variables to obtain the AGBs of all dawn redwood trees in study area. In accuracy assessment, the coefficient of determination (R-2 ) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of extracted H were 0.9341 and 0.59 m; the R-2 and RMSE of extracted R-c were 0.9006 and 0.28 m; the R-2 and RMSE of estimated AGB were 0.9452 and 17.59 kg. These results proved the feasibility and effectiveness of applying dual-source UAV point cloud data and the new allometric equation on H and R-c to accurate AGB estimation of urban forest trees.

TI  - Tracking dike-pond landscape dynamics in a core region of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area based on topographic maps and remote sensing data during 1949-2020
T2  - AQUACULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - As an important agricultural mode and heritage site in lowland areas with abundant water resources, dike-pond agriculture in China bloomed from the Ming dynasty (1368-1644 CE) and is famous with a "Mulberry Dike-Fish Ponds" type. However, their spatial pattern and morphology have been altered due to international trade and demands from textiles to freshwater aquatic products. Therefore, this study used topographic maps from 1949, declassified keyhole data during 1967-1975, Landsat images during 1975-2010 and Chinese Gaofen (GF-1) images to extract dike-pond landscapes and then revealed the spatial-temporal dynamics of their patterns and morphology. The results showed that four stages of dike-pond landscape changes during 1949-1967 indicated rapid fluctuations. Different towns also have obvious differences in temporal and spatial changes in dike-pond landscapes. The dike-pond landscape was mainly concentrated in the southern part of the study area. The spatial gradient of the dike-pond landscape changes showed that the dike had an upward trend within 9 km and then dropped to 11-12 km. The interannual variation in the buffer zone greater than 6 km is relatively larger. The landscape metrics showed that the aggregation decreased and the shape of the dike-pond landscape increased in a scattered state. The dike-pond gain type increased from 1967 to 1995 and then gradually decreased during 1995-2020. The dike-pond loss type increased from 1967 to 2005 and then gradually decreased during 2005-2020. Therefore, the findings show that dike-pond landscape dynamics are key concerns for decision-makers and stakeholders for sustainable development.

TI  - Characterization and interpretation of the global lunar impact basins based on remote sensing
T2  - ICARUS
M3  - Article
AB  - Impact basins are primary geological structures on the Moon, and play key roles in revealing the lunar history. Due to the different identification standards currently used, the basin identification results are highly inconsistent. Except for the major basins (e.g., Orientale, Schro center dot dinger, Imbrium, Crisium, Apollo, and Nectaris Basin), detailed sub-formation interpretations for most other basins are lacking, which hampers the construction of a complete (global) geological interpretation for the lunar impact basins. Based on multisource remote sensing data and previous works, we established a basin identification standard, and a new global lunar basin catalog containing 81 basins. According to the ring diameter ratios, the purest anorthosite (PAN) distribution, and basin radial textures, we divided the basin sub-formations into the central-peak, peak-ring, basin-floor, basin-wall, basin-rim, and basin-ejecta formations. We interpreted the ejecta formation and other basin sub-formations by combining the Focal Flow data with LROC WAC images, topographic data, gravity anomalies, and spectral data. Our new lunar geologic map shows more precise distribution of basin formations, covering nearly 70% of the lunar surface. Moreover, we obtained the origin of basin rings using basin sub-formations map. Additionally, the basin sub-formation map can contribute to the basin impact conditions, such as the discovered ring (concentric with the outermost ring) provides evidence for three impacts in the Mare Moscoviense, and the SPA subformation distribution indicates the impact direction of SPA is SE-NW. Furthermore, the sub-formation distribution can facilitate the geological characteristics and evolution study of the lunar exploration sites.

TI  - A better carbon-water flux simulation in multiple vegetation types by data assimilation
T2  - FOREST ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The accurate estimation of carbon-water flux is critical for understanding the carbon and water cycles of terrestrial ecosystems and further mitigating climate change. Model simulations and observations have been widely used to research water and carbon cycles of terrestrial ecosystems. Given the advantages and limitations of each method, combining simulations and observations through a data assimilation technique has been proven to be highly promising for improving carbon-water flux simulation. However, to the best of our knowledge, few studies have accomplished both parameter optimization and the updating of model state variables through data assimilation for carbon-water flux simulation in multiple vegetation types. And little is known about the variation of the performance of data assimilation for carbon-water flux simulation in different vegetation types.Methods: In this study, we assimilated leaf area index (LAI) time-series observations into a biogeochemical model (Biome-BGC) using different assimilation algorithms (ensemble Kalman filter algorithm (EnKF) and unscented Kalman filter (UKF)) in different vegetation types (deciduous broad-leaved forest (DBF), evergreen broad-leaved forest (EBF) and grassland (GL)) to simulate carbon-water flux.Results: The validation of the results against the eddy covariance measurements indicated that, overall, compared with the original simulation, assimilating the LAI into the Biome-BGC model improved the carbon-water flux simulations (R-2 increased by 35%, root mean square error decreased by 10%; the sum of the absolute error decreased by 8%) but more significantly, improved the water flux simulations (R-2 increased by 31%, root mean square error decreased by 18%; the sum of the absolute error decreased by 16%). Among the different forest types, the data assimilation techniques (both EnKF and UKF) achieved the best performance towards carbon-water flux in EBF (R-2 increased by 44%, root mean square error decreased by 24%; the sum of the absolute error decreased by 28%), and the performances of EnKF and UKF showed slightly different when simulating carbon fluxes.Conclusion: We suggest that to reduce the uncertainty in global carbon-water flux quantification, forthcoming data assimilation treatment should consider the vegetation types where the data assimilation experiments are carried out, the simulated objectives and the assimilation algorithms.

TI  - Global daily gap-free ocean color products from multi-satellite measurements
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Gap-free global chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration images derived from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) and NOAA-20 are now available online in near-real-time for the ocean color community. With the data fusion of Chl-a from the two satellite sources, missing pixels caused by cloud, sun glint contamination, high satellite viewing angles, and other unfavorable conditions are completely filled using the Data Interpolating Empirical Orthogonal Function (DINEOF) method. Our further studies show that adding more data from additional satellite sensors can remarkably improve the spatial coverage of the merged ocean color products, provide more ocean features over coastal and inland waters, and enhance the accuracy of the gap-free data. Since the launch of the Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B satellites, the onboard Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) sensors have been providing global ocean color product data. In this work, we recruit the OLCI-Sentinel-3A to join the two VIIRS sensors to produce a three-sensor merged ocean color dataset, and further derive global gap-free images using the DINEOF method. It is found that adding OLCI data as the input source significantly enhances the spatial features of high Chl-a by similar to 10-20% in productive coastal regions and inland lakes. Additionally, the first-ever dataset of global gap-free suspended particulate matter (SPM) and water diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm (K-d(490)) is also generated using the three-sensor merged data. Results show that K-d(490) and SPM have similar spatial patterns as that of Chl-a in the major ocean basins, and that SPM can provide more details of the spatial variations than those of K-d(490) in the center of the ocean basin and coastal oceans. Global gap-free Chl-a, K-d(490), and SPM products provide important and useful water quality information particularly over global productive ocean/water regions.

T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - The health risks of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ambient ozone (O-3) have been widely recognized in recent years. An accurate estimate of PM2.5 and O-3 exposures is important for supporting health risk analysis and environmental policy-making. The aim of our study was to construct random forest models with high-performance and estimate daily average PM2.5 concentration and O-3 daily maximum of 8 h average concentration (O-3-8 hmax) of China in 2005-2017 at a spatial resolution of 1 km x 1 km. The model variables included meteorological variables, satellite data, chemical transport model output, geographic variables and socioeconomic variables. Random forest model based on 10-fold cross-validation was established, and spatial and temporal validations were performed to evaluate the model performance. According to our sample-based division method, the daily, monthly and yearly estimations of PM2.5 from test datasets gave average model-fitting R-2 values of 0.85, 0.88 and 0.90, respectively; these R-2 values were 0.77, 0.77 and 0.69 for O-3-8 hmax, respectively. The meteorological variables and their lagged values can significantly affect both PM2.5 and O-3-8 hmax estimations. During 2005-2017, PM2.5 concentration exhibited an overall downward trend, while ambient O-3 concentration experienced an upward trend. Whilst the spatial patterns of PM2.5 and O-3-8 hmax barely changed between 2005 and 2017, the temporal trend had spatial characteristics.

TI  - Estimations of <SUP>137</SUP>Cs activity concentrations using marine parameters issued from MODIS and Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Services (CMEMS) data in Souda Bay (Crete, Greece) for the period 2011-2019
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Cesium-137, as the main fission product, is of special interest in the marine environment because of its solubility, which results to very low sinking time. Nevertheless, the conservative form of the main percentage of Cs-137 introduced in the marine environment (70%) makes Cs-137 to be included in the salinity of sea water. Based on this property, in this study, we examine potential relations between Cs-137 activity concentrations and marine parameters issued from Earth Observation (EO) data products in the Southern Aegean Sea, in order to investigate the possibility of Cs-137 to be recorded by satellite data. In particular, measurements of physical and biological marine parameters issued from the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) database and MODIS ocean products are retrieved for the dates of Cs-137 field measurements. Single and multiple regression analyses are performed between the marine parameters and Cs-137 activity concentration measurements for three distinctive time periods (total, cold, and warm period). The best results are obtained from multiple regressions, one for each time period (r(2) > 0.70). The models show that during cold period, Cs-137 activity concentrations are highly correlated to both chlorophyll and nutrients (phosphates) while during warm and the total period, they seem to be mainly correlated to the photosynthetic available incident solar radiation on the sea surface. For each period, we propose a multiparameter model linear in its parameters. Although the results of this study must be considered preliminary due to the limited size of the datasets, for the first time, we show that estimations of Cs-137 activity concentrations from EO measurements and CMEMS environmental models are feasible, and they can be used as a marine radiological assessment tool for a closed Mediterranean bay such as Souda Bay in Greece.

TI  - Resilience-oriented operation of power systems: Hierarchical partitioning-based approach
T2  - APPLIED ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - As an achievement of innovations resulting from partitioning mechanisms, these mechanisms can contribute to the more flexible operation of power systems in local communities. The ever-increasing frequency and severity of unexpected real-time failures have created challenges for partitioned-based power system operators, affecting each partition's resiliency. With this in mind, this paper presents an adaptive local operation strategy (ALOS) for resilient scheduling of the renewable-dominated partitioned-based power systems under normal and islanding modes in a decentralized manner. The main objective of the developed ALOS lies in reaching an affordable preparedness level in each partition to deal with unscheduled islanding mode, which can occur subsequent to real-time failures at common lines between adjacent partitions on transmission level. To this end, a set of resilience-target constraints is presented to prepare sufficient spinning reserve capacity in each partition to ensure continuity of supply during islanding mode. The proposed strategy is formulated as a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer linear program (MILP), and the nested formation algorithm is employed to execute it in a hierarchical fashion based on the privacy-preserving protocols. Besides, the tri-state compressed air energy storage (CAES) system is also included in the proposed strategy to mitigate the negative consequences caused by real-time failures and uncertain sources. Numerical results conducted on the IEEE 30-bus test system reveal that the proposed ALOS can enhance the resilience of each partition in responding to unscheduled islanding mode by efficiently utilizing all available capacities on the generation side. Furthermore, the DIgSILENT PowerFactory is used to identify the worst possible series of events and to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed resilience-promoting proactive strategy in dealing with these events.

TI  - Building footprint extraction from very high-resolution satellite images using deep learning
T2  - JOURNAL OF SPATIAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Building footprint datasets are valuable for a variety of uses in urban settings. For a number of urban applications, polygonal building outlines with regularised bounds are required and are extremely challenging to prepare. We propose a deep learning strategy based on convolutional neural networks for retrieving building footprints. The model was trained using images from a variety of places across the metropolis, highlighting differences in land use patterns and the built environment. The evaluation measures indicate how the accuracy characteristics of distinct built-up settings differ. The results of the model are equivalent to cutting-edge building extraction methods.

TI  - A Micro-Scale Study of Flood Risk Assessment in Urban Fluvial Areas Using the Flood Potential Index
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Worldwide, increasing various methods are being offered to solve the issue of flood disasters in urban fluvial areas, yet there is a relative lack of micro-scale studies concerning the flood potential index (FPI) to forecast future flood events in DKI Jakarta. With recent advances, the information of flood risk assessment can be monitored and communicated by using FPI embedded with a geographical information system (GIS)-based model. Therefore, the main purpose and concerned issue in this paper is how to relate the micro-scale study of flood risk assessment in the urban fluvial area in DKI Jakarta as the study case using FPI. Specific parameters were selected to develop and analyze FPI, involving three considerations: meteorological, physical-environment, and socio-economic aspects. The classification has also been developed by the analysis of data from rainfall, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) obtained from Landsat eight interpretation, and population density to produce a flood potential hazard map for each sub-district in DKI Jakarta during 2021-2024. The results of the completed analysis of classification for each sub-district in DKI Jakarta showed 10 sub-districts with high potential, 219 sub-districts with medium potential, and 32 sub-districts with low potential in 2024. Our findings also confirmed that using a GIS approach in identifying and measuring the FPI in DKI Jakarta for micro-scale areas is very helpful in order to develop better adaptive local flood management practices. For future works, the assessment not only produces a visualization of the flood potential index but also estimates possible damage due to the flood hazard itself.

TI  - Plasmonic Core-Shell Materials: Synthesis, Spectroscopic Characterization, and Photocatalytic Applications
T2  - ACCOUNTS OF MATERIALS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The ability to concentrate light at the nanoscale and produce extremely high local electromagnetic (EM) fields makes plasmonics a promising and rapidly developing research area. In the region with high EM field intensity (usually called the "hot spot"), various processes can be significantly enhanced, including spectroscopy, luminescence, catalysis, etc. However, only coinage metals ( material limitation) with nanoscale roughness (morphological limitation) exhibit significant plasmonic effects under the visible light region, which greatly hinders wider and further applications of plasmonics. Constructing plasmonic core-shell materials by coating a second material onto the surface of a plasmonic metal core is a potential solution to these limitations. The plasmonic core can amplify the signals and/or accelerate the processes of the shell materials or other substrates of interest, making plasmonic research on nonplasmonic materials possible, thus expanding the applications of plasmonics. Besides, through controllable synthesis, the size and composition of both the core and the shell can be tuned simultaneously and precisely. This offers huge possibilities to study and tune plasmonic structure- performance effects at the (sub)nanometer level, which would otherwise not be feasible.This Account summarizes recent work of our research group on plasmonic core-shell nanomaterials, including synthesis, spectroscopic characterization and photocatalysis, in terms of different compositions of the core and shell. To begin with, we introduce methods to directly coat different kinds of chemically "active" components on a plasmonic core to form Au/Ag@X (X = Pt, PtNi alloy, and MoS2) structures, including the principles of plasmonic core-shell nanomaterials and the "borrowing" strategy. Next, for general surface/interface characterization and analysis, "inert" Au/Ag@SiO2 and shell-isolated enhanced spectroscopy, including Raman, luminescence and nonlinear spectroscopies, are discussed. Then, core-shell satellite structures, Au@SiO2/M, where M includes nanoparticles (NPs) and single metal catalysts (SAC), are presented for nanocatalysis. After that, Au- semiconductor core-shell nanomaterials and hot-electron (HE)-induced photocatalysis are reviewed. Finally, we summarize the remaining challenges and opportunities in plasmonics based on core-shell materials. We believe this Account will be informative in designing novel plasmonic core-shell structures for various applications and will offer new directions in plasmonic materials and applications, not limited to core-shell nanomaterials, spectroscopy or catalysis.

TI  - Temporal resolution of vegetation indices and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence data affects the accuracy of vegetation phenology estimation: A study using in-situ measurements
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation phenology plays a critical role in inter-annual changes of the terrestrial carbon cycle. Land surface phenology (LSP) has been widely used to monitor vegetation phenology from remotely-sensed data (RSD) across multiple spatial scales. However, it remains unclear how the temporal resolution of RSD influences the accuracy of LSP estimation. This study systematically analyzed the influences of temporal resolution, including the observation temporal resolution (OTR) and composite temporal resolution (CTR), of RSD on LSP estimation from continuous ground-based remote sensing observations. Specifically, this study quantitatively assessed the sensitivity of LSP estimation to temporal resolution from both structural indicators including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRV), and physiological indicators including photochemical reflectance index (PRI), gross primary productivity (GPP), and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF). The results showed that the effects of temporal resolution of RSD on LSP estimation can be divided into systematic error and random error. The systematic error of CTR was caused by the methods of LSP estimation and affected by data compositing methods, while the random error of both OTR and CTR was caused by data noise. The sensitivity of SIF and GPP to temporal resolution (both OTR and CTR) in LSP estimation was higher than that of vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI, NIRV, PRI) due to higher data noise. Furthermore, in LSP estimation, the selection of the required temporal resolution of RSD was directly related to the data quality. The results highlight the importance of the temporal resolution in LSP estimation from RSD and provide two possible insights to reduce the errors of LSP estimation. First, in the case of the appropriate data compositing strategies and very little data noise, temporal resolution (both OTR and CTR) can be considered to have little influence on LSP estimation. Second, most of the difference in sensitivity of different indicators to temporal resolution comes from external factors, including observation and model or algorithm errors, rather than the properties of indicators.

TI  - Classification and Regression Tree Models for Remote Recognition of Black and Odorous Water Bodies Based on Sensor Networks
T2  - SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING
M3  - Article
AB  - Black and odorous water bodies represent a topic of significant interest in the field of water pollution prevention and control. Remote sensing technology is increasingly exploited for the monitoring of black and odorous water bodies because of its high efficiency and large-scale monitoring potential. In the present study, the Sentinel-2A imagery data were combined with data obtained by measuring spectral properties of black and odorous water bodies to produce a classification and regression tree (CART) model-based improved remote sensing recognition method for such water bodies. This method transforms the traditional single-feature empirical threshold segmentation algorithm to a multi-feature fuzzy decision-tree classification algorithm. The results reveal overall accuracy values of 84.78%, 92.85%, and 72.23% for the CART decision-tree algorithm, the confidence zone classification, and the fuzzy zone node classification, respectively. The method proposed in the present study enables the highly precise extraction of features representing black and odorous water bodies from satellite imagery. The characterization of confidence and fuzzy zones minimizes the need for field inspections, and it enhances the efficiency of diverse applications including engineering.

T2  - STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The solar ultraviolet index (UVI) is a key public health indicator to mitigate the ultraviolet-exposure related diseases. This study aimed to develop and compare the performances of different hybridised deep learning approaches with a convolutional neural network and long short-term memory referred to as CLSTM to forecast the daily UVI of Perth station, Western Australia. A complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) is incorporated coupled with four feature selection algorithms (i.e., genetic algorithm (GA), ant colony optimization (ACO), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and differential evolution (DEV)) to understand the diverse combinations of the predictor variables acquired from three distinct datasets (i.e., satellite data, ground-based SILO data, and synoptic mode climate indices). The CEEMDAN-CLSTM model coupled with GA appeared to be an accurate forecasting system in capturing the UVI. Compared to the counterpart benchmark models, the results demonstrated the excellent forecasting capability (i.e., low error and high efficiency) of the recommended hybrid CEEMDAN-CLSTM model in apprehending the complex and non-linear relationships between predictor variables and the daily UVI. The study inference can considerably enhance real-time exposure advice for the public and help mitigate the potential for solar UV-exposure-related diseases such as melanoma.

TI  - Satellite observations document trends consistent with a boreal forest biome shift
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The boreal forest biome is a major component of Earth's biosphere and climate system that is projected to shift northward due to continued climate change over the coming century. Indicators of a biome shift will likely first be evident along the climatic margins of the boreal forest and include changes in vegetation productivity, mortality, and recruitment, as well as overall vegetation greenness. However, the extent to which a biome shift is already underway remains unclear because of the local nature of most field studies, sparsity of systematic ground-based ecological monitoring, and reliance on coarse resolution satellite observations. Here, we evaluated early indicators of a boreal forest biome shift using four decades of moderate resolution (30 m) satellite observations and biogeoclimatic spatial datasets. Specifically, we quantified interannual trends in annual maximum vegetation greenness using an ensemble of vegetation indices derived from Landsat observations at 100,000 sample sites in areas without signs of recent disturbance. We found vegetation greenness increased (greened) at 38 [29, 42] % and 22 [15, 26] % of sample sites from 1985 to 2019 and 2000 to 2019, whereas vegetation greenness decreased (browned) at 13 [9, 15] % and 15 [13, 19] % of sample sites during these respective periods [95% Monte Carlo confidence intervals]. Greening was thus 3.0 [2.6, 3.5] and 1.5 [0.8, 2.0] times more common than browning and primarily occurred in cold sparsely treed areas with high soil nitrogen and moderate summer warming. Conversely, browning primarily occurred in the climatically warmest margins of both the boreal forest biome and major forest types (e.g., evergreen conifer forests), especially in densely treed areas where summers became warmer and drier. These macroecological trends reflect underlying shifts in vegetation productivity, mortality, and recruitment that are consistent with early stages of a boreal biome shift.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study combined Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR), Sentinel-2 multispectral, and site variable datasets to model leaf area index (LAI) and basal area per ha (BAPH) of two economically important tree species in Northeast, USA; red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.; RS), and balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.; BF). We used Random Forest (RF), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) algorithms for LAI and BAPH modeling. The results showed that RF outperformed MLP by reducing the normalized root mean square error (nRMSE) by 0.01 and 0.06 for LAI and BAPH, respectively. The final variables selected for modeling of both LAI and BAPH indicated the superiority of Sentinel-2 variables over the Sentinel-1 SAR with minor contributions of site variables (mainly elevation). The red-edge spectral vegetation indices played a significant role in both LAI and BAPH estimation. We attained the lowest nRMSEs of 0.12, and 0.16 for the final LAI model of RS, and BF, respectively using Sentinel-2 and site variables. The lowest nRMSE for both RS and BF BAPH models was 0.12. As RS and BF are the primary host species for a cyclically occurring and most destructive pest of the region, eastern spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana; SBW), these estimations will be useful to evaluate SBW dynamics in the region.

TI  - Surface ruptures and off-fault deformation of the October 2016 central Italy earthquakes from DInSAR data
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Large magnitude earthquakes produce complex surface deformations, which are typically mapped by field geologists within the months following the mainshock. We present detailed maps of the surface deformation pattern produced by the M. Vettore Fault System during the October 2016 earthquakes in central Italy, derived from ALOS-2 SAR data, via DInSAR technique. On these maps, we trace a set of cross-sections to analyse the coseismic vertical displacement, essential to identify both surface fault ruptures and off-fault deformations. At a local scale, we identify a large number of surface ruptures, in agreement with those observed in the field. At a larger scale, the inferred coseismic deformation shows a typical long-wavelength convex curvature of the subsiding block, not directly recognizable in the field. The detection of deformation patterns from DInSAR technique can furnish important constraints on the activated fault segments, their spatial distribution and interaction soon after the seismic events. Thanks to the large availability of satellite SAR acquisitions, the proposed methodological approach can be potentially applied to worldwide earthquakes (according to the environmental characteristics of the sensed scene) to provide a wider and faster picture of surface ruptures. Thus, the derived information can be crucial for emergency management by civil protection and helpful to drive and support the geological field surveys during an ongoing seismic crisis.

TI  - Analysis of the Spatio-Temporal Variation of the Thermal Pattern of River Ganges in Proximity to Varanasi, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The temperature of a river is a fundamental aspect of its water quality and has a bearing on its ecosystem to a greater extent. Therefore, in systematic planning for optimal stream monitoring programs involving the determination of location at monitoring stations, understanding this crucial thermal parameter is much desired. This would help to give an integrated scenario regarding physical, chemical, and biological processes occurring in the river ecosystem. Water quality parameters of the river such as dissolved oxygen, pH, salinity get affected due to change in river thermal patterns. In this study, the Landsat-8 TIR sensor was used to study spatial and temporal variations of river temperature. Thermal bands of 23 cloud-free Landsat-8 images from June 2013 to November 2020 were processed to prepare thermal maps of a stretch of river Ganges at Varanasi, India. The work has been validated by in-situ temperature measurement with a portable thermal sensor having high accuracy (+/- 0.1 degrees C). A good correlation (R-2 = 0.927 and RMSE = 0.956) was observed between the sensor's estimated temperature and the in-situ temperature. The results exemplify that water surface temperature at confluence points was relatively higher due to the incoming effluents than the mid-river temperature. The 'confluence point 3' has the least relative temperature variation. The relative temperature variation has been more prominent for the month of February in comparison to June and November. Owing to the time series data availability and worldwide coverage of the Landsat-8 satellite, the present work provides a promising strategy for studying the thermal patterns in other rivers.

TI  - Updated soil salinity with fine spatial resolution and high accuracy: The synergy of Sentinel-2 MSI, environmental covariates and hybrid machine learning approaches
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization is the main source of global soil degradation. It has impeded progress towards sustainable development goals (SDGs) by threatening 20% of irrigated areas. However, in many data-poor regions, accurate soil salinization information is unavailable. Thus, an updated soil salinity map with high accuracy and resolution is urgently needed to help local governments conduct precise management. In this study, a bootstrap hybrid machine learning framework was developed combine Sentinel-2 data and environmental covariates. The Boruta algorithm was applied to input the spectral information and environmental variables to identify the primary factors influencing soil salinity. By averaging 100 model iterations within a bootstrap framework, the soil salinity mapping outcomes were compared from four machine learning methods (bagging, classification and regression tree, random forest, and gradient boosting regression tree (GBRT)). The results showed that the models driven by spectral information and environmental covariates (strategy II) explained 68~88% of the variability in soil salinity. The model accuracy of strategy II was improved by 5%-8% over that of the models driven only by spectral information (strategy I). The GBRT yielded the most appropriate averaging performance of the four machine learning approaches within strategy II, with an R-2 of 0.88, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 6.33 dS m(-1) , a ratio of performance to interquartile distance (RPIQ) of 4.66 and model stability (ROB) of 0.44. The bootstrap averaging method was relatively stable and had high accuracy potential. The distribution of soil salinity in the Ebinur Lake region was the result of a combination of natural and human activity influences. The proposed approach provides a soil salinity mapping strategy with a fine resolution (10 m) and high accuracy in data-poor places. It may also aid in the restoration of biodiversity, the decrease in land degradation, and the avoidance of future food output reductions in the future.

TI  - Evaluation of Sentinel-1, SMAP and SMOS surface soil moisture products for distributed eco-hydrological modelling in Mediterranean forest basins
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable distributed hydrological modeling, especially in semi-arid areas, must consider the inclusion of surface soil moisture (SSM) spatial information during the calibration process. This variable plays a key role in the evapotranspiration processes that determine the hydrological cycle. The coarse resolution of the SSM estimates by satellite remote sensing has restricted the application of this approach to only large basins, focusing most of the studies in the consideration of simply the temporal dynamics of this variable. The growing efforts in providing higher spatial resolution through disaggregating methodologies or new sensor estimates facilitates the application of this spatial approach to small basins. This paper explores the applicability of the currently available satellite surface soil moisture estimates for distributed eco-hydrological modelling in Mediterranean forest basins. On one hand, this study contributes to fill the existing research gap on the use of remote sensing SSM spatial patterns within the distributed hydrological modelling framework in small basins. On the other hand, it serves as an indirect validation method for the spatial performance of satellite SSM products. To achieve this goal, we implemented the eco-hydrological model TETIS in three case studies named: Hozgarganta (southern Spain), Ceira (western Portugal) and Carraixet (eastern Spain). The SSM estimates selected for comparison were Sentinel-1 SSM provided by the Copernicus Global Land Services (CGLS), SMAP SSM disaggregated using Sentinel-1 (SPL2SMAP_S) provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), SMOS SSM provided by the Barcelona Expert Center (BEC), and SMOS and SMAP SSM disaggregated using the DISPATCH algorithm provided by Lobelia Earth. The methodology employed involved a multi-objective and multi-variable calibration in terms of remote sensing SSM spatial patterns and in-situ streamflow, using the Spatial Efficiency Metric (SPAEF) and the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency index (NSE) respectively. Before model calibration a sensitivity analysis of the most influent variables was performed. The temporal and spatial comparison of the reference SSM products revealed inconsistencies amongst products. The disaggregating methodology determined the spatial agreement to a greater degree than the sensor itself (i.e. SMAP, SMOS). In spite of the differences amongst products, the multi-objective calibration approach proposed increased the robustness of the hydrological modelling.

TI  - A Predictive Model for Nonsentinel Node Status after Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Sentinel Lymph Node-Positive Chinese Women with Early Breast Cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Axial lymph node dissection (ALND) is needed in patients with positive sentinel lymph node (SLN). ALND is easy to cause upper limb edema. Therefore, accurate prediction of nonsentinel lymph nodes (non-SLN) which may not need ALND can avoid excessive dissection and reduce complications. We constructed a new prognostic model to predict the non-SLN metastasis of Chinese breast cancer patients. Methods. We enrolled 736 patients who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB); 228 (30.98%) were diagnosed with SLNB metastasis which was determined by intraoperative pathological detection and further accepted ALND. We constructed a prediction model by univariate analysis, multivariate analysis, "R " language, and binary logistic regression in the abovementioned 228 patients and verified this prediction model in 60 patients. Results. Based on univariate analysis using alpha = 0.05 as the significance level for type I error, we found that age (P=0.045), tumor size (P=0.006), multifocality (P=0.011), lymphovascular invasion (P=0.003), positive SLN number (P=0.009), and negative SLN number (P=0.034) were statistically significant. Age was excluded in multivariate analysis, and we constructed a predictive equation to assess the risk of non-SLN metastasis: LogitP=LnP/1-P=0.267*a+1.443*b+1.078*c+0.471*d-0.618*e-2.541 (where "a " represents tumor size, "b " represents multifocality, "c " represents lymphovascular invasion, "d " represents the number of metastasis of SLN, and "e " represents the number of SLNs without metastasis). AUCs for the training group and validation group were 0.715 and 0.744, respectively. When setting the risk value below 22.3%, as per the prediction equation's low-risk interval, our model predicted that about 4% of patients could avoid ALND. Conclusions. This study established a model which demonstrated good prognostic performance in assessing the risk of non-SLN metastasis in Chinese patients with positive SLNs.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Identification in Cutaneous Head & Neck Cancer - Lymphoscintigraphy Late Phase
T2  - LARYNGOSCOPE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Sentinel node (SN) biopsy following lymphoscintography is recommended for high-risk cutaneous malignancies. Herein, we investigate different lymphoscintography phases, focusing on the importance of the late static phase and the resultant discovery of distal echelon solitary positive sentinel nodes that would otherwise have been overlooked. Methods In this retrospective cohort study, conducted in a tertiary referral medical center, we assessed SN localization and time from tracer injection to SN identification on lymphoscintigraphy. Findings on scan were compared with SN found in the surgical field, and with the final pathological investigation. Results Seventy-three patients, undergoing SN biopsy for head and neck skin malignancies, were investigated. Most patients were male (n = 50). The average age was 65.7 (+/- 15.7) years and the average follow-up time was 29.1 (+/- 22.4) months. Overall, 101 SNs were histologically investigated, demonstrating 7 positive SN. Eleven patients (15%) benefited from the late lymphoscintigraphy phase. In four studies, an SN was identified only in the late static phase, one of which was positive for the disease. In seven patients, SN was identified in the early phase with additional, different, SN on the late phase, one of which was positive for the disease. Comparing the yield (positive SNs) of early versus late phases, demonstrated the same importance (p = 0.275). Conclusions The late lymphoscintigraphy phase has a crucial role in high-risk HN cutaneous cancer. Level of Evidence 3 Laryngoscope, 2022

TI  - Evolution of warm season intense rainfall in Yaan against a cold-anomaly background
T2  - CLIMATE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the rainfall characteristics during intense rainfall over Yaan against a cold-anomaly background, aiming to refine the understanding of different kinds of rainfall events across complex terrain. Hourly rain gauge records, ERA5 reanalysis data and the black body temperature of cloud tops derived from FY-2E were used. The results show that against a cold-anomaly background, the regional rainfall events (RREs) in Yaan exhibit west-to-east propagation, which is different from the north-to-south evolution of warm RREs. The middle and upper troposphere is dominated by a negative geopotential height anomaly corresponding to the cold anomaly. The cyclonic circulation at the higher level associated with the negative geopotential height anomaly bends the high-level jet to the south, forming a divergent zone over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and guiding mid-level systems to move eastward. The cyclonic circulation at the mid-level produces a wind shear zone over the TP, generating anomalous vorticity that continuously moves eastward and develops to influence the rainfall over Yaan. The cold Yaan RREs are closely related to the TP low-pressure systems (both vortex and shearline). The anomalous vorticity over the TP can influence the local vortex over the eastern periphery of the TP at a distance mainly by the horizontal advection of anomalous vorticity by the mean flow and then enhance the local vortex mainly by anomalous convergence when it moves near Yaan.

TI  - Validation of a clinicopathological and gene expression profile model to identify patients with cutaneous melanoma where sentinel lymph node biopsy is unnecessary
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In patients with cutaneous melanoma, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) serves as an important technique to asses disease stage and to guide adjuvant systemic therapy. A model using clinicopathologic and gene expression variables (CP-GEP; Merlin Assay) has recently been introduced to identify patients that may safely forgo SLNB. Herein we present data from an independent validation cohort of the CP-GEP model in Swedish patients.Methods: Archival histological material (primary melanoma tissue) from a prospectively collected cohort of 421 consecutive patients with pT1-T4 melanoma undergoing SLNB between 2006 and 2014 was analyzed using the CP-GEP model. CP-GEP combines Breslow thickness and patient age with the expression levels of eight genes from the primary melanoma. Stratification is based on their risk for nodal metastasis: CP-GEP Low Risk or CP-GEP High Risk.Results: The SLNB positivity rate was 13%. Of 421 primary melanomas, the CP-GEP model identified 86 patients as having a low risk for nodal metastasis. In patients with pT1-2 melanomas, the SLNB reduction rate was 35.4% (95% CI: 29.4-41.8) with a negative predictive value (NPV) of 96.5% (95% CI: 90.0-99.3). Among patients with pT1-3 melanomas, CP-GEP suggested a SLNB reduction rate of 24.0% (95% CI: 19.7 -28.8) and a NPV of 96.5% (95% CI: 90.1-99.3). Only one of 118 pT3 tumors was classified as CP-GEP Low Risk, and all pT4 tumors were classified as being high risk for nodal metastasis.Conclusion: This study demonstrates that CP-GEP can identify patients with a low risk for nodal metastasis. Patients with pT1-2 melanomas have the highest clinical benefit from using the test, where 35% of the patients could forgo a SLNB procedure. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Mapping the trophic state index of eastern lakes in China using an empirical model and Sentinel-2 imagery data
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake eutrophication has become a critical environmental issue due to the global effects of anthropogenic activities and climate change, and has been comprehensively studied for many years. A series of models and indicators have been proposed to assess the trophic state of lakes. The trophic state index (TSI) is a synthetic index that integrates chlorophyll-a, water clarity, and total phosphorus and is widely used to evaluate the trophic state of aquatic environments. In this study, we collected in situ lake samples (N = 431) from typical lakes to match Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) imagery data using the Case 2 Regional Coast Color processor. Then we developed a new empirical model, TSI = -34.04 x (band 4/band 5) - 1.114 x (band 1/band 4) + 97.376). This model is valid for all of China, with good performance and few errors (RMSE = 7.36; MAE = 6.25) for the validation dataset. Recognizing that over 94% of the Chinese population located along eastern watersheds and large lakes have competing water uses, and given the TSI model on the seasonal scales, we further estimated the mean TSI and trophic state in eastern Chinese lakes (> 100 km(2)) from 2019 to 2020. The results revealed that more lakes were eutrophic in autumn (94.28%) than in spring (> 77.14%), indicating a serious eutrophication of eastern lakes. Although the eastern lakes have been studied in more detail, this study found that eutrophication still has markedly negative impacts on lake ecosystems. In addition, no significant improvement was observed in spring, most likely due to the months of curfew/lockdown from January 2020 onwards due to COVID-19. This may be due to the enrichment of nutrients deposited in sediment or watershed soil, which can be characterized as "autochthonous sources " of lake eutrophication, over decades with high rates of economic development. This study demonstrates the applicability of Sentinel-2 MSI data to monitor lake eutrophication as well as the feasibility of blue/red and red/red edge combinations. The framework and TSI model used bands available on MSI sensors to develop a novel approach for generating historical eutrophication data for large-scale evaluation of and decision-making related aquatic environmental changes, even in poorly studied areas.

TI  - The Acceptance Status of Traditional Moral Culture in Colleges and Universities Using Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING
M3  - Article
AB  - In today's world, competition among countries is not just a contest of hard force, but also a contest of soft power. China has a five-thousand-year-old history and civilization, with a strong traditional moral culture at its core. The university stage is an important time for college students to develop their worldview, outlook on life, and values. In this context, excellent traditional and moral culture education plays an important role and significance in their development. College students are the country's future builders and an important force to inherit China's excellent moral culture. The rapid development of the modern Internet era has made the channels for college students to understand and accept the cultures of various countries more and more diverse and convenient. Actively borrowing their essence can help promote the development of Chinese culture, but we must also pay attention to active defense and resistance against the dregs of culture. This paper discusses the current situation and problems of the acceptance status of excellent traditional moral culture among college students and analyses the factors that restrict the acceptance of excellent traditional moral culture among college students to conduct a large-scale study on the acceptance status of traditional moral culture in colleges and universities. A model based on convolutional neural networks is suggested for predicting college students' embrace of traditional moral values. By learning and describing their activities and preferences on the Internet, the model assesses and creates college students' acceptance status for conventional moral culture. Extensive tests indicate that the suggested technique can successfully assess college students' acceptance status for traditional moral culture, and the model's superior performance is supported by test results.

TI  - An Assessment of the Suitability of Sentinel-2 Data for Identifying Burn Severity in Areas of Low Vegetation
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires result in a range of adverse Earth's eco-environment and economic impacts. It is crucial to timely and accurately assess the severity of a forest fire, because burn severity is the factor for post-fire vegetation recovery. On the 7th July 2015, a forest fire occurred in western Spain, Comunidad Valenciana, near the villages of Montan and Caudiel. The fire mainly affected low vegetation types such as scrublands and herbs. This study intended to evaluate the use of Sentinel-2 data for identifying burn severity within areas covered by low vegetation, with the single band, spectral index, and differential spectral index Sentinel-2 data assessed. The results confirmed that the use of near-infrared and short-wave infrared ranges of Sentinel-2 data was suitable for identifying burned and unburned areas of low vegetation. The use of the normalized difference vegetation index performed best in distinguishing between areas of highly and moderately damaged vegetation, whereas the use of the normalized burn ratio (NBR) and NBR2 performed best for distinguishing between areas of completely destroyed and moderately damaged vegetation. These preliminary research results indicated that Sentinel-2 data are useful for forest fire monitoring in areas with low vegetation.

TI  - Fish metabolome from sub-urban lakes of the Paris area (France) and potential influence of noxious metabolites produced by cyanobacteria
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent democratization of high-throughput molecular phenotyping allows the rapid expansion of promising untargeted multi-dimensional approaches (e.g. epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and/or metabolomics). Indeed, these emerging omics tools, processed for ecologically relevant species, may present innovative perspectives for environmental assessments, that could provide early warning of eco(toxico)logical impairments. In a previous pilot study (Sotton et al., Chemosphere 2019), we explore by 1H NMR the bio-indicative potential of metabolomics analyses on the liver of 2 sentinel fish species (Perca fluviatilis and Lepomis gibbosus) collected in 8 water bodies of the peri-urban Paris' area (France). In the present study, we further investigate on the same samples the high potential of high-throughput UHPLC-HRMS/MS analyses. We show that the LC-MS metabolome investigation allows a clear separation of individuals according to the species, but also according to their respective sampling lakes. Interestingly, similar variations of Perca and Lepomis metabolomes occur locally indicating that site-specific environmental constraints drive the metabolome variations which seem to be influenced by the production of noxious molecules by cyanobacterial blooms in certain lakes. Thus, the development of such reliable environmental metabolomics approaches appears to constitute an innovative bioindicative tool for the assessment of ecological stress, such as toxigenic cyanobacterial blooms, and aim at being further follow up.

AB  - Understanding the evolution of natural systems spatio-temporal dynamics is paramount in modern ecology. We focused on highlighting and analysing temporal and spatial dynamics of remotely-sensed chlorophyll a con-centration. This pigment is linked with phytoplankton production, which in turn play a pivotal role in marine environment. Satellite platforms offer a synoptic view of surface chlorophyll a concentration for the last two decades. Coupling this source of information with statistical and Machine Learning techniques could help highlighting eventual patterns.We merged the Mediterranean chlorophyll a satellite data for the last two decades into a single dataset. We tested several techniques for reconstructing missing data and performed a general analysis. Finally, we imple-mented a Dynamic Time Warping Self-Organizing Map algorithm to cluster our series showing that an elastic distance measure outperforms a non-elastic one. The proposed satellite data management and analysis provided insights on spatio-temporal chlorophyll a dynamics in the Mediterranean Basin.

Current routine for SLN detection combines Technetium(99m) (Tc-99) lymphoscintigraphy and blue dye (BD). The primary aim of this study was to examine the feasibility of using a low dose of superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) injected intracutaneously to detect and identify the SLN, and the secondary aim was to investigate if a low dose of SPIO would enable a preoperative MRI-evaluation of SLN status.Methods: Patients with melanoma of the extremities were eligible. Before surgery, a baseline MRI of the nodal basin was followed by an injection of a low dose (0.02-0.5 mL) of SPIO and then a second MRI (SPIO-MRI). Tc-99 and BD was used in parallel and all nodes with a superparamagnetic and/or radioactive signal were harvested and analyzed.Results: Fifteen patients were included and the SLNB procedure was successful in all patients (27 SLNs removed). All superparamagnetic SLNs were visualized by MRI corresponding to the same nodes on scintigraphy. Micrometastatic deposits were identified in four SLNs taken from three patients, and SPIO-MRI correctly predicted two of the metastases. There was an association between MRI artefacts in the lymph node and the dose SPIO given.Discussion: It is feasible to detect SLN in patients with melanoma using a low dose of SPIO injected intracutaneously compared with the standard dual technique. A low dose of SPIO reduces the lymph node MRI artefacts, opening up for a non-invasive assessment of SLN status in patients with cancer. (C) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Change of land use/land cover in kurdistan region of Iraq: A semi-automated object-based approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - During the conflict and in the years afterward, the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI) saw substantial changes in land use. The mapping and monitoring of land use/land cover (LULC) is critical for its long-term development and natural resource management. Therefore in this study, we developed a semi-automated object-based land use/land cover classification to identify and quantify LULC changes and change detection analysis in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq for the period 1990 to 2020 using Landsat satellite data (TM, ETM+, and OLI). To determine the optimum segmentation scales for each phase, we first applied and evaluated different scales of a multi-resolution segmentation technique. After that, spatial (digital elevation information) and spectral information were combined in an object-based image analysis (OBIA) technique. For each LULC class, object features were found. We then used the standard nearest neighbor (SNN) approach to derive their individual properties. Field data and validation units collected from high resolution Google earth pro and historical maps in SAS planet open source were used to conduct accuracy evaluations based on the error matrix and kappa coefficient for each reference year. With overall accuracies ranging from 86.072% to 88.9% and Kappa coefficients of 0.845-0.878, ten LULCs were effectively recorded. After that, a post classification comparison was used to perform a change analysis. The findings demonstrated that LULC change trends were notably different, as all categories were altered at different times throughout the study. Strikingly, 52.1% of the land use/land cover in the Kurdistan Region has changed between 1990 and 2020. All changes corresponded to the KRI's own challenges throughout the last three decades. The OBIA-based approaches and features, we conclude, have a lot of potential for LULC mapping and monitoring. The results shall support state institutions and experts to manage the land in a more controlled way.

TI  - Spatial-temporal dynamics of mangrove extent in Quang Ninh Province over 33 years (1987-2020): Implications toward mangrove management in Vietnam
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing technology offers a huge potential to continuously monitor the changes in mangrove forests. Mangrove deforestation has resulted in a loss of coastal ecosystem services and associated economic benefits. Quang Ninh is the third largest mangrove area in Vietnam, but has experienced mangrove deforestation and degradation since 1987. The study used historical Landsat-5/8 and Sentinel-2 data to quantify spatial-temporal dynamics of mangrove extent from 1987 to 2020. The CMRI was used to construct LULC and post-classification comparison was used for change detection analysis over the study period. The overall accuracies of 94.8%, 94.1% 92.4%, and 89.9% were recorded in 2020 (Kappa = 0.917), 2017 (Kappa = 0.906), 2010 (Kappa = 0.872), and 2000 (Kappa = 0.832), respectively. The dynamics of mangrove forests in Quang Ninh were influenced by mangrove deforestation and afforestation. The extent of mangrove forests decreased by 2168.3 ha from 1987 to 2020. Mangrove deforestation was mainly caused by unplanned aquaculture, urban development, and other land uses. However, the root of mangrove deforestation is found due to inappropriate regulations and institutional schemes related to mangrove management. The study suggests that community-based mangrove management model and blue carbon approach are suggested in Quang Ninh and Vietnam.& nbsp;(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Wildlife in Cameroon harbor diverse coronaviruses, including many closely related to human coronavirus 229E
T2  - VIRUS EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Zoonotic spillover of animal viruses into human populations is a continuous and increasing public health risk. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) highlights the global impact of emergence. Considering the history and diversity of coronaviruses (CoVs), especially in bats, SARS-CoV-2 will likely not be the last to spillover from animals into human populations. We sampled and tested wildlife in the Central African country Cameroon to determine which CoVs are circulating and how they relate to previously detected human and animal CoVs. We collected animal and ecological data at sampling locations and used family-level consensus PCR combined with amplicon sequencing for virus detection. Between 2003 and 2018, samples were collected from 6,580 animals of several different orders. CoV RNA was detected in 175 bats, a civet, and a shrew. The CoV RNAs detected in the bats represented 17 different genetic clusters, coinciding with alpha (n = 8) and beta (n = 9) CoVs. Sequences resembling human CoV-229E (HCoV-229E) were found in 40 Hipposideridae bats. Phylogenetic analyses place the human-derived HCoV-229E isolates closest to those from camels in terms of the S and N genes but closest to isolates from bats for the envelope, membrane, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase genes. The CoV RNA positivity rate in bats varied significantly (P < 0.001) between the wet (8.2 per cent) and dry seasons (4.5 per cent). Most sampled species accordingly had a wet season high and dry season low, while for some the opposite was found. Eight of the suspected CoV species of which we detected RNA appear to be entirely novel CoV species, which suggests that CoV diversity in African wildlife is still rather poorly understood. The detection of multiple different variants of HCoV-229E-like viruses supports the bat reservoir hypothesis for this virus, with the phylogenetic results casting some doubt on camels as an intermediate host. The findings also support the previously proposed influence of ecological factors on CoV circulation, indicating a high level of underlying complexity to the viral ecology. These results indicate the importance of investing in surveillance activities among wild animals to detect all potential threats as well as sentinel surveillance among exposed humans to determine emerging threats.

TI  - Mapping of the perigastric lymphatic network using indocyanine green fluorescence imaging and tissue marking dye in clinically advanced gastric cancer
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Using indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging and tissue marking dyes (TMDs), perigastric lymphatic mapping and their pathological correlation were examined to see whether ICG staining covers all metastatic lymph nodes (LNs) in advanced gastric cancer (AGC).Methods: Patients with AGC who underwent open distal or total gastrectomy were enrolled. ICG was serially injected intraoperatively into the subserosa along the greater and lesser curvatures. Stomach specimens were examined under a near-infrared camera. ICG-stained LNs were named, excised, and tattooed with different colored TMDs to retrace the exact location after pathological examinations.Results: A total of 687 LNs and 69 LN stations were examined from 11 patients. The map of the perigastric lymphatic network showing the topography of ICG-stained and ICG-unstained LNs, including metastatic information, was successfully reconstructed. The average number of ICG-stained and ICG-unstained LNs were 23.6 +/- 12.3 (37.8%) and 38.8 +/- 17.1 (62.2%), respectively. LN metastases were present in 28 LN stations of 8 patients. Of 8 cases with LN metastases, 40% (11.1-75% per case) of metastatic LNs were stained by ICG. Of 28 metastatic LN stations, 21 (75.0%) were covered by ICG, and actual metastatic LNs were stained in 16 LN stations (57.1%). In 4/8 cases (50%), all metastatic LN stations showed ICG signals.Conclusions: ICG fluorescence imaging and TMD are useful tools for visualizing the perigastric lymphatic network and retracing the exact location of ICG-stained LNs in AGC. However, ICG imaging is still not recommended for selective LN dissection in AGC because of the limited staining of perigastric LNs.

TI  - Global seasonal dynamics of inland open water and ice
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal changes of temperature and precipitation cause inland open surface water and ice cover extents to vary dramatically through the year from local to global scales. These dynamics of land, water, and ice have a significant impact on climate and often are critical to natural ecosystem functioning. However, global seasonal dynamics of both water and ice extent have not been well quantified. Here, we present the quantification of monthly surface water and ice areas for 2019 with associated uncertainties. Time-series reference data were created for a probability sample of 10 m grid cells by interpreting the entire 2019 time-series of 10 m Sentinel-2 data and a subset of 3 m PlanetScope data in selected places with a mix of land and water. From the probability sample reference data, we estimate that 4.86 +/- 0.16 million km(2) had inland water presence at some point during the year. Globally, only 23% of the total area with water was permanent water that remained open year-round (1.13 +/- 0.19 million km(2)). Permanent water with seasonal ice cover extended 1.97 +/- 0.21 million km(2), comprising 41% of the total area with water. Seasonal water-land transitions (both with and without ice/snow cover) covered the remaining 36% of the total area with water (1.76 +/- 0.19 million km(2)). February had the maximum extent of ice over areas of inland permanent and seasonal water, totaling 2.49 +/- 0.25 million km(2), and January - March had a larger global extent of ice cover than of open water. To investigate the spatiotemporal distribution of ice cover and the suitability of Landsat, prototype maps of surface water ice cover phenology were created by integrating the ice/snow and no data labels from the quality assurance layer of the GLAD ARD of Potapov et al. (2020) with the monthly surface water layers of Pickens et al. (2020), both of which are Landsat- based. While limited by data availability, these maps reveal the high spatiotemporal variability of ice phenology. The near-daily observations near the poles and the 10 m resolution bands of Sentinel-2 provide unprecedented potential to examine surface water and ice dynamics for 2016 forward and to investigate the drivers and impacts of this variability.

TI  - New high-resolution estimates of the permafrost thermal state and hydrothermal conditions over the Northern Hemisphere
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the thermal state of permafrost (TSP) is important in many environmental science and engineering applications. However, such data are generally unavailable, mainly due to the lack of ground observations and the uncertainty of traditional physical models. This study produces novel permafrost datasets for the Northern Hemisphere (NH), including predictions of the mean annual ground temperature (MAGT) at the depth of zero annual amplitude (DZAA) (approximately 3 to 25 m) and active layer thickness (ALT) with 1 km resolution for the period of 2000-2016, as well as estimates of the probability of permafrost occurrence and permafrost zonation based on hydrothermal conditions. These datasets integrate unprecedentedly large amounts of field data (1002 boreholes for MAGT and 452 sites for ALT) and multisource geospatial data, especially remote sensing data, using statistical learning modeling with an ensemble strategy. Thus, the resulting data are more accurate than those of previous circumpolar maps (bias = 0 :02 +/- 0 :16 degrees C and RMSE = 1 :32 +/- 0 :13 degrees C for MAGT; bias = 2 :71 +/- 16 :46 cm and RMSE = 86 :93 +/- 19 :61 cm for ALT). The datasets suggest that the areal extent of permafrost (MAGT <= 0 degrees C) in the NH, excluding glaciers and lakes, is approximately 14.77 (13.60-18.97) x 10(6) km(2) and that the areal extent of permafrost regions (permafrost probability > 0) is approximately 19 :82 x 10(6) km(2). The areal fractions of humid, semiarid/subhumid, and arid permafrost regions are 51.56 %, 45.07 %, and 3.37 %, respectively. The areal fractions of cold (<= 3 :0 degrees C), cool (-3 :0 degrees C to -1 :5 degrees C), and warm ( > 1 :5 degrees C) permafrost regions are 37.80 %, 14.30 %, and 47.90 %, respectively. These new datasets based on the most comprehensive field data to date contribute to an updated understanding of the thermal state and zonation of permafrost in the NH. The datasets are potentially useful for various fields, such as climatology, hydrology, ecology, agriculture, public health, and engineering planning. All of the datasets are published through the National Tibetan Plateau Data Center (TPDC), and the link is https://doi.org/10.11888/Geocry.tpdc.271190 (Ran et al., 2021a).

TI  - Deciphering artificial groundwater recharge suitability zones in the agricultural area of a river basin in Andhra Pradesh, India using geospatial techniques and analytical hierarchical process method
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the present study is to decipher artificial groundwater zones in the agricultural area of the Varaha River basin in the Visakhapatnam district, Andhra Pradesh, India, using a combination of the Geospatial Techniques (remote sensing and GIS) and Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) method. For identification zones suitable for recharging aquifers, the thematic maps on determinant factors (n = 9) including rainfall, slope, drainage, soil cover, geomorphology, geology, lineaments, seasonal fluctuation of groundwater levels, and land use/land cover were considered and prepared them, using Landsat Satellite Imageries and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission Digital Elevation Model (SRTM DEM). These factors were classified into different sub-classes for integration by assigning appropriate weights (1 to 5) and ranks (4 to 35) for each given factor based on their respective groundwater recharge contributions, using the AHP method. The coefficient of determination, regression analysis, and ANOVA tests were performed prior to integrating the layers for the degree of accuracy in the prediction output, which supports the result of the AHP method. Finally, ArcGIS was used to integrate all thematic layer maps to delineate artificial groundwater recharge zones. These zones included very low artificial recharge zone (4.60%), low artificial recharge zone (18.33%), moderate artificial recharge zone (50.40%), high artificial recharge zone (23.43%), and very high artificial recharge zone (3.24%) to replenish groundwater re-sources. Most study area (77.07%) falls under moderate to very high artificial groundwater recharge zones. The study recommends the suitable recharge structures (roof-top rainwater harvesting, check dams, percolation tanks, and injection wells) and irrigation efficiency methods (sprinklers and drips irrigations) to augment groundwater quantity and thereby improve groundwater quality. Therefore, this study helps to expand the practice of irrigation and increase agricultural income for better living conditions of rural communities.

TI  - Operational framework to predict field level crop biomass using remote sensing and data driven models
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote Sensing (RS) based monitoring provides opportunities to acquire timely and reliable information on crop growth at diverse scales. Crop yield forecasts can help decision makers to formulate policies on maintaining national food reserves, sustaining food supply chains and attaining national food security. Inter field crop yield heterogeneity arising from varied field management and agricultural practices necessitates this forecasting to be done at field-level. Such field level information can aid farmers to identify gaps in water and farm management practices and take corrective actions, if needed. So far, no scalable tools are available to predict crop yields at field level that leverage the availability of open-access high-resolution RS data.This research implements an operational framework to predict field level crop biomass by evaluating different regression algorithms to develop data driven models, leveraging historical and near real time open-access high resolution optical satellite data from Sentinel-2, radar data from Sentinel-1 and evapotranspiration (ETa) and Net Primary Production (NPP) data from Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) Water Productivity through Open-access Remotely sensed data (WaPOR) platform. NPP is used as a proxy for biomass production/yield. Five of the most commonly used regression algorithms were tested to build a data-driven model for sugarcane NPP prediction in Wonji-Shoa sugarcane estate, located in the Awash Basin, Ethiopia. The models tested were the Multivariate Linear Regression (MLR), Stepwise Multivariate Linear Regression (SMLR), Boosted Regression Trees (BRT), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Random Forest Regression (RFR).The results revealed that for seasonal sugarcane NPP predictions, the linear regression models (MLR and SMLR) yielded more accurate predictions than the non-linear machine learning models (BRT, SVR and RFR) tested. The highest accuracy was achieved for MLR models for which estimates with 89% accuracy could be made 4 months prior to the harvest and with accuracies of 79% up to 200 days (approx. 6.5 months) before the harvest. The non-linear machine learning models, however, could not provide reliable estimates of sugarcane NPP (accuracies < 61%). Cumulative vegetation indices (VIs) were found to have higher predictive power than standard VIs for predicting future sugarcane NPP. Cumulative Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) was found to be the variable with the highest predictive power, followed by VH polarized Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar data and WaPOR ETa. The study shows the usefulness of high-resolution RS information to predict seasonal NPP at field level. The methods presented here can be translated into an automated framework towards an operational system.

TI  - A Study on the Sufficient Conditional and the Necessary Conditional With Chinese and French Participants
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - According to the weak version of linguistic relativity, also called the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, the features of an individual's native language influence his worldview and perception. We decided to test this hypothesis on the sufficient conditional and the necessary conditional, expressed differently in Chinese and French. In Chinese, connectors for both conditionals exist and are used in everyday life, while there is only a connector for the sufficient conditional in French. A first hypothesis follows from linguistic relativity: for the necessary conditional, better logic performance is expected in Chinese participants rather than French participants. As a second hypothesis, for all participants, we expect performance on the sufficient conditional to be better than on the necessary conditional. Indeed, despite the isomorphism of the two conditionals, they differ in how information is processed for reasoning. We decided to study reasoning under uncertainty as it reflects reality more accurately. To do so, we analyzed the coherence of participants using de Finetti's theory for deduction under uncertainty. The results of our study show no significant difference in performance between Chinese and French participants, neither on the sufficient conditional nor on the necessary conditional. Thus, our first hypothesis derived from the weak version of linguistic relativity is not confirmed. In contrast, our results confirm the second hypothesis in two out of three inference schemas.

TI  - Environmental Cues of Spawning Migration into a Confined Wetland by Northern Pike and Common Carp in Lake Erie: Identifying Fine-Scale Patterns
T2  - NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Restoration of wetlands in the Laurentian Great Lakes is designed to improve numerous ecosystem services including nutrient sequestration, support recreational uses, augment waterfowl habitat, and provide spawning and nursery habitat for fish. These projects often use Northern Pike Esox lucius, as a sentinel species for assessing restoration success because of their obligate use of emergent and submergent vegetation by the early life stages. However, invasive species such as Common Carp Cyprinus carpio also utilize these habitats and can have negative effects. Thus, fostering the use of these wetlands by Northern Pike and limiting access by invasive carp is a common restoration management concern. Using a dual frequency sonar system to observe fish migration in a recently connected Lake Erie coastal wetland, we were able to identify fine-scale environmental correlates to immigration by each species during early spring. Both species overwhelmingly migrated during daylight hours and against the flow of water that was generated through seiche-driven water oscillations. However, Northern Pike predominantly immigrated during the initial increase in water temperature immediately after ice-out; Common Carp also began to enter the wetland at low temperatures shortly after ice-out, but immigration exhibited a slow exponentially increasing pattern, such that the primary immigration timing differed by almost 30 d. Thus, we demonstrate common fine-scale spawning migration patterns (i.e., water oscillation effects and time of day) for both species and reinforce the temperature-correlated differences in spawning migration. Using these results could enable managers of connected wetlands to more precisely and dynamically manage habitat accessibility for desired species like Northern Pike while better regulating invasive Common Carp spawning migration and use of these systems.

M3  - Article
AB  - For outburst susceptibility assessment of glacial lakes, the accurate extraction of glacial lakes region from satellite image is essential. Several techniques are introduced to extract glacial lakes over the years, such as based on image pixel or different thresholds and object-based statistics. These methods require manual optimization parameters for accurate extraction of the glacial lake's region. Hence, in this work, the deep learning (DL) models are utilized to segment the water and non-water bodies from satellite imagery. DL techniques are successful in many research areas for classification problems, but these techniques are relatively new for the extraction of glacial lakes. The main challenges in implementing DL techniques for the extraction of the glacial lakes are (i) preserving the semantic features of the image without loss during max-pooling operation, (ii) huge dataset requirement for proper training. To overcome the problems mentioned above, a customized architecture of the U-Net named as glacial lakes U-Net (GLU-Net) with various encoders is proposed in this work for effective segmentation of the glacial lakes. The proposed method for segmentation is also compared with the existing DL techniques in this work. The DL models are evaluated on Imja, Chandra, and Bhaga glacier regions datasets collected from Landsat 8 satellite imagery. The average sensitivity (Sen), specificity (Spe), and dice coefficient (Dice) for GLU-Net are 92.23%, 99.81%, and 93.46%. These are the three measures for an average of Imja, Chandra and Bhaga glacier regions. The qualitative and quantitative performance analysis shows the significant improvement of the proposed technique compared to other DL techniques for extraction of glacial lake's region.

TI  - Parcel-based summer maize mapping and phenology estimation combined using Sentinel-2 and time series Sentinel-1 data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to map the planting area of summer maize and estimate the spatiotemporal phenology information with parcel-based classification method through integration of Sentinel-1/2 data in Jiaozuo located in North China Plain. For the maize mapping, the combination of Sentinel-1/2 data with the parcel-based method has the highest classification accuracy, suggesting that the integration of Sentinel-1/2 data with parcel-based method has great potential for regional maize mapping. For the estimation of maize phenology, the dynamic threshold method is used to extract the tasseling and milk ripening date through the time series sigma(0)(VH). In order to reduce the influence of precipitation or irrigation on SAR data, a Local Minimum Value Composite (LMVC) method is proposed to filter the original time series SAR data. The systematic phenology estimation method mainly includes LMVC, S-G filtering, Fourier curve fitting and dynamic threshold points extracting. Compared with the actual phenology date by field investigation, the errors of estimated tasseling and milk ripening date are 4.3 days and 5.5 days respectively, indicating that the time series sigma(0)(VH) derived from the SAR data has great potential in spatiotemporal phenology estimation of field maize. Finally, the scattering mechanism of the maize field to C-band microwave in different growth periods was analyzed. It was also found that the phenology of maize was delayed in the coal mining subsidence areas and the areas with insufficient field management.

TI  - Satellite retrieval of benthic reflectance by combining lidar and passive high-resolution imagery: Case-I water
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Under the background of global change, increasing attention has been paid to the changes of benthic habitats in shallow ocean ecosystems (e.g., seagrass beds and coral reefs). Optical satellite remote sensing via both active and passive methods plays an important role in monitoring the health of benthic habitats by retrieving benthic reflectance spectra, but it remains difficult to accurately retrieve benthic reflectance spectra from only active or passive remote sensing because of the coupling between water column scattering and benthic reflectance. Here, we developed a semi-analytical model to retrieve benthic reflectance spectra in Case-I waters by combining active lidar and passive high-resolution imagery. Based on two-stream radiative transfer theory, the analytical relationship among the remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) and water column reflectance (R-w), benthic reflectance (R-b), diffuse attenuation coefficient (K-d), and water depth was established. The lidar data at a certain wavelength were applied to derive the water depth and the chlorophyll concentration (chl) along the lidar track. Then, the values of K-d at different wavelengths were estimated from the derived chl. In addition, we established a look-up table (LUT) for the relationship between R-w and chl and water depth using Hydrolight simulation, and the R-w values at different wavelengths were then estimated by the lidar-derived chl and water depth. Finally, R-b(lambda) values at different wavelengths along the lidar track were retrieved from the R-rs(lambda) values observed by passive high-resolution imagery and the values of R-w(lambda), K-d(lambda), and water depth derived by lidar observation. The accuracy of the model was verified by using the Hydrolight simulated datasets, and the high correlation coefficient (R) revealed promising model performance for different benthic habitats, e.g., R > 0.9 for typical clean shallow water (chl = 0.5 mg/m(3), H < 4 m) for the wavelength range of 400-640 nm. The model was further applied to real satellite data from ICESat-2 lidar and passive high-resolution satellite imagery (multispectral imagery of Sentinel-2 and hyperspectral imagery of Zhuhai-1) at two different benthic habitat sites (seagrass beds in Xincun Bay and coral reefs in the Huaguang Reef) in the South China Sea, and the results revealed that the model could reproduce the benthic spectra in both magnitude and shape. Overall, the proposed model can reliably yield benthic reflectance spectra along the lidar track without any requirement on prior knowledge, which should be beneficial for further benthic habitat health monitoring.

TI  - Short-term agricultural drought prediction based on D-vine copula quantile regression in snow-free unfrozen surface area, China
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to propose an agricultural drought prediction model based on D-vine copula quantile regression considering several factors related to agricultural drought occurrence mechanisms in China. The proposed model is applied for short-term agricultural drought prediction (represented by 1-month time scale of the standardized soil moisture index (SSI-1)) considered antecedent soil moisture (represented by SSI-3), real-time rainfall (represented by 1-month time scale of the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI-1)) and vegetation cover (represented by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)) based on monthly soil moisture data from the Climate Change Initiative (CCI) program of European Space Agency (ESA), precipitation data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and NDVI products from MODIS. The proposed model was employed and evaluated in China and results showed it performed well in snow-free unfrozen surface area such as south-east China. The outcome of this study can contribute to early warning for agricultural drought.

TI  - Combined use of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 to monitor water surface area and evaluated drought risk severity using Google Earth Engine
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is often one of environmental disasters replicated in Morocco. It is the result of climate variations and human activity that has affected different sectors (water resources, agriculture, ecology, and socio-economy, etc.). The normalized water differential index (NDWI) is a type of spectral water analysis based on one green band and one NIR-band representation. The NDWI was effectively used to gather information around water bodies from remote sensing data. The study area for this work is the Idriss 1st Dam in northeast Morocco, situated downstream from the drainage of the Inaouene River. This basin is mostly affected by drought risk, which will evaluate by calculating NDWI index of image time series, based on Sentinel-2 (2015 to 2020), Landsat-8 (2013 to 2020) and Google Earth Engine (2013 to 2020) as a data processing tool. For the study area drought monitoring, DrinC software is used to calculate the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and the Stream-flow Drought Index (SDI).The result of this paper is mapping water bodies of Idriss 1st Dam, and evaluated drought risk severity and frequency with a high precision.

TI  - Too much, too late: Fires and Reactive Wildfire Management in Northern Botswana's Forests and Woodland Savannas
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF RANGE & FORAGE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Across much of southern Africa's savanna wildernesses, wildfires burn unchecked. This is particularly true in the woodland savannas of northern Botswana, where wildfires originate outside of management activities, and are left to burn uncontrolled, because of limited resources and remoteness. There is concern that severe annual wildfires are resulting in the 'savannisation' of large tracts of wooded land across forest reserves, protected areas and surrounding wilderness areas. Because the current fire regime is unknown, management interventions are hard to introduce. We examine the recent 20-year (2001-2020) fire history in northern Botswana using MODIS satellitederived fire products to reveal fire frequency and seasonality. Six wildfire hotspots are identified for exploration of fire frequency and possible origins. Annual fire frequencies are far higher than would be expected without anthropogenic ignition. Extensive areas in some hotspots are shown to have burned between 14 and 16 out of the 20-year period. Fires peak in September, several weeks before the onset of the rainy season and associated lightning strikes, and when the fuel load is at its maximum and conditions at their driest. Adaptive fire management practices, such as those being followed in neighbouring South Africa and elsewhere should inform Botswana's fire management policies.

TI  - The impact of body mass index (BMI) on MRI diagnostic performance and surgical management for axillary lymph node in breast cancer
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background We hypothesized that different BMI might have different impact on pre-operative MRI axillary lymph node (ALN) prediction accuracy and thereby subsequent surgical lymph node management. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of BMI on presentation, surgical treatment, and MRI performance characteristics of breast cancer with the main focus on ALN metastasis evaluation. Methods The medical records of patients with primary invasive breast cancer who had pre-operative breast MRI and underwent surgical resection were retrospectively reviewed. They were categorized into 3 groups in this study: underweight (BMI < 18.5), normal (BMI of 18.5 to 24), and overweight (BMI > 24). Patients' characteristics, surgical management, and MRI performance for axillary evaluation between the 3 groups were compared. Results A total of 2084 invasive breast cancer patients with a mean age of 53.4 +/- 11.2 years were included. Overweight women had a higher rate of breast conserving surgery (56.7% vs. 54.5% and 52.1%) and initial axillary lymph node dissection (15.9% vs. 12.2% and 8.5%) if compared to normal and underweight women. Although the post-operative ALN positive rates were similar between the 3 groups, overweight women were significantly found to have more axillary metastasis on MRI compared with normal and underweight women (50.2% vs 37.7% and 18.3%). There was lower accuracy in terms of MRI prediction in overweight women (65.1%) than in normal and underweight women (67.8% and 76.1%). Conclusion Our findings suggest that BMI may influence the diagnostic performance on MRI on ALN involvement and the surgical management of the axilla in overweight to obese women with breast cancer.

TI  - High spatial resolution modelling of net forest carbon fluxes based on ground and remote sensing data
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the application of a recently proposed modelling strategy to yield high spatial resolution estimates of net forest carbon fluxes in Tuscany (Central Italy). The simulation of forest net primary production (NPP) and net ecosystem production (NEP) is based on the combination of remotely sensed and ancillary data which describe the main characteristics of local environment and vegetation. Distinctively, the methodology is driven by a map of growing stock volume (GSV) having a pixel size of 23 x 23 m(2) and can therefore yield correspondingly high spatial resolution estimates of forest NPP and NEP. An advancement of the original methodology is also proposed based on the availability of a recently produced soil organic carbon map of Tuscany informative about biomass decomposition (heterotrophic respiration). The modified modelling strategy is applied over the period 2001-2005 and the obtained estimates are assessed against: i) ground observations of GSV current annual increment (CAI) collected for over 600 plots during the last National Forest Inventory of Italy; ii) a high spatial resolution reference NEP map obtained for a Mediterranean pine forest (San Rossore) by the integration of eddy covariance flux data and local CAI observations. Considering the complexity of the simulated processes and of the examined environment, the estimation accuracy achieved is satisfactory for both NPP and NEP. This supports the possibility of applying the proposed modelling strategy to estimate net carbon fluxes at high spatial resolution in other forest environments.

T2  - LOCAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Although the Brundtland Commission's definition of Sustainable Development (SD) is widely accepted and central to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it presents some limitations for application in the traditional African context. Drawing on a qualitative research design, this study interrogated indigenous knowledge systems of land governance among the Grune people in northern Ghana and the implications for SD. The emergent perspectives on land and land ownership are compelling and underpin the need for re-conceptualisation SD. To adapt SD to Grune worldview, it is imperative to redefine the frontiers of SD, by embracing a three-generational framework for addressing needs and achieving total wellbeing. In the context of decentralisation in Africa, an Endogenous Development (ED) approach to development planning is imperative for engineering social innovations and learnings that ensure socially and culturally acceptable development and the well-being of indigenous people and communities.

T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the mid-20th century, ice shelves around the Antarctic Peninsula have declined in extent and thickness, and some have shown signs of structural instability. Here, using satellite imagery from 1999/2000 to 2019/20 (Landsat 7 and 8, Sentinel-2 and ASTER), we measure areal changes, calculate surface flow speeds, and quantify structural changes of Bach, Stange and George VI ice shelves, located in the southwest Antarctic Peninsula. We recorded a total area loss of 797.5 km(2) from 2009/10 to 2019/20, though spatial and temporal patterns varied at individual ice fronts. Flow speeds remained largely stable over the observation periods, but notable acceleration was calculated for Bach Ice Shelf, and at the northern and southern extents of George VI Ice Shelf. Open fractures widened and lengthened between 2009/10 and 2019/20 on all three ice shelves. We conclude that Stange Ice Shelf is stable, and not under any immediate threat of enhanced recession. Continued ice-mass loss and consequential speed up of George VI South may cause further fracturing and destabilisation in the coming decades. Of more immediate concern are the glaciological changes noted for Bach Ice Shelf and George VI North; substantial areas of stabilising ice have already, or will soon be removed, that may lead to enhanced recession within the next decade.

TI  - Evaluation of retrieving chlorophyll <i>a</i> concentration and colored dissolved organic matter absorption from satellite ocean color remote sensing in the coastal waters of Hokkaido, Japan
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal ecosystems are important in biogeochemical cycles, because they provide many pathways for chemical elements and compounds to flow between the physical environment and living organisms. The spatial and temporal scales of the biotic and abiotic interactions establish the inherent dynamics of the coastal zone and the requirement for high-resolution investigations. Using match-up data collected in Hokkaido coastal waters, the study herein evaluated the performance of deriving chlorophyll (Chl) a concentration and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption (a(CDOM)) as a function of wavelength (lambda) from satellite observations. The Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Second generation GLobal Imager (SGLI), which has 250 m spatial resolution, was compared with other satellite ocean color (OC) sensors. Our results show that the standard SGLI OC4 algorithm with the 530 nm band provided the best performance for Chl a retrievals, and the end-member analysis (EMA) technique improved the estimation of a(CDOM)(.lambda). Overall differences between in situ radiometric data and satellite retrievals suggest that additional challenges remain, especially in the ultraviolet and blue spectral domains which are useful for studying CDOM and harmful algae blooms in coastal waters. To fulfill applications wherein high-quality remote sensing data are required, the improvement of the atmospheric correction is a likely research area where additional accomplishment will be beneficial for satellite observations of optically complex coastal waters.

TI  - Impact of 3-D urban landscape patterns on the outdoor thermal environment: A modelling study with SOLWEIG
T2  - COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - With global warming and rapid urban growth, cities get warmer, which poses additional stress on human thermal comfort and health. Complex three-dimensional (3D) urban forms change radiation fluxes and shade patterns in cities, but most studies that link urban form to thermal exposure have traditionally investigated the horizontal, two-dimensional composition and configuration of urban landscapes. Supported by high-precision airborne LiDAR data and IKONOS satellite data, this study calculates 3D urban landscape metrics for central Nanjing, China, including vegetation above ground biomass (AGB), building volume (V-B), standard deviation of building and vegetation heights (HSDB, HSDV), the building normalized compactness radio (nCR), sky view factor (SVF), surface roughness (SR), and shadow patterns (SP). Diurnal hourly mean radiant temperature (T-mrt) is simulated using the UMEP (Urban Multi-scale Environmental Predictor) tool forced with fixed-point observation data for a typical hot summer day. Correlation and multiple regression analyses are conducted to investigate the relationship between the 3D form metrics and T-mrt and to identify key factors that influence the thermal environment. T-mrt varies spatially and diurnally and is strongly related to SP during the day, revealing the importance of solar access for modulating the thermal environment. AGB is negatively, but SVF, SP, and building nCR are positively correlated with daytime T-mrt. At night, T-mrt is more homogeneous across space and mainly impacted by the urban fabric's ability to lose heat. Open areas cool faster than areas with low SVF and complex urban forms with high building nCR. Findings from this study have great scientific and practical significance for optimizing urban landscape patterns from a human-centered heat exposure perspective and will guide planning and design strategies to promote thermally comfortable urban environments.

TI  - The role of blue green infrastructure in the urban thermal environment across seasons and local climate zones in East Africa
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanisation and climate change are two major trends in Africa in need of further investigation. In this paper, the urban thermal environment and vegetation abundance in four East African cities (Khartoum, Addis Ababa, Kampala and Dar es Salaam) were characterised, providing new insights into the role and potentials of blue green infrastructure in differing climate regions. The Local Climate Zone (LCZ) framework was employed to detect the seasonal Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) derived from Landsat8 data. Significant LST differences between LCZs in dry and rainy seasons were confirmed using a Welch's T test. The LCZs were found to offer potentially new approaches to investigating issues pertaining to urban heating in data-scarce regions. Greater surface urban heat island (SUHI) intensity during the rainy season was apparent in Khartoum and Addis Ababa, emphasising the importance of seasonality in urban thermal studies. Spatial correlations between EVI and LST within each LCZ were analysed through Moran's I and further illustrated the complex relationships of vegetation and thermal behaviour in urban areas. Despite these complexities, urban blue green infrastructure was found to moderate the SUHI, with different types of intervention required across different LCZs.

TI  - The influence of bioclimatic and topographic variables on grassland fire occurrence within an urbanized landscape
T2  - SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN
M3  - Article
AB  - Unplanned veldfires (or wildfires) characterize vegetation landscapes and offer a range of ecological benefits that promote, among others, the health of the grasslands and other fire-adapted ecosystems. However, in urbanized areas, uncontroled fires are often a threat to property, life, the environment, and economy. The eThekwini Municipal area, a global bio-diversity hot-spot experiences frequent unplanned veld fires that threatens the valuable remnant grasslands. This necessitates an understanding of key drivers to fire occurrence as a first step towards the remnant grasslands sustainability. In this study, the probabil-ity of fire occurrence within the study area was determined using the Near Real-Time (NRT) MODIS Collection 6 Active Fire Data, topographic and bioclimatic variables within the Maximum Entropy (Maxent) environment. The predictor variables were assessed us-ing jackknife analysis, percentage contribution, and Area Under Curve (AUC). The results showed that the mean temperature of the coldest quarter (33%), isothermality (12.3%), el-evation (8.9%), and precipitation of the warmest month (8.8%) were the most influential predictor variables affecting fire occurrence within the study area. The Area Under Curve (AUC) values for training and test data-sets were 0.728 and 0.716 respectively, indicating good accuracy for the fire occurrence probability modeling. The study concludes that the Maxent modeling algorithm is suitable for determining fire occurrence and identifying key topographic and bioclimatic fire drivers within an urban landscape. These results are valu-able in informing the protection and conservation of urban ecological systems, useful for the provision of urban ecosystem goods and services.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - Landslide detection in the Himalayas using machine learning algorithms and U-Net
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - Event-based landslide inventories are essential sources to broaden our understanding of the causal relationship between triggering events and the occurring landslides. Moreover, detailed inventories are crucial for the succeeding phases of landslide risk studies like susceptibility and hazard assessment. The openly available inventories differ in the quality and completeness levels. Event-based landslide inventories are created based on manual interpretation, and there can be significant differences in the mapping preferences among interpreters. To address this issue, we used two different datasets to analyze the potential of U-Net and machine learning approaches for automated landslide detection in the Himalayas. Dataset-1 is composed of five optical bands from the RapidEye satellite imagery. Dataset-2 is composed of the RapidEye optical data, and ALOS-PALSAR derived topographical data. We used a small dataset consisting of 239 samples acquired from several training zones and one testing zone to evaluate our models' performance using the fully convolutional U-Net model, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor, and the Random Forest (RF). We created thirty-two different maps to evaluate and understand the implications of different sample patch sizes and their effect on the accuracy of landslide detection in the study area. The results were then compared against the manually interpreted inventory compiled using fieldwork and visual interpretation of the RapidEye satellite image. We used accuracy assessment metrics such as F1-score, Precision, Recall, and Mathews Correlation Coefficient (MCC). In the context of the Nepali Himalayas, employing RapidEye images and machine learning models, a viable patch size was investigated. The U-Net model trained with 128 x 128 pixel patch size yields the best MCC results (76.59%) with the dataset-1. The added information from the digital elevation model benefited the overall detection of landslides. However, it does not improve the model's overall accuracy but helps differentiate human settlement areas and river sand bars. In this study, the U-Net achieved slightly better results than other machine learning approaches. Although it can depend on architecture of the U-Net model and the complexity of the geographical features in the imagery, the U-Net model is still preliminary in the domain of landslide detection. There is very little literature available related to the use of U-Net for landslide detection. This study is one of the first efforts of using U-Net for landslide detection in the Himalayas. Nevertheless, U-Net has the potential to improve further automated landslide detection in the future for varied topographical and geomorphological scenes.

TI  - Permafrost thaw sensitivity prediction using surficial geology, topography, and remote-sensing imagery: a data-driven neural network approach
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Seasonal or degradational thaw subsidence of permafrost terrain affects the landscape, hydrology, and sustainability of permafrost as an engineering substrate. We perform permafrost thaw sensitivity prediction via supervised classification of a feature set consisting of geological, topographic, and multispectral variables over continuous permafrost near Rankin Inlet, Nunavut, Canada. We build a reference classification of thaw sensitivity using process-based categorization of seasonal subsidence as measured from differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar whereby categories of thaw sensitivity are reflective of ground ice conditions. Classification is performed using a neural network trained on both dispersed and parcel-based reference data. For Low, Medium, High, and Very High thaw sensitivity categories, generalized classification accuracy is 70.8% for 20.6 km(2) of dispersed training data. In all cases, the majority classes of Low and Medium thaw sensitivity are predicted with higher accuracy and more certainty, while the minority classes of High and Very High thaw sensitivity are underpredicted. Minority classes can be combined to improve accuracy at the expense of a reduced level of discrimination. The two-class problem can be classified with an accuracy of 81.8%, thereby effectively distinguishing between stable and unstable ground. The method is applicable to similar Low-Arctic permafrost terrain with geological and topographical controls on thaw sensitivity. However, generalized accuracy is reduced for parcel-based training, indicating that reference samples are not totally representative for inference beyond the parcel, and any deployment of the network to other geographical regions would benefit from full or partial retraining with local data.

TI  - Rapid surface water warming and impact of the recent (2013-2016) temperature anomaly in shallow coastal waters at the eastern entrance of the Gulf of California
T2  - PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Review
AB  - Anthropogenically-induced global warming is increasing surface seawater temperatures (SST) worldwide. Furthermore, the Northeastern Tropical Pacific is affected by seasonal, interannual (El Nino - Southern Oscillation, marine heatwaves), and decadal variabilities (Pacific Decadal Oscillation). Here we analyzed a long-term (1973-2016) SST time-series from the Mazatlan coastal zone, at the eastern entrance of the Gulf of California (Mexico) to record the warming trend and to examine the effect of the 2013-2016 North Pacific SST positive anomaly. This SST time-series can be useful to better understand the interplay of surface water masses in the region (Tropical Surface Water, Gulf of California Water, and California Current Water) and their transport mechanisms. Variability analysis was focused on 2007-2016, for which a 10-year climatology was established. During this period, two La Nina and El Nino events, and a regional marine heatwave occurred in the Northeast Pacific. There was a significant positive correlation between the Oceanic Nino Index (ONI) and SST anomalies. La Nina events caused large negative anomalies (up to 4 degrees C) in maximum SST, and El Nino events caused large positive anomalies (up to 7 degrees C) in the minimum SST. The 2013-2014 regional marine heatwave was preceded by a previously unreported anomalous regional warming at the entrance of the Gulf of California (2012-2013), which caused positive anomalies of 4 degrees C in minimum SST. Since then, each winter showed increasing minimum SST anomalies until reaching a 7 degrees C maximum in 2016. Minimum SST positive anomalies were caused by i) the inhibition of coastal upwelling of cold waters, and ii) a limited penetration of California Current cold waters. For the past 40 years, we estimated a mean warming trend of 0.57 +/- 0.01 degrees C per decade in the study area, which is larger than the global ocean increasing trend. This relatively fast warming rate could be caused by i) local effects caused by shallowness and coastal dynamics, ii) an increasing influence of warmer Tropical Surface Water transported by the Mexican Coastal Current, iii) the transport and upwelling of warmer waters from the Western Pacific Warm Pool during El Nino events, and iv) global warming, as increasing SST can induce stronger and longer-lasting thermoclines, especially in regions commonly affected by upwelling events. If this trend persists, a simple linear extrapolation would indicate that the mean SST from 1977 to 2100 would increase by 7 degrees C. This extrapolation should be taken with caution, but such an increase would have profound effects on the coastal ecosystems, so possible adaptation strategies merit urgent attention by scientists and coastal zone managers to dynamically adapt to coastal global warming and marine heatwaves. This methodology can be used in other coastal zones worldwide where enough field and satellite data are available.

TI  - Semi-analytical model for TSI estimation of inland water bodies from Sentinel 2 imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Regular monitoring of inland water bodies is essential to identify the areas of deteriorating water quality and to take measures to curb the impairment. The present study aims to develop a semi-analytical model for estimating Trophic State Index (TSI) from Sentinel 2 (S2) imagery. A semi-analytical algorithm, QAA-v6, is parameterized for S2 data (referred to as QAA-S2) based on the correlation between the retrieved inherent optical properties (IOPs) from S2 imagery and the measured TSI data of Milford Lake in USA. The accuracy of estimation of TSI by this modified model from three different lakes located in USA and from one lake in India has increased by almost 50%, when compared with that of QAA-v6. A correlation analysis of the retrieved IOPs from QAA-S2 using the outputs of three atmospheric correction processors (ACPs) (namely C2RCC, Acolite and Sen2Cor) was carried out and C2RCC gave the least mean absolute percentage error (MAPE<8%) for TSI estimation. TSI estimation using single-scattering albedo (u) at B5 and B6 bands of S2 was reasonable (MAPE<12%) to mark them as computationally efficient estimators of TSI. These results indicate the usefulness and transferability of the QAA-S2 to the various parts of the globe for estimating TSI.

AB  - The Tropical Atlantic Ocean Database and Monthly Anomalies of River Discharge on Atlantic Ocean datasets encompass the monthly anomalies of a variety of physical, biogeochemical parameters from the tropical Atlantic Ocean and the monthly anomalies of river runoff in the Atlantic Ocean and its adjacent seas. The parameters used as the base for the computation of anomalies come from the TROPFLUX, GPCP, ASCAT, SODA, GODAS, DASK, SeaWiFS, OAFLUX, WAVEWATCH III, NOAA/ESRL 20th Century Reanalysis, GLOBAL_REANALYSIS_BIO_001_029, GLOBAL_REANALYSIS_BIO_001_033, OCEANCOLOUR_GLO_ OPTICS_L4_REP_OBSERVATIONS_009_081, OSCAR, SMOS, MODIS-Aqua, CO2_Flux, and GRDC datasets. Several of the anomaly data are redundant, but come from different data sources making comparative studies possible. For ease of use, both datasets are provided in NetCDF format, CF convention. These datasets include 18 files in NetCDF format, which facilitates its handling due to the diversity of freeware tools that exist and are structured in two-, three- and four-dimensional grids. All these anomalies can be useful to oceanographers, meteorologists, ecologists and other researchers for studies of climate variation in the tropical Atlantic Ocean.

TI  - Comparison of time-integrated NDVI and annual maximum NDVI for assessing grassland dynamics
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The saturation of NDVI makes the annual maximum NDVI(NDVImax) underestimate vegetation with high coverage. Time-Integrated NDVI(TI-NDVI) accumulates NDVIs of vegetation at different growing stages in one growing season. TI-NDVI might alleviate the saturation effect of NDVImax when vegetation dynamics are assessed at annual time scale. Taking grassland in Ili Valley at the west end of Tianshan Mountain as the study area, this paper compared NDVImax and TI-NDVI systematically for assessing grassland dynamics and also their correlations with precipitation and temperature. Data of time-series Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer(MODIS) NDVI were used and methods of Mann-Kendall trend test, Sen's slope estimator test, coefficient of variation(CV) and partial correlation coefficient were employed. We found that there were 28.69% grassland in Ili Valley where the TI-NDVI and NDVImax showed different changing trends over the years of 2000-2019. TINDVI not only revealed more about the spatial and temporal heterogeneities of grassland with high coverage than NDVImax at annual time scale, but also captured more about the close relationship between grassland dynamics and precipitation or temperature in Ili Valley.

TI  - Near-infrared aggregation-induced emission nanodots for early diagnosis of tongue squamous cell carcinoma and sentinel lymph node mapping
T2  - BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Fluorescence imaging has been widely used in the biomedical field owing to its merits of high sensitivity, excellent accuracy, high biosafety, etc. However, despite the good performance of fluorescent materials in the diagnosis of subcutaneous tumors or some orthotopic tumors in mice, their potential clinical application for most orthotopic tumors in humans is still limited due to their weak tissue penetration ability and the high thickness of human tissues. Given that the human tongue can extend out of the mouth and is approximately 1 cm thick, the diagnosis of tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) by fluorescence has great potential for clinical applications. However, to the best of our knowledge, a few studies have been performed to detect tongue tumors using fluorescence imaging, and most of them are administered in a subcutaneous tumor-bearing mouse model and are based on fluorescent materials with aggregation-caused quenching effects. Herein, by developing DPA-TPE-DCM with intense near-infrared fluorescence emission in the aggregation state, aggregation-induced emission materials were used for the first time in the early diagnosis of orthotopic TSCC and sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping in an immunocompetent mouse model of orthotopic TSCC with a high signal-to-background ratio of 10.2. Moreover, with the guidance of the fluorescence of DPA-TPE-DCM NPs, SLNs smaller than 2 mm in diameter were successfully excised. This study provides new insight and a method for the early diagnosis of TSCC in clinical practice and provides more possibilities to broaden the potential clinical applications of fluorescent materials.

TI  - Is national identity in crisis? An assessment of national imaginations in the early 2020s
T2  - STUDIES IN ETHNICITY AND NATIONALISM
M3  - Article
AB  - The current context of a worldwide pandemic has once again sparked debate about the bleak future of nationalism. For those who support this view, the fact that long-lasting national identities are being decisively contested represents a major symptom of the crisis of nationalism, which the challenges associated with the coronavirus outbreak can only accentuate. In this paper, it is my objective to prove this belief incorrect and to demonstrate that nationalism remains almost hegemonic as a form of political and communal identification. My method for achieving this goal comprises two interlinked endeavours: first, a theoretical analysis of the concepts of crisis and national identity; second, an overview of current global conflicts and political debates to determine the extent to which they fit with a nationalist worldview. The results of this research suggest that national perspectives - from which national identities arise - are not experiencing any meaningful challenge in contemporary societies. Even in those cases where deep-seated national discourses are threatened, such opposition remains constrained by the assumptions of the nationalist worldview. Consequently, and albeit the COVID-19 pandemic may ultimately result in the triumph of globalism, it is more likely that international cooperation will develop in a world constructed of national imaginations rather than one from which these have disappeared.

TI  - Simultaneous assimilation of water levels from river gauges and satellite flood maps for near-real-time flood mapping
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydro-meteo hazard early warning systems (EWSs) are operating in many regions of the world to mitigate nuisance effects of floods. EWS performances are majorly impacted by the computational burden and complexity affecting flood prediction tools, especially for ungauged catchments that lack adequate river flow gauging stations. Earth observation (EO) systems may integrate the lack of fluvial monitoring systems supporting the setting up of affordable EWSs. But, EO data, constrained by spatial and temporal resolution limitations, are not sufficient alone, especially at medium-small scales. Multiple sources of distributed flood observations need to be used for managing uncertainties of flood models, but this is not a trivial task for EWSs. In this work, a near-real-time flood modelling approach is developed and tested for the simultaneous assimilation of both water level observations and EO-derived flood extents. An integrated physically based flood wave generation and propagation modelling approach, that implements an ensemble Kalman filter, a parsimonious geomorphic rainfall-runoff algorithm (width function instantaneous unit hydrograph, WFIUH) and a quasi-2D hydraulic algorithm, is proposed. An approach for assimilating multiple stage gauge observations is proposed to overcome stability issues related to the updating of the quasi-2D hydraulic model states. Furthermore, a methodology to retrieve distributed observed water depths from satellite images to update 2D hydraulic modelling state variables is implemented. Performances of the proposed approach are tested on a flood event for the Tiber River basin in central Italy. The selected case study shows varying performances depending on whether local and distributed observations are separately or simultaneously assimilated. Results suggest that the injection of multiple data sources into a flexible data assimilation framework constitutes an effective and viable advancement for flood mitigation to tackle EWS uncertainty and numerical stability issues. Specifically, our findings reveal that the simultaneous assimilation of observations from static sensors and satellite images led to an overall improvement of the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) between 5 % and 40 %, the Pearson correlation up to 12 % and bias reduction up to 80 % with respect to the open-loop simulation. Moreover, this combined assimilation allows us to reduce the flood extent uncertainty with respect to the disjoint assimilation simulations for several hours after the satellite image acquisition.

TI  - Modelling high-resolution Evapotranspiration in fragmented croplands from the constellation of Sentinels
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinels for Evapotranspiration (Sen-ET) developed by the European Space Agency (ESA) provides a synoptic representation of actual ET (ETa) and other land-surface energy fluxes at high spatial (20 m) and temporal (daily) resolutions by the fusion of Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 datasets. However, the non-availability of optical sensor enabled Sentinel-2 images during the periods of high cloud cover such as monsoon limits the perennial use of Sen-ET. Here, we propose an alternate method to estimate ETa fluxes using locally observed weather data and the polarimetric parameters derived from Sentinel-1 with an application to fragmented, heterogeneous croplands. At first, the Sen-ET modelling approach with cloud-free datasets is validated using eddy covariance (EC) flux datasets (R-2 = 0.74). Sen-ET derived ETa fluxes were used to develop crop coefficient (K-c) curves by considering reference ET (ET0) obtained from the weather data (Monteith, 1965b). Functional relations were then established between Sentinel-1 derived polarimetric parameters and K-c considering cloud-free datasets, and further translated to the periods of high cloud cover. We observed a strong dependency of VH on K-c for sugarcane and vegetables, and radar vegetation index (RVI) on K-c for rice (R-veg(2) = 0.55, R-s.c(2). = 0.61, R-rice(2). = 0.51 ). The performance of Sentinel-1 derived ETa estimates were further validated with EC fluxes and found to be high during non-monsoon period (R-2 = 0.74, RMSE = 1.25) than in monsoon period (R-2 = 0.63, RMSE = 0.82). Our results indicate the suitability of Sentinel-1 in estimating ETa fluxes during the periods of high cloud cover for effective irrigation management.

AB  - A GIS and remote sensing-based decision support tool called SAMZ-Desert was developed for management zones (MZs) delineation of a total of 6852 fields in the Imperial County region of southern California using Landsat-8 NDVI data acquired on 27/4 2018. In addition, a total number of 11 cloud-free images in 2018-2020 were statistically analyzed to determine the extent of within-field NDVI variability and temporal stability of MZs at the regional level. A majority (approx. 37%) of the fields had four zones as an optimum number of zones in the region, which could explain > 85% of the within-field NDVI variance. Around 13% (n = 873) of the fields in the region were strongly spatially-clustered in at least half the Landsat-8 cloud-free scenes and can benefit from variable rate technologies. Our results suggest that dynamic zoning over time might be necessary for most of these fields.

TI  - Large-scale and fine-grained mapping of heathland habitats using open-source remote sensing data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping natural habitats remains challenging, especially at a national scale. Although new open-access variables for vegetation and its environment and increased spatial resolution derived from satellite remote sensing data are available at the global scale, the relevance of these new variables for fine-grained mapping of natural habitats at a national scale remains underexplored. This study aimed to map the fine-grained pattern of four heathland habitats throughout France (550 000 km(2)). Environmental (bioclimatic, soil and topographic) and spectral (vegetation) variables derived from MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer, and Sentinel-2 satellite data were analyzed using the MaxEnt classifier. Open-access field databases were used to calibrate and validate the classification, based on the threshold-independent area under the curve (AUC) index and the conventional F1-score. For each heathland habitat, potential and actual areas were mapped using environmental and spectral variables, respectively. The results showed high classification accuracy for potential (AUC 0.92-0.99) and actual (AUC 0.88-0.99) suitability maps of the four heathland habitats. Visual interpretation of maps of the probability of occurrence indicated that the fine-grained distribution of heathland habitat was detected satisfactorily. However, although the accuracy of the crisp map of combined classifications of actual heathland habitats was high (overall accuracy 0.72), estimated producer's accuracies in terms of proportion of area were low (<0.25). This study provides the first fine-grained pattern maps of heathland habitats at a national scale, thus highlighting the value of combining environmental and spectral variables derived from open-remote sensing data and open-source field databases. These suitability maps could support the identification of heathland habitats in the framework of national conservation policies.

TI  - Matching high resolution satellite data and flux tower footprints improves their agreement in photosynthesis estimates
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping canopy photosynthesis in both high spatial and temporal resolution is essential for carbon cycle monitoring in heterogeneous areas. However, well established satellites in sun-synchronous orbits such as Sentinel-2, Landsat and MODIS can only provide either high spatial or high temporal resolution but not both. Recently established CubeSat satellite constellations have created an opportunity to overcome this resolution trade-off. In particular, Planet Fusion allows full utilization of the CubeSat data resolution and coverage while maintaining high radiometric quality. In this study, we used the Planet Fusion surface reflectance product to calculate daily, 3-m resolution, gap-free maps of the near-infrared radiation reflected from vegetation (NIRvP). We then evaluated the performance of these NIRvP maps for estimating canopy photosynthesis by comparing with data from a flux tower network in Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, California, USA. Overall, NIRvP maps captured temporal variations in canopy photosynthesis of individual sites, despite changes in water extent in the wetlands and frequent mowing in the crop fields. When combining data from all sites, however, we found that robust agreement between NIRvP maps and canopy photosynthesis could only be achieved when matching NIRvP maps to the flux tower footprints. In this case of matched footprints, NIRvP maps showed considerably better performance than in situ NIRvP in estimating canopy photosynthesis both for daily sum and data around the time of satellite overpass (R-2 = 0.78 vs. 0.60, for maps vs. in situ for the satellite overpass time case). This difference in performance was mostly due to the higher degree of consistency in slopes of NIRvP-canopy photosynthesis relationships across the study sites for flux tower footprint-matched maps. Our results show the importance of matching satellite observations to the flux tower footprint and demonstrate the potential of CubeSat constellation imagery to monitor canopy photosynthesis remotely at high spatio-temporal resolution.

T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Investigating the land use and land cover (LULC) dynamics and the status of traditional agroforestry practices provide important data for policymakers. The main objective of this study was to assess the LULC dynamics and traditional agroforestry practices among smallholder farmers across the two agro-ecological zones in Wonchi District of Ethiopia. Methods. Landsat images were acquired from Earth Explorer, and changes in LULC were quantified with three Landsat sensors in the three time-series (1985, 2001, and 2019). Supervised classification with maximum likelihood technique was employed using ERDAS Imagine and ArcGIS. A ground survey was conducted with 100 key informants who were selected from 10 sites using a purposive sampling method. The collected data were subjected to direct matrix ranking, use-value analysis of most important multipurpose plant species, and semi-structured interviews were conducted for qualitative analysis. Results. In total, 103 agroforestry plant species belonging to 44 families were identified in Wonchi District, of which 74 were indigenous including seven endemic and 29 exotic species. The highest species (13) were recorded in the Fabaceae family. About 61% of species were reported in the midland agro-ecological zone. A mixed farming system was the most frequently (56%) reported source of income. The results of LULC changes from 1985 to 2019 showed that the agroforestry cover increased from 31.1% to 34.9% and settlement including road construction increased from 12.5% to 31.6% of the total area with an annual rate change of 0.3% and 2.7%, respectively. These changes corresponded with a decreasing trend of the forest, cropland, water body, and shrub at a rate of 4.7%, 1.3%, 0.8%, and 0.5%, respectively. The LULC changes were more pronounced in the highlands than in the midlands of Wonchi District. Expansion of settlement and tenure policy change are the main drivers for these changes in the area. The authors recommended that protecting and planting indigenous and multipurpose plant species is essential as restoration techniques for all degraded land use types. Therefore, strengthening agroforestry practices and land-use planning is urgently needed for achieving multiple goals.

TI  - Chagas Immunochromatographic Rapid Test in the Serological Diagnosis of <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i> Infection in Wild and Domestic Canids
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR AND INFECTION MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Canis lupus familiaris (domestic dog) represents a reliable sentinel for the occurrence of a well-established transmission cycle of Trypanosoma cruzi among wild mammals in the surroundings and, consequently, where the risk of human infection exists. Serological diagnosis is the chosen method to identify T. cruzi infection in dogs that, in Brazil, rarely present positive parasitological tests. The use of recombinant chimeric parasitic antigens results in a sensitive and specific serological diagnostic test in contrast to the use of crude T. cruzi antigens. Our objective was to evaluate the Chagas/Bio-Manguinhos Lateral Flow Immunochromatographic Rapid Test (Chagas-LFRT) for the diagnosis of T. cruzi infection in domestic dogs and the potential of application of this diagnostic platform to wild canid species. Two recombinant proteins (IBMP-8.1 and IBMP-8.4) that displayed the best performance in the enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) in previous studies were tested in a platform with two diagnostic bands. A panel of 281 dog serum samples was evaluated: 133 positive for T. cruzi by serological diagnosis, including 20 samples with positive blood cultures belonging to different discrete typing units (DTUs); 129 negative samples; and 19 samples from dogs infected by other trypanosomatids: Leishmania infantum, Trypanosoma rangeli, Trypanosoma caninum and Crithidia mellificae, in addition to samples infected by Anaplasma platys, Dirofilaria immitis and Erlichia sp. that were employed to evaluate eventual cross-reactions. We also evaluated the Chagas-LFRT to detect T. cruzi infection in 9 serum samples from six wild canid species. We observed that the intensity pattern of the bands was directly proportional to the serological titer observed in IFAT. The sensitivity was 94%, the specificity was 91% according to the ROC curve, and the defined cutoff was an optical density of 4.8. The agreement obtained was considered substantial by the kappa analysis (84%). From T. cruzi positive hemoculture samples, 88.9% were positive by Chagas-LFRT. The test was efficient in recognizing infections by five of the six T. cruzi DTUs. Cross-reactions were not observed in infections by L. infantum, T. rangeli, T. caninum and D. immitis; however, they were observed in sera of dogs infected by Crithidia mellificae, Anaplasma sp. and Erlichia sp. A strong reaction was observed when serum samples from wild canids were submitted to the Protein A affinity test, confirming its applicability for these species. This test will allow rapid preventive actions in areas with high risk to the emergence of Chagas disease in a safer, reliable, low-cost and immediate manner, without the need for more complex laboratory tests.

TI  - Utility of fertility procedures and prenatal tests to estimate gestational age for live-births and stillbirths in electronic health plan databases
T2  - PHARMACOEPIDEMIOLOGY AND DRUG SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Current algorithms to evaluate gestational age (GA) during pregnancy rely on hospital coding at delivery and are not applicable to non-live births. We developed an algorithm using fertility procedures and fertility tests, without relying on delivery coding, to develop a novel GA algorithm in live-births and stillbirths. Methods Three pregnancy cohorts were identified from 16 health-plans in the Sentinel System: 1) hospital admissions for live-birth, 2) hospital admissions for stillbirth, and 3) medical chart-confirmed stillbirths. Fertility procedures and prenatal tests, recommended within specific GA windows were evaluated for inclusion in our GA algorithm. Our GA algorithm was developed against a validated delivery-based GA algorithm in live-births, implemented within a sample of chart-confirmed stillbirths, and compared to national estimates of GA at stillbirth. Results Our algorithm, including fertility procedures and 11 prenatal tests, assigned a GA at delivery to 97.9% of live-births and 92.6% of stillbirths. For live-births (n = 4 701 207), it estimated GA within 2 weeks of a reference delivery-based GA algorithm in 82.5% of pregnancies, with a mean difference of 3.7 days. In chart-confirmed stillbirths (n = 49), it estimated GA within 2 weeks of the clinically recorded GA at delivery for 80% of pregnancies, with a mean difference of 11.1 days. Implementation of the algorithm in a cohort of stillbirths (n = 40 484) had an increased percentage of deliveries after 36 weeks compared to national estimates. Conclusions In a population of primarily commercially-insured pregnant women, fertility procedures and prenatal tests can estimate GA with sufficient sensitivity and accuracy for utility in pregnancy studies.

TI  - Feasibility of variable rate application of diammonium phosphate fertilizer to wheat crop under center pivot irrigation system
T2  - JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A study was conducted, on a 30 ha wheat field under a solar energy powered center pivot irrigation system in a commercial farm located 400 km north of Khartoum, Sudan, to evaluate the feasibility of variable rate fertilizer application of Diammonium Phosphate (DAP) on wheat crop based on variable soil phosphorus content. Soil phosphorus content was divided into three categories (low: 3.75 to 4.50 ppm, medium: 4.51 to 5.25 ppm and high: 5.26 to 6.00 ppm) and a GIS soil phosphorus content map of the experimental field was generated. Three variable application rates (200 kg ha(-1), 160 kg ha(-1) and 120 kg ha(-1)) of granular DAP fertilizer were determined to fit the low, medium and high soil phosphorus contents, respectively. The the DAP fertilizer rate of 200 kg ha(-1) was the rate practiced for wheat production in the experimental farm.The normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), measured at different wheat growth stages using sentinel-2 satellite images, and wheat grain yield were used to evaluate the response of wheat crop to the variable DAP fertilizer application rates. Excluding the tillering stage, the results showed significant differences in the NDVI values among different soil phosphorus levels and DAP fertilizer application rates at other growth stages, including stem elongation, grain filling and maturity stages. Moreover, wheat yield results showed significant differences among different soil phosphorus contents (P > F = 0.0001) and DAP fertilizer application rates (P > F = 0.0457). On the average, the highest yield of 2.449 t ha(-1) was recorded in the field areas treated with the high DAP fertilizer application rate (200 kg ha(-1)), where the second highest yield of 2.441 t ha(-1) was observed in field areas under the medium DAP fertilizer application rate (160 kg ha(-1)); however, no significant differences between these two yield values. Based on these results, the total savings of the DAP fertilizer was estimated to be 792 kg (equivalent to 475.2 $) in the experimental field (30 ha), only when the medium DAP fertilizer rate (160 kg ha(-1)) was used in the medium and high soil phosphorus zones, saving 15.84 $ ha(-1) without affecting production.

TI  - Remote sensing-aided rainfall-runoff modeling in the tropics of Costa Rica
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Streamflow simulation across the tropics is limited by the lack of data to calibrate and validate large-scale hydrological models. Here, we applied the process-based, conceptual HYPE (Hydrological Predictions for the Environment) model to quantitatively assess Costa Rica's water resources at a national scale. Data scarcity was compensated for by using adjusted global topography and remotely sensed climate products to force, calibrate, and independently evaluate the model. We used a global temperature product and bias-corrected precipitation from Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) as model forcings. Daily streamflow from 13 gauges for the period 1990-2003 and monthly Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) potential evapotranspiration (PET) and actual evapotranspiration (AET) for the period 2000-2014 were used to calibrate and evaluate the model applying four different model configurations (M1, M2, M3, M4). The calibration consisted of step-wise parameter constraints preserving the best parameter sets from previous simulations in an attempt to balance the variable data availability and time periods. The model configurations were independently evaluated using hydrological signatures such as the baseflow index, runoff coefficient, and aridity index, among others. Results suggested that a two-step calibration using monthly and daily streamflow (M2) was a better option than calibrating only with daily streamflow (M1), with similar mean Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE similar to 0.53) for daily streamflow time series, but with improvements to reproduce the flow duration curves, with a median root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.42 for M2 and a median RMSE of 1.15 for M1. Additionally, including AET (M3 and M4) in the calibration statistically improved the simulated water balance and better matched hydrological signatures, with a mean KGE of 0.49 for KGE in M3-M4, in comparison to M1-M2 with mean KGE < 0.3. Furthermore, Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney statistical tests support a similar model performance for M3 and M4, suggesting that monthly PET-AET and daily streamflow (M3) represents an appropriate calibration sequence for regional modeling. Such a large-scale hydrological model has the potential to be used operationally across the humid tropics informing decision-making at relatively high spatial and temporal resolution.

TI  - Verifying the predictive performance for soil organic carbon when employing field Vis-NIR spectroscopy and satellite imagery obtained using two different sampling methods
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - In soil research, the most employed sampling design techniques can be categorized as random sampling (stratified or simple random (SR)) or systematic techniques (transects or grid). Many other sampling approaches have also been developed by researchers based on these sampling principles. The purpose of this study is to compare the differences in SOC prediction when using field spectra (FS) and Sentinel-2 (S2) data collected separately through SR and grid design (GD) on the same agricultural field. Additionally, the impact of spectral indices on S2 data in a merged data approach under the two-sampling strategies will also be tested. The data for each sampling method were obtained based on a previous study in which 130 soil samples were collected from a full grid design (with 40 m spacing) covering the entire area. Although the full GD method was used for this current study, the distance between the samples was increased (80 m apart). The schemes were therefore structured for the collection of 65 samples in the field for each sampling technique. However, 63 samples were collected with the GD because two of the sampling points fell on rocky areas and were eliminated accordingly. For SR sampling, the study field was not stratified, and no requirements were used for minimum sample spacing. Sixty-five samples and spectral data were collected at various locations. To achieve the mentioned objective, this study builds a fivefold cross-validation model based on support vector machines (SVMs). Different pretreatment combinations were also implemented. The results showed that the GD was better than the SR approach using the merged dataset (R-CV(2) = 0.45, RMSECV = 0.26, RPD = 1.41, bias =-0.0073); however, SOC prediction under SR sampling using FS yielded the highest accuracy and lowest error margin (R-CV(2) = 0.60, RMSECV = 0.21, RPD = 1.66, and bias = 0.0045). Despite the above-mentioned disparity between the single and merged data, this study shows that using different sampling design methods on the same field separately is a very promising approach for SOC estimation, particularly in fields with low SOC. Based on these results, the robustness of this approach should be investigated next in future studies using larger sample sizes as well as other modeling techniques. Based on these results, the robustness of this approach should be investigated next in future studies using larger sample sizes as well as other modeling techniques.

TI  - Detection of Rift Valley Fever Virus Lineage H From South Africa Through the Syndromic Sentinel Surveillance Network in Senegal
T2  - OPEN FORUM INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is an arbovirus that causes epizootics and epidemics among livestock population and humans. Our surveillance system has revealed multiple emergences and re-emergences of RVFV in West Africa over the last decade. Methods The Sentinel Syndromic Surveillance Network in Senegal (4S) has been implemented since 2011. Samples from human suspected arbovirus infection in 4S sentinel sites were sent to Institut Pasteur de Dakar (IPD), where arbovirus diagnosis by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and virus isolation was performed. Overall, IPD has received a total of 1149 samples from arboviral suspected patients through the 4S network from January to December 2020. These samples were screened for 7 arboviruses including RVFV. Whole-genome sequencing of positive RVFV samples by RT-PCR was performed using the Illumina Miseq platform followed by genome assembly. Phylogenetic analyses were performed using MEGA X. Results Out of the 1149 arbovirus suspected cases, 4 RVFV-positive samples were detected with RT-PCR while 5 RVFV-positive samples were detected by ELISA. Complete genome sequences were obtained for 3 strains among the 4 positive samples by RT-PCR. Phylogenetic analyses indicated an emergence of a virus first described in South Africa during a major outbreak. Conclusions This strong surveillance system allowed the detection of an RVFV outbreak in Senegal in 2020. The obtained genomes clustered with strains from South Africa belonging to lineage H. This calls for implementation of a strong surveillance system for wild animals, humans, and livestock simultaneously in all African countries.D/C/F/TAF is the reference for combination therapy based on protease inhibitors but has not been compared with regimens containing integrase inhibitors as initial ART. We could not demonstrate D/C/F/TAF noninferiority relative to DTG/ABC/3TC, although both regimens were similarly well tolerated.

TI  - Biophysical parameter estimation of crops from polarimetric synthetic aperture radar imagery with data-driven polynomial chaos expansion and global sensitivity analysis
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Data-driven machine learning regression methods are easy to implement and applicable to a wide-range of data in biophysical parameter estimation and have become a common approach in the remote sensing field. Among the regression methods, polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) is one of the reliable and interesting ones due to its tight relationship with uncertainty quantification. One of the advantages of PCE is that global sensitivity analysis (GSA) with Sobol's method can be analytically computed from polynomial coefficients if the input space is statistically independent. However, most of the phenomena include dependent features either statistically or physically. Though the physical independence is provided between inputs, they must be statistically uncorrelated. Therefore, an independent and uncorrelated input space must be created before the regression analysis. In this paper, we performed PCE-based regression analysis for the estimation of biophysical parameters of crops. The study was conducted in the experimental fields of field pea, barley, canola, and oat of the AgriSAR2009 campaign. The input parameters of the regression model were formed by creating polarimetric features derived from RADARSAT-2 imagery. The estimated biophysical parameters were based on the discrete in situ measurements of leaf area index (LAI) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), scattered semi-randomly in each crop field. We implemented neighbourhood component analysis (NCA) to create an independent and uncorrelated input space by eliminating correlations. Finally, we investigated the importance of features, which drive the PCE-based regression models applying GSA with Sobol's method. Besides the individual effects of each feature, their interactions were found significant.

TI  - Revised German guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of carcinoma of the uterine cervix-what's new for pathologists in 2021?
T2  - PATHOLOGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2021, the 2015 German consensus guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of uterine cervical carcinoma was updated. The present article summarises the new recommendations for pathologists: the incorporation of the International Endocervical Adenocarcinoma Classification (IECC), which morphologically separates HPV-associated and non-HPV-associated adenocarcinomas, as well as the reporting of the prognostic relevant growth pattern of the adenocarcinoma of the endocervical subtype (Silva pattern). Histologically, multifocality has been defined as the presence of clearly invasive foci with a minimum distance between each focus of 0.2 cm. Because of its intratumoural heterogeneity, all carcinomas <= 2 cm in their largest dimension should be processed completely, and tumours > 2 cm should be processed with one block per centimetre of their greatest dimension. In cases of (radical) trachelectomy/hysterectomy, the distal vaginal resection margin and all parametrial tissue should be processed completely. Sentinel lymph nodes have to be processed completely by lamellation along its long axis in 0.2 cm intervals. Immunohistochemical ultrastaging is mandatory. Staging should be performed using the 2009 FIGO classification and 2017 TNM classification. Reporting the revised 2018 FIGO classification is optional. To date, molecular markers have not been relevant for prognostication and treatment decision making.

TI  - Spatio-temporal development of large-scale auroral electrojet currents relative to substorm onsets
T2  - ANNALES GEOPHYSICAE
M3  - Article
AB  - During auroral substorms, the electric currents flowing in the ionosphere change rapidly, and a large amount of energy is dissipated in the auroral ionosphere. An important part of the auroral current system is the auroral electrojets whose profiles can be estimated from magnetic field measurements from low-earth orbit satellites. In this paper, we combine electrojet data derived from the Swarm satellite mission of the European Space Agency with the substorm database derived from the SuperMAG ground magnetometer network data. We organize the electrojet data in relation to the location and time of the onset and obtain statistics for the development of the integrated current and latitudinal location for the auroral electrojets relative to the onset. The major features of the behaviour of the westward electrojet are found to be in accordance with earlier studies of field-aligned currents and ground magnetometer observations of substorm temporal statistics. In addition, we show that, after the onset, the latitudinal location of the maximum of the westward electrojet determined from Swarm satellite data is mostly located close to the SuperMAG onset latitude in the local time sector of the onset regardless of where the onset happens. We also show that the SuperMAG onset corresponds to a strengthening of the order of 100 kA in the amplitude of the median of the westward integrated current in the Swarm data from 15 min before to 15 min after the onset.

TI  - Episode 4 (2019-2020) Nishinoshima activity: abrupt transitions in the eruptive style observed by image datasets from multiple satellites
T2  - EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - In December 2019, a new activity started at Nishinoshima volcano in the southern part of the Izu-Ogasawara arc, Japan. This is now referred to as Episode 4 of a series of activities that began in 2013. We analyzed the eruption sequence, including erupted volume and effusion rate, based on combined observations of thermal anomalies by Himawari-8 and topographic changes by ALOS-2. The total eruption volume during Episode 4 was similar to 132 x 10(6) m(3), and the average effusion rate over the entire period was 0.51 x 10(6) m(3) day(-1) (5.9 m(3) s(-1)), which was two to three times higher than that of Episode 1. Episode 4 had three stages. In Stage 1, effusive activity was dominant, and most of the lava erupted from a northeast vent at the foot of the pyroclastic cone to cover the northern half of the island. The average effusion rate was estimated to be 0.46 x 10(6) m(3) day(-1) (5.3 m(3) s(-1)). In Stage 2, an intensive lava fountain with a high discharge rate developed, and it increased the size of the pyroclastic cone rapidly. The effusion rate temporarily reached 2.6 x 10(6) m(3) day(-1) (30 m(3) s(-1)). Pyroclastic rocks accounted for 45-88% of the total erupted volume in this stage. Lava flows with rafted cone material were generated, and those possibly caused by intensive spatter falls on the slope were also formed. These lavas flowed down the southern half of the island. In Stage 3, continuous phreatomagmatic eruptions released ash and spread it over a wide area. The high effusion rate and the drastic change in the activity style in Episode 4 can be explained by deep volatile-rich magma being supplied to a shallower magma chamber prior to Episode 4. When the volatile-rich magma reached a shallow part of the conduit in Stage 2, fragmentation occurred due to rapid volume expansion to eject large amounts of magma and form the intensive lava fountain. Observations by satellite-borne ultraviolet-visible image sensors detected a rapid increase in SO2 emissions in response to the intensive lava-fountain activity. The less-differentiated nature of the ash fragments collected during Stage 2 may reflect the composition of the volatile-rich magma. Large-scale discolored-seawater areas appeared during the late period of Stage 1, which may have been caused by ascent of the volatile-rich magma.[GRAPHICS].

TI  - Size-frequency measurements of meter-sized craters and boulders in the lunar polar regions for landing-site selections of future lunar polar missions
T2  - ICARUS
M3  - Article
AB  - The concentrations of volatiles, especially hydrogen (or water), at the lunar poles have been reported from remote sensing data in previous studies. Many future missions are targeting to investigate the permanently shadowed regions inside polar craters, where water ice can exist because the temperature is extremely low. Accordingly, landing sites are being planned around polar craters. We conducted a geomorphological analysis of the ejecta blankets of Shackleton Crater at the South Pole (89.63 degrees S, 130.0 degrees E) and Whipple Crater at the North Pole (89.14 N degrees, 119.5 degrees E). Size-frequency measurements of the craters and boulders were derived from high resolution (~1 m/pix) image data obtained by the Narrow Angle Camera onboard the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. The number of identified craters (diameter > 10 m) and boulders (diameter > 3 m) were 35,799 and 1273, respectively, around Shackleton and 17,074 and 3092, respectively, around Whipple. The number densities of boulders around fresh craters on Shackleton and Whipple rim are lower than at the Apollo and Luna landing sites, suggesting a low production rate of boulders in these regions. The number density of small craters is lower than expected from the formation ages of Shackleton and Whipple and is strongly correlated with regional topographic slopes, implying that small craters were eliminated by resurfacing with mass wasting from the continuous ejecta of Shackleton and Whipple. Ejecta blankets from small craters may cover and preserve past subsurface accumulations of water molecules. Based on the crater counting data, we propose feasible landing sites around Shackleton Crater and scenarios for exploring local subsurface water using excavators in future missions.

TI  - Infrequent detection of unintentional fentanyl use via urinalysis among people who regularly inject opioids in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia
T2  - ADDICTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and aim The current phase of the North American 'opioid crisis' is characterised by illicit fentanyl use; however, the presence of illicit fentanyl in Australia is unknown. This study aimed to monitor unintentional fentanyl consumption in Australia. Design Rapid urine drug screens (UDS) paired with surveys conducted within supervised injecting facilities (SIFs) and confirmatory laboratory testing. Setting Sydney and Melbourne, Australia. Participants Clients who used heroin within the past 2 days (n = 911 tests, 2017-2021). Participants were demographically similar to the overall client base (median age 43, 72% male). Measurements UDS were conducted using BTNX Rapid Response fentanyl urine strip tests with cross-reactivity to numerous fentanyl analogues. Positive urine samples were analysed using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Surveys covered past 3 day drug use and lifetime report of fentanyl in heroin. Findings Two percent of participants reported intentional use of fentanyl, mostly through fentanyl patches. Of the 911 rapid UDS conducted, 17 (1.9%) yielded positive results. Eight of these (all from Melbourne) were not explained by survey-reported fentanyl use in the past 3 days. Of these 8 unexplained positives, confirmatory laboratory analysis was conducted on 6, with 4 deemed to be false positives, and 2 confirmed for the presence of fentanyl. This represents the first confirmation of unintended use of fentanyl type substances in this population. Conclusion There is limited evidence of unintentional fentanyl use among people in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia who regularly inject heroin, suggesting that, currently, there is very little illicit fentanyl in Australian drug markets accessed by supervised injecting facilities attendees. This study demonstrates the feasibility of quick onsite testing to cost-effectively screen large samples for fentanyl; however, the high false positive rate emphasises the need for confirmation of positive tests through advanced analytical techniques.

TI  - Deep-learning-based post-process correction of the aerosol parameters in the high-resolution Sentinel-3 Level-2 Synergy product
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based aerosol retrievals provide global spatially distributed estimates of atmospheric aerosol parameters that are commonly needed in applications such as estimation of atmospherically corrected satellite data products, climate modelling and air quality monitoring. However, a common feature of the conventional satellite aerosol retrievals is that they have reasonably low spatial resolution and poor accuracy caused by uncertainty in auxiliary model parameters, such as fixed aerosol model parameters, and the approximate forward radiative transfer models utilized to keep the computational complexity feasible. As a result, the improvement and reprocessing of the operational satellite data retrieval algorithms would become a tedious and computationally excessive problem. To overcome these problems, we have developed a machine-learning-based post-process correction approach to correct the existing operational satellite aerosol data products. Our approach combines the existing satellite retrieval data and a post-processing step where a machine learning algorithm is utilized to predict the approximation error in the conventional retrieval. With approximation error, we refer to the discrepancy between the true aerosol parameters and the ones retrieved using the satellite data. Our hypothesis is that the prediction of the approximation error with a finite training dataset is a less complex and easier task than the direct, fully learned machine-learning-based prediction in which the aerosol parameters are directly predicted given the satellite observations and measurement geometry. Our approach does not require reprocessing of the satellite retrieval products; it requires only a computationally fast machine-learning-based post-processing step of the existing retrieval product. Our approach is based on neural networks trained based on collocated satellite data and accurate ground-based Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) aerosol data. Based on our post-processing approach, we propose a post-process-corrected high-resolution Sentinel-3 Synergy aerosol product, which gives a spectral estimate of the aerosol optical depth at five different wavelengths with a high spatial resolution equivalent to the native resolution of the Sentinel-3 Level-1 data (300m at nadir). With aerosol data from Sentinel-3A and 3B satellites, we demonstrate that our approach produces high-resolution aerosol data with clearly better accuracy than the operational Sentinel-3 Level-2 Synergy aerosol product, and it also results in slightly better accuracy than the conventional fully learned machine learning approach. We also demonstrate better generalization capabilities of the post-process correction approach over the fully learned approach.

TI  - Cloud-probability-based estimation of black-sky surface albedo from AVHRR data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes a new method for cloud-correcting observations of black-sky surface albedo derived using the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). Cloud cover constitutes a major challenge for surface albedo estimation using AVHRR data for all possible conditions of cloud fraction and cloud type with any land cover type and solar zenith angle. This study shows how the new cloud probability (CP) data to be provided as part of edition A3 of the CLARA (CM SAF cLoud, Albedo and surface Radiation dataset from AVHRR data) record from the Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring (CM SAF) project of EUMETSAT can be used instead of traditional binary cloud masking to derive cloud-free monthly mean surface albedo estimates. Cloudy broadband albedo distributions were simulated first for theoretical cloud distributions and then using global cloud probability (CP) data for 1 month. A weighted mean approach based on the CP values was shown to produce very-high-accuracy black-sky surface albedo estimates for simulated data. The 90 % quantile for the error was 1.1 % (in absolute albedo percentage) and that for the relative error was 2.2 %. AVHRR-based and in situ albedo distributions were in line with each other and the monthly mean values were also consistent. Comparison with binary cloud masking indicated that the developed method improves cloud contamination removal.

T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - A deep neural network (DNN), evolved from a traditional artificial neural network, has been seamlessly adapted for the spatial data domain over the years. Deep learning (DL) has been widely applied for a number of applications and a variety of thematic domains. This article reports on a systematic review of methods adapted in major DNN applications with remote sensing data published between 2010 and 2020 aiming to understand the major application area, a framework for model development and the prospect of DL application in spatial data analysis. It has been found that image fusion, change detection, scene classification, image segmentation, and feature detection are the most commonly used application areas. Based on the publication in these thematic areas, a generic framework has been devised to guide a model development using DL based on the methods followed in the past. Finally, recent trends and prospects in terms of data, method, and application of deep learning with remote sensing data are discussed. The review finds that while DL-based approaches have the potential to unfold hidden information, they face challenges in selecting the most appropriate data, methods, and model parameterizations which may hinder the performance. The increasing trend of application of DL in the spatial domain is expected to leverage its strength at its optimum to the research frontiers.

TI  - SAR Offset Tracking Based on Feature Points
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The offset tracking approach has been widely used to measure large ground deformation as a complement to Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) when its coherence is poor and/or the deformation gradient is large. The standard offset tracking procedures estimate deformation of tie points, which are uniformly distributed over two SAR images, resulting in many unsatisfactory measurements. In this paper, we propose a feature point offset tracking (FPOT) procedure to overcome the limitation of the standard method. First, we identify feature points using the Speeded Up Robust Feature (SURF) algorithm. Improper feature points are masked using external land coverage information like water coverages. Then, we use the standard cross-correlation algorithm to find offsets of the remaining feature points between reference and secondary images. The offset outliers are removed using a quadtree filtering. Finally, the resultant deformation field is generated by removing systematic offsets estimated with far-field feature points. We assess the effectiveness of our proposed procedure using the 2016 Mw 7.8 Kaikoura earthquake in New Zealand. In far-field where deformation is expected to be negligible, histograms of offset distribution show that the root-mean-square error (RMSE) is decreased from 0.07 pixels to 0.02-0.03 pixels for regular points and feature points, respectively, after quadtree filtering. The RMSE between our FPOT-derived offsets and GPS measurements are 0.14 and 0.48 m for range and azimuth offsets, respectively. The results show that our proposed procedure can significantly improve the efficiency, accuracy, and reliability with respect to the standard regular point offset tracking (RPOT).

TI  - Fire-Net: A Deep Learning Framework for Active Forest Fire Detection
T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest conservation is crucial for the maintenance of a healthy and thriving ecosystem. The field of remote sensing (RS) has been integral with the wide adoption of computer vision and sensor technologies for forest land observation. One critical area of interest is the detection of active forest fires. A forest fire, which occurs naturally or manually induced, can quickly sweep through vast amounts of land, leaving behind unfathomable damage and loss of lives. Automatic detection of active forest fires (and burning biomass) is hence an important area to pursue to avoid unwanted catastrophes. Early fire detection can also be useful for decision makers to plan mitigation strategies as well as extinguishing efforts. In this paper, we present a deep learning framework called Fire-Net, that is trained on Landsat-8 imagery for the detection of active fires and burning biomass. Specifically, we fuse the optical (Red, Green, and Blue) and thermal modalities from the images for a more effective representation. In addition, our network leverages the residual convolution and separable convolution blocks, enabling deeper features from coarse datasets to be extracted. Experimental results show an overall accuracy of 97.35%, while also being able to robustly detect small active fires. The imagery for this study is taken from Australian and North American forests regions, the Amazon rainforest, Central Africa and Chernobyl (Ukraine), where forest fires are actively reported.

TI  - Multiple objective metaheuristics for feature selection based on stakeholder requirements in credit scoring
T2  - DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Alternative data is increasingly utilized for credit evaluation of financially excluded persons. However, requirements, such as reliability, which gain new importance when alternative data is employed for credit evaluation, have not been considered as part of the credit scoring process. This research proposes an approach for incorporating context-specific stakeholder requirements in the credit scoring process. Two hybrid heuristics are proposed for a feature selection process that simultaneously optimizes all requirements. The first is a multiple objective, non-dominated sorting, binary Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm. The second incorporates the selection, crossover, and mutation techniques of genetic algorithms for greater diversity. Both algorithms are fitted with objective functions obtained from stakeholder requirements for multiple objective feature selection. Empirical evaluation is conducted with stakeholder requirements and alternative data features collected from mobile, public geospatial, and satellite data sources. Their performance is compared against several existing algorithms, and they offer improved performance on specific metrics. The first algorithm outperforms the existing many-objective non dominated sorting genetic algorithm, NSGA-III, in terms of computational time, convergence, and spacing. Meanwhile, the second method results in greater spread for the same population size but has a lengthy computational time. Thus, stakeholder requirements are successfully incorporated into the feature selection process. This results in a better balance between objectives. These findings extend the research on hybrid metaheuristics for feature selection, as well as alternative data for credit scoring.

TI  - DSWEmod - The Production of High-Frequency Surface Water Map Composites from Daily MODIS Images
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical satellite imagery is commonly used for monitoring surface water dynamics, but clouds and cloud shadows present challenges in assembling complete water time series. To test whether the daily revisit rate of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery can reduce cloud obstruction and improve high-frequency surface water mapping, we compared map results derived from Landsat (30-m) and MODIS (250-m) data across the state of California for 2003-2019. We adapted the Dynamic Surface Water Extent (DSWE) model in Google Earth Engine to generate surface water map composites from MODIS imagery every 5, 10, 15, and 30 days, and compared products to monthly Landsat-based DSWE maps. Results for DSWEmod (DSWE MODIS) in California suggest that more than 5% data loss (cloud obstruction, etc.) was present in only 2% of the 15-day time series, as compared to 32% of the monthly Landsat DSWE time series. The five-day DSWEmod composites averaged 8.4% obscuration in the winter months. Area estimates derived from cloud-filtered MODIS and Landsat monthly products have the highest linear correlations compared to streamgage discharge records, suggesting that monthly scale analyses best explain the relationship between surface water area and general streamflow dynamics. Shorter-interval DSWEmod products have lower correlations but utility for understanding the timing of surface water peaks and past flood events.

TI  - Comprehensive LiDAR simulation with efficient physically-based DART-Lux model (I): Theory, novelty, and consistency validation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) remote sensing is increasingly needed to assess the 3D architecture of Earth's surface. Physically-based LiDAR radiative transfer (RT) models are essential tools for interpreting LiDAR signals, designing LiDAR systems, and validating information retrieval methods. Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) is one of the most accurate and comprehensive 3D RT models that simulate LiDAR signals of urban and natural landscapes. Its physical modeling relies on a forward Monte Carlo mode optimized by a ray-tracking technique, also called DART-RC (Ray Carlo) mode. However, DART-RC is not adapted to simulate massive LiDAR signals of large landscapes due to its constraints of high memory demand and long computational time. Therefore, we developed a novel computationally efficient LiDAR modeling method based on a new DART modeling mode called DART-Lux. It simulates LiDAR signal by adapting the bidirectional path tracing algorithm of DART-Lux to the time and power measurements and by implementing the LiDAR instrument and multiple product outputs in DART-Lux. We verified the accuracy of DART-Lux for LiDAR modeling using DART-RC as a reference for several case studies with different LiDAR configurations (i.e., single-pulse waveform, multi-pulse point cloud, multi-pulse photon counting, with and without solar signal) on realistic scenes from the RAMI experiment. Results stress that i) DART-Lux is consistent with DART-RC, for example, R-2 = 1 and rRMSE = 0.21% for the waveform of a forest simulated with a huge number of rays; ii) DART-Lux converges faster than DART-RC: its processing time is usually about half that of DART-RC, and over ten times smaller if the solar signal is simulated; iii) DART-Lux memory usage can be a hundred times less than DART-RC. Also, several sensitivity studies with various sensor configurations and solar directions illustrate the usefulness of DART-Lux for impact studies. This new DART-Lux LiDAR model opens promising perspectives for large-scale LiDAR applications with 3D modeling. It is already part of the official DART version freely available to scientists (https://dart.omp.eu).

TI  - Mapping of soil organic carbon using machine learning models: Combination of optical and radar remote sensing data
T2  - SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic C (SOC) plays an important role in soil quality. Thus, it is of great significance to know the spatial distribution characteristics of SOC. Environmental variables, such as natural predictors, remote sensing (RS) variables, and digital soil mapping approaches have been widely used in SOC prediction. However, it is still challenging to determine which methods and variables are effective to map SOC in farmland. In this study, we compare the performance of three machine learning models, including random forest, Cubist, and the support vector machine model for the prediction of SOC contents using RS variables, topographic variables, climate variables, soil property variables, and spatial position variables as environmental covariates. The recursive feature elimination (RFE) technique was used to select optimal variables. Of the 130 sampling sites of the cultivated layer that were collected in Shanggao county, 70% of the data were used for training and 30% for validation. Prediction accuracy and uncertainty was quantified using the bootstrap approach with 100 iterations. The performance of the model was verified by the mean absolute error, RMSE, R-2, and Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (CCC); the SD was used as a measure of prediction uncertainty. Results showed that the Cubist model combined with the RFE method (Cubist_RFE) had a mean R-2, RMSE, and SD of .84, 2.39 g kg(-1), and 0.73 g kg(-1), respectively, which showed the highest prediction accuracy and the lowest uncertainty. The soil property variables (soil alkaline hydrolysis N and pH) and RS variables (soil adjusted vegetation index, enhanced vegetation index, and band7 of Sentinel-2) were the controlling factors of SOC prediction. Thus, the results indicate the potential of the Cubist model in SOC prediction, and the combination of the optical and radar RS data is a viable way for predicting SOC.

TI  - A cost-effective method for producing spatially continuous high-resolution air temperature information in urban environments
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable city planning requires detailed information on spatial temperature variations. Remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST) is known to differ substantially from air tem-perature (AT) causing misinterpretations of the ambient conditions. We demonstrate a reliable and cost-efficient method for AT modelling in urban environments using open data and few temperature observations. The study area is the city of Turku SW Finland, where we have a dense in situ AT observation network of 64 Onset Hobo temperature loggers as a reference. Landsat 8 thermal data from different seasons were used to extract pixel-based LST by employing MODIS and ASTER emissivity libraries and CORINE land cover classification. The LSTs were analysed against the in situ AT first with the correlation analysis. Except for December, the Pearson's correlation coefficients were statistically significant (0.449-0.654, p <= 0.001). Seasonally adjusted linear regression models were applied to predict spatially continuous air temperatures (AT(p)) based on the extracted LST. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to predict urban ATs reliably - within ca. half-a-degree accuracy (MAE 0.36-0.62 degrees C). The prediction works best in spring, summer and autumn. It improves the capacity to produce reliable high spatial resolution AT information even if in situ observations are sparse.

TI  - The value of remotely sensed vs. field-surveyed habitat structure for predicting bird abundance: a case study in traditional orchards
T2  - JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding environmental effects on the distribution and abundance of species is central to ecology, biogeography and evolutionary biology. This led to the development of species distribution models (SDMs) that relate spatial variation in occurrence and abundance to environmental variables. So far, SDMs rarely considered habitat structure, as a major determinant of bird distributions. While remote sensing increasingly provides high-resolution measures of habitat structure, certain structural variables affecting bird abundance still need to be measured with field surveys. In this study, we compare the value of remotely sensed vs. field-surveyed habitat structure for predicting bird abundance. Specifically, we analysed abundance data for nine bird species of traditional orchards in South-Western Germany. 'Remote sensing SDMs' related abundance to structural variables obtained by aerial photogrammetry of individual orchard trees. Alternative 'field survey SDMs' related bird abundance to detailed field surveys of the species composition and pruning state of orchard trees. Additionally, both remote sensing and field survey SDMs included climate and land use variables. Accounting for detailed habitat structure improved abundance predictions for seven of nine study species compared to models only incorporating climate and land use. The impact on model performance differed between remotely sensed and field-surveyed variables: the former improved abundance models for most (n = 7) bird species, whereas the latter had more variable impact, decreasing model performance for five species. The remotely sensed variable with strongest effects was overall tree density, which positively affected abundance of seven species. In contrast, multiple field-surveyed variables had similar effect strength, with the overall strongest effect found for pear tree density, to which seven bird species showed a unimodal response. These analyses have conservation implications since they predict expected responses of bird species to ongoing changes in orchard structure. Moreover, they identify structural variables that will be most promising to measure via remote sensing data in the future.

TI  - Fish parasites can reflect environmental quality in fish farms
T2  - REVIEWS IN AQUACULTURE
M3  - Review
AB  - In the aquatic environment, fish are subject to different pollutants and environmental variations that favour stress on animals, making them vulnerable to pathogens. Fish parasites are excellent biological indicators of environmental quality, as their parasitic population may increase or decrease in response to changes in water parameters and/or the presence of pollutants. Ectoparasites are considered excellent indicators of environmental quality because they have a monoxenic life cycle with high reproductive rates that have been responsible for the immediate response to changes in aquatic biota. In turn, parasites with a heteroxenous life cycle are also responsive to environmental variation because, with the mortality of intermediate hosts, their population can be easily changed. However, studies with endoparasites and their relation with the environment are more numerous, as they are accumulators of pollutants, especially trace elements, either via fish or through stages of development outside the host that also contribute to the accumulation of metals. Moreover, Digenea, Acanthocephala, Nematoda and Cestoda parasites can compete for trace elements that are bioavailable in the environment, as fish with a greater abundance of parasites have a lower concentration of toxic metals in their tissues. Furthermore, they have a high affinity for trace elements that are toxic to human and fish health (arsenic, mercury, lead and cadmium). This review is a comprehensive overview of the use of fish parasites as environmental sentinels and describes their potential as bioindicators of effect and accumulation, and evaluates their application in fish farms environments.

TI  - No axillary surgical treatment for lymph node-negative patients after ultra-sonography [NAUTILUS]: protocol of a prospective randomized clinical trial
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Following sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), the axillary recurrence rate is very low although SLNB has a false-negative rate of 5-10%. In the ACOSOG Z0011 trial, non-sentinel positive-lymph nodes were found in more than 20% of the axillary dissection group; the SLNB only group did not have a higher axillary recurrence rate. These findings raised questions about the direct therapeutic effect of the SLNB. SLNB has post-surgical complications including lymphedema. Considering advances in imaging modalities and adjuvant therapies, the role of SLNB in early breast cancer needs to be re-evaluated.Methods: The NAUTILUS trial is a prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial involving clinical stage T1-2 and N0 breast cancer patients receiving breast-conserving surgery. Axillary ultrasound is mandatory before surgery with predefined imaging criteria for inclusion. Ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy or needle aspiration of a suspicious node is allowed. Patients will be randomized (1:1) into the no-SLNB (test) and SLNB (control) groups. A total of 1734 patients are needed, considering a 5% non-inferiority margin, 5% significance level, 80% statistical power, and 10% dropout rate. All patients in the two groups will receive ipsilateral whole-breast radiation according to a predefined protocol. The primary endpoint of this trial is the 5-year invasive disease-free survival. The secondary endpoints are overall survival, distant metastasis-free survival, axillary recurrence rate, and quality of life of the patients.Discussion: This trial will provide important evidence on the oncological safety of the omission of SLNB for early breast cancer patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery and receiving whole-breast radiation, especially when the axillary lymph node is not suspicious during preoperative axillary ultrasound.

TI  - Increasing loss of mature boreal forests around protected areas with red-listed forest species
T2  - ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Protected areas (PA) are central to biodiversity, but their efficiency is challenged by human-induced habitat loss and fragmentation. In the Fennoscandian boreal region, forestry with clearcutting is a threat to biodiversity causing the loss of mature forest elements and deterioration of ecological processes in forest landscapes, ultimately affecting PAs via declined structural connectivity. This paper aims to (1) determine PAs with high, red-listed species concentrations; (2) estimate the change in forest habitat around these PAs on different spatial scales; and (3) determine if forest management intensity is higher around biologically most valuable PAs. Occurrences of red-listed forest-dwelling species in Finland were used to identify PAs harbouring these species and to produce site-specific importance indices. CORINE landcover data was used as a baseline for the distribution of forests to assess the cover of clear-cuttings from 2001 to 2019 with the Global Forest Change (GFC) data set in three buffer areas around the PAs with occurrences of red-listed species. Results The largest proportion of clear-cuts occurred in 1 km and 10 km buffers around the PAs in the southern and middle boreal zones, being ca. 20%. This indicates that the forest habitat is degrading fast at regional and landscape levels. On the positive side, the change in forest cover was lower around the biologically most important PAs compared to other PAs with red-listed species. Conclusions Open and free satellite-data based assessments of the cover and change of forests provide reliable estimates about the rates at which mature and old-growth forests are being converted into young managed ones in Finland mainly via clear-cuts on different scales around PAs. The rate of clear-cuts was lowest in adjacent buffer areas next to the most species-rich PAs, which provides opportunities for biodiversity conservation efforts to be targeted to the remaining mature and old-growth forests found in the vicinity of these areas.

TI  - Continental-scale biomass redistribution by migratory birds in response to seasonal variation in productivity
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim Animal migration is often explained as the result of resource tracking in seasonally dynamic environments. Therefore, resource availability should influence both the distributions of migratory animals and their seasonal abundance. We examined the relationship between primary productivity and the spatio-temporal distributions of migratory birds to assess the role of energy availability in avian migration. Location North America. Time period Full annual cycle, 2011-2016. Major taxa studied Nocturnally migrating landbirds. Methods We used observations of nocturnally migrating landbirds from the eBird community-science programme to estimate weekly spatial distributions of total biomass, abundance and species richness. We related these patterns to primary productivity and seasonal productivity surplus estimated using a remotely sensed measure of vegetation greenness. Results All three avian metrics showed positive spatial associations with primary productivity, and this was more pronounced with seasonal productivity surplus. Surprisingly, biomass showed a weaker association than did abundance and richness, despite being a better indicator of energetic requirements. The strength of associations varied across seasons, being the weakest during migration. During spring migration, avian biomass increased ahead of vegetation green-up in temperate regions, a pattern also previously described for herbivorous waterfowl. In the south-eastern USA, spring green-up was instead associated with a net decrease in biomass, and winter biomass greatly exceeded that of summer, highlighting the region as a winter refuge for short-distance migrants. Main conclusions Although instantaneous energy availability is important in shaping the distribution of migratory birds, the stronger association of productivity with abundance and richness than with biomass suggests the role of additional drivers unrelated to energetic requirements that are nonetheless correlated with productivity. Given recent reports of widespread North American avifaunal declines, including many common species that winter in the south-eastern USA, understanding how anthropogenic activities are impacting winter bird populations in the region should be a research priority.

TI  - Radio-Frequency Identifier Devices (RFIDs): Our Experience With Wireless Localisation in Nonpalpable Breast Masses at a UK Tertiary Breast Imaging Unit
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this report is to evaluate the impact of the percutaneous ultrasound- guided placement of wireless radio-frequency identifier devices (RFIDs; Hologic LOCalizer, Marlborough, Massachusett) and its impact in our practice of preoperative localisation of biopsy-proven breast cancers, post-vacuum assisted biopsy-site hematoma, and lymph nodes for targeted dissection pre-operatively.A single institutional retrospective analysis of RFID usage for preoperative localisation in screening and symptomatic patients with non-palpable biopsy-proven breast carcinoma was reviewed from the radiology information system at our tertiary breast imaging unit. Its impact on the radiological and surgical team practice was reviewed, including the number of appointments, the interval between scheduling imageguided localisation and intraoperative localisation, procedure failure, average deployment, and surgical time. Feedback from surgeons and pathologists practice was also taken into consideration.Fifty-nine RFID clips were placed for wireless localisation of breast cancers, lymph nodes, and postvacuum-assisted biopsy hematoma over nine months. Seventy-three per cent (73%; n=43/59) of RFID devices were placed in biopsy-proven carcinomas under direct ultrasound guidance. The learning curve was small, as the delivery system was similar to the commonly used localisation clips.The pilot process involved RFID with radioisotope injections for the breast mass for the initial 28% (n=12 /43) cases, which were gradually transitioned into RFID only. Radioisotope was used for sentinel node purposes if required. For targeted node dissection, 3% (n=2/59) patients received RFID for biopsy-proven metastatic node localisation, with one of two with adjunct radioisotope injection. Post-vacuum-assisted biopsy (VAB) hematoma was localised in 24% (n=14/59) cases, four of which received adjunct radioisotope in the pilot phase. The average procedure time for RFID deployment was five minutes.The average time for surgery was 20 minutes. 1.6% (n=1/59) incidence of RFID slipping from the surface of the site through surgical exposure attributed to the superficial and immediate pre-operative placement of the RFID. This was salvageable with adjunct radioisotope injection within the pilot phase. There were no incidences of repeat localisation or repeat exploration surgeries.Planned pre-operative localisation with RFID allows for better planning and less pressured service delivery and a success rate of 98-99%. This ultimately avoids lost theatre time and patient demotivation. Surgeons have reported excellent intra-operative detectability in their approach. There has been no difficulty in the detection of the RFID within the surgical cavity despite hematoma. RFID localisers are expensive compared to our usual practice of radioisotope injection but this can be recuperated through uncoupled tariffs like gain in slots of one-stop clinics, flexibility for placement, and avoiding lost theatre time, as these can be placed up to 30 days before surgery.

TI  - Look-up table approach for uncertainty determination for operational vicarious calibration of Earth imaging sensors
T2  - APPLIED OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the uncertainty of a vicarious calibration is essential for any application to Earth imaging sensors. The Radiometric Calibration Network provides SI-traceable spectral top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance from a network of ground sites and uses a look-up table (LUT) approach for uncertainty determination. The uncertainty LUT was derived using Monte Carlo techniques applied to the relevant solar geometry, surface, and atmospheric variables. While surface reflectance is typically the dominant uncertainty source, atmospheric contributions do play an important role, depending upon the exact scenario and conditions. This approach allows knowledge of TOA reflectance uncertainty to within 0.5%. (C) 2022 Optical Society of America

AB  - The universal remote sensing image processing software focuses on the preprocessing of remote sensing data, and it is used to implement the monitoring and evaluation functions of the ecological environment such as drought and flood. The operation is complex. In order to simplify the work process of natural geographical environment monitoring and assessment, GIS technology and data mining technology were combined in this paper. With monitoring and evaluation as the core, a decision tree model was constructed. Taking the Dongting Lake as an example, the scale and characteristics of its texture were studied, and combined with other ancillary data, the Dongting land information was explored and the land types were classified. Finally, a conclusion was reached: The algorithm designed in this paper can be applied to the land types of the natural geographical environment. The classification model has a positive guiding role in the judgment of environmental monitoring and assessment.

TI  - Prevalence and circulation patterns of SARS-CoV-2 variants in European sewage mirror clinical data of 54 European cities
T2  - WATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - For community-level monitoring, the European Commission under the EU Sewage Sentinel System recommends wastewater-based SARS-CoV-2 surveillance. Tracking SARS-CoV-2 variants in a community is pivotal for appropriate public health response. Genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater samples for tracking variants is challenging, often resulting in low coverage genome sequences, thereby impeding the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 mutations. Therefore, we aimed at high-coverage SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from sewage samples which we successfully accomplished. This first pan-European surveillance compared the mutation profiles associated with the variants of concerns: B.1.1.7, P.1, B.1.351 and B.1.617.2 across 20 European countries, including 54 municipalities. The results highlight that SARS-CoV-2 variants detected in the wastewater samples mirror the variants profiles reported in clinical data. This study demonstrated that >98% coverage of SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences is possible and can be used to track SARS-CoV-2 mutations in wastewater to support identifying variants circulating in a city at the community level.

TI  - Comparison of Layer-stacking and Dempster-Shafer Theory-based Methods Using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Data Fusion in Urban Land Cover Mapping
T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Data fusion has shown potential to improve the accuracy of land cover mapping, and selection of the optimal fusion technique remains a challenge. This study investigated the performance of fusing Sentinel-1 (S-1) and Sentinel-2 (S-2) data, using layer-stacking method at the pixel level and Dempster-Shafer (D-S) theory-based approach at the decision level, for mapping six land cover classes in Thu Dau Mot City, Vietnam. At the pixel level, S-1 and S-2 bands and their extracted textures and indices were stacked into the different single-sensor and multi-sensor datasets (i.e. fused datasets). The datasets were categorized into two groups. One group included the datasets containing only spectral and backscattering bands, and the other group included the datasets consisting of these bands and their extracted features. The random forest (RF) classifier was then applied to the datasets within each group. At the decision level, the RF classification outputs of the single-sensor datasets within each group were fused together based on D-S theory. Finally, the accuracy of the mapping results at both levels within each group was compared. The results showed that fusion at the decision level provided the best mapping accuracy compared to the results from other products within each group. The highest overall accuracy (OA) and Kappa coefficient of the map using D-S theory were 92.67% and 0.91, respectively. The decision-level fusion helped increase the OA of the map by 0.75% to 2.07% compared to that of corresponding S-2 products in the groups. Meanwhile, the data fusion at the pixel level delivered the mapping results, which yielded an OA of 4.88% to 6.58% lower than that of corresponding S-2 products in the groups.

TI  - Impacts of inter-annual cropland changes on land surface temperature based on multi-temporal thermal infrared images
T2  - INFRARED PHYSICS & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The research on the impact of land cover changes on the thermal environment is crucial to environmental monitoring. Land surface temperature (LST) is often used as the main parameter to analyze the thermal environment. As the primary land cover type, "cropland" is the main factor affecting the LST. Previous studies investigated the effects of cropland with other land cover types on the LST but ignored the changes within cropland. Furthermore, inter-annual changes of crop types in the cropland often occur. With the growth of the crops, their impact on LST also change. Therefore, it is necessary to understand how cropland changes affect the LST. The traditional comparison method based on a single time image is not suitable for evaluating the impact of the different crops during the whole growth period because single-phase information cannot reflect the changing process of crop influence. To address this issue, this paper proposes a cumulative land surface temperature index (cLST) based on multi-temporal images to evaluate the yearly impact of cropland changes. Results indicate that different crops have different effects on the thermal environment, and the annual cLST of cotton extracted from MODIS is higher than that of corn, sorghum, and winter wheat cropland. Also, the changing amplitude of the annual cLST is mainly related to the inter-annual cropland area ratio change (R = 0.85 for winter wheat to cotton, R = 0.75 for corn to cotton) in the study area, indicating that the overall change from corn and winter wheat to cotton cropland increases the annual cLST. The effect of cotton-sorghum and winter wheat-corn change is not significant. By comparing the contribution rate, it is found that the annual cLST is more affected by the cotton-winter wheat change (35%) than air temperature (26%). The method proposed in this paper helps to reveal the impact of cropland changes on LST, and the prediction of regional climate changes.

TI  - Simultaneous estimation of surface soil moisture and salinity during irrigation with the moisture-salinity-dependent spectral response model
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture and salinity are both important environmental variables for crop growth in agricultural production areas. Optical remote-sensing datasets from different sensors are available for estimating soil moisture and salinity from different spatial-temporal scales. Given the co-regulation of soil spectral reflectance (SR) by soil moisture and salinity, the simultaneous estimation of moisture and salinity in saline soil may result in great bias and uncertainty. To address this problem, soil samples were collected in the salinized area during irrigation. Synchronously, processed multi-spectral images were acquired from Sentinel-2 satellite. The spectrum mechanism responsive to soil moisture and salinity was verified by statistical tests, and its corresponding mathematical model (MSS model) was developed to identify the dominant factors affecting SR and to inverse moisture and salinity. The result showed that the effects of moisture and salinity were temporally constant (facilitation) and changing (from inhibition to facilitation), respectively, during the irrigation stages. The dominant factors in the variation of SR shifted from salinity and moisture-salinity interaction to moisture. Reliable accuracy was achieved in the moisture and salinity estimation using inverse MSS model. The profile from the series of estimations can further reveal the dynamic changes of soil moisture and salinity content during irrigation, and provide guidance for local irrigation management.

TI  - Adjusting solar-induced fluorescence to nadir-viewing provides a better proxy for GPP
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) provides key information for inferring terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP). However, there is little research on analyzing the performance of nadir-adjusted SIF (SIFnadir) on GPP, compared to total SIF emitted by all leaves (SIFtotal) for reducing the viewing angle effects and estimating GPP. Besides, there have been controversial opinions on whether SIFtotal is better correlated to GPP than raw SIF observations (SIFobs). Here we systematically analyzed the relationship between raw/nadir/total SIF (i.e., SIFobs, SIFnadir and SIFtotal) and GPP and investigated the underlying mechanism, using multi-angular field measurements and eddy covariance data in wheat and corn crops at sub-daily scale. We further compared the performance of SIFobs, SIF(nadir )and SIFtotal in estimating GPP using the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) SIF and concurrent AmeriFlux measurements at daily scale. The results indicate that diurnal SIFnadir has stronger correlations to GPP than SIFobs for field measurements, with the increase of mean coefficient of determination (R-2) by 0.05-0.07 for far-red band and 0.11-0.20 for red band. SIFnadir shows comparable performance with SIFtotal for both far-red and red bands. Although the viewing angle effects dominate the difference in estimating GPP between SIFnadir and SIFobs, the correlation between light use efficiency (LUE) and f(esc) further determines the different performance of SIFnadir and SIFtotal in estimating GPP. TROPOMI-based analysis further confirms that SIFnadir overall has higher correlations to AmeriFlux GPP than SIFobs for different plant functional types and shows similar performance with SIFtotal. Compared to SIFtotal, the estimation of SIFnadir independent of viewing angle effects does not require any canopy structure parameters, and thus offers promising potential for reliably estimating regional and global GPP.

TI  - Daily snow water equivalent product with SMMR, SSM/I and SSMIS from 1980 to 2020 over China
T2  - BIG EARTH DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - The reliable knowledge of seasonal snow volume and its trend is very important to understand Earth's climate system. Thus, a long-time snow water equivalent (SWE) dataset is necessary. This work presents a daily SWE product of 1980-2020 with a linear unmixing method through passive microwave data including SMMR, SSM/I and SSMIS over China after cross-calibration and bias-correction. The unbiased root-mean-square error of snow depth is about 5-7 cm, corresponding to 10-15 mm for SWE, when compared with stations measurements and field snow course data. The spatial patterns and trends of SWE over China present significant regional differences. The overall slope trend presented an insignificant decreasing pattern during 1980-2020 over China; however, there is an obvious fluctuation, i.e. a significant decrease trend during the period 1980-1990, an upward trend from 2005 to 2009, a significant downward trend from 2009 to 2018. The increase of SWE occurred in the Northeast Plain, with an increase trend of 0.2 mm per year. Whereas in the Hengduan Mountains, it presented a downward trend of SWE, up to -0.3 mm per year. In the North Xinjiang, SWE has an increasing trend in the Junggar Basin, while it shows a decreasing trend in the Tianshan and Altai Mountains.

TI  - In vitro ictogenesis is stochastic at the single neuron level
T2  - BRAIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Seizure initiation is the least understood and most disabling element of epilepsy. Studies of ictogenesis require high speed recordings at cellular resolution in the area of seizure onset. However, in vivo seizure onset areas cannot be determined at the level of resolution necessary to enable such studies. To circumvent these challenges, we used novel GCaMP7-based calcium imaging in the organotypic hippocampal slice culture model of post-traumatic epilepsy in mice. Organotypic hippocampal slice cultures generate spontaneous, recurrent seizures in a preparation in which it is feasible to image the activity of the entire network (with no unseen inputs existing). Chronic calcium imaging of the entire hippocampal network, with paired electrophysiology, revealed three patterns of seizure onset: (i) low amplitude fast activity; (ii) sentinel spike; and (iii) spike burst and low amplitude fast activity onset. These patterns recapitulate common features of human seizure onset, including low voltage fast activity and spike discharges. Weeks-long imaging of seizure activity showed a characteristic evolution in onset type and a refinement of the seizure onset zone. Longitudinal tracking of individual neurons revealed that seizure onset is stochastic at the single neuron level, suggesting that seizure initiation activates neurons in non-stereotyped sequences seizure to seizure. This study demonstrates for the first time that transitions to seizure are not initiated by a small number of neuronal 'bad actors' (such as overly connected hub cells), but rather by network changes which enable the onset of pathology among large populations of neurons.

TI  - Estimating district HIV prevalence in Zambia using small-area estimation methods (SAE)
T2  - POPULATION HEALTH METRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The HIV/AIDS pandemic has had a very devastating impact at a global level, with the Eastern and Southern African region being the hardest hit. The considerable geographical variation in the pandemic means varying impact of the disease in different settings, requiring differentiated interventions. While information on the prevalence of HIV at regional and national levels is readily available, the burden of the disease at smaller area levels, where health services are organized and delivered, is not well documented. This affects the targeting of HIV resources. There is need, therefore, for studies to estimate HIV prevalence at appropriate levels to improve HIV-related planning and resource allocation. Methods We estimated the district-level prevalence of HIV using Small-Area Estimation (SAE) technique by utilizing the 2016 Zambia Population-Based HIV Impact Assessment Survey (ZAMPHIA) data and auxiliary data from the 2010 Zambian Census of Population and Housing and the HIV sentinel surveillance data from selected antenatal care clinics (ANC). SAE models were fitted in R Programming to ascertain the best HIV predicting model. We then used the Fay-Herriot (FH) model to obtain weighted, more precise and reliable HIV prevalence for all the districts. Results The results revealed variations in the district HIV prevalence in Zambia, with the prevalence ranging from as low as 4.2% to as high as 23.5%. Approximately 32% of the districts (n = 24) had HIV prevalence above the national average, with one district having almost twice as much prevalence as the national level. Some rural districts have very high HIV prevalence rates. Conclusions HIV prevalence in Zambian is highest in districts located near international borders, along the main transit routes and adjacent to other districts with very high prevalence. The variations in the burden of HIV across districts in Zambia point to the need for a differentiated approach in HIV programming within the country. HIV resources need to be prioritized toward districts with high population mobility.

TI  - B-esterases characterisation in the digestive tract of the common octopus and the European cuttlefish and their <i>in vitro</i> responses to contaminants of environmental concern
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Cephalopods are a group of marine invertebrates that have received little attention as sentinel species in comparison to other molluscs, such as bivalves. Consequently, their physiological and biochemical xenobiotic metabolism responses are poorly understood. Here we undertake a comparative analysis of the enzymatic activities involved in detoxification reactions and neural transmission in the digestive tract of two commercial cephalopods: the Common octopus, Octopus vulgaris, and the European cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis. For methodological purposes, several common B-esterases (five carboxylesterase (CE) substrates and three cholinesterase (ChE) determinations) were assayed as a proxy of metabolic and neuronal activities, respectively. Four components of the digestive tract in each species were considered: salivary glands, the stomach, the digestive gland and the caecum. The in vitro responses of digestive gland homogenates to model chemicals and contaminants of environmental concern were contrasted between both cephalopod species. The baseline biochemical activities in the four digestive tract components were also determined. Moreover, in order to validate the protocol, purified proteins, recombinant human CE (CE1 and CE2) and purified eel acetylcholinesterase (AChE) were included in the analysis. Overall, carboxylesterase activities were higher in octopus than in cuttlefish, with the activity quantified in the digestive tract components in the following order: digestive gland approximate to caecum > stomach approximate to salivary glands, with higher hydrolysis rates reached with naphthyl-derived substrates. In contrast, cuttlefish hydrolysis rates with ChE substrates were higher than in octopus. This trend was also reflected in a higher sensitivity to CE inhibitors in octopus and to AChE inhibitors in cuttlefish. Given the detoxification character of CEs and its protective role preventing AChE inhibition, octopus could be regarded as more efficiently protected than cuttlefish from neurotoxic exposures. A full characterisation of B-esterases in the digestive tract of the two common cephalopods is also provided.

TI  - Spatiotemporal distribution and insecticide resistance status of <i>Aedes aegypti</i> in Ghana
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Vector control is the main intervention used to control arboviral diseases transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes because there are no effective vaccines or treatments for most of them. Control of Aedes mosquitoes relies heavily on the use of insecticides, the effectiveness of which may be impacted by resistance. In addition, rational insecticide application requires detailed knowledge of vector distribution, dynamics, resting, and feeding behaviours, which are poorly understood for Aedes mosquitoes in Africa. This study investigated the spatiotemporal distribution and insecticide resistance status of Aedes aegypti across ecological extremes of Ghana.Methods: Immature mosquitoes were sampled from containers in and around human dwellings at seven study sites in urban, suburban, and rural areas of Ghana. Adult Aedes mosquitoes were sampled indoors and outdoors using Biogents BG-Sentinel 2 mosquito traps, human landing catches, and Prokopack aspiration. Distributions of immature and adult Aedes mosquitoes were determined indoors and outdoors during dry and rainy seasons at all sites. The phenotypic resistance status of Aedes mosquitoes to insecticides was determined using World Health Organization susceptibility bioassays. The host blood meal source was determined by polymerase chain reaction.Results: A total of 16,711 immature Aedes were sampled, with over 70% found in car tyres. Significantly more breeding containers had Aedes immatures during the rainy season (11,856; 70.95%) compared to the dry season (4855; 29.05%). A total of 1895 adult Aedes mosquitos were collected, including Aedes aegypti (97.8%), Aedes africanus (2.1%) and Aedesluteocephalus (0.1%). Indoor sampling of adult Aedes yielded a total of 381 (20.1%) and outdoor sampling a total of 1514 (79.9%) mosquitoes (z = - 5.427, P = 0.0000) over the entire sampling period. Aedes aegypti populations were resistant to dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane at all study sites. Vectors showed suspected resistance to bendiocarb (96-97%), permethrin (90-96%) and deltamethrin (91-96%), and were susceptible to the organophosphate for all study sites. Blood meal analysis showed that the Aedes mosquitoes were mostly anthropophilic, with a human blood index of 0.9 (i.e. humans, 90%; human and dog, 5%; dog and cow, 5%).Conclusions: Aedes mosquitoes were found at high densities in all ecological zones of Ghana. Resistance of Aedes spp. to pyrethroids and carbamates may limit the efficacy of vector control programmes and thus requires careful monitoring. Graphical abstract

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study illustrates the delineation of the groundwater potential zones in one of the most critical and drought-affected areas under Bundelkhand region of Uttar Pradesh (India). Hydrological evaluations were carried out using GIS tools and remote sensing data which ultimately yielded several thematic maps, such as lineament density, land use/land cover, drainage density, lithology, slope, geomorphology, topographic wetness index (TWI), DEM, and soil. Thematic layers were assigned relative weightages as per their groundwater potential prospects under multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method through analytical hierarchy process (AHP). To recognize the groundwater potential zone, weighted overlay analysis was also performed. Additionally, for testing of the Dempster-Shafer model, 16 wells in the study area have been selected. Based on the probability of the groundwater occurrence, the belief factor was equated to delineate groundwater potential zones which illustrate five different potential zones. According to the AHP model, the northwest side of the study area is characterized with very high potential zones whereas the northeast and southeast regions constitute medium and low groundwater potential zones respectively. According to the DS model, very high groundwater potential zones constitute 17% and the remaining area falls under low potential. Overall accuracy of the DS model is higher than AHP model.

TI  - Influence of strain-hardening on the load-carrying behaviour of bearing type bolted connections
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTIONAL STEEL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The investigations presented in this paper focus on the hole bearing resistance of symmetric single-bolt connections, taking into account the distinct hardening behaviour of various steel grades and quantifying its impact on the resulting load-carrying behaviour. The main focus of the study was put on the limitation of the hole bearing deformations by defining a corresponding "resistance", which is thus a quantity with the background of an implicit deformation limitation. This represents a further expansion of new regulations, which have currently found their way into the draft version of the part of the Eurocode 3 standard dedicated to the resistance of connections prEN1993-1-8. In contrast to this draft standard, the specific differences between steels with very pronounced and less pronounced hardening behaviour are dealt with. Experimental investigations were carried out on four different steel grades, each with eight different geometries, in order to investigate the influence of this hardening behaviour on the hole bearing deformations.The paper presents a new approach to define the point on the load-deformation curve between acceptable and excessive deformations. This is defined as a point with a certain slope of the normalised and standardised load -deformation curve, namely the point where the tangent stiffness corresponds to the secant stiffness defined by connecting the origin of the load-deformation point to the point with the peak load.Based on the results of the hole bearing tests in combination with the new approach to define the transition point between acceptable and excessive deformations, an adapted resistance model is presented. In this model, the hardening behaviour of the steel is taken into account, whereby here specifically the ratio fu/fy of tensile strength to yield strength influences the load-bearing behaviour.In addition to laboratory tests, numerical simulations were carried out with an extended range of geometries. This made it possible to create a representative data set with which the proposed model could be verified. It was shown that with the developed proposal a significant improvement of the prediction accuracy can be achieved compared to the resistance model in prEN1993-1-8.The proposed adaptation of the hole bearing verification which takes the fu/fy ratio into account facilitates the optimal use of material and can thus save resources. The format of the hole bearing verification remains almost unchanged, which should simplify its applicability in practice.

TI  - Gold prospectivity mapping and exploration targeting in Hutti-Maski schist belt, India: Synergistic application of Weights-of-Evidence (WOE), Fuzzy Logic (FL) and hybrid (WOE-FL) models
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOCHEMICAL EXPLORATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Our study attempts to map gold prospectivity for deriving optimal exploration targets using data-driven, knowledge-driven and hybrid approaches. Prospectivity models viz. Weights of Evidence (WOE), Fuzzy Logic (FL) and a hybrid model that combines the data-driven and knowledge-driven components (WOE-FL) were applied to a part of the auriferous Hutti-Maski schist belt of 1352 km(2) area with 20 known gold occurrences. With a pixel resolution of 500 m, 16 spatial evidential raster layers were created on a GIS platform encompassing viable predictive indicators, critical in gold exploration. Modelling inputs include essential ingredients and mappable criteria of the conceived orogenic gold mineral system in the study area. Multi-source geological data such as lithostratigraphic units, favourable litho-contacts, structural deformation sites, geochemical anomalies of selected gold pathfinder elements, and hydrothermal alteration zones derived from digital image processing of Landsat 8 OLI satellite imagery were integrated to generate prospectivity maps for delineation of future targets. A quantitative evaluation of the resulting three prospectivity maps was performed using concentration-area (C-A) fractal analysis, prediction-area (P-A) plot, fitting-rate curve (FRC) and area under curve (AUC). Comparative analysis indicates that the performance of the hybrid model (WOE-FL) stands out to be the most efficient, with a prediction rate of 87% and AUC of 91.40% compared to WOE and FL. A risk assessment was performed combining the outputs of prospectivity models that returned 10% of the study area as potential exploration targets out of which the low-risk exploration targets comprises merely 4.5% representing the optimal targets for gold exploration in the study area.

TI  - Sentinel-1 time series for mapping snow cover depletion and timing of snowmelt in Arctic periglacial environments: case study from Zackenberg and Kobbefjord, Greenland
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover (SC) and timing of snowmelt are key regulators of a wide range of Arctic ecosystem functions. Both are strongly influenced by the ampli?ed Arctic warming and essential variables to understand environmental changes and their dynamics. This study evaluates the potential of Sentinel-1 (S-1) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) time series for monitoring SC depletion and snowmelt with high spatiotemporal resolution to capture their understudied small-scale heterogeneity. We use 97 dual-polarized S-1 SAR images acquired over northeastern Greenland and 94 over southwestern Greenland in the interferometric wide swath mode from the years 2017 and 2018. Comparison of S-1 intensity against SC fraction maps derived from orthorecti?ed terrestrial time-lapse imagery indicates that SAR backscatter can increase before a decrease in SC fraction is observed. Hence, the increase in backscatter is related to changing snowpack properties during the runoff phase as well as decreasing SC fraction. We here present a novel empirical approach based on the temporal evolution of the SAR signal to identify start of runoff (SOR), end of snow cover (EOS) and SC extent for each S-1 observation date during melt using backscatter thresholds as well as the derivative. Comparison of SC with orthorectified time-lapse imagery indicates that HV polarization outperforms HH when using a global threshold. The derivative avoids manual selection of thresholds and adapts to different environmental settings and seasonal conditions. With a global configuration (threshold: 4 dB; polarization: HV) as well as with the derivative, the overall accuracy of SC maps was in all cases above 75 % and in more than half of cases above 90 %. Based on the physical principle of SAR backscatter during snowmelt, our approach is expected to work well in other low-vegetation areas and, hence, could support large-scale SC monitoring at high spatiotemporal resolution (20 m, 6 d) with high accuracy.

TI  - Management of the positive sentinel lymph node following neoadjuvant chemotherapy: results of a survey conducted with breast surgeons
T2  - ECANCERMEDICALSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Despite the lack of randomised evidence, there is a current trend towards omitting axillary surgery in cases of positive sentinel lymph node (SLN) following neoad-juvant chemotherapy (NACT). This study evaluated practice patterns of Brazilian breast surgeons when managing positive SLN following NACT.Methods: This was a nationwide electronic survey of breast surgeons affiliated with the Brazilian Society of Mastology. Management approaches for positive SLN after NACT (axillary dissection (AD), regional nodal irradiation (RNI) or no additional treatment) were evaluated as a function of residual disease volume in the SLN (macro-metastasis, micro-metastasis or isolated tumour cells (ITC)).Results: Survey response rate was 49%, with 799/1,627 questionnaires returned. Most respondents were <50 years old (61%), lived in southeastern Brazil (50%), in a major city (67%), worked in an academic institute (80%) and were board-certified (80%). AD recommendation rate decreased according to residual nodal disease volume: 91% of respondents recommended AD for cases of macro-metastasis, 64% for micro metastasis and 38% for ITC (p < 0.00001). Furthermore, 35% would recommend no additional surgery for micro-metastasis, while 27% would recommend no treatment at all for ITC (p < 0.00001). Not working in an academic institute was associated with RNI for micro-metastasis (p = 0.02), but not for macro-metastasis or ITC. Being board-certified did not affect axillary management.Conclusion: Most respondents would recommend AD and/or RNI in residual nodal disease following NACT irrespective of disease volume. Nevertheless, a trend towards surgical de-escalation was found with low-volume disease (micro-metastasis and ITC). Ongoing randomised trials will clarify the impact of this trend.

TI  - Watershed Prioritization in Lower Shivaliks Region of India Using Integrated Principal Component and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis Techniques: A Case of Upper Ghaggar Watershed
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The watershed prioritization of soil erosion-affected areas is an utmost requirement to formulate management and conservation practices. In this study, a geospatial framework integrated with multivariate statistical techniques such as principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering was used to prioritize the fragile ecosystem, i.e., the upper Ghaggar watershed. It is one of the least studied seasonal river watersheds in northern India, which carry substantial monsoon flows. The drainage characteristics were inferred using the interferometrically derived Sentinel 1A/1B digital elevation model (spatial resolution-13.96 m). The study area was further divided into 92 sub-watersheds (32 fourth and 60 third-order) using ArcSWAT. Twenty-seven linear, areal, and relief aspect parameters were exploited to study the watershed's hydrological, lithological, and geomorphological characteristics. The categorization and correlation of these parameters were attempted using principal component/factor analysis, which resulted in five components having an eigenvalue greater than 1. The factor analysis resulted in magnitude, relief, drainage composition, and dissection intensity factor, which accounted for percentage variance of 39.96, 27.70, 10.32, and 9.80%, respectively, which account for 87.78% of the total variance. Finally, the morphometric parameters were grouped into three priority clusters in which 29, 46, and 17 sub-watersheds fall in high, medium, and least priorities clusters, respectively. The methodology adopted in this study provides vital information for watershed characterization and prioritization, which can serve as a criterion for the decision-makers in sustainable planning and management of the resources prevalent within the watershed.

TI  - On the distribution and productivity of mountain grasslands in the Gran Paradiso National Park, NW Italy: A remote sensing approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Mountain grazing lands are key constituents of the natural, economical and cultural heritage, but at the same time sensitive to climate and land use change, hence requiring urgent adaptation and management strategies. These must be based on a better understanding of the distribution of mountain pastoral resources across space and time.In this study we model the distribution and the productivity of grassland surfaces in a topographically complex protected area (Gran Paradiso National Park, 710 km(2)) in north-western Italian Alps. The objective of our work was threefold: a) modelling the distribution of mountain grasslands across the entire park at a 20-meters spatial resolution, b) classify pastoral surfaces according to productivity classes, and c) according to thirteen pastoral categories. We used a random forest approach to combine a massive terrain vegetation survey as ground truth, with remote-sensing-derived, climatic and topographic layers as predictors.Grassland presence/absence was classified with high accuracy (up to 88%) and, compared to the standard Copernicus European Grassland Product, revealed the presence of extensive high altitude grassland areas potentially available for wild herbivores. Grassland productivity was modelled with remarkably high accuracy both according to three broad productivity classes (90% accuracy) and to a more detailed classification into thirteen pastoral categories (83% accuracy). Productivity estimates agree well with satellite-derived leaf area index maps and with area-averaged NDVI seasonal patterns.We conclude that combining tailored field campaigns and high-resolution remote sensing allows for robust prediction of grassland distribution and productivity even in complex terrains. This information can contribute to improve the management of pastoral resources and promote effective adaptation strategies.

TI  - Effect of land use land cover changes on land surface temperature during 1984-2020: a case study of Baghdad city using landsat image
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban land surface temperature (LST) is dependent on many factors, including land cover, building materials, urban density, and other human activities. The current study evaluated Baghdad's LST and urban heat island (UHI) changes during 1984-2020, one of the world's hottest capital cities. The study also examined the relationship between LST and various land use and land covers (LULC). The Landsat data (TM and OLI/TIRS) data were used to retrieve normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference built-up index (NDBI). Results showed increases in LST in Baghdad between 1984 and 2020 due to increased urbanization, decreased green lands, and expansion of baren areas. The highest LST is associated with residential and barren areas, ranging from 46.7 to 52.7 degrees C, while lowest with water bodies and orchards areas, ranging between 25 and 30.4 degrees C. UHI effect appeared clearly in 2020 in different parts, particularly in suburban areas around Baghdad. Higher LST was observed in less vegetated areas and vice versa. The study revealed that the average maximum temperature in Baghdad increased from 40.2 degrees C in 1984 to 47 degrees C in 2020 or about 6.8 degrees C during 36 years. The NDVI showed a negative correlation and NDBI a positive correlation with LST. The results improved the understanding of urban LST's relation to LULC in developing an inclusive climate resilience policy and making Baghdad more sustainable to face the consequences of climate change.

TI  - Retrieval of UV-visible aerosol absorption using AERONET and OMI-MODIS synergy: spatial and temporal variability across major aerosol environments
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Measuring spectral aerosol absorption remains a challenging task in aerosol studies, especially in the UV region, where ground and airborne measurements are sparse. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm that synergizes ground measurements with satellite observations for the derivation of spectral single scattering albedo (SSA, omega(o)) of aerosols in the UV-to-visible wavelength range (340-670 nm). The approach consists in explaining satellite-measured near-UV radiances (340, 354, 388 nm) by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and visible radiances (466, 646 nm) by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), given the collocated ground-based Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) measurements of total column extinction aerosol optical depth (AOD, tau), in terms of retrieved total column wavelength-dependent SSA using radiative transfer calculations. Required information on aerosol particle size distribution is adopted from AERONET-based aerosol type-dependent seasonal climatologies specifically developed for this project. The inversion procedure is applied to about 110 AERONET sites distributed worldwide, for which continuous, long-term AERONET measurements are available. Using the derived data set, we present seasonal and regional climatology of omega(o)(lambda) for carbonaceous, dust, and urban/industrial aerosols. The resulting UV-visible spectral dependence of omega(o) obtained for these three major aerosol types is found to be both qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with independent measurements reported in the literature. A comparison to standard AERONET SSA product at 440 nm shows absolute differences within 0.03 (0.05) for 40 % (65 %) of the compared observations. The derived aerosol omega(o)(lambda) data set provides a valuable addition to the existing aerosol absorption record from AERONET by extending it to the near-UV region. Furthermore, SSA retrievals from our method at visible wavelengths and around satellite overpass time also complement the equivalent inversion available during early morning/late afternoon from AERONET. In addition to improving our understanding of spectral aerosol absorption properties, the combined UV-visible data set also offers wavelength-dependent dynamic aerosol absorption models for use in the satellite-based aerosol retrieval algorithms.

TI  - Prediction of multi-year winter wheat yields at the field level with satellite and climatological data
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term yield mapping is key to Precision Farming and needs to consider yield-relevant factors such as the water demand and nitrogen uptake. For the prediction of winter wheat yields, we incorporated climatological data and daily crop water requirements (CWR), Sentinel-2 time series, and the derived indices such as the normalised difference red edge (NDRE), red edge inflection point (REIP) and the normalized difference water index (NDWI). These factors were evaluated by using stepwise linear regression (LR) and random forest (RF). Robust field data sets from 2016 to 2018 with weighed yields from three regions in southern Germany in the range of 49 dt ha-1 to 102 dt ha-1 were used for calibration and validation. Indices reflecting the field variability were not better suited for yield prediction than climatological data alone. A new approach using all raw bands of Sentinel-2 in combination with evapotranspiration and precipitation, delivered a reduced number of features and explained 84% of the yield variance with a RMSE of 5.6 dt ha-1. Alternatively, the NDWI-based CWR merged all significant parameters into one feature and explained 79% of the variance with a RMSE of 6.46 dt ha-1. A sufficiently precise prediction of yields at the field level could contribute to an optimised agricultural management.

TI  - A population-based study of administrative data linkage to measure melanoma surgical and pathology quality
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundContinuous quality improvement is important for cancer systems. However, collecting and compiling quality indicator data can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. Here we explore the utility and feasibility of linked routinely collected health data to capture key elements of quality of care for melanoma in a single-payer, universal health care setting.MethodThis pilot study utilized a retrospective population-based cohort from a previously developed linked administrative data set, with a 65% random sample of all invasive cutaneous melanoma cases diagnosed 2007-2012 in the province of Ontario. Data from the Ontario Cancer Registry was utilized, supplemented with linked pathology report data from Cancer Care Ontario, and other linked administrative data describing health care utilization. Quality indicators identified through provincial guidelines and international consensus were evaluated for potential collection with administrative data and measured where possible.ResultsA total of 7,654 cases of melanoma were evaluated. Ten of 25 (40%) candidate quality indicators were feasible to be collected with the available administrative data. Many indicators (8/25) could not be measured due to unavailable clinical information (e.g. width of clinical margins). Insufficient pathology information (6/25) or health structure information (1/25) were less common reasons. Reporting of recommended variables in pathology reports varied from 65.2% (satellitosis) to 99.6% (body location). For stage IB-II or T1b-T4a melanoma patients where SLNB should be discussed, approximately two-thirds met with a surgeon experienced in SLNB. Of patients undergoing full lymph node dissection, 76.2% had adequate evaluation of the basin.ConclusionsWe found that use of linked administrative data sources is feasible for measurement of melanoma quality in some cases. In those cases, findings suggest opportunities for quality improvement. Consultation with surgeons offering SLNB was limited, and pathology report completeness was sub-optimal, but was prior to routine synoptic reporting. However, to measure more quality indicators, text-based data sources will require alternative approaches to manual collection such as natural language processing or standardized collection. We recommend development of robust data platforms to support continuous re-evaluation of melanoma quality indicators, with the goal of optimizing quality of care for melanoma patients on an ongoing basis.

TI  - Optoacoustic imaging and potential applications of raster-scan optoacoustic mesoscopy in dermatology
T2  - CLINICS IN DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Optoacoustic imaging (OAI) is a hybrid imaging modality that integrates the benefits of optical contrast and ultrasound detection. Raster-scan optoacoustic mesoscopy (RSOM) is an emerging OAI method that provides information about several dermatological conditions' structural, functional, and molecular features. We searched PubMed and Google Scholar databases through September 2021 for contributions relevant to OAI in the English language. This review contains 32 studies and other relevant literature. Several studies indicate that RSOM is helpful in inflammatory skin conditions such as psoriasis and eczema, especially as it allows more accurate quantification of inflammation-related alterations such as changes to the dermal vasculature. In psoriasis, RSOM can provide objective early diagnosis and monitoring of disease activity and treatment efficacy. Multispectral RSOM, a method in which skin is lightened at more than a single wavelength, is beneficial in diagnosing and monitoring hypoxia-associated conditions, such as systemic sclerosis and chronic wounds. OAI techniques can visualize the pathologicvascularization of skin cancers and quantify their oxygenation status which helps differentiate them from normal skin. Also, they can measure the depth of malignant melanoma and detect the metastatic spread of melanoma cells to sentinel lymph nodes. As demonstrated in this contribution, there is a large spectrum of potential applications of OAI imaging, especially RSOM, in diagnosing, treating, and managing skin diseases. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Reliability framework for characterizing heat wave and cold spell events
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Extreme weather events such as heat waves and cold spells affect people's lives. This study develops a probabilistic framework to evaluate heat waves and cold spells. As case studies, average daily temperatures of meteorological stations of the two cities (Tehran and Vancouver) from 1995 to 2016 are used to identify four main indicators including intensity, average intensity, duration, and the rate of the occurrence. In addition, probabilistic spatial analysis of the events is obtained through MODIS's land surface temperature product. To include possible uncertainties, the predictive probability distributions of the intensity and duration are derived using a Bayesian scheme and Monte Carlo Markov Chain method. The probability distributions of the indicators show that the most extreme temperature (lowest temperature) occurs during the cold spell. Reliability evaluations indicate that both cities are more likely to be affected by the cold spell than the heat wave. Results of this study can be used as a benchmark for heat wave/cold spell characterization. The developed approach can be applied to characterize other extreme weather events in any location.

T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Here, we present a detailed analysis of glaciers in the Alaknanda Basin, Central Himalaya, starting with a novel glacier inventory for 1968 and 2020 using high-resolution datasets of Corona and Sentinel-2A. Primarily, we examine the factors influencing changes in glacier characteristics. Results show that glacier area reduced to 683 +/- 47.81 km(2) from 742 +/- 44.4 km(2), and the number of glaciers increased to 116 from 98 between 1968 and 2020. The annual average recession of glaciers in the basin is 11.75 +/- 1.6 m/year for the corresponding period. Also noted is a significant increase (similar to 38%) in supraglacial debris cover extent of the glaciers during 2000-2020. Interestingly, smaller glaciers (< 5 km(2)) with lower altitude snout and higher slope have registered more significant area loss and higher retreat rate. Alongside topographic parameters, the significant deglaciation and fragmentation observed in the basin are augmented by the increase in winter-time temperature (0.03 degrees C/year) between 1968 and 2020.

TI  - Detection of trend and seasonal changes in non-stationary remote sensing data: Case study of Tunisia vegetation dynamics
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The availability of long-term time series (TS) derived from remote sensing (RS) images is favorable for the analysis of vegetation variation and dynamics. However, the choice of appropriate methods is a challenging task. This article presented an experimental comparison of four methods widely used for the detection of long-term trend and seasonal changes of TS, with a case study in north-western Tunisia. The four methods are the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD), Multi-Resolution Analysis-Wavelet transform (MRA-WT), Breaks for Additive Season and Trend (BFAST), and Detecting Breakpoints and Estimating Segments in Trend (DBEST). Their efficiencies were compared by analysing Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) TS from 2001 to 2017 in the study area, obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations. The variations of long-term NDVI trends were analysed using non-parametric statistical tests. Results indicated that MRA-WT gave efficient results for both trend and seasonal changes, especially in forest area. Moreover, it exhibited the fastest efficiency in terms of time of execution and thus recommended for detecting detailed features (such as forest fire detection). DBEST also showed a good performance for trend detection in forest area as MRA-WT, however, it was more constrained to a longer computational time of execution. BFAST and EEMD exhibited a better performance in bare soil and cropland areas, and the latter can be taken as an appropriate and fast alternative for a general long-term trend overview with long TS.

TI  - Association Between Regional Nodal Irradiation and Breast Cancer Recurrence-Free Interval for Patients With Low-Risk, Node-Positive Breast Cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Randomized clinical trials have shown that regional nodal irradiation (RNI) in patients with unselected N1 breast cancer improves breast cancer-specific survival. However, the benefit of RNI in women with biologically low-risk N1 breast cancer is uncertain. We conducted a population-based study to determine whether RNI is associated with improved breast cancer recurrence-free interval (BCRFI) in this population.Methods and Materials: Patients aged 40 to 79 years with pT1-2 pN1 (node-positive) breast cancer diagnosed between 2005 and 2014 were identified. The inclusion criteria were modeled off of the TAILOR RT study, which is a randomized noninferiority clinical trial designed to assess the value of RNI in patients with low-risk N1 disease. Eligible patients had breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection with 1 to 3 positive nodes, breast-conserving surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy with 1 to 2 positive nodes, or mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy with 1 positive node. Additionally, patients had luminal A breast cancers, as approximated by estrogen receptor positive (Allred 6-8/8), progesterone receptor (PR) positive (Allred 6-8/8), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, and grade 1 to 2 immuno-histochemical testing. All patients were prescribed hormonal treatment. The primary endpoint of BCRFI, the time to any breast cancer recurrence or breast cancer-related death, was analyzed using a multivariate competing risks analysis.Results: The cohort included 1169 women with a median follow-up of 9.2 years. Radiation treatments were not performed in 151 women treated with mastectomy alone, were delivered to the breast only in 133 women, and were delivered locoregionally in 885 women. Patients undergoing RNI were younger (median age: 58 vs 62 years), more likely to have 2 to 3 macroscopic lymph nodes involved, and more often received chemotherapy (all P<.05). The 10-year estimate of BCRFI was 90% without RNI versus 90% with RNI (P=.5). On multivariable analysis, RNI was not a significant predictor of BCRFI (hazard ratio: 1.0; P=.9).Conclusions: In this retrospective analysis, RNI was not associated with improved BCRFI for women with biologically low-risk N1 breast cancer. We advocate accrual to the ongoing TAILOR RT study. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Identification of Hazardous Glacial Lakes in the Yarlung Zangbo River Basin Based on Lakes Changes Determined Using Google Earth Engine
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers have melted rapidly in the Yarlung Zangbo River Basin due to recent climate change, which has accelerated the expansion of glacial lakes. We performed a systematic survey of glacial lakes in the Yarlung Zangbo River Basin using the Google Earth Engine platform. This allowed us to map the distribution and monitor the evolution of glacial lakes over seven time periods from 1990 to 2020, using more than 140 Landsat Thematic Mapper and Operational Land Imager images at a 30-m resolution. The results show that there were 2088 glacial lakes in 2020, with a total area of 245.87 km(2), mainly distributed at elevations of 3,800-5,800 m above sea level. From 1990 to 2020, the Yarlung Zangbo River Basin glacial lakes expanded by approximately 1.81 km(2)center dot a(-1). A total of 153 glacial lakes in the Yarlung Zangbo River Basin were assessed. The assessment shows that 153 glacial lakes were divided into very high, high, medium, low, and very low level. The number of glacial lakes in each level is 23, 22, 32, 32, and 44, respectively. The very high and high level glacial lakes were mainly found in the Yi'ong Zangbo River Basin, Parlung Zangbo River Basin, the western of the Yarlung Zangbo River Basin and Nianchu River Basin. These glacial lakes deserve further attention and monitoring.

TI  - Evaluation of metal accumulation in Terme River sediments using ecological indices and a bioindicator species
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Freshwater resources are hotspot areas for sustainable water use. Surface sediment samples from four stations in Terme River were collected seasonally between April 2019 and January 2020. Sample collection from 0 to 10 cm depth of the riverbed was carried out with an Ekman Dredge Grab. Cu, Pb, Zn, Ni, Mn, Fe, Co, As, Cr, Cd, and Al concentrations were determined with an inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The percentage of organic matter in the sediment was evaluated by the combustion method. pH measurements were made with a pH meter. The concentrations of elements measured are listed in descending order as follows: Fe > Al > Mn > Cr > Cu > Zn > Ni > Co > Pb > As > Cd. Enrichment factor (EF), contamination factor (CF), and geo-accumulation index (I-geo) are the most commonly used tools to determine whether elements are of natural origin or anthropogenic origin. According to average EF values, the metals are listed as follows: Cd > Cu > Co > Fe > Cr > Pb > Mn > Zn > Al > Ni > As. The CF and I-geo values are listed as follows: Cd > Cu > Co > Fe > Cr > Pb > Mn > Zn > Al > Ni > As. According to EF results, Cd and Cu originate from human activities. The CF and I-geo indicate minimal enrichment for all metals. Potential ecological risk (PERI), pollution load (PLI), modified hazard quotient (mHQ), ecological contamination (ECI), and toxic risk indices (TRI) indicate low risk in the region. Human health risk indices also show that carcinogenic and noncarcinogenic risks are low. In the bioaccumulation evaluation performed on Myriophyllum spicatum species, it was determined that the plant accumulated Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, and Cd. These results show that Myriophyllum spicatum can be used as a bioindicator.

TI  - A retrospective study of spine injuries in electric bicycles related collisions
T2  - INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Electric bicycles related collisions could lead to severe consequences in spine injuries, while no study had comprehensively investigated the epidemiology and demography of spine injuries in electric bicycles related collisions.Questions/purposes: The aim of this study is to (1) describe the epidemiological characteristics of spine injuries in electric bicycles related collisions, (2) develop clinical guideline of spine injuries in electric bicycles related collisions and (3) support the new road safety policy for electric bicycle riders.Methods: A retrospective review of spine injuries in electric bicycle related collisions was performed from 86 patients in an urban trauma center between 2018 and 2020. The variables including gender, age, radiographic findings, associated injuries, neurologic injuries, treatment, average length of stay were fully collected. Chi-square test and paired sample mean t-test were used to test for statistically significant differences. All statistical analyses were performed using Statistical Product and Service Solutions 20.0.0 software. A P<0.001 was considered as significant.Results: A total of 86 cases were involved in electric bicycles related collisions lead to spine injuries. The spine injuries victims were predominantly male (79.07%) and middle-aged (41-60years, 44.19%). The most common spine injuries were L1 fractures (10.48%). The most common fracture type was AO Fracture Classification type A (71.40%). Age and multivertebral fractures had significant difference between patients who suffered from an ASOI and from those who did not (P-value: 0.005, 0.0 05). There was significant difference between patients who suffered from neurologic injuries and from those who did not in AO Classification, multivertebral fractures and ASOI (P-value: 0.0001, 0.001, 0.032). Age, AO Classification, multivertebral fractures, ASOI and neurologic injuries had significant difference to influence patients' ISS and ALOS.Conclusions: Spine injuries in electric bicycles related collisions may make patients suffer from severe consequences including their potential permanent disability, economic cost, or even life safety. Patients with spine injuries in electric bicycles related collisions should be paid close attention to avoid missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis. Helmet, protective clothing or other safety gear should be required to use to provide greater protection for electric bicycle riders. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - A semianalytical algorithm for estimating particulate composition in inland waters based on Sentinel-3 OLCI images
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The composition of suspended particles is a key factor in determining the underwater light field, which is of great significance for understanding the variability in the optical properties of water bodies. In this study, the ratio of the phytoplankton absorption coefficient to the backscattering coefficient at wavelength of 681 nm (a(ph)(681)/ b(b)(681)) was found to be an optimal optical indicator of the ratio of chlorophyll-a to the total suspended matter concentration (Chla/TSM), a parameter indicating the particulate composition. Therefore, a semianalytical algorithm was proposed to estimate Chla/TSM from remote sensing reflectance (Rrs(lambda)) at 681 nm and 754 nm on Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) images. The validation dataset collected from 11 inland lakes and 3 reservoirs in China and 2 inland lakes in America was used to evaluate the algorithm's performance. The evaluation results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm could have favorable performance in inland waters. Furthermore, comparison with two other state-of-the-art algorithms (Sun_13 and NTD675) showed that this proposed algorithm had higher estimation accuracy, with an overall winning rate (OWR) of 60%, an unbiased mean absolute percentage error (UMAPE) reduction from 72.95% to 46.44%, a root mean square error (RMSE) decline from 1.42 mu g/mg to 0.83 mu g/mg and a normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) decline from 11.36% to 6.62%. This algorithm was successfully applied to acquire the Chla/TSM tempo-spatial variation using the OLCI images of Lake Taihu from 2016 to 2019. It was found that the algorithm developed based on OLCI images can be applied to satellite sensors with similar bands, such as Medium-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS), and Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument (MSI), etc. As a simple and effective algorithm, the proposed algorithm has the potential to monitor changes in Chla/TSM in inland waters on a global scale.

TI  - Probabilistic assessment of vegetation vulnerability to drought stress in Central Asia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing frequency and intensity of droughts in a warming climate are likely to exacerbate adverse impacts on ecosystems, especially for water-limited regions such as Central Asia. A quantitative understanding of the impacts of drought on vegetation is required for drought preparedness and mitigation. Using the Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies NDVI3g data and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) from 1982 to 2015, we evaluate the vegetation vulnerability to drought in Central Asia based on a copula based probabilistic framework and identify the critical regions and periods. Furthermore, a boosted regression trees (BRT) model was also used to explore the relative importance of environmental factors and plant traits on vegetation response to drought. Additionally, we also investigated to what extent irrigation could alleviate the impacts of drought. Results revealed that months from June to September was the critical period when vegetated areas were most vulnerable to drought stress. The probabilities of vegetation loss below 20th quantile under extremely dry in these months were 68.7%, 69.4%, 71.0%, and 67.0%, respectively. Regarding vegetation vulnerable regions, they shifted with different growth stages. During the middle of the growing season, semiarid areas were the most vulnerable regions, whereas the highest drought-vulnerable regions were observed in arid areas during other periods. The BRT results showed that plant traits accounted for a large fraction (58.9%) of vegetation response to drought, which was more important than ambient soil environment (20.8%). The analysis also showed that mitigations from irrigation during July to September were smaller than in other months. The results of this paper provide insight into the influences of drought on vegetation and may contribute to drought mitigation and land degradation measures in Central Asia under accelerating global warming.

T2  - AEU-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS AND COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the design of a Grid Array Antenna that covers both Short Range Radar applications at 24 GHz, the spectrum requirement of Ku-band transmit mode for Fixed Satellite Service and Direct Broadcast Service for Vehicle to Satellite communications. The proposed Grid Array Antenna design has vertical short radiating wire segments and long radiating wire segments loaded with parallel reactive disc structures to enhance the bandwidth. Taylor synthesis method of amplitude-tapering reduces the Side Lobe Level to -16.3 dB. The simulation and measurement results are in alignment with each other covering the bandwidth of 12.58 GHz (VSWR <= 2), Half Power Beam Width of 7.8 degrees in E-plane, and 101.6 degrees in H-plane at 24 GHz and broadside radiation for Vehicle-to-Satellite communication. The antenna parameters are analyzed for housing effect and mounted on a virtual model of a vehicle. The aforementioned results show that the proposed antenna is well suited for the spectral coverage of Vehicle-to-Satellite communication, Blind Spot Detection, and pre-impact sensing in Short Range Radar automotive communication.

TI  - Warming weakens the night-time barrier to global fire
T2  - NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Night-time provides a critical window for slowing or extinguishing fires owing to the lower temperature and the lower vapour pressure deficit (VPD). However, fire danger is most often assessed based on daytime conditions(1,2), capturing what promotes fire spread rather than what impedes fire. Although it is well appreciated that changing daytime weather conditions are exacerbating fire, potential changes in night-time conditions-and their associated role as fire reducers-are less understood. Here we show that night-time fire intensity has increased, which is linked to hotter and drier nights. Our findings are based on global satellite observations of daytime and night-time fire detections and corresponding hourly climate data, from which we determine landcover-specific thresholds of VPD (VPDt), below which fire detections are very rare (less than 95 per cent modelled chance). Globally, daily minimum VPD increased by 25 per cent from 1979 to 2020. Across burnable lands, the annual number of flammable night-time hours-when VPD exceeds VPDt -increased by 110 hours, allowing five additional nights when flammability never ceases. Across nearly one-fifth of burnable lands, flammable nights increased by at least one week across this period. Globally, night fires have become 7.2 per cent more intense from 2003 to 2020, measured via a satellite record. These results reinforce the lack of night-time relief that wildfire suppression teams have experienced in recent years. We expect that continued night-time warming owing to anthropogenic climate change will promote more intense, longer-lasting and larger fires.

TI  - Attitudes about withholding or withdrawing life-prolonging treatment, euthanasia, assisted suicide, and physician assisted suicide: a cross-sectional survey among the general public in Croatia
T2  - BMC MEDICAL ETHICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background There has been no in-depth research of public attitudes on withholding or withdrawing life-prolonging treatment, euthanasia, assisted suicide and physician assisted suicide in Croatia. The aim of this study was to examine these attitudes and their correlation with sociodemographic characteristics, religion, political orientation, tolerance of personal choice, trust in physicians, health status, experiences with death and caring for the seriously ill, and attitudes towards death and dying. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted on a three-stage random sample of adult citizens of the Republic of Croatia, stratified by regions, counties, and locations within those counties (N = 1203). In addition to descriptive statistics, ANOVA and Chi-square tests were used to determine differences, and factor analysis (component model, varimax rotation and GK dimensionality reduction criterion), correlation analysis (Bivariate correlation, Pearson's coefficient) and multiple regression analysis for data analysis. Results 38.1% of the respondents agree with granting the wishes of dying people experiencing extreme and unbearable suffering, and withholding life-prolonging treatment, and 37.8% agree with respecting the wishes of such people, and withdrawing life-prolonging treatment. 77% of respondents think that withholding and withdrawing procedures should be regulated by law because of the fear of abuse. Opinions about the practice and regulation of euthanasia are divided. Those who are younger and middle-aged, with higher levels of education, living in big cities, and who have a more liberal worldview are more open to euthanasia. Assisted suicide is not considered to be an acceptable practice, with only 18.6% of respondents agreeing with it. However, 40.1% think that physician assisted suicide should be legalised. 51.6% would support the dying person's autonomous decisions regarding end-of-life procedures. Conclusions The study found low levels of acceptance of withholding or withdrawing life-prolonging treatment, euthanasia, assisted suicide and physician assisted suicide in Croatia. In addition, it found evidence that age, level of education, political orientation, and place of residence have an impact on people's views on euthanasia. There is a need for further research into attitudes on different end-of-life practices in Croatia.

TI  - Evaluation of Landsat 8 image pansharpening in estimating soil organic matter using multiple linear regression and artificial neural networks
T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In agricultural systems, the regular monitoring of Soil Organic Matter (SOM) dynamics is essential. This task is costly and time-consuming when using the conventional method, especially in a very fragmented area and with intensive agricultural activity, such as the area of Sidi Bennour. The study area is located in the Doukkala irrigated perimeter in Morocco. Satellite data can provide an alternative and fill this gap at a low cost. Models to predict SOM from a satellite image, whether linear or nonlinear, have shown considerable interest. This study aims to compare SOM prediction using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). A total of 368 points were collected at a depth of 0-30 cm and analyzed in the laboratory. An image at 15 m resolution (MSPAN) was produced from a 30 m resolution (MS) Landsat-8 image using image pansharpening processing and panchromatic band (15 m). The results obtained show that the MLR models predicted the SOM with (training/validation) R-2 values of 0.62/0.63 and 0.64/0.65 and RMSE values of 0.23/0.22 and 0.22/0.21 for the MS and MSPAN images, respectively. In contrast, the ANN models predicted SOM with R-2 values of 0.65/0.66 and 0.69/0.71 and RMSE values of 0.22/0.10 and 0.21/0.18 for the MS and MSPAN images, respectively. Image pansharpening improved the prediction accuracy by 2.60% and 4.30% and reduced the estimation error by 0.80% and 1.30% for the MLR and ANN models, respectively.

TI  - Using CDOM spectral shape information to improve the estimation of DOC concentration in inland waters: A case study of Andean Patagonian Lakes
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - For the last two decades different scientific disciplines have focused on lacustrine dissolved organic matter (DOM) given its importance in the biogeochemistry of carbon and in ecosystem functioning. New satellites supply the appropriate resolutions to evaluate chromophoric dissolved organicmatter (CDOM) in inland waters, opening the possibility to estimate DOM at appropriate spatiotemporal scales. This requires, however, a robust relationship between CDOM and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). In this work, we evaluated the use of CDOM as a proxy of DOC in 7 Andean Patagonian lakes. Considering the entire data set, CDOM absorption coefficients (a(355) and a(440)) were linearly related with DOC. Shallow lakes, however, drove this relationship showing a moderate relationship, whereas, deep lakes with lower colour presented a weaker relationship. Therefore, we assessed the use of CDOM spectral shape information to improve DOC estimates regardless of observed DOM differences due to climatic seasonality and lakes' morphometry. The use of well-known CDOM spectral shape metrics (i.e., S275-295 and a(250):a(365) ratio) significantly improved DOC estimation. Particularly, using a Gaussian decomposition approach we found that much of the variation in the spectral shape, associated with the variability of CDOM:DOC ratio, was explained by differences in two dynamic regions centred at 270 and 320 nm. A strong nonlinear relationship was found between the a(270):a(320) ratio and the DOC-specific absorption coefficients a*(355) and a*(440). This was translated into a further improvement in DOC estimation yielding the higher R-2 and lower mean absolute differences (MAPD < 16%), either considering the entire data set or shallow and deep lakes separately. Our results highlight that incorporating the CDOM spectral shape information improves the characterization of the DOC pool of inland waters, which is particularly relevant for remote and/or inaccessible sites and has significant implications for the environmental management, biogeochemical studies and future remote sensing applications.

TI  - Identification of dust sources in a dust hot-spot area in Iran using multi-spectral Sentinel 2 data and deep learning artificial intelligence machine
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The drying of wetlands in Iran due to climate change and indiscriminate human activities has increased dust production. Dust storms have become a major problem in arid and semi-arid regions and cause adverse social, economic, and environmental effects. The Jazmurian wetland in Kerman Province is one such area. To identify dust sources in the Jazmurian basin, high resolution Sentinel 2 data were used. From these, sediment supply was mapped. Three artificially intelligent algorithms-artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and deep-learning neural network (DLNN)-were used to model dust-production potential in the study area. The results show that portions of the Jazmurian basin that have dried up in recent years have a very high potential for dust production. Evaluation of the models' performances using area-under-curve (AUC) statistics revealed that the DLNN model is more efficient (AUC = 0.97) than either the ANN (AUC = 0.91) or SVM (AUC = 0.92). All three models reveal that NDVI, elevation, annual rainfall, and windspeed are the four most important factors influencing dust-production potential in the study area. This remote sensing-artificial intelligence framework should be tested for mapping dust-production potential in other regions as this study demonstrates highly accurate, high-resolution results. This study yielded fundamental information to identify locations in need of desertification management and mitigation of dust production in the Jazmurian basin.

TI  - Shear wave elastography of lymph nodes in dogs with head and neck cancer: A pilot study
T2  - VETERINARY AND COMPARATIVE ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Shear wave elastography (SWE) is a novel ultrasound imaging technique, used in human medicine to differentiate metastatic from non-metastatic lymph nodes (LNs) based on higher tissue stiffness. The objective of this pilot study was to evaluate whether canine metastatic LNs were stiffer compared to non-metastatic LNs. SWE of sentinel or regional LNs in dogs with head and neck cancer was performed. Ten elastograms of each LN were acquired. In each elastogram, mean, median, and maximum shear wave velocities (SWVs) were calculated in the most elastic region, the stiffest region, and the entire LN. The means of those SWVs for each region of each LN were subsequently calculated. Furthermore, a stepwise subsampling was performed to assess the effect of the number of acquired elastograms on the consistency of the classification of a LN as metastatic or not. Twenty-four LNs in 15 dogs with head and neck cancer were included, of which 10 LNs were metastatic. Metastatic medial retropharyngeal and mandibular LNs were successfully distinguished from non-metastatic LNs based on higher mean and median SWVs in the stiffest region and higher maximum SWVs in entire LNs. Furthermore, maximum SWVs in the stiffest region of mandibular LNs were higher in metastatic LNs compared to non-metastatic LNs. Downstream analyses demonstrated that at least eight elastograms were necessary to perform reliable analyses. This pilot trial demonstrated that SWE has potential to discriminate metastatic from non-metastatic LNs; however, LN status should be based on at least eight elastograms in future clinical trials.

TI  - A machine learning-based accuracy enhancement on EUMETSAT H-SAF H35 effective snow-covered area product
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow is a major element of the cryosphere with significant impact on the Earth's water cycle and global energy budget. Acquiring consistent and long time series data on the spatial extent of snow cover doubtlessly plays a key role in our understanding and modeling of the current and future environmental dynamics. Remote sensing offers a powerful tool for continuous retrieval of snow cover information by utilizing snow's contrasting reflectance characteristics at optical wavelengths. The pre-operational H35 covers the Northern Hemisphere, and it is the successor of the operational Pan-European H12 daily fractional snow-covered area (fSCA) product at similar to 1 km. Both products are developed through the Satellite Application Facility on Support to Operational Hydrology and Water Management (H-SAF) project of EUMETSAT by exploiting AVHRR channels. This study is focused on developing an alternative fully data-driven H35 product with improved accuracy using a machine learning (ML) based approach. Multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) algorithm is trained by using AVHRR reflectance data as well as the well-known snow and vegetation indices (i.e., NDSI and NDVI) to generate the new version of H35 fSCA product. The reference fSCA maps required for the training of MARS models are obtained from the higher resolution Sentinel 2 multispectral imagery. The MARS-based fSCA models are validated against an initial test dataset composed of 15 Sentinel 2 scenes over European Alps, Tatra Mountain Range, and Turkey. The final MARS-H35 product is then rigorously assessed over the whole Northern Hemisphere within a temporal domain spanning from Nov 2018 to Nov 2019. The quantitative testing process involves the use of reference data in both continuous and dichotomous scales: i) Sentinel 2 derived reference fSCA maps, ii) ERA5-Land snow depth data, iii) MODIS MOD10A1 NDSI snow cover data, and finally iv) in-situ snow depth data. Additionally, qualitative assessment is also performed by visually comparing MARS-H35/MODIS false-color and MARS-H35/Sentinel 2-derived reference fSCA image pairs over various geographic regions. The overall results indicate that: i) the proposed MARS-H35 fSCA product overperforms the original H35, and ii) it has higher capability in detecting the fine variations in the extent of snow cover, especially across the fringes of the slopes in complex mountainous terrains.

TI  - Activation of Complement Components on Circulating Blood Monocytes From COVID-19 Patients
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus may vary from asymptomatic to severe infection with multi-organ failure and death. Increased levels of circulating complement biomarkers have been implicated in COVID-19-related hyperinflammation and coagulopathy. We characterized systemic complement activation at a cellular level in 49-patients with COVID-19. We found increases of the classical complement sentinel C1q and the downstream C3 component on circulating blood monocytes from COVID-19 patients when compared to healthy controls (HCs). Interestingly, the cell surface-bound complement inhibitor CD55 was also upregulated in COVID-19 patient monocytes in comparison with HC cells. Monocyte membrane-bound C1q, C3 and CD55 levels were associated with plasma inflammatory markers such as CRP and serum amyloid A during acute infection. Membrane-bounds C1q and C3 remained elevated even after a short recovery period. These results highlight systemic monocyte-associated complement activation over a broad range of COVID-19 disease severities, with a compensatory upregulation of CD55. Further evaluation of complement and its interaction with myeloid cells at the membrane level could improve understanding of its role in COVID-19 pathogenesis.

TI  - Asymmetric Feature Fusion Network for Hyperspectral and SAR Image Classification
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Joint classification using multisource remote sensing data for Earth observation is promising but challenging. Due to the gap of imaging mechanism and imbalanced information between multisource data, integrating the complementary merits for interpretation is still full of difficulties. In this article, a classification method based on asymmetric feature fusion, named asymmetric feature fusion network (AsyFFNet), is proposed. First, the weight-share residual blocks are utilized for feature extraction while keeping separate batch normalization (BN) layers. In the training phase, redundancy of the current channel is self-determined by the scaling factors in BN, which is replaced by another channel when the scaling factor is less than a threshold. To eliminate unnecessary channels and improve the generalization, a sparse constraint is imposed on partial scaling factors. Besides, a feature calibration module is designed to exploit the spatial dependence of multisource features, so that the discrimination capability is enhanced. Experimental results on the three datasets demonstrate that the proposed AsyFFNet significantly outperforms other competitive approaches.

TI  - Wet snow detection using dual-polarized Sentinel-1 SAR time series data considering different land categories
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Snowmelt is a natural water resource, and its distribution is essential for understanding regional climate change and hydrological cycle. In this study, using dual-polarized C-band Sentinel-1 SAR data, we propose a new wet snow detection algorithm that considers the effects of radar incidence angle, land cover types and topography for snow regions where prairie snow is the main snow cover type. We quantitatively evaluate the performance of the proposed method by optical-derived snow maps. The results show that (1) the overall accuracy of the proposed method is 80.8% (dry snow reference) and 79.0% (snow-free reference); while using a conventional threshold of -2 dB, the accuracy is 32.1% and 43.5%, respectively; (2) -2 dB can only be applied on the ratio image calculated by the snow-free reference to extract wet snow in cropland; (3) adding topographic information greatly improves the identification accuracy, especially for grassland and barren with higher topographic complexity.

TI  - Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio is associated with survival and sentinel lymph node positivity in invasive cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma: A retrospective study
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a known prognostic biomarker for survival and is predictive of sentinel lymph node (SLN) positivity in some cancers. However, its usefulness as a prognostic biomarker for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) has not been fully investigated.Objective: Our objective was to investigate the relationship between the NLR and the disease-specific survival and SLN positivity in patients with cSCC.Methods: In this single-center retrospective case series, we analyzed patients with cSCC who underwent blood tests prior to the initiation of treatment at our oncology hospital. The relationship between the patients' clinical characteristics (including the NLR) and the disease-specific survival and SLN positivity was evaluated using univariate and multivariate analyses.Results: An elevated NLR was an independent prognostic factor for poor disease-specific survival and a predictive factor for SLN positivity.Limitations: Limitations include the small number of participants and selection bias due to the large proportion of high-risk cases in our patient population.Conclusion: NLR is a useful biomarker in cSCC because it is simple to measure and can predict prognosis.

TI  - Use of multi-source remotely sensed data in monitoring the spatial distribution of pools and pool dynamics along non-perennial rivers in semi-arid environments, South Africa
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explored the use of multi-source remotely sensed data in monitoring the spatial distribution of pools and pool dynamics in two distinct semi-arid sites in South Africa. The factors that control the pool dynamics were also examined. Three water extraction indices were used, these included Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI), Modified NDWI and Normalised Difference Vegetation Index. In addition, random forest classifier and Sentinel-1 SAR data were used in mapping pools and pools dynamics for both sites. Overall, the remotely-sensed methods detected and mapped pools with acceptable accuracy, except for small pools (<400 m(2)). The results suggest that flow occurrences and rainfall are key in controlling temporal changes in pools sizes, and there was no interaction between pools and groundwater. The study showed that remote sensing methods are essential for filling ground monitoring gaps in non-perennial rivers and determining hydrological processes and water availability from pools in semi-arid environments.

TI  - Monitoring of construction-induced urban ground deformations using Sentinel-1 PS-InSAR: The case study of tunneling in Dangjin, Korea
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The construction of underground tunnels can prime or trigger ground subsidence, and thus surface deformation monitoring is required during and post-construction. Freely available satellite data allow significant possibilities for the use of remote sensing techniques, particularly multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (Mt-InSAR), for surface deformation monitoring. However, track records and field demonstrations of InSAR-based tunneling-related deformation monitoring are limited, particularly in identifying the spatiotemporal evolution of ground deformation and causal factors thereof from construction activities. Therefore, this study explores the feasibility of using satellite SAR data to monitor the surface deformation associated with different tunnel construction phases. Tunneling-related surface deformation was analyzed using the persistent scatterer InSAR (PS-InSAR) technique and Sentinel-1B SAR data; the PS-InSAR results were compared with those from the conventional leveling method. The velocity map of the study site revealed a localized subsidence trough asso-ciated with the construction of vertical shafts and shield tunneling. The cumulative time-series displacement map successfully tracked the spatial and temporal progression of ground deformations related to the phases of tunnel construction activities. The maximum subsidence rate in the radar line-of-sight direction was estimated to exceed 40 mm/yr, with maximum cumulative subsidence of ~ 200 mm. The results clearly showed that dewatering during tunneling aggravated the subsidence phenomenon. The consequent compaction and consolidation of the compressible soil layers due to the lowered groundwater table were the main causes of subsidence. Our results demonstrate the viability of the PS-InSAR technique based on the C-band Sentinel-1 product as a monitoring method to examine the spatiotemporal evolution of ground deformation patterns during tunneling activities and as a possible preliminary surveying tool to identify ongoing abnormal settlement prior to tunnel construction.

TI  - Temporal and spatial analysis and monitoring of drought (meteorology) and its impacts on environment changes in Iran
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The consequences of climate change, primarily due to natural and human factors, have caused many problems in the last decade that have affected different sections of society. One of the most important consequences is the occurrence of natural atmospheric-climatic disasters (drought). One of these regions is Iran in the Middle East, which has been suffering from this drought in the last decade. This investigation aims to evaluate and monitor drought and its impacts on environment changes in Iran. To conduct this research, the TERRA satellite data and the MODIS sensor were used over a 21-year period, and the Normalised Differential Vegetation Index and Palmer Drought Severity Index Indicators were used to monitor drought and to estimate the soil moisture by the Soil Moisture Calculation satellite. Finally, to estimate the amount of precipitation and evapotranspiration, cumulative precipitation and real evapotranspiration, actual evaporation and transpiration were used. Findings showed that in the investigation region, the severity and frequency of drought have increased in recent years. Soil moisture has also decreased, indicating the inverse relationship between drought intensity and soil surface moisture, meaning that as the intensity of drought increases, the amount of soil surface moisture decreases. However, in the investigation region during the study course, the accumulation of rain showed a direct relationship with evaporation and transpiration. The highest monthly drought intensity of Palmer was 5.65% in May 2000. Also, the highest amount of wet year in November 2018 is 3.6%. The highest amount of rainfall was 61.25 mm in October 2018. Based on the results obtained in this research, drought has occurred in the investigation region in recent years, the intensity of which in the south, eastern and centre half of the country, especially the provinces of south Khorasan, Semnan, Hormozgan, Sistan and Baluchestan, Khuzestan and Ilam more it has been more than other provinces. To manage and control drought in the investigation region, in the various sectors affected by drought (agriculture, environment, surface water resources, forests, pastures and watershed management and natural ecosystems) strategies and plans in the short term, medium-term and long-term in line with natural and human factors and climate change to be adopted.

TI  - Deriving Phenological Metrics from Landsat-OLI for Sugarcane Crop Type Mapping: A Case Study in North India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The crop detection and classification using satellite imagery can be helpful in crop management. Therefore, it is needed to be explored for effective crop detection and classification. In this study, the phenological metrics derived from dense Landsat Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series from January 2017 to June 2018 were used to classify sugarcane crop type. The Savitzkey-Golay method was employed as curve fitting method for smoothening and filtering of the pre-processed NDVI time-series data. Thereafter, the phenological metrics extracted from TIMESAT were used to classify planted and ratoon sugarcane using the decision-tree approach. The overall accuracy was 84.5%, and the kappa coefficient was 0.7. The results showed that the classification method was consistent and robust which has the potential to increase the classification accuracy by the use of better resolution satellite imagery time-series. Moreover, the phenological metrics have the potential to explain the spatial distribution of agricultural pattern, use of crop varieties and management practices that can be useful in better understanding of agricultural practices in the region along with crop diversification and crop yield modelling.

TI  - Clarifications on the equations and the sample number in triple collocation analysis using SST observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The triple collocation (or three-way error) analysis is a widely used approach to infer the random uncertainty of three datasets measuring the same geophysical variable. It has been applied primarily for studying the quality of satellite observations for several variables, including sea surface temperature (SST) among others. Different algorithms have been developed in the literature to calculate the random uncertainties with sometimes distinct assumptions of the underlying error model or different equations. Four of the available triple collocation (TC) algorithms have been examined here in order to clarify the assumptions behind them and investigate their mathematical equivalence. In addition, triple collocations of SST observations from drifting buoys, and satellite observations from the ATSRs and microwave (MW) imagers have been used to examine the divergence among the TC algorithms with real data. It has been found that the maximum absolute difference is less than 0.009 K for the data considered here, indicating that the choice of TC algorithm is not significant to first order. This result permitted the investigation of the impact of the number of collocations by performing statistical experiments with real observations selecting them randomly without replacement. It is established that the ideal number is at least 500. Numbers below 200 on average would underestimate the true value of random uncertainties, while for numbers of about 100 or below numerical instabilities appear preventing the convergence to a solution with this issue becoming more acute as the number becomes smaller. For the SST instruments considered, the dependence of the random uncertainty on the sample number is described adequately by a theoretical equation given by Zwieback et al. (2012). This theoretical equation has been used to study the robustness of the differences in AMSR-E random uncertainties between day and night. The differences are mainly due to wind speed dependence, manifested also as latitudinal dependence. This is further confirmed when examining the variability of the random uncertainties with wind speed and SST. The AATSR random uncertainty slightly decreases linearly with wind speed, while AMSR-E increases by up to 50% between low and high wind speeds. A non-negligible dependence with SST has been found for both AATSR and drifting buoys with higher random uncertainty for SST in the range 10 degrees-15 degrees C. The AMSR-E random uncertainty decreases linearly with SST, when SST is above about 15 degrees C. Obviously, the dependence of the random uncertainty with the geophysical variable, here SST, violates one of the assumptions behind TC. Nevertheless, this can be mitigated through the application of TC into intervals of the geophysical variable for which the independence from the random uncertainty holds. These practical results unveil the real power of TC which based on the use of three collocated datasets is able to characterise their random uncertainties in a robust way, something extremely difficult to achieve by employing only two datasets without prior knowledge.

TI  - Integrated topographic corrections improve forest mapping using Landsat imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In mountainous environments, topography strongly affects the reflectance due to illumination effects and cast shadows, which introduce errors in land cover classifications. However, topographic correction is not routinely implemented in standard data pre-processing chains (e.g., Landsat Analysis Ready Data), and there is a lack of consensus whether topographic correction is necessary, and if so, how to conduct it. Furthermore, methods that correct simultaneously for atmospheric and topographic effects are becoming available, but they have not been compared directly. Our objects were to investigate (1) the effectiveness of two topographic correction approaches that integrate atmospheric and topographic correction, (2) improvements in classification accuracy when analyzing topographically corrected single-date imagery (14 July 2016 and 2 October 2016), versus a full Landsat time series from 2014 to 2016, and 3) improvements in classification accuracy when including additional terrain information (i.e. topographic slope, elevation, and aspect). We developed a physical based model and compared it with an enhanced C-correction, both of which integrate atmospheric and topographic correction. We compared classification accuracies with and without topographic correction using combinations of single-date imagery, image composites and spectral-temporal metrics generated from the full Landsat time series, and additional terrain information in the Caucasus Mountains. We found that both the enhanced C-correction and the physical model performed very well and largely eliminated the correlation (Pearson's correlation coefficient r ranges from 0.06 to 0.24) between surface reflectance and illumination condition, but the physical model performed best (r ranges from 0.05 to 0.11). Both image composites, and spectral-temporal metrics generated from corrected imagery, resulted in significantly (p & LE; 0.05) higher classification accuracies and better forest classifications, especially for the mixed forests. Adding terrain information reduced classification error significantly, but not as much as topographic correction. In summary, topographic correction remains necessary, even when analyzing a full Landsat time series and including a digital elevation model in the classification. We recommend that topographic correction should be applied when analyzing Landsat satellite imagery in mountainous region for forest cover classification.

TI  - Deep learning-based local climate zone classification using Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery
T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - As a newly developed classification system, the LCZ scheme provides a research framework for Urban Heat Island (UHI) studies and standardizes the worldwide urban temperature observations. With the growing popularity of deep learning, deep learning-based approaches have shown great potential in LCZ mapping. Three major cities in China are selected as the study areas. In this study, we design a deep convolutional neural network architecture, named Residual combined Squeeze-and-Excitation and Non-local Network (RSNNet), that consists of the Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) block and non-local block to classify LCZ using freely available Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery. Overall Accuracy (OA) of 0.9202, 0.9524 and 0.9004 for three selected cities are obtained by applying RSNNet and training data of individual city, and OA of 0.9328 is obtained by training RSNNet with data from all three cities. RSNNet outperforms other popular Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in terms of LCZ mapping accuracy. We further design a series of experiments to investigate the effect of different characteristics of Sentinel-1 SAR data on the performance of RSNNet in LCZ mapping. The results suggest that the combination of SAR and multispectral data can improve the accuracy of LCZ classification. The proposed RSNNet achieves an OA of 0.9425 when integrating the three decomposed components with Sentinel-2 multispectral images, 2.44% higher than using Sentinel-2 images alone.

TI  - Operational daily evapotranspiration mapping at field scale based on SSEBop model and spatiotemporal fusion of multi-source remote sensing data
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate understanding of daily evapotranspiration (ET) at field scale is of great significance for agricultural water resources management. The operational simplified surface energy balance (SSEBop) model has been applied to estimate field scale ET with Landsat satellite imagery. However, there is still uncertainty in the ET time reconstruction for cloudy days based on limited clear days' Landsat ET fraction (ETf) computed by SSEBop. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remote sensing data can provide daily surface observation over clear-sky areas. This paper presented an enhanced gap-filling scheme for the SSEBop ET model, which improved the temporal resolution of Landsat ETf through the spatio-temporal fusion with SSEBop MODIS ETf on clear days and increased the time reconstruction accuracy of field-scale ET. The results were validated with the eddy covariance (EC) measurements over cropland in northwestern China. It indicated that the improved scheme performed better than the original SSEBop Landsat approach in daily ET estimation, with higher Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE, 0.75 vs. 0.70), lower root mean square error (RMSE, 0.95 mm.d(-1) vs. 1.05 mm.d(-1)), and percent bias (PBias, 16.5% vs. 25.0%). This fusion method reduced the proportion of deviation (13.3% vs. 25.5%) in the total errors and made the random error the main proportion, which can be reduced over time and space in regional ET estimation. It also evidently improved the underestimation of crop ET by the SSEBop Landsat scheme during irrigation before sowing and could more accurately describe the synergistic changes of soil moisture and cropland ET. The proposed MODIS and Landsat ETf fusion can significantly improve the accuracy of SSEBop in estimating field-scale ET.

TI  - Unfavorable genetic correlations between fecal egg count and milk production traits in the French blond-faced Manech dairy sheep breed
T2  - GENETICS SELECTION EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Genetic selection has proven to be a successful strategy for the sustainable control of gastrointestinal parasitism in sheep. However, little is known on the relationship between resistance to parasites and production traits in dairy breeds. In this study, we estimated the heritabilities and genetic correlations for resistance to parasites and milk production traits in the blond-faced Manech breed. The resistance to parasites of 951 rams from the selection scheme was measured through fecal egg counts (FEC) at 30 days post-infection under experimental conditions. Six milk production traits [milk yield (MY), fat yield (FY), protein yield (PY), fat content (FC), protein content (PC) and somatic cell score (LSCS)], were used in this study and were collected on 140,127 dairy ewes in first lactation, as part of the official milk recording. These ewes were related to the 951 rams (65% of the ewes were daughters of the rams).Results: Fecal egg counts at the end of the first and second infections were moderately heritable (0.19 and 0.37, respectively) and highly correlated (0.93). Heritabilities were moderate for milk yields (ranging from 0.24 to 0.29 for MY, FY and PY) and high for FC (0.35) and PC (0.48). MY was negatively correlated with FC and PC (-0.39 and -0.45, respectively). FEC at the end of the second infection were positively correlated with MY, FY and PY (0.28, 0.29 and 0.24, respectively with standard errors of similar to 0.10). These slightly unfavorable correlations indicate that the animals with a high production potential are genetically more susceptible to gastrointestinal parasite infections. A low negative correlation (- 0.17) was also found between FEC after the second infection and LSCS, which suggests that there is a small genetic antagonism between resistance to gastrointestinal parasites and resistance to mastitis, which is another important health trait in dairy sheep.Conclusions: Our results indicate an unfavorable but low genetic relationship between resistance to gastrointestinal parasites and milk production traits in the blond-faced Manech breed. These results will help the breeders' association make decisions about how to include resistance to parasites in the selection objective.

TI  - Attribution of Observed Recent Decrease in Low Clouds Over the Northeastern Pacific to Cloud-Controlling Factors
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine low clouds cool the Earth's climate, with their coverage (LCC) being controlled by their environment. Here, an observed significant decrease of LCC in the northeastern Pacific over the past two decades is linked quantitatively to changes in cloud-controlling factors. In a comparison of different statistical and machine learning methods, a decrease in the inversion strength and near-surface winds, and an increase in sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are unanimously shown to be the main causes of the LCC decrease. While the decreased inversion strength leads to more entrainment of dry free-tropospheric air, the increasing SSTs are shown to lead to an increased vertical moisture gradient that enhances evaporation when entrainment takes place. While the LCC trend is likely driven by natural variability, the trend-attribution framework developed here can be used with any method in future analyses. We find the choice of predictors is more important than the method.

TI  - Simple and complex burrow morphology in two <i>Macrophthalmus</i> species on the intertidal mudflats of Barr Al Hikman, Sultanate of Oman
T2  - JOURNAL OF NATURAL HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - Burrowing Ocypodoidea crabs are an abundant component of many tropical and temperate coastal areas and central to the ecosystem functioning, for instance because they recycle nutrients, are important food for many shorebirds and alter the sediment through their burrowing behaviour. The burrow morphology of these crabs may differ between and within species, often correlated with differences in habitat preferences, crab morphology and life-history traits. Here we studied the burrow morphology and complexity of Macrophthalmus sulcatus and Macrophthalmus depressus, by means of casts (n = 7 and 10, respectively) and burrow excavations (n = 17 and 16, respectively) at the pristine intertidal mudflats of Barr Al Hikman in the Sultanate of Oman. We found that M. sulcatus construct simple burrows that were in all but one case inhabited by a single crab. By contrast, all burrows of M. depressus were complex, with multiple entrances and many (deep-reaching) branches. There was a strong relationship between M. sulcatus carapace width and burrow entrance size, indicating that the simple burrows are adapted to and made by the occupant. There was no relation between M. depressus carapace width and burrow entrance size, and in six burrows more than one crab was encountered, suggesting that the complex burrows are not made by and adapted to a single occupant. The complex burrows were found close to the shore whereas the simple burrows were found at the intermediate tidal zone. We speculate that the striking differences in burrow morphology may be explained by difference in habitat selection of the studied crabs, which most importantly relates to differences in sediment structure and tidal height. Crab morphology and life-history traits of the studied crabs could also account for the observed difference in burrow morphology.

TI  - Re-examining the 'culture of silence' through peer-based Pasifika pedagogies in a New Zealand tertiary environment
T2  - JOURNAL OF HIGHER EDUCATION POLICY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper draws on a study that examined the experiences of four high-achieving Pasifika physiotherapy degree level students to identify factors contributing to their success. As peer students, they identified five approaches that assisted them to become high achievers within the tertiary environment. This paper refers specifically to these approaches as peer-based Pasifika pedagogies (PbPP) and broadly as culturally responsive practices. The aim of this paper is to examine how Pasifika pedagogies, such as PbPP provide culturally responsive practices that can address the 'culture of silence' while promoting the va relationality, the cultural nuances and norms of their worldview as well as aligning it with modern pedagogies or tools to enhance success among Pasifika students in the New Zealand tertiary education context.

TI  - Vertical artifacts in high-resolution WorldView-2 and WorldView-3 satellite imagery of aquatic systems
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite image artefacts are features that appear in an image but not in the original imaged object and can negatively impact the interpretation of satellite data. Vertical artefacts are linear features oriented in the along-track direction of an image system and can present as either banding or striping; banding are features with a consistent width, and striping are features with inconsistent widths. This study used high-resolution data from DigitalGlobeModified Letter Turned Commas (now Maxar) WorldView-3 satellite collected at Lake Okeechobee, Florida (FL), on 30 August 2017. This study investigated the impact of vertical artefacts on both at-sensor radiance and a spectral index for an aquatic target as WorldView-3 was primarily designed as a land sensor. At-sensor radiance measured by six of WorldView-3Modified Letter Turned Commas eight spectral bands exhibited banding, more specifically referred to as non-uniformity, at a width corresponding to the multispectral detector sub-arrays that comprise the WorldView-3 focal plane. At-sensor radiance measured by the remaining two spectral bands, red and near-infrared (NIR) #1, exhibited striping. Striping in these spectral bands can be attributed to their time delay integration (TDI) settings at the time of image acquisition, which were optimized for land. The impact of vertical striping on a spectral index leveraging the red, red edge, and NIR spectral bands-referred to here as the NIR maximum chlorophyll index (MCINIR)-was investigated. . Temporally similar imagery from the European Space AgencyModified Letter Turned Commas Sentinel-3 and Sentinel-2 satellites were used as baseline references of expected chlorophyll values across Lake Okeechobee as neither Sentinel-3 nor Sentinel-2 imagery showed striping. Striping was highly prominent in the MCINIR product generated using WorldView-3 imagery, as noise in the at-sensor radiance exceeded any signal of chlorophyll in the image. Adjusting the image acquisition parameters for future tasking of WorldView-3 or the functionally similar WorldView-2 satellite may alleviate these artefacts. To test this, an additional WorldView-3 image was acquired at Lake Okeechobee, FL, on 26 May 2021 in which the TDI settings and scan line rate were adjusted to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. While some evidence of non-uniformity remained, striping was no longer noticeable in the MCINIR product. Future image tasking over aquatic targets should employ these updated image acquisition parameters. Since the red and NIR #1 spectral bands are critical for inland and coastal water applications, archived images not collected using these updated settings may be limited in their potential for analysis of aquatic variables that require these two spectral bands to derive.

TI  - A comparison of remotely sensed environmental predictors for avian distributions
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context With greater accessibility and processing power from online platforms, summaries of remotely sensed data are increasingly used in species distribution models (SDMs). Comparisons of the predictive power of these environmental variables could inform SDMs moving forward. Objectives We evaluated the performance of freely available Landsat data as predictor sets for SDMs. Our objectives were to (1) compare the performance of single season SDMs built on mean values of raw spectral bands, Tasseled Cap transformations, and eight different indices, including NDVI, (2) evaluate the performance gain with the addition of standard deviation, textural metrics, and additional seasons, and (3) compare the performance of SDMs built on these continuous spectral predictor sets to SDMs built on classified land cover data (e.g., percent forest cover). Methods We used statewide point counts to build multi-scale SDMs for 13 avian species across Oregon, USA. We compared the performance of SDMs built on each predictor set based on our objectives. Results Of the Landsat-derived predictor sets, SDMs built on raw spectral bands had the highest overall performance with nearly equivalent performance in Tasseled-Cap models. While performance gains from standard deviations, textural metrics, and additional seasons were minimal in raw-band and Tasseled-Cap models, gains were appreciable in single-index models. Classified land cover models performed equivalently to raw band models. Conclusions When predictive performance is paramount, means of raw Landsat bands are strong predictors for avian SDMs. When parsimonious variables are essential, SDMs of single indices (e.g., NDVI) greatly benefit from additional information, such as standard deviation.

TI  - A New Index for Snow/Ice/Ice-Snow Discrimination Based on BRDF Characteristic Observation Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The field observation data of ice-snow (the ice covered by snow) is scarce, causing a poor understanding of its characteristics and some uncertainty in ice process simulation. Using a multi-angle observation instrument, we conducted a field investigation and measured the snow/ice/ice-snow Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function. Both snow and ice have the typical feature of forwarding scattering, and the scattering intensity is governed by their properties (i.g., snow grain size, liquid water content, and transparency). The characteristics of ice-snow are similar to snow when a small amount of fresh snow is deposited on the ice surface, but will change significantly when the surface snow is metamorphic (melt or refreezing). This change can affect the monitoring accuracy of snow and ice using remote sensing data. In this study, a Normalized Difference Ice-Snow Index (NDISI) was developed using two bands (i.e., 1,080-1,120 nm and 1,760-1,800 nm). We applied spectra from different regions to verify the ability of NDISI and its application for distinguishing ice-snow. This work should be helpful for the fine classification between snow, ice, and ice-snow. It can support a more accurate simulation of ice phenology.

TI  - Intra-Annual Ground Surface Deformation Detected by Site Observation, Simulation and InSAR Monitoring in Permafrost Site of Xidatan, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The permafrost degradation can cause long-term ground surface subsidence, and the surface undergoes frost heave and thaw settlement due to the ice-water phase change in the active layer. The multi-year surveys by leveling observations and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar monitoring (InSAR) are helpful to understand the characteristics of seasonal deformation and to model the permafrost terrain surface deformation. In this paper, we studied the characteristics of seasonal deformation over permafrost terrain in Xidatan, obtained by leveling measurements from 2010 to 2018, Sentinel-1 data from 2014 to 2020, and hydrothermal-data-based simulation. The results consistently showed a four-stage pattern of seasonal deformation characteristics: Summer thaw subsiding, warm-season stable-standing, winter freeze heaving and stable-standing. The leveling measurements proved that spatial heterogeneity also exists on a small spatial scale (400 m(2)). The deformation amplitude obtained by leveling data is the largest, and the InSAR data is the smallest.

TI  - Free iron oxide content in tropical soils predicted by integrative digital mapping
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The free iron content is a vital indicator of pedogenic processes in tropical soils and can be used to understand the soil's weathering history and aid in classification. Despite its importance in agriculture and pedology, laboratory analyses of soil iron content are not widely used because they are costly and time-consuming. Remote sensing data combined with digital soil mapping are effective tools to regionalise soil iron content. They can reduce the number of soil samples needed to characterise soil variability and, consequently, laboratory analysis costs. This study aimed to create a strategy for mapping free iron content using a 35-year time series of Landsat images combined with topographic parameters at two spatial resolutions (5 and 30 m) in a region with high variability in soils and geology in the state of Sa & SIM;o Paulo, Brazil. The dataset comprised 344 observations of free iron content at 0-20 cm depth over a 2574 km(2) area. The dataset was split into calibration and a validation set (85:15%), and the environmental variables were chosen based on the scorpan factors. Spatial prediction functions for free iron were developed using several machine learning algorithms linking soil observations with the environmental variables. We found that the temporal bare soil image improved model performance. Although 5 and 30 m resolution terrain data differed slightly, the best-fit model was obtained at 5 m resolution (root mean square error, 25.09 g kg(-1); adjusted R-2, 0.84). Among the evaluated machine learning algorithms, Random Forest was the most accurate method for predicting free iron distribution in the study area. The free iron content map can identify soil types in more detail and should be prioritised in future pedological studies.

TI  - Automated determination of landslide locations after large trigger events: advantages and disadvantages compared to manual mapping
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Earthquakes in mountainous areas can trigger thousands of co-seismic landslides, causing significant damage, hampering relief efforts, and rapidly redistributing sediment across the landscape. Efforts to understand the controls on these landslides rely heavily on manually mapped landslide inventories, but these are costly and time-consuming to collect, and their reproducibility is not typically well constrained. Here we develop a new automated landslide detection index (ALDI) algorithm based on pixel-wise normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) differencing of Landsat time series within Google Earth Engine accounting for seasonality. We compare classified inventories to manually mapped inventories from five recent earthquakes: Kashmir in 2005, Aysen in 2007, Wenchuan in 2008, Haiti in 2010, and Gorkha in 2015. We test the ability of ALDI to recover landslide locations (using receiver operating characteristic - ROC - curves) and landslide sizes (in terms of landslide area-frequency statistics). We find that ALDI more skilfully identifies landslide locations than published inventories in 10 of 14 cases when ALDI is locally optimised and in 8 of 14 cases both when ALDI is globally optimised and in holdback testing. These results reflect not only good performance of the automated approach but also surprisingly poor performance of manual mapping, which has implications both for how future classifiers are tested and for the interpretations that are based on these inventories. We find that manual mapping, which typically uses finer-resolution imagery, more skilfully captures the landslide area-frequency statistics, likely due to reductions in both the censoring of individual small landslides and amalgamation of landslide clusters relative to ALDI. We conclude that ALDI is a viable alternative to manual mapping in terms of its ability to identify landslide-affected locations but is less suitable for detecting small isolated landslides or precise landslide geometry. Its fast run time, cost-free image requirements, and near-global coverage suggest the potential to significantly improve the coverage and quantity of landslide inventories. Furthermore, its simplicity (pixel-wise analysis only) and parsimony of inputs (optical imagery only) mean that considerable further improvement should be possible.

TI  - Assessment of long-term ground subsidence and groundwater depletion in Hanoi, Vietnam
T2  - ENGINEERING GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization and population growth in Hanoi city raise the demand for groundwater and the risk of land subsidence. This study is the first to conduct a long-term interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) analysis with different SAR sensors including ALOS, COSMO-SkyMed and Sentinel-1 to evaluate the spatiotemporal evolution of subsidence in Hanoi between 2007 and 2018. The results show that subsidence in Central Hanoi had been diminishing during these 12 years, while the southern and western outskirts (Ha Dong and Hoai Duc district) had become hot spots with peak rates of ~50 mm/yr. We further model the subsidence time-series with 22 years of piezometric records to estimate hydrogeological properties in the area. The modeling yields a mean consolidation coefficient of 0.56 m2/yr, a value typical for aquitards composed of > 90% fine-grain materials. The model also predicts another 0.5-1.3 m of subsidence in Ha Dong by the end of this century. Based on these results, we propose zoning for subsidence susceptibility as the basis for future groundwater management in Hanoi. From a regional perspective, Hanoi is relatively less affected by land subsidence compared to other South East Asian cities due to geotechnical factors including small consolidation coefficients, as well as social factors such as lower population density.

TI  - RFID-based location based services framework for alerting on black spots for accident prevention
T2  - EGYPTIAN INFORMATICS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The need of developing systems that address traffic matters such as traffic control and accidents has led to the development of a number of techniques, methods and tools to address road usability issues. Many automated models have been proposed and applied in different scenarios such as road oddities. Despite of the advantages of these models the major problem of road accidents continue to pose problem glob-ally. This has created the need to come up with more user-effective approaches to address road accidents. Main objective of this research therefore is to identify and address the gap in Location Based Services (LBS). A model that combines RFID and GPS technology to provide Location Based Services via audio alerts to drivers as they approach black spots is presented. The model provides location based services to dri-vers as they approach black spots causing them to adjust their driving accordingly (i.e. speeding, overtak-ing). Since LBS technologies have different limitations, most researchers have focused on addressing accuracy limitation by proposing hybrid technologies. Accuracy requirement varies depending on appli-cation area. The analysis of the different technologies revealed that in vehicle transportation medium accuracy is effective. This research focused on availability aspect which is a key requirement in LBS. To achieve this a model made up of RFID & GPS is formulated. Higher availability of significant alerts at black spots is registered through simulation as compared to alerts when the technologies are applied sepa-rately. Black spot accidents are therefore managed due to safer driving around black spots. This can lead to reduction in exposure to accidents, likelihood of occurrence and impact in the event of an incident. Usability metrics is used to determine effectiveness of the model.

TI  - Associations between SARS-CoV-2 variants and risk of COVID-19 hospitalization among confirmed cases in Washington State: a retrospective cohort study.
T2  - medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences
M3  - Preprint
AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is dominated by variant viruses; the resulting impact on disease severity remains unclear. Using a retrospective cohort study, we assessed the hospitalization risk following infection with seven SARS-CoV-2 variants.METHODS: Our study includes individuals with positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in the Washington Disease Reporting System with available viral genome data, from December 1, 2020 to January 14, 2022. The analysis was restricted to cases with specimens collected through sentinel surveillance. Using a Cox proportional hazards model with mixed effects, we estimated hazard ratios (HR) for hospitalization risk following infection with a variant, adjusting for age, sex, calendar week, and vaccination.FINDINGS: 58,848 cases were sequenced through sentinel surveillance, of which 1705 (2.9%) were hospitalized due to COVID-19. Higher hospitalization risk was found for infections with Gamma (HR 3.20, 95%CI 2.40-4.26), Beta (HR 2.85, 95%CI 1.56-5.23), Delta (HR 2.28 95%CI 1.56-3.34) or Alpha (HR 1.64, 95%CI 1.29-2.07) compared to infections with ancestral lineages; Omicron (HR 0.92, 95%CI 0.56-1.52) showed no significant difference in risk. Following Alpha, Gamma, or Delta infection, unvaccinated patients show higher hospitalization risk, while vaccinated patients show no significant difference in risk, both compared to unvaccinated, ancestral lineage cases. Hospitalization risk following Omicron infection is lower with vaccination.CONCLUSION: Infection with Alpha, Gamma, or Delta results in a higher hospitalization risk, with vaccination attenuating that risk. Our findings support hospital preparedness, vaccination, and genomic surveillance.SUMMARY: Hospitalization risk following infection with SARS-CoV-2 variant remains unclear. We find a higher hospitalization risk in cases infected with Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta, but not Omicron, with vaccination lowering risk. Our findings support hospital preparedness, vaccination, and genomic surveillance.

TI  - OCO-2 Satellite-Imposed Constraints on Terrestrial Biospheric CO<sub>2</sub> Fluxes Over South Asia
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatiotemporal variability of terrestrial biospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes over South Asia has large uncertainty. The Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2) satellite provides much-needed retrievals of column-average CO2 on a global-scale, with the highest sensitivity to surface CO2 fluxes and spatiotemporal resolution available to-date. This study conducted global inverse model simulations, assimilating in situ (IS) data and OCO-2 retrievals, to assess optimized CO2 net ecosystem exchange (NEE) fluxes for South Asia. Annual Net Biome Exchange (NBE = NEE + biomass burning) fluxes over South Asia were estimated to be near neutral (0.04 +/- 0.14 PgC yr(-1)) using both IS and OCO-2 observations. The most robust result found by assimilating OCO-2 observations was the constraint imposed on the seasonal cycle of NBE fluxes. The amplitude of the seasonal cycle of NEE was found to be larger than previously assumed. The OCO-2 inversion led to an NBE seasonal amplitude of 0.34 PgC month(-1), which was larger compared to IS constrained NBE (0.19 PgC month(-1)) and MsTMIP ensemble mean NEE (0.16 PgC month(-1)). Moreover, OCO-2 data imposed a phase shift in the NBE seasonal cycle predicted by the prior model. The larger magnitude of NEE seasonality, and phase shift, simulated when assimilating OCO-2 observations are in general agreement with previous studies assimilating regional aircraft observations in addition to global IS observations. This result suggests that OCO-2 provides valuable data that allows for the estimate of NBE on a regional scale in a similar manner as regional in situ aircraft networks.Plain Language Summary The terrestrial biosphere plays a significant role in the global carbon budget. As biosphere-atmosphere exchange is one of the largest sources of uncertainty in the global carbon cycle, it is important that we better understand the sources and sinks of biospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). A major limitation for estimating CO2 fluxes from the terrestrial biosphere has historically been the scarcity of measurement data. However, to alleviate this issue, NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2) satellite was launched in 2014 with the goal to improve our understanding about the regional exchange of CO2 between the terrestrial biosphere and atmosphere. This study applied OCO-2 data focusing on South Asia, a region with highly uncertain spatiotemporal variability of terrestrial biospheric fluxes. When using OCO-2 data in this study, a larger seasonal amplitude of biospheric CO2 fluxes was estimated compared to what has previously been assumed for this region. A noticeable difference in the temporal variability of the CO2 flux seasonality was also determined when using satellite data. The results of this study suggest that OCO-2 provides data sufficient for estimating biospheric CO2 fluxes at a regional scale in a similar manner as regional aircraft networks.

TI  - Review Internal senses of the vagus nerve
T2  - NEURON
M3  - Review
AB  - The vagus nerve is an indispensable body-brain connection that controls vital aspects of autonomic physiology like breathing, heart rate, blood pressure, and gut motility, reflexes like coughing and swallowing, and survival behaviors like feeding, drinking, and sickness responses. Classical physiological studies and recent molecular/genetic approaches have revealed a tremendous diversity of vagal sensory neuron types that innervate different internal organs, with many cell types remaining poorly understood. Here, we review the state of knowledge related to vagal sensory neurons that innervate the respiratory, cardiovascular, and digestive systems. We focus on cell types and their response properties, physiological/behavioral roles, engaged neural circuits and, when possible, sensory receptors. We are only beginning to understand the signal transduction mechanisms used by vagal sensory neurons and upstream sentinel cells, and future studies are needed to advance the field of interoception to the level of mechanistic understanding previously achieved for our external senses.

TI  - Explaining the differential response of glaciers across different mountain ranges in the north-western Himalaya, India
T2  - COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The study investigated a group of 65 glaciers, selected from different mountain ranges in the north-western Himalaya, India to understand and explain their status and response to the changing climate, surface topography and glacier morphology. Two-date Landsat satellite images (1990 and 2014), ICESat altimetry data, HMA DEM and SRTM DEM were used to estimate the changes in glacier area, snout position, Equilibrium Line Altitude (ELA), glacier thickness and volume. The total area of the glaciers under consideration across the five ranges shrunk from 1106 +/- 33.6 km(2) in 1990 to 1073 +/- 24.6 km(2) in 2014 with the consequent reduction in the glacier volume from 219 +/- 6.66 km(3) in 1990 to 211 +/- 4.85 km(3) in 2014, a loss of 5.9 +/- 0.09 Gt during 24-year observation period. Upward shift in ELA, ranging from 18 +/- 17 m to 64 +/- 17 m, was observed during the observation period. The glaciers across the study area are losing thickness in the range of -0.59 +/- 0.22-1.18 +/- 0.40 m a(-1). The study revealed that the glaciers situated at altitudes < 4500 m have witnessed higher glacier area loss (8.25 +/- 1.3%) compared to those situated at altitudes > 6000 m (2.72 +/- 0.92%). The influence of size on glacier loss is indicated by the higher shrinkage observed for the glaciers < 3 km(2) in size (6.75 +/- 1.63%) compared to the lower shrinkage of 2.17 +/- 1.12% observed for the large-size glaciers (> 30 km(2)). Significant differences in the glacier response were observed across the five ranges due to the unique topographic and climatic setting endemic to a particular mountain range.

TI  - Empirically derived Coloured Dissolved Organic Matter absorption coefficient using <i>in-situ</i> and Sentinel 3/OLCI in coastal waters of India
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Chromophoric Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM) is the fraction of dissolved organic matter that absorbs sun light in ultra-violet and visible region of the electromagnetic radiation. CDOM is abundantly found in marine and coastal waters and is very important to studying optical properties of water columns and biogeochemistry of the water. It is a proxy to study dissolved organic carbon pools in marine and freshwater pools. This research aims to establish a relation between CDOM absorption and remote sensing reflectance in coastal waters of India using a large pool of in-situ data set. This study is very significant to studying CDOM distribution, its variability and the coastal processes that influence its distribution on larger time scales (seasonal to decadal changes) through ocean colour sensors. This study presents a new empirical algorithm for estimation of CDOM absorption (412nm) in Indian coastal waters using remote sensing reflectance that has not been reported so far. The study also presents its slope and variability in different regions of coastal waters of India using in-situ data. A large pool of 409 datasets has been generated using NASA bio-Optical Marine Algorithm Dataset/SeaWiFS Bio-Optical Archive and Storage System (NOMAD/SeaBASS) datasets and Indian coastal waters datasets collected during 2014-18 exclusively for coastal waters of India. A power equation is obtained using the ratio of remote sensing reflectance (Rrs412/Rrs555) to derive CDOM absorption with R-2=0.74. The retrieved absorption coefficient is further validated with independent in-situ data set using another 58 station points with R-2=0.84. The root mean square error is 0.03 m(-1) (with 20% standard error in modelled data). CDOM slope (S412-443) is also estimated from in-situ data and it varies from 0.010-0.020 (units nm(-1)) with a mean value of 0.015 (nm(-1)) for Indian coastal waters. CDOM absorption coefficient (412 nm) varies between 0.01-0.8 m(-1) for 90% of the stations whereas remaining 10% of the stations show high CDOM absorption coefficient between 1.2- 2.0 m(-1) in the study area. This empirically derived algorithm is then applied on Sentinel-3/OLCI derived remote sensing reflectance time series data of whole year 2019 and CDOM absorption coefficient has been retrieved in different regions of coastal waters off Gujarat (India). The seasonal and spatial variability in these regions show that this algorithm is having great potential to retrieve CDOM absorption in coastal areas using high-resolution ocean colour monitors like Sentinel-3/OLCI. This algorithm is highly useful in retrieving CDOM absorption in coastal waters through existing and future ocean colour monitors from space-borne platform.

TI  - Channel morphodynamics and sediment budget of the Lower Ganga River using a hydrogeomorphological approach
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ganga River is one of the largest river systems in the world that has built extensive alluvial plains in northern India. The stretch of the Lower Ganga River is vulnerable to siltation because of: (a) the naturally low slope in the alluvial stretch; (b) the confluence of several highly sediment-charged rivers such as the Ghaghra, Gandak, and Kosi; and (c) the reduction in non-monsoon flows because of upstream abstractions of both surface and groundwater. Additionally, the Farakka barrage has impacted the morphology of the Ganga River significantly, both upstream and downstream of the barrage. Large-scale siltation in several reaches has reduced the channel capacity, leading to catastrophic floods in this region even at low discharges. This work has utilized historical remote sensing data and UAV surveys to reconstruct channel morphodynamics and compute sediment volumes accumulated in the channel belt along the Lower Ganga River between Buxar and Farakka. The work was carried out by dividing the total length of the river into four continuous stretches: (a) Buxar-Gandhighat (GW1, 160 km); (b) Gandhighat-Hathidah (GW2, 106 km); (c) Hathidah-Azmabad (GW3, 182 km); and (d) Azmabad-Farakka (GW4, 132 km). We document that major 'hotspots' of siltation have developed in several reaches of the Lower Ganga during the last four to five decades. Sediment budgeting using planform maps provides estimates of 'extractable' volumes of sediment in GW1, GW2, GW3, and GW4 as 656 +/- 48, 706 +/- 52, 876 +/- 71, and 200 +/- 85 Mm(3), respectively. These estimates are considerably lower than those computed from the hydrological approach using observed suspended sediment load data, which assumes uniform sedimentation between two stations. Further, our approach provides reach-scale hotspots of aggradation and estimates of extractable sediment volumes, and this can be very useful for river managers to develop a strategic sediment management plan for the given stretch of the Ganga River.

TI  - Precipitation during two weeks in spring influences reproductive success of first-year females in the long-lived Natterer's bat
T2  - ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Bats are characterized by low reproductive rates in contrast with most of other small mammals. This makes their populations vulnerable when inclement environmental conditions such as cold and rainy weather impair the reproductive success of females. The fine-scale effect of weather on bats, however, remains largely unknown. Using a sliding window analysis approach on an 18-year individualized dataset on six Natterer's bat (Myotis nattereri) colonies, we investigated the effect of fine-scale weather conditions on age-specific reproductive success. We found that increased precipitation during a short time window in spring strongly reduced the probability of successful reproduction of first-year (FY) females. Our data suggest that this time window is concomitant with implantation or early pregnancy, before substantial investment into embryo development. In addition, larger FY had higher reproductive success, suggesting that reproduction may be condition dependent in young females. Reproductive success of older females was not affected by either weather or individual parameters. Our results show that changes in precipitation pattern may compromise the reproductive success of FY females. Further studies are needed to better understand the impact of weather conditions on reproductive success in long-lived bats under climate change scenarios.

TI  - Contribution of breaking wave on the co-polarized backscattering measured by the Chinese Gaofen-3 SAR
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the non-Bragg (NB) scattering due to breaking waves as measured by the C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is investigated using more than 300 Gaofen-3 (GF-3) SAR images, which were acquired in quad-polarization stripmap (QPS) mode, that is, co-polarization [vertical-vertical (VV) and horizontal-horizontal (HH)] and cross-polarization [vertical-horizontal (VH) and horizontal-vertical (HV)]. First, the quality of SAR-based wind estimation is checked against the Haiyang-2B (HY-2B) scatterometer and European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis (ERA-5), indicating a wind speed accuracy of 1.62 m s(-1) root-mean-square error (RMSE) and a 0.89 correlation. Then, the SAR-derived wind and HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) sea surface current are used to simulate Bragg resonant roughness. The non-polarized (NP) wave breaking contribution sigma ( wb ) on co-polarized SAR-measured normalized radar cross section (NRCS) sigma (0) is studied, which is derived using two methods: an approach of the Bragg theory and empirical function. Numerical simulations are contrasted with actual SAR measurements: they show that the theoretical-based approach provides accurate enough simulations of the NP contribution, especially at the HH-polarization channel. To deeply understand the behavior of sea surface scattering under breaking conditions, the third-generation WAVEWATCH-III (WW3) model is used to simulate wake-breaking parameters, i.e. whitecap coverage (WCC), whitecap foam thickness (WCT) and whitecap breaking height (WCH), which are then collocated with SAR images. The difference between simulated co-polarized NRCS and the measured one versus sea surface dynamics parameters (i.e. SAR-derived wind speed, HYCOM sea surface speed, and WW3-simulated significant wave height) shows that NP enhances HH-polarized backscattering, while it damps the VV-polarized backscattering. In addition, the contribution of sigma (wb) could be ignored for WCC and WCT larger than 15 x 10(-3) and 40 x 10(-3) m, respectively. Moreover, the ratio reduces with the increasing WCH greater than 2.0 m; in particular, the ratio likely remains to be 0.1 as WCH is greater than 2.5 m. Generally, the HH-polarized backscattering is relatively sensitive with the wave-breaking parameters; however, this behavior has to be further studied utilizing buoy-measured wave breaking data.

TI  - Assessment of reductions in NO<sub>2</sub> emissions from thermal power plants in Canada based on the analysis of policy, inventory, and satellite data
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The National Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI) was enacted in Canada as an information management tool under federal administration to assist in identifying the amount of point pollution sources. This study demonstrates an approach to combine on-ground air pollutant emission inventory (i.e., NPRI) with satellite monitoring data to verify the impact on overall air pollution of implementing policies to reduce emissions from power plants. As demonstrated by the satellite observations, the decreasing column density in satellite NO2 hot spots was obvious in some Canadian provinces, especially in Ontario, where total on-site NO2 releases from all types of power plants decreased by 98.4% and the total value of TVCDs of NO2 in the corresponding area saw a 70.5% decrease over the period of study (i.e., 2008 to 2017). With the advances brought by these direct and indirect demand-pull policies, coal-fired plants are being rapidly phased out in Canada, and this trend is projected to become more pronounced in future years. This study provides insights for developing a verification method that uses digital and visual methods to characterize the changes in emissions concentration in the area surrounding an emission source as a result of emission reduction policies and incentives. Combining numerical data from an inventory tool with pollutant concentration thresholds at the geographical level can be helpful for monitoring emission reduction performance.

TI  - Alleviation approach for flash flood risk reduction in urban dwellings: A case study of Fifth District, Egypt
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Flash Floods resemble one of the most strenuous challenges that we face in the 21st century. Therefore, identifying the flooded areas is imperative to avert the negative consequences. An enormous number of researchers tended to study the impact of flash floods on vast areas which puts up some challenges if we want to address this deleterious effect of flash floods on small urban cities. This research focused on investigating and mitigating the devastating effect of flash floods on Fifth District- Egypt where the flash flood strikes many times a year. Furthermore, the study was developed on both community and building scale. The purpose of studying the community scale is to assess the risk level that may occur during certain predicted hydrographs. Moreover, this study was also conducted on a building scale to examine the effect of water excess on buildings and how many buildings are in the flood streamlines. The water depth was calculated in front of each building to make fully appraisal on the buildings state. Moreover, 32 underground tanks were utilized as protective measures. These tanks were located at the streamlines where the water flow accumulates. After applying the mitigation measures, the water depth decreased in the main streamlines as well as 153 m(3) of the rainfall water was collected and could be reused after treatment. Eventually, the analytical hierarchy process was used to generate the weights of each component of flood hazard map. This map is essential to determine the most prone areas in the studied region.

TI  - Modulation of Intestinal Barrier, Inflammatory Response, and Gut Microbiota by <i>Pediococcus pentosaceus</i> zy-B Alleviates Vibrio <i>parahaemolyticus</i> Infection in C57BL/6J Mice
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Modulation of the intestinal barrier, inflammation, and gut microbiota by Pediococcus pentosaceus zy-B (zy-B) in Vibrio parahaemolyticus (Vp)-infected C57BL/6J mice was studied. Mice intragastrically pretreated with 108 colony-forming units (CFU) zy-B significantly alleviated Vp infection as evidenced by maintaining body weight and reduced disease activity index score and intestine ratio. In addition, zy-B reduced the Vp load in the ileum and cecum, significantly reduced the load in the colon, prevented colonic atrophy, and strengthened mucosal integrity. Mechanistically, zy-B ameliorated intestinal barrier dysfunction by upregulating tight junction protein expression, which in turn reduced the lipopolysaccharide, D-lactic acid (D-LA), and diamine oxidase concentrations and downregulated the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) and CB2 mRNA expressions. Moreover, zy-B systemically reduced inflammation by decreasing interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels, and increased interleukin-10 (IL-10), immunoglobulin M (IgM), and immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels in the colon and serum. Furthermore, zy-B markedly altered the gut microbiota composition by enriching Bifidobacterium, Akkermansia, and Lactobacillus in the colon. Overall, zy-B appears to act as a probiotic to alleviate Vp infection by protecting the intestinal barrier, reducing inflammation, and promoting the growth of "beneficial" gut microbiota.

TI  - A 250 m resolution global leaf area index product derived from MODIS surface reflectance data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - There are several global leaf area index (LAI) products currently available. The spatial resolution of these products is 500 m and above, which is unsuitable for many applications requiring higher spatial resolution. In the past several years, we developed a method to estimate the LAI from time series satellite remote sensing data using general regression neural networks. The method has been used to generate global LAI products at 500 m and 1000 m from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance data, and a global LAI product at 0.05 degrees from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) surface reflectance data. In this study, the method was extended to generate a global LAI product at 250 m (one of the MUltiscale Satellite remotE Sensing (MUSES) product suite) from MODIS surface reflectance data in the red and near-infrared (NIR) bands. As far as we know, it is the first global LAI product at 250 m spatial resolution and is the highest spatial resolution global LAI product available. The spatial and temporal consistency of the MUSES LAI product was evaluated by comparing it with the MODIS LAI product, and the MUSES LAI product was validated by high-resolution reference maps at the Validation of Land European Remote Sensing Instruments (VALERI) and Implementing Multi-Scale Agricultural Indicators Exploiting Sentinels (IMAGINES) sites representative of different biomes. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the MUSES LAI product versus the LAI values derived from the high-resolution reference maps over the VALERI and IMAGINES sites was 0.9984, and the bias of the MUSES LAI product was -0.2005.

TI  - Estimating fractional coverage of crop, crop residue, and bare soil using shortwave infrared angle index and Sentinel-2 MSI
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimations of soil cover parameters (fractional coverage of crop residue [f (cr)], crop [f (c)], and bare soil [f (bs)]) in croplands can assist in decision-making for agricultural management organisations and are important for understanding the interrelations between global changes and terrestrial ecosystems. In recent decades, optical remote sensing has been widely used for mapping f (c), f (cr), and f (bs). The crop residue and soil spectra decrease rapidly with increasing cropland moisture primarily because of water absorption in the near-infrared and shortwave infrared bands. This leads to a decrease in the denominator of current normalized crop residue spectral indices (shortwave infrared [SWIR] band 1 + band 2), thereby causing them to increase with increasing cropland moisture. This study revealed that the slopes of the soil and crop residue spectra between SWIR1 and SWIR2 were less affected by cropland moisture changes. Based on this feature, we propose a shortwave infrared angle (SWIRA) index and jointly use it with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to estimate and produce multi-temporal maps of f (c), f (cr), and f (bs) using broadband Sentinel-2 MSI images. The proposed SWIRA is the slope of the spectrum between SWIR1 and SWIR2. This study (i) uses laboratory-based spectral reflectance to evaluate the performance of the SWIRA and (ii) further evaluates the performance of the SWIRA-NDVI method using multi-temporal Sentinel-2 MSI images. Our results indicate that (i) cropland moisture has a considerably smaller effect on SWIRA than it does on current broadband normalized crop residue spectral indices, and (ii) maps of the estimated f (c), f (cr), and f (bs) values can be used to improve crop growth and decision-making, for example, by providing harvest maps and soil tillage intensity maps.

TI  - Responses of estuarine circulation to the morphological evolution in a convergent, microtidal estuary
T2  - OCEAN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Huangmaohai estuary (HE) is a funnel-shaped microtidal estuary in the west of the Pearl River Delta (PRD) in southern China. Since China reformed and opened up in 1978, extensive human activities have occurred and greatly changed the estuary's topography and modified its hydrodynamics. In this study, we examined the morphological evolution by analyzing remote sensing data with ArcGIS tools and studied the responses of hydrodynamics to the changes in topography from 1977 to 2010 by using the Delft3D model. We took the changes in estuarine circulation during neap tides in dry seasons as an example. The results show that human reclamation caused a narrowing of the estuary, and channel dredging deepened the estuary. These human activities changed both the longitudinal and lateral estuarine circulations. The longitudinal circulation was observed to increase with the deepening and narrowing of the estuary. The lateral circulation experienced changes in both the magnitude and pattern. The momentum balance analysis shows that when the depth and width changed simultaneously, the longitudinal estuarine circulation was modulated by both the channel deepening and width reduction, in which the friction, pressure gradient force, and advection terms were altered. The analysis of the longitudinal vortex dynamics indicates that the changes in the vertical shear of the longitudinal flow, lateral salinity gradient, and vertical mixing were responsible for the change in the lateral circulation. The changes in water depth are the dominant factors affecting lateral circulation intensity. This study has implications for sediment transport and morphological evolution in estuaries heavily impacted by human interventions.

TI  - Deformations monitoring in complicated-surface areas by adaptive distributed Scatterer InSAR combined with land cover: Taking the Jiaju landslide in Danba, China as an example
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-temporal InSAR (MT-InSAR) technique provides a powerful tool for measuring large-scale surface displacements at high precision. However, traditional MT-InSAR approaches always employ a single global threshold to select measurement points (MPs), making it difficult to identify enough MPs in complex land cover areas (e.g., mountainous areas). In this study, to increase the number and spatial distribution density of distributed scatterer (DS) detection while maintaining its quality, we proposed a new MT-InSAR method, named Adaptive Distributed Scatterer InSAR Combined with Land Cover (ADSI-CLC). The key ideas of ADSI-CLC include the introduction of land cover maps as the constraint condition for DS adaptive selection and the employment of coherence weighted spatial adaptive filtering method to estimate optimal phase. Of these, DS adaptive selection method as the most pivotal idea realizes the unification of mathematical, physical, and geographical mechanism in the process of statistically homogeneous pixels (SHP) identification and adaptively adjusts the DS selection thresholds in different land cover areas in the process of DS selection. ADSI-CLC significantly increases the number and spatial distribution density of DS by using the adaptive selection method, and purifies the SHPs populations, and improves the efficiency of SHPs identification through introducing land cover maps. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the ADSI-CLC method, a case study of the Jiaju landslide using 19 scenes ALOS-1 PALSAR-1 L-band data (2006-2011) and 31 scenes Sentinel-1 C-band data (2014-2016) was carried out. The comparison between deformation measurements retrieved by ADSI-CLC and classical StaMPS-SBAS method showed that their distribution pattern is similar, but the ADSI-CLC method can provide more deformation details due to much higher (nearly 10 times) DS density. Quantitative comparisons between the ADSI-CLC results from ALOS-1 data and GNSS measurements also showed that the accuracy of this method is about 11.7 mm/yr in terms of root mean square error (RMSE). These results proved the reliability and effectiveness of ADSI-CLC and indicated its great potential for displacements monitoring in complicated-surface areas with large topographic fluctuations (e.g., mountainous areas).

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RESILIENCE IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Urban built-up has been increasing exponentially in the world. Urban population growth and migration are depleting the land resources and creating thermal discomfort. Cities all around the world are facing urban heat island effects and increased temperatures. This study aims to map land cover and formulate local climate zones for enhancing urban resilience against disaster and climate risks. Design/methodology/approach This study uses exploratory research to identify local climate zones for Lahore, Pakistan. Landsat 8 imagery was used to develop a land use land cover map. For mapping local climate zones, the standard World Urban and Access Portal Tool procedure was used. Findings Results have revealed that Lahore has grown exponentially. Compact low rise and open low rise were the two most common local climate zones prevalent in the city. In contrast, the outer regions of the city consisted of LCZ D (low plants) and LCZ F (bare soil). Practical implications This study highlights the need to consider local climate zones in future development plans and policies for ensuring sustainable, resilient and climate-friendly cities. Originality/value Local climate zone studies are missing in Pakistan. This study has empirically analyzed the ground situation of local climate zones for Lahore metropolitan city. This study will provide baseline support for future studies on urban heat island and climate change adaptation planning.

TI  - Comparative assessment of heatwave vulnerability factors for the districts of Budapest, Hungary
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change increases the magnitude and frequency of extreme weather events worldwide; therefore, cities are highly vulnerable areas as housing the majority of the global population. This study aims to analyze the heatwave vulnerability of the 23 districts of the Hungarian capital, Budapest, by applying a weighted indicator method. For this purpose, 12 indicators were collected, normalized, and finally categorized to reveal spatial heterogeneity through the selected administration units. Socio-economic variables and remote sensing data have also been involved in the study in order to point out as many aspects as possible. Generally, downtown districts have medium vulnerability due to their increased land surface temperature, higher population density and low yearly income per capita. In the case of both Pest-, and Buda-side outer districts, higher NDVI values pose them at the top of the ranking. At the same time, considerable differences can be found regarding other sensitivity and adaptive capacity values. The high ratio of elderly people with cardiovascular disease and the low number of pharmacies per 1000 people were identified as common weak points in the case of almost every district. The revealed weak points may contribute to defining those aspects where urgent and targeted adaptation actions are needed.

T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical storms (TSs)/Typhoons (TYs) in the Northwest Pacific (NWP) region are one of the most devastating natural hazards, which cause large-scale impacts on human life and infrastructure. In August 2020, a total of 9 tropical storms were identified by International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS) in the NWP region. These TSs/TYs made their landfall over the coastal parts of China, North Korea, and South Korea, while none of them made their landfall over Taiwan. These conditions were unique in recent years and induced drought conditions in Taiwan during 2020. We have carried out a three-dimensional analysis of oceanic, atmospheric, and meteorological parameters for the evaluation of changes associated with typhoons during August 2020. The model, satellite, and ground observations data have been used for the assessment of the impact of these TS/TYs on the ocean, atmosphere, and air quality. The rise in ocean temperature (1 C-2 C) was observed even at the depth of 100 m. Strong upwelling of the ocean water in the NWP originated a change in the mixed layer depth and also has affected the salinity in South China, East China, and the Philippines Sea. The strong convective forces during the storm conditions produced a prominent rise in CO and Ozone concentration. These typhoons also affected the air quality of Taiwan during August 2020. The transboundary air pollutants triggered the enhancement in particulate matter (PM1.0 and PM2.5) and surface ozone over Taiwan, which resulted in major health hazards to a large population.

TI  - IL-6-induced FOXO1 activity determines the dynamics of metabolism in CD8 T cells cross-primed by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells
T2  - CELL REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) are liver-resident antigen (cross)-presenting cells that generate memory CD8 T cells, but metabolic properties of LSECs and LSEC-primed CD8 T cells remain understudied. Here, we report that high-level mitochondrial respiration and constitutive low-level glycolysis support LSEC scavenger and sentinel functions. LSECs fail to increase glycolysis and co-stimulation after TLR4 activation, indicating absence of metabolic and functional maturation compared with immunogenic dendritic cells. LSEC-primed CD8 T cells show a transient burst of oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis. Mechanistically, co-stimulatory IL-6 signaling ensures high FOXO1 expression in LSEC-primed CD8 T cells, curtails metabolic activity associated with T cell activation, and is indispensable for T cell functionality after re -activation. Thus, distinct immunometabolic features characterize non-immunogenic LSECs compared with immunogenic dendritic cells and LSEC-primed CD8 T cells with memory features compared with effector CD8 T cells. This reveals local features of metabolism and function of T cells in the liver.

TI  - Developing a high-resolution land use/land cover map by upgrading CORINE's agricultural components using detailed national and pan-European datasets
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The agricultural uses of the Coordination of Information on the Environment Land Cover (CLC) dataset suffer from limitations such as temporal stationarity, low spatial resolution, broad and rather simplified grouping of classes. The study attempts to address these shortcomings, using as test site the Sperchios River catchment, Central Greece. The Greek 'branch' of the Land Parcel Identification System, Beneficiaries' Declarations (BD) and CLC inventories were utilized to develop hybrid layers, deriving from their harmonization, sequential incorporation and progressive update (BD -> BD-ilot -> BD-ilot-CLC). The final layer constitutes the new object-oriented Land Use/Land Cover map. Remote sensing data (Sentinel-2) was used to validate the accuracy of the BD, subject to the most frequent errors. The new map retains the key advantages of CLC yet is now characterized by highly detailed spatial resolution and the explicit description of the different cultivated farmlands included.

TI  - Nutrients across Time: Relationships with Climate, Hydrology, and Land Use in Four Rivers of the Pacific Northwest
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the temporal dynamics and drivers of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) provides a critical link to better management of nutrient-related impacts such as eutrophication and harmful algal blooms (HABs). DIN and DIP are a primary control on persistent eutrophication and HABs in the Pacific Northwest (PNW). An understudied phenomenon, this paper examines multi-decadal trends in DIN and DIP concentrations and loads, and their relationships to climatic and hydrologic factors (e.g., stream and air temperature, discharge, precipitation) in the PNW. Dissolved constituents act as a broad sentinel of linkages between watershed and in-stream mechanisms such as nitrification, denitrification, nutrient use efficiency, evapotranspiration, hydrologic connectivity, groundwater extraction, irrigation, and land uses. As opposed to the total N and P often used in individual, autochthonous, lentic systems, DIN and DIP are used here as measures of multiscaled processes in allochthonous lotic systems with diverse flow paths. Time-series data from public agencies were used for up to 20 years in river outlets from the Willamette, Salmon, Spokane, and Yakima watersheds. Seasonal Mann Kendall (SMK) tests suggest significant decreasing multi-decadal trends in DIN and DIP loads for three out of four watersheds (for DIN, SMK = -0.104; for DIP, SMK = -0.081, -0.181, and -0.213), significant decreasing trends in DIN concentrations for one of the four watersheds (SMK = -0.144), and significant decreasing trends in DIP concentrations in three of the four watersheds (SMK = -0.120, -0.135, and -0.157). Multivariate regressions found significant relationships for concentrations, loads, and ratios when regressed against stream and air temperatures, precipitation, and discharge (16 significant regressions, with adjusted R-2 values between 0.016 and 0.65). Highlights of these regression results are as follows: (1) precipitation, discharge, and water and air temperatures help to explain DIN and DIP concentrations and loads, (2) changes in DIN concentrations are sensitive to more hydroclimatic variables than DIP concentrations, and (3) DIP concentrations are positively correlated with stream temperature while DIP loads are negatively correlated with stream temperature. Furthermore, seasonal changes in nutrients - and their potential to alter aquatic productivity during a year - has received little attention in the literature. Regressions established significant seasonality or monthly variation of DIN and DIP concentrations and loads in all four watersheds (20 significant regressions, with adjusted R-2 values between 0.038-0.65). Nutrient thresholds of DIN (0.3-0.5 mg/L) and DIP (0.05-0.005 mg/L) concentrations were used to analyze N- and P-limitation. P-limitation is known to occur in lakes, and N-limitation is known to occur in rivers. Surprisingly, except for one watershed (Salmon), nutrient concentrations for both DIN and DIP in all watersheds were shown to be above the limitation thresholds across multiple seasons. In certain situations, such as where significant decreasing trends continue, the DIN:DIP ratio suggests seasonal switching between N- and P-limited could create ideal conditions for HABs.The findings of this study have important implications for water resource management issues such as agriculture, land use development, fish populations, timber harvests, water quality, and public health.

TI  - Drones address an observational blind spot for biological oceanography
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Marine biological communities are dynamic across many scales in both space and time. Such multi-scale complexity complicates efforts to fully characterize these communities. Critical processes unfold on the order of 0.1-10 kilometers and 0.1-10 days, but conventional oceanographic techniques generally do not observe or model at this scale. Small aerial drones conveniently achieve scales of observation between satellite resolutions and in-situ sampling, and effectively diminish the "blind spot" between these established measurement techniques. Despite this promise, drone-based techniques face challenges inherent to optical oceanography, as well as logistical and regulatory barriers relating to both aerial and marine operations. Such obstacles have slowed adoption of drones for marine biological study, but best practices are emerging alongside new techniques that facilitate robust study designs and rigorous data collection. With such advancements, drones promise to complement conventional approaches in biological oceanography to more fully capture the spatiotemporal complexity of the marine environment.

TI  - Use of the downscalling method in satellite images for the analysis of heat islands in landfills
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, the landfill is the most used method in the world for the treatment and final disposal of municipal solid waste (MSW), especially in first world countries. In Brazil, in 2017, only 36.8% of the municipalities used landfills for the final disposal of MSW, but this number is expected to increase significantly in the next decade. In this way, thermal infrared remote sensing (TIR) is a powerful tool for observation and monitoring the landfill. With the TIR, it is possible to evaluate various processes within the landfill, mainly those linked to biological processes that generate heat as a result. In this way, methods of obtaining the surface temperature of the landfill combined with methods of improving spatial data resolution show great potential for analyzing these data. Thus, this work uses the TIR applied to the study of environmental sanitation problems in the landfill in the city of Sa similar to o Leopoldo, state of Rio Grande do Sul - Brazil. The aim of this work is study the heat islands landfill using LANDSAT-8/SENTINEL-2 thermal images and consolidated downscaling methods to increase the spatial resolution of the temperature image. The results showed an increase of up to 300% in the spatial resolution of the data, allowing better qualitative discrimination of the targets, and thus identification of heat islands without increasing the root mean square error (RMSE) in temperature. In addition, the error associated with the temperature for the resampled data was less than or equal to the error associated with the original data.

TI  - Identifying the main drivers of the seasonal decline of near-infrared reflectance of a temperate deciduous forest
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The physical mechanisms behind correlations of earth observations and remote sensing products are of vital importance. The so-called 'near-infrared reflectance of vegetation' (NIRV) and gross primary production (GPP) show high correlations among different ecosystems and temporal scales but the underlying relationship is still poorly understood. NIRV is defined as the product of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and nearinfrared (NIR) canopy reflectance (RNIR). We examined this relationship in the case of a temperate deciduous forest in Germany. GPP, RNIR and NIRV all exhibited a strong rise during leaf development in spring and a continual decline after the maximum in early summer. The decline of NIRV in late summer was mainly driven by the decline of RNIR, since NDVI remained saturated.Here we tested the RNIR decline attributions to changes in leaf area index, leaf optical properties, canopy structure, sun-sensor geometry, or understory vegetation by measuring seasonal variations of those factors of the temperate deciduous forest. Leaf area was nearly constant between May and mid September, leaf albedo decreased slightly, leaf angles increased over time towards more vertical leaves, and understory reflectance decreased considerably.We simulated the seasonal RNIR decline of the forest using the radiative transfer model FRT and quantified the sensitivity of the decline to variations in the measured parameters. FRT captured well the observed seasonal RNIR decline by Sentinel 2 using the measured optical and structural properties. Decreasing understory reflectance alone explained 43% of the simulated RNIR decrease, while leaf angle variations explained 31%, the solar zenith angle (SZA) 21%, leaf albedo 7%, and LAI 0%. The effect size of the SZA depended on the viewing angle and would hence be different for different satellites and for local instruments. The results may help to better understand and help to track seasonal changes in forest structure and leaf optical properties using remote sensing techniques. They also suggest that the proposed link between the seasonal evolution of GPP and NIRV may be weaker than expected.

TI  - Performance comparison of Fengyun-4A and Himawari-8 in PM<sub>2.5</sub> estimation in China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The increase in the PM2.5 concentration has become the focus of public concern due to the health risks it poses. In contrast to the sparsely distributed ground stations, geostationary satellites can provide a unique method of frequently monitoring national-scale PM2.5 concentrations. The Himawari-8 and Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) satellites have both been used to monitor PM2.5 concentrations due to their high spatial (5 km and 4 km, respectively) and temporal resolutions (hourly), but it is still not clear which satellite is more suitable for such studies. In this study, the hourly PM(2.5)concentrations were estimated based on a deep belief network using top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance data and other auxiliary variables from April 2018 to March 2019. To comprehensively and effectively verify the accuracy of the results, three cross-validation methods were applied. The evaluation indexes of FY-4A were slightly higher than those of Himawari-8. The distributions of their estimated PM2.5 concentration mappings were consistent in terms of the overall trend, but they exhibit regional inconsistencies. In-depth analysis of the results revealed that the main reasons for these inconsistencies are the differences in the spatial resolution, training data, satellite platforms, and retrieval algorithms. Through comparative analysis, the effects of the satellite platforms and retrieval algorithms were determined to be negligible. In general, the FY-4A satellite was found to be more adaptable to PM2.5 concentration estimation in China due to its wide coverage and high estimation accuracy.

TI  - Satellites Detect Abatable Super-Emissions in One of the World's Largest Methane Hotspot Regions
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Reduction of fossil fuel-related methane emissions has been identified as an essential means for climate change mitigation, but emission source identification remains elusive for most oil and gas production basins in the world. We combine three complementary satellite data sets to survey single methane emission sources on the west coast of Turkmenistan, one of the largest methane hotspots in the world. We found 29 different emitters, with emission rates >1800 kg/h, active in the 2017-2020 time period, although older satellite data show that this type of emission has been occurring for decades. We find that all sources are linked to extraction fields mainly dedicated to crude oil production, where 24 of them are inactive flares venting gas. The analysis of time series suggests a causal relationship between the decrease in flaring and the increase in venting. At the regional level, 2020 shows a substantial increase in the number of methane plume detections concerning previous years. Our results suggest that these large venting point sources represent a key mitigation opportunity as they emanate from human-controlled facilities, and that new satellite methods promise a revolution in the detection and monitoring of methane point emissions worldwide.

TI  - Hierarchical sparse Cholesky decomposition with applications to high-dimensional spatio-temporal filtering
T2  - STATISTICS AND COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial statistics often involves Cholesky decomposition of covariance matrices. To ensure scalability to high dimensions, several recent approximations have assumed a sparse Cholesky factor of the precision matrix. We propose a hierarchical Vecchia approximation, whose conditional-independence assumptions imply sparsity in the Cholesky factors of both the precision and the covariance matrix. This remarkable property is crucial for applications to high-dimensional spatiotemporal filtering. We present a fast and simple algorithm to compute our hierarchical Vecchia approximation, and we provide extensions to nonlinear data assimilation with non-Gaussian data based on the Laplace approximation. In several numerical comparisons, including a filtering analysis of satellite data, our methods strongly outperformed alternative approaches.

TI  - A machine learning approach for identifying and delineating agricultural fields and their multi-temporal dynamics using three decades of Landsat data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High spatial and temporal resolution satellite imagery are essential data for land cover discrimination and mapping of vegetation dynamics, offering insights into the number, extent, and condition of agricultural fields. However, an accurate account of the number, location, and variability of fields can be challenging to obtain in a timely manner, particularly at scale or in regions where ground-supporting data are not available, limiting the capacity for food production and water use assessment and planning. To bridge this capacity gap, a convolutional neural network approach was adopted and combined with two clustering techniques: the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) and spectral clustering, to provide an account of agricultural fields and their extent across a region lacking ground based information. A random forest classification was also employed to discriminate crop types. Using an annual maximum normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from 2018 Landsat-8 data, the approach was applied to classify the shape and delineate the extent of agricultural fields across an agricultural region in Saudi Arabia that had an area under irrigation exceeding 2,300 km(2). When assessed against manually identified center-pivot fields (CPFs), the method achieved 97.4% producer's and 98.0% user's accuracies on an object basis, and 81.4% producer's and 85.4% user's accuracies on a pixel basis for identifying non-CPFs (i.e., tree crop plantations and other non-woody crops). The over-and under-segmentation error for CPFs was 1.5% and 1.0%, respectively, with intersection over union errors reported as being 3.5%. The framework showed stability when retrospectively applied to Landsat data from the year 2000, returning 97.5% producer's and 96.6% user's accuracies for CPF identification. In order to characterize the temporal dynamics of agricultural development over the past three decades, an analysis of field behavior between 1988 and 2020 was subsequently undertaken. The analysis indicated that the number of CPFs in the study region increased from 45 (covering 20 km(2)) in 1988 to 5,080 CPFs by 2016 (covering 2,368 km(2)), followed by a recent reduction to 3,700 CPFs in 2020 (covering 1,581 km(2)). Through the multi-temporal analysis, individual fields were able to be characterized in terms of their expansion, contraction and activity throughout the study period. Overall, the proposed method was simple to train, efficient in dealing with large datasets, relied on limited in-situ records to a very small degree, and has the potential to be applied to larger national scales, providing an ongoing assessment of important agroinformatic metrics.

TI  - Data-Driven Machine Learning in Environmental Pollution: Gains and Problems
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The complexity and dynamics of the environment make it extremely difficult to directly predict and trace the temporal and spatial changes in pollution. In the past decade, the unprecedented accumulation of data, the development of high-performance computing power, and the rise of diverse machine learning (ML) methods provide new opportunities for environmental pollution research. The ML methodology has been used in satellite data processing to obtain ground-level concentrations of atmospheric pollutants, pollution source apportionment, and spatial distribution modeling of water pollutants. However, unlike the active practices of ML in chemical toxicity prediction, advanced algorithms such as deep neural networks in environmental process studies of pollutants are still deficient. In addition, over 40% of the environmental applications of ML go to air pollution, and its application range and acceptance in other aspects of environmental science remain to be increased. The use of ML methods to revolutionize environmental science and its problem-solving scenarios has its own challenges. Several issues should be taken into consideration, such as the tradeoff between model performance and interpretability, prerequisites of the machine learning model, model selection, and data sharing.

TI  - Role of sentinel lymph node in endometrial cancer: rationale and surgical aspects, a review of the literature
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF GYNAECOLOGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Endometrial carcinoma is the most common gynecological cancer in Europe, with 130,000 new cases per year, and the incidence has been rising with aging and increased obesity of the population. Most women with endometrial cancer will present with early-stage disease, with a tumor confined to the uterus and without metastasis, and the first approach is surgery. Approximately 10% to 15% of these patients have a metastatic nodal disease, which is why guidelines have always emphasized the importance of lymphadenectomy to stratify the risk and tailor adjuvant treatment. However, comprehensive lymphadenectomy is related to significant morbidity and seems not to improve either progression-free or overall survival in these patients. Lymphatic mapping with sentinel lymph node biopsy has emerged as an alternative and an optimal compromise instead of systematic lymphadenectomy. This review presents the current evidence supporting sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with endometrial cancer.

TI  - Identifying microclimate tree seedling refugia in post-wildfire landscapes
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - High-severity wildfire in arid regions has caused ecological state change, transforming previously forested areas into shrublands. This dramatically alters the microclimatic conditions, which can exceed the climatic tolerance of tree seedlings, rendering the likelihood of returning post-wildlife landscapes to their previous state relatively low. Characterizing microclimatic variability across severely burned landscapes could allow for identifying locations where seedling survival is more likely. We used a combination of small unmanned aircraft system imagery, satellite data and in-situ microclimate data recordings, together with a machine learning approach, to model monthly near-ground minimum, mean and max temperature as well as relative humidity and vapor pressure deficit in a previously forested area, which is now dominated by two different shrub species. Spatially explicit models predicted recorded microclimate well (r = 0.73 to 0.97), and model projections highlight that at any given location in the hottest month, the solar buffering capacity of existing vegetation can alter the maximum temperature by -12 degrees C, increase relative humidity by -20% and reduced vapor pressure deficit by 0.3mbar relative to open areas. By harnessing these microclimate refugia, the success rate of reforestation efforts in post-wildfire landscapes could be substantially increased and mitigate seedlings from climate warming at local scales.

TI  - Land use/land cover dynamics study and prediction in jaipur city using CA markov model integrated with road network
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Land Use Land Cover (LULC) dynamics analysis is critical and should be done regularly. It draws attention to LULC developments that can be addressed before they become unmanageable disasters or circumstances. For the years 2000, 2010, and 2020, LULC change analysis was carried out in Jaipur City, Rajasthan, India. The LULC maps were created using Landsat data through a visual interpretation technique at a scale of 1:50,000. These maps were classified into vegetation, agriculture, built-up areas, barren land, and water bodies. LULC was predicted by extrapolating the current LULC change pattern. Using a Cellular Automata-Markov Chain Model (CA Markov) integrated with road network, the current LULC change trend was extrapolated and utilized to estimate the LULC map for the years 2020, 2030, 2040, and 2050. The strategy was validated by estimating LULC change for 2020 and comparing it to the actual LULC map for that year. The urban area contributed to 4. 75% in 2000 of the total area in Jaipur city. The percentage of area under urban class has increased to 9.68% in 2010 and 12.96% in 2020. The prediction based on 2000-2010 and 2010-2020 has shown an unprecedented decadal growth in the built-up area till 2050. The prediction based on the 2000-2010 period has shown a rise of 92.04% during 2020-2030, 77.13% during 2030-2040 and, 64.34% during 2040-2050. The prediction based on the 2010-2020 period has shown a rise of 102.42% during 2020-2030, 73.56% during 2030-2040 and, 54.47% during 2040-2050. This study is, therefore, calls for policy interventions to manage population and urban growth.

TI  - Biogeographic variability in wildfire severity and post-fire vegetation recovery across the European forests via remote sensing-derived spectral metrics
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires have large-scale and profound effects on forest ecosystems, and they force burned forest areas toward a wide range of post-fire successional trajectories from simple reduction of ecosystem functions to transitions to other stable non-forest states. Fire disturbances represent a key driver of changes in forest structure and composition due to post -fire succession processes, thus contributing to modify ecosystem resilience to subsequent disturbances. Here, we aimed to provide useful insights into wildfire severity and post-fire recovery processes at the European continental scale, con-tributing to improved description and interpretation of large-scale wildfire spatial patterns and their effects on forest ecosystems in the context of climate change. We analyzed fire severity and short-term post-fire vegetation recovery patterns across the European forests between 2004 and 2015 using Corine Land Cover Forest classes and bioregions, based on MODIS-derived spectral metrics of the relativized burn ratio (RBR), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and relative recovery indicator (RRI). The RBR-based fire severity showed geographic differences and interannual variability in the Boreal bioregion com-pared to that in other biogeographic regions. The NBR-based RRI showed a slower post-fire vegetation recovery rate with respect to the NDVI, highlighting the differential sensitivities of the analyzed remote sensing-spectral metrics. Moreover, the RRI showed a significant decreasing trend during the observation period, suggesting a growing lag in post-fire vegetation recovery across European forests.

TI  - Managing mangroves and coastal land cover in the Mekong Delta
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves play an important role in sustaining a healthy coastal environment, providing a natural habitat to various species, a stable shoreline and forestry products. However, the extent of mangroves developed along the tidal coast of the Mekong delta in southern Vietnam has faced and still faces the impact from both natural and anthropogenic drivers. Since the area of mangroves in the coastal Mekong delta is not well documented, this study aims to quantitatively document the evolution of the mangrove area over the past 48 years, i.e. between 1973 and 2020. Satellite Landsat images, along with a classification method comprising Iso Cluster and Maximum Likelihood algorithms, have been used for mapping land cover types including mangroves, aquaculture, soils, plants and water surfaces along the coastal districts of the Mekong delta. The study shows that remote sensing and GIS techniques can be applied to obtain mapping of the land cover, as well as detect and analyse spatial and temporal changes caused by e.g. coastal erosion or aquaculture expansion. The findings reveal that the total mangrove area of an estimated 185,800 ha in 1973 decreased significantly to 102,160 ha in 2020. Approximately 2150 ha/yr of the total mangrove loss over 1973-2020 was due to invasion by aquaculture, while roughly 430 ha/yr was lost due to coastal erosion. A slight increase in mangrove area occurred since 2010 as a result of the implementation of a series of projects to protect against coastal erosion and to restore mangroves by the Vietnamese government and international non-governmental and governmental organizations, although the success rates of mangrove restoration are relatively low. The survival of mangrove forests in the Mekong delta is related to the main pressure drivers: pollution, land use conversion, insufficient sediment sources, coastal erosion and coastal mangrove squeeze. Therefore, an integrated mangroves and shrimp farming model is one of the most appropriate approaches to achieve a beneficial balance between both aquaculture and mangroves.

TI  - Utility of Cerebral Embolic Protection in Non-TAVR Transcatheter Procedures
T2  - CARDIOVASCULAR REVASCULARIZATION MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Cerebrovascular events that occur during structural and interventional procedures are a well known risk which is associated with increased mortality. The FDA has approved the use of the Sentinel device in TAVR. Hereby we report on our experience on the safety and efficacy of using Sentinel in a patient population undergoing non-TAVR transcatheter procedures.Methods: Retrospective analysis of a single center experience with using the Sentinel device for non-TAVR trans catheter procedures.Results: We identified 33 patients (average age was 73.8 years, 36.7% females, and 30% with history of a prior stroke) felt to be at high risk for cerebroembolic events that underwent Sentinel device placement. Sentinel placement was successful in all patients. Examples of high risk features included high atheroma burden in the aortic arch, left sided valve vegetations, intra-cardiac thrombi and severe left sided valve calcifications/thrombi. No patients developed periprocedural stroke or vascular complications.Conclusion: Overall, the use of Sentinel for non-TAVR indications appears feasible and safe. The use of cerebral protection devices should be studied further in non-TAVR patients to establish its role and its benefits, especially with expanding the number of non-TAVR transcatheter interventions.

TI  - Mainstreaming remotely sensed ecosystem functioning in ecological niche models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Review
AB  - Biodiversity is declining globally at unprecedented rates. Ecological niche models (ENMs) are one of the most widely used toolsets to appraise global change impacts on biodiversity. Here, we identify a variety of advantages of incorporating remotely sensed ecosystem functioning attributes (EFAs) into ENMs. The development of ENMs that explicitly incorporate ecosystem functioning will allow a more holistic and integrative perspective of the habitat dynamics. The synergies between the increasingly available open-access satellite images and cloud-based platforms for planetary-scale geospatial analysis offer an unprecedented opportunity to incorporate ecosystem processes and disturbances (such as fires, insect outbreaks or droughts) that have been so far largely neglected in ecological niche characterization and modelling. The most paradigmatic example of EFAs is the application of time series of spectral vegetation indices related to primary productivity and carbon cycle. EFAs related to surface energy balance and water cycles derived from remote sensing products such as land surface temperature or soil moisture enable a fine-scale characterization of the species' niche-eventually improving the predictive performance of ENMs. All these advantages confirm that a new generation of ENMs based on such EFAs would offer great perspectives to increase our ability to monitor habitat suitability trends and population dynamics. However, despite the technical advances and increasing effort of remote sensing community to develop integrative EFAs, ENMs have yet to make full profit of the most recent developments by integrating them in ENMs. A coordinated agenda for remote sensing experts and ecological modellers will be essential over the coming years to bridge the gap between remote sensing and ecology disciplines and to take full (and timely) advantage of the fast-growing body of Earth observation data and remote sensing technologies-with special emphasis on the development and testing of new variables related to key processes driving ecosystem functioning.

TI  - Monitoring surface water dynamics in the Prairie Pothole Region of North Dakota using dual-polarised Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) time series
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The North American Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) represents a large system of wetlands with great importance for biodiversity, water storage and flood management. Knowledge of seasonal and inter-annual surface water dynamics in the PPR is important for understanding the functionality of these wetland ecosystems and the changing degree of hydrologic connectivity between them. Optical sensors that are widely used for retrieving such information are often limited by their temporal resolution and cloud cover, especially in the case of flood events. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors can potentially overcome such limitations. However, water extent retrieval from SAR data is often impacted by environmental factors, such as wind on water surfaces. Hence, robust retrieval methods are required to reliably monitor water extent over longer time periods . The aim of this study was to develop a robust approach for classifying open water extent in the PPR and to analyse the obtained time series covering the entire available Sentinel-1 observation period from 2015 to 2020 in the hydrometeorological context. Open water in prairie potholes was classified by fusing dual-polarised Sentinel-1 data and high-resolution topographical information using a Bayesian framework. The approach was tested for a study area in North Dakota. The resulting surface water maps were validated using high-resolution airborne optical imagery. For the observation period, the total water area, the number of waterbodies and the median area per waterbody were computed. The validation of the retrieved water maps yielded producer's accuracies between 84 % and 95 % for calm days and between 74 % and 88 % for windy days. User's accuracies were above 98 % in all cases, indicating a very low occurrence of false positives due to the constraints introduced by topographical information.The observed dynamics of total water area displayed both intra-annual and inter-annual patterns. In addition to differences in seasonality between small (<1 ha) and large (>1 ha) waterbodies due to the effect of evaporation during summer, these size classes also responded differently to an extremely wet period from 2019 to 2020 in terms of the increase in the number of waterbodies and the total area covered. The results demonstrate the potential of Sentinel-1 data for high-resolution monitoring of prairie wetlands. Limitations of this method are related to wind inhibiting the correct water extent retrieval and to the rather long acquisition interval of 12 d over the PPR, which is a result of the observation strategy of Sentinel-1.

TI  - Greater temperature sensitivity of vegetation greenup onset date in areas with weaker temperature seasonality across the Northern Hemisphere
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The temperature sensitivity (ST) of the vegetation greenup onset date (VGD) is critical for the assessment and prediction of phenological response to climate warming. Spatial variations in ST, though well documented based on satellite observations in recent studies, have remained largely under-explained. We determined VGD from satellite observation of the normalized difference vegetation index over the period 2000-2018 and showed that ST is substantially smaller in areas with stronger temperature seasonality (i.e. the multiyear mean of standard deviations of monthly mean temperature over a 12-month period). Spatially, ST averaged over each 2 degrees C bin of temperature seasonality increased from about 10.0 days K-1 in areas with temperature seasonality of about 3.5 degrees C to about 3.3 to 2.3 days K-1 in areas with temperature seasonality between 15.0 and 22.3 degrees C. Statistical analyses suggest that this pattern was not related with spatial variations in the length of chilling exposure, spring frost risk, inter-annual variability of spring temperature, or photoperiod. Rather, it may occur because areas with stronger temperature seasonality have stronger pre-VGD constraints because of a lower temperature and a faster temperature increase from the onset of greenup to summer, which could result in faster leaf development rates and thus higher speeds of completion of leaf development. Our results also show that the greater ST associated with higher mean annual temperature and multiyear mean VGD across the northern middle and high latitudes observed in previous studies is probably caused by temperature seasonality. This study deepens our understanding of the spatial variation in the temperature sensitivity of vegetation spring leafing phenology in the Northern Hemisphere.

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF GYNAECOLOGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To investigate the characteristics and distribution patterns of clinically metastatic nodes assessed by Computed Tomography (CT) in preoperative cervical cancer patients; to address the importance of obturator and/or inguinal lymph nodes as sentinel lymph nodes. Methods: A total of 217 patients with cervical carcinoma treated by lymph node dissection (LND) between 2009 and 2014 were included. All preoperative CT/MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) imaging data of these patients were reviewed. The relationship of patient characteristics age, tumor stages, and corresponding lymph node metastasis status were analyzed. We put emphasis on the distribution pattern of positive lymph nodes from pre-operative imaging and compared the different frequencies of each regional and non-regional lymph node group respectively. The data of the 5-year survival rate from follow-up was taken into consideration too. SPSS 24.0 (IBM Corp., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical analysis. Results: The overall lymph node metastasis (LNM) rate was 92.6% in 217 cases. When regional nodes were involved, obturator groups were concerned in 154 (76.6%). The inguinal group was involved in 146 (72.6%) in the area of non-regional lymph node. The 5-year survival rates of return visits were 92.6% and 82.1% in stage IB and IIA, respectively. Age distribution was not associated with the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage as well as the incidence and patterns of nodal metastasis. Conclusions: obturator and inguinal groups play a decisive role in the metastases process of cervical cancer, and can be regarded as a candidate for sentinel lymph nodes.

TI  - Daily Spatial Complete Soil Moisture Mapping Over Southeast China Using CYGNSS and MODIS Data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN BIG DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Daily spatial complete soil moisture (SM) mapping is important for climatic, hydrological, and agricultural applications. The Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) is the first constellation that utilizes the L band signal transmitted by the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) satellites to measure SM. Since the CYGNSS points are discontinuously distributed with a relativity low density, limiting it to map continuous SM distributions with high accuracy. The Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) product (i.e., vegetation index [VI] and land surface temperature [LST]) provides more surface SM information than other optical remote sensing data with a relatively high spatial resolution. This study proposes a point-surface fusion method to fuse the CYGNSS and MODIS data for daily spatial complete SM retrieval. First, for CYGNSS data, the surface reflectivity (SR) is proposed as a proxy to evaluate its ability to estimate daily SM. Second, the LST output from the China Meteorological Administration Land Data Assimilation System (CLDAS, 0.0625 degrees x 0.0625 degrees) and MODIS LST (1 x 1 km) are fused to generate spatial complete and temporally continuous LST maps. An Enhanced Normalized Vegetation Supply Water Index (E-NVSWI) model is proposed to estimate SM derived from MODIS data at high spatial resolution. Finally, the final SM estimation model is constructed from the back-propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN) fusing the CYGNSS point, E-NWSVI data, and ancillary data, and applied to get the daily continuous SM result over southeast China. The results show that the estimation SM are comparable and promising (R = 0.723, root mean squared error [RMSE] = 0.062 m(3) m(-3), and MAE = 0.040 m(3) m(-3) vs. in situ, R = 0.714, RMSE = 0.057 m(3) m(-3), and MAE = 0.039 m(3) m(-3) vs. CLDAS). The proposed algorithm contributes from two aspects: (1) validates the CYGNSS derived SM by taking advantage of the dense in situ networks over Southeast China; (2) provides a point-surface fusion model to combine the usage of CYGNSS and MODIS to generate the temporal and spatial complete SM. The proposed approach reveals significant potential to map daily spatial complete SM using CYGNSS and MODIS data at a regional scale.

TI  - Identifying the paths and contributions of climate impacts on the variation in land surface albedo over the Arctic
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding historical changes in land surface albedo (ALB) is critical for projecting future climate changes over the Arctic. Previous studies have reported the important role of snow cover and vegetation growth in regulating Arctic land ALB, but their main influencing paths and separate contributions remain underexamined. In this study, the partial least squares path model (PLS-PM) and random forest model (RFM) are adopted to explore the dominant paths of three climate variables-temperature (Tem), precipitation (Pre) and wet days (WD)-in influencing the interannual variations in ALB (IVA) by regulating vegetation and snow cover. The results show that ALB in October and December exhibit significant (p < 0.05) upward and downward trends, respectively. ALB in the Northwest Territories, Victoria Island and Nunavut of the Arctic significantly (p < 0.05) increase in summer and October. The summer snow cover fraction (SCF) shows a significant positive correlation with ALB (R: 0.60.0.78), while significant negative (R = -0.60) and positive (R = 0.50) relations are found between the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and ALB during July and September, respectively. According to PLS PM, the dominant paths that affect the IVA exhibit a prominent seasonal feature. Pre -> EVI -> ALB and Tem -> SCF -> ALB are identified as the main paths for ALB changes during spring, while in summer, the only significant path is Tem -> SCF -> ALB. In autumn, nonsignificant impacts on the variations in EVI and SCF (p > 0.05) are observed, while a significant path WD -> SCF -> ALB is found in winter. Based on RFM, the relative contribution (RC) of vegetation change to March IVA can reach 52.1 +/- 9.2%, while snow variations play a dominant role in April and May, with contributions of 57.8 +/- 8.4% and 68.4 +/- 4.1%, respectively. Seasonally, summer IVA is mainly impacted by snow (RC from 50.5 +/- 4.5% to 65.9 +/- 4.5%), while vegetation exerts the dominant influence on IVA in autumn except for September. In winter, however, the dominant strength of vegetation is weakened except in December, with IVA mainly controlled by snow (RC above 50%).

TI  - A global seamless 1 km resolution daily land surface temperature dataset (2003-2020)
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is one of the most important and widely used parameters for studying land surface processes. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST products (e.g., MOD11A1 and MYD11A1) can provide this information with moderate spatiotemporal resolution with global coverage. However, the applications of these data are hampered because of missing values caused by factors such as cloud contamination, indicating the necessity to produce a seamless global MODIS-like LST dataset, which is still not available. In this study, we used a spatiotemporal gap-filling framework to generate a seamless global 1 km daily (mid-daytime and mid-nighttime) MODIS-like LST dataset from 2003 to 2020 based on standard MODIS LST products. The method includes two steps: (1) data pre-processing and (2) spatiotemporal fitting. In the data pre-processing, we filtered pixels with low data quality and filled gaps using the observed LST at another three time points of the same day. In the spatiotemporal fitting, first we fitted the temporal trend (overall mean) of observations based on the day of year (independent variable) in each pixel using the smoothing spline function. Then we spatiotemporally interpolated residuals between observations and overall mean values for each day. Finally, we estimated missing values of LST by adding the overall mean and interpolated residuals. The results show that the missing values in the original MODIS LST were effectively and efficiently filled with reduced computational cost, and there is no obvious block effect caused by large areas of missing values, especially near the boundary of tiles, which might exist in other seamless LST datasets. The cross-validation with different missing rates at the global scale indicates that the gap-filled LST data have high accuracies with the average root mean squared error (RMSE) of 1.88 and 1.33 circle, respectively, for mid-daytime (13:30) and mid-nighttime (01:30). The seamless global daily (mid-daytime and mid-nighttime) LST dataset at a 1 km spatial resolution is of great use in global studies of urban systems, climate research and modeling, and terrestrial ecosystem studies. The data are available at Iowa State University's DataShare at (T. Zhang et al., 2021).

TI  - Current Slip and Strain Rate Distribution Along the Ganzi-Yushu-Xianshuihe Fault System Based on InSAR and GPS Observations
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ganzi-Yushu-Xianshuihe fault (GYXSF), a large strike-slip fault located on the east side of the Tibetan Plateau, has seen high seismic activity in recent years. However, despite the earthquake risk posed by this fault, there is a lack of high-resolution geodetic survey results regarding the current slip rate. We have used 4-track ascending and 5-track descending Sentinel-A/B SAR Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data from 2014 to 2020, to obtain the current slip rate of the entire GYXSF within the radar's line of sight (LOS), with high resolution. Both InSAR and published Global Positioning System (GPS) data were integrated to calculate a high-resolution three-dimensional deformation field and strain rate field of the GYXSF. We have also used the screw dislocation model to calculate current slip rates in the fault-parallel direction at 20 km intervals. The key findings of our study are as follows. (1) The current slip rate of the GYXSF is segmental: the slip rate of the Ganzi-Yushu fault (GYF) gradually increases from similar to 1 to similar to 6 mm/yr from the north-west to the southeast, while the slip rate of the Xianshuihe fault (XSF) increases from similar to 8.5 to similar to 12 mm/yr from the north-west to the southeast. (2) There are non-negligible post-earthquake deformations along the GYXSF, and our best fitting results show that an approximately 100 km long section of the GYF has undergone post-seismic after-slip in the 4-10 years since the 2010 Yushu M 6.9 earthquake, with a maximum creep of similar to 2.2 mm/yr (3) The strain rate is dispersed in the GYF region but concentrated on the fault in the XSF region. There is also a measurable strain rate on secondary faults north of the GYXSF, implying the seismic hazard of these secondary faults cannot be ignored. (4) The continuous deformation and block-like models are the best models to explain the observations and deformation characteristics of the GYF and XSF, respectively.

TI  - Remote sensing image cloud removal by deep image prior with a multitemporal constraint
T2  - OPTICS CONTINUUM
M3  - Article
AB  - The existence of clouds largely goes against the monitoring of Earth from remote sensing satellites, and how to remove these clouds is of vital importance. To address the issue, we propose a generative method with two main aspects: 1) we introduce deep image prior as the generator to reconstruct the missing information covered by clouds; 2) to ensure the spatial information of reconstruction results, we attempt to make use of optical images from other periods as the constraint. The paper presents both simulation and real data experiments conducted with Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms the traditional cloud removal methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluation results.

TI  - Sensitivities of simulated global aerosol optical depth and aerosol-radiation interactions to different horizontal resolutions in CAS-FGOALS-f3
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The variations of horizontal grid spacing in aerosol climate models lead to discrepancies in simulated aerosol optical properties and radiation effects. To quantitatively investigate the effects of model horizontal resolution on global atmospheric aerosol simulation, the aerosol optical depths (AODs) and aerosol-radiation interactions (ARIs) for 10 years (2005-2014) are simulated by the Chinese Academy of Sciences Flexible Global Ocean Atmosphere Land System (CAS-FGOALS-f3) with a high resolution (HRM,-25 km) and a low resolution (LRM,-100 km). The experiments are performed with the same model parameterizations except the time step in HRM and LRM to maintain the stability of the dynamical core. The results show that the AODs simulated in HRM are more comparable to the multi-satellites and ground-based retrievals than those in LRM. Upon investigating the aerosol components, the differences in the carbonaceous and sulfate AODs between the HRM and LRM are more than 30%. The resolution sensitivities of hygroscopic aerosol simulations are mainly attributed to the simulated relative humidity (RH) and aerosol wet scavenging. The aerosol transports by wind fields alter the distributions of aerosol. The more reasonable simulations of the meteorological fields in the CAS-FGOALS-f3 with high resolution are favorable for aerosol simulations. The HRM-simulated ARI (-2.35 W m(-2)) is generally lower than the LRM-simulated one (-3.40 W m(-2)) at top of the atmosphere, and the relative difference is about 30%, which is similar to the relative difference of AOD.

TI  - Untangling irrigation effects on maize water and heat stress alleviation using satellite data
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Irrigation has important implications for sustaining global food production by enabling crop water demand to be met even under dry conditions. Added water also cools crop plants through transpiration; irrigation might thus play an important role in a warmer climate by simultaneously moderating water and high temperature stresses. Here we used satellite-derived evapotranspiration estimates, land surface temperature (LST) measurements, and crop phenological stage information from Nebraska maize to quantify how irrigation relieves both water and temperature stresses. Unlike air temperature metrics, satellite-derived LST revealed a significant irrigation-induced cooling effect, especially during the grain filling period (GFP) of crop growth. This cooling appeared to extend the maize growing season, especially for GFP, likely due to the stronger temperature sensitivity of phenological development during this stage. Our analysis also revealed that irrigation not only reduced water and temperature stress but also weakened the response of yield to these stresses. Specifically, temperature stress was significantly weakened for reproductive processes in irrigated maize. Attribution analysis further suggested that water and high temperature stress alleviation was responsible for 65 +/- 10 % and 35 +/- 5.3 % of the irrigation yield benefit, respectively. Our study underlines the relative importance of high temperature stress alleviation in yield improvement and the necessity of simulating crop surface temperature to better quantify heat stress effects in crop yield models. Finally, considering the potentially strong interaction between water and heat stress, future research on irrigation benefits should explore the interaction effects between heat and drought alleviation.

TI  - Assessment of OLCI-A and OLCI-B radiometric data products across European seas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ocean and Land Color Instruments (OLCI) operated onboard the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellites are providing globally distributed Ocean Color Radiometry (OCR) data products of relevance for environmental and climate applications. This work summarizes results on the assessment of fundamental OCR data from the Operational Baseline 3 Collection OL_L2M.003.01 of OLCI-A and OLCI-B onboard Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B, respectively. Evaluated products are the satellite derived normalized water-leaving radiance L-WN(lambda), aerosol optical depth at 865 nm tau(a)(865) and angstrom ngstrom exponent alpha determined in the near-infrared spectral region. The analyses were performed relying on in situ reference data from the Ocean Color component of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET-OC) from sites representative of diverse water types. The comparison of OLCI-A and OLCI-B with AERONET-OC L-WN(lambda) for oligotrophic/mesotrophic waters shows cross-mission consistent spectral median percent differences (i.e., biases) varying within +/- 6% at the blue-green center-wavelengths. The analysis of data from regions characterized by optically complex waters, however, displays systematic negative biases for both OLCI-A and OLCI-B further increasing for waters dominated by chromophoric dissolved organic matter, thus suggesting a dependence of the atmospheric correction on water type. The direct inter-comparison of OLCI-B and OLCI-A L-WN(lambda) from the Tandem Phase characterized by Sentinel-3B and Sentinel-3A flying 30 s apart on the same orbit, shows spectral median percent differences lower than +/- 1% in the 412-560 nm interval, of approximately +5% at 620 and 665 nm, and-7% at 400 nm. However, outside the Tandem Phase, the inter-comparison of OLCI-B and OLCI-A data products indicates large and systematic differences explained by a notable dependence on the viewing angle. The evaluation of tau(a)(865) and alpha across different geographic regions exhibits overestimated values between +48 and + 79% for the former and underestimated values between-28% and -41% for the latter. A complementary evaluation of OCR data products from the Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (VIIRS-S), proposed as a further in-direct term of reference for OLCI-A and OLCI-B data, shows large underestimates of L-WN(lambda) with respect to the in situ reference data in the various water types at 410 nm. Nevertheless, opposite to OLCI-A and OLCI-B data products, absolute differences between VIIRS-S and in situ reference data do not reveal any large or systematic dependence on water type and satellite viewing angle. Overall results suggest the need for further developing the OLCI-A and OLCI-B atmospheric correction, possibly improving the capability to identify aerosol types and to model scattering processes.

TI  - Early season prediction of within-field crop yield variability by assimilating CubeSat data into a crop model
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate early season predictions of crop yield at the within-field scale can be used to address a range of crop production, management, and precision agricultural challenges. While the remote sensing of within-field insights has been a research goal for many years, it is only recently that observations with the required spatio-temporal resolutions, together with efficient assimilation methods to integrate these into modeling frameworks, have become available to advance yield prediction efforts. Here we explore a yield prediction approach that combines daily high-resolution CubeSat imagery with the APSIM crop model. The approach employs APSIM to train a linear regression that relates simulated yield to simulated leaf area index (LAI). That relationship is then used to identify the optimal regression date at which the LAI provides the best prediction of yield: in this case, approximately 14 weeks prior to harvest. Instead of applying the regression on satellite imagery that is coincident, or closest to, the regression date, our method implements a particle filter that integrates CubeSat-based LAI into APSIM to provide end-of-season high-resolution (3 m) yield maps weeks before the optimal regression date. The approach is demonstrated on a rainfed maize field located in Nebraska, USA, where suitable collections of both imagery and in-situ data were available for assessment. The procedure does not require in-field data to calibrate the regression model, with results showing that even with a single assimilation step, it is possible to provide yield estimates with good accuracy up to 21 days before the optimal regression date. Yield spatial variability was reproduced reasonably well, with a strong correlation to independently collected measurements (R2 = 0.73 and rRMSE = 12%). When the field averaged yield was compared, our approach reduced yield prediction error from 1 Mg/ha (control case based on a calibrated APSIM model), to 0.5 Mg/ha (using satellite imagery alone), and then to 0.2 Mg/ha (results with assimilation up to three weeks prior to the optimal regression date). Such a capacity to provide spatially explicit yield predictions early in the season has considerable potential to enhance digital agricultural goals and improve end-of-season yield predictions.

TI  - Preventing Metastasis Using Gold Nanorod-Assisted Plasmonic Photothermal Therapy in Xenograft Mice
T2  - BIOCONJUGATE CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite significant research regarding metastasis, there has been limited success in preventing it. However, gold nanoparticle (AuNP) technology has shown the potential to inhibit metastasis. Our earlier studies of gold nanorodassisted plasmonic photothermal therapy (AuNRs-PPTT), where gold nanorods (AuNRs) were irradiated with near-infrared (NIR) light to induce heat, were utilized in slowing cancer cell migration in vitro. Herein, we have expanded the in vitro studies of the AuNRs-PPTT to xenograft mice to inhibit metastasis of mammary gland tumors. The study duration was 32 days from 4T1 cancer cell injections in four treatment groups: control (PBS), NIR Only, AuNRs, and AuNRs + NIR. Multiple AuNRs-PPTT treatment sessions with intratumoral AuNRs injections were conducted every 7 days on average on the mice. Photoacoustic spectroscopy has been utilized to study the distribution and aggregation of AuNRs within the tumors and the drainage of particles to the sentinel right subiliac lymph node. The photoacoustic results revealed that the AuNRs' shapes are still stable regardless of their heterogeneous distributions inside the mammalian tumor and lymph nodes. Bioluminescence imaging was used to monitor metastasis using luciferin labeling techniques and has shown that AuNRs-PPTT inhibited metastasis completely within the first 21 days. Moreover, proteomics was run to determine the most pivotal inhibitory pathways: NETosis, cell growth, cell proliferation, inflammation, and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation. These five mechanisms are interdependent within related networks, which synergistically explains the molecular mechanism of metastasis inhibition by AuNRs-PPTT. The current in vivo data ensures the viability of PPTT applications in inhibiting metastasis in humans.

TI  - National Outcomes of Prophylactic Lymphovenous Bypass during Axillary Lymph Node Dissection
T2  - JOURNAL OF RECONSTRUCTIVE MICROSURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Breast cancer treatment, including axillary lymph node excision, radiation, and chemotherapy, can cause upper extremity lymphedema, increasing morbidity and health care costs. Institutions increasingly perform prophylactic lymphovenous bypass (LVB) at the time of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) to reduce the risk of lymphedema but reports of complications are lacking. We examine records from the American College of Surgeons (ACS) National Surgery Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database to examine the safety of these procedures. Methods Procedures involving ALND from 2013 to 2019 were extracted from the NSQIP database. Patients who simultaneously underwent procedures with the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes 38999 (other procedures of the lymphatic system), 35201 (repair of blood vessel), or 38308 (lymphangiotomy) formed the prophylactic LVB group. Patients in the LVB and non-LVB groups were compared for differences in demographics and 30-day postoperative complications including unplanned reoperation, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), wound dehiscence, and surgical site infection. Subgroup analysis was performed, controlling for extent of breast surgery and reconstruction. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify predictors of reoperation. Results The ALND without LVB group contained 45,057 patients, and the ALND with LVB group contained 255 (0.6%). Overall, the LVB group was associated with increased operative time (288 vs. 147 minutes, p < 0.001) and length of stay (1.7 vs. 1.3 days, p < 0.001). In patients with concurrent mastectomy without immediate reconstruction, the LVB group had a higher rate of DVTs (3.0 vs. 0.2%, p = 0.009). Reoperation, wound infection, and dehiscence rates did not differ across subgroups. Multivariate logistic regression showed that LVB was not a predictor of reoperations. Conclusion Prophylactic LVB at time of ALND is a generally safe and well-tolerated procedure and is not associated with increased reoperations or wound complications. Although only four patients in the LVB group had DVTs, this was a significantly higher rate than in the non-LVB group and warrants further investigation.

TI  - Turbidity and fecal indicator bacteria in recreational marine waters increase following the 2018 Woolsey Fire
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires increase runoff and sediment yields that impact downstream ecosystems. While the effects of wildfire on stream water quality are well documented, oceanic responses to wildfire remain poorly understood. Therefore, this study investigated oceanic responses to the 2018 Woolsey Fire using satellite remote sensing and in situ data analyses. We examined 2016-2020 turbidity plume (n = 192) and 2008-2020 fecal indicator bacteria (FIB, n = 15,015) measurements at variable proximity to the Woolsey Fire. Shifts in coastal water quality were more pronounced in the "inside" region, which drained the burn area. The inside region experienced 2018-2019 plume surface area monthly means that were 10 and 9 times greater than 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 monthly means, respectively. Further, linear regressions showed that 2018-2019 three-day precipitation totals produced plumes of greater surface area. We also noted statistically significant increases in the inside region in 2018-2019 total coliform and Enterococcus monthly means that were 9 and 53 times greater than 2008-2018 monthly means, respectively. These results indicate that sediment and microbial inputs to coastal ecosystems can increase substantially post-wildfire at levels relevant to public and environmental health, and underscore the benefit of considering remote sensing and in situ measurements for water quality monitoring.

TI  - Disaster management and the need for a relational leadership framework founded upon compassion, care, and justice
T2  - CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - There is increasing recognition of the human capacity to alter the underlying dynamics of the planet's basic life support system for themselves and all other forms of life. Resulting impacts include large scale loss, damage and harm and significant negative impacts on human and non-human species. Managing and minimizing these resulting impacts rests in part with disaster management leaders who have responsibility for providing protection, improving wellbeing, and minimizing vulnerability to natural hazards influenced by climate change. The difficulty for effective leadership resides in attempting to manage and minimize these impacts whilst potentially being influenced by sociocultural factors such as anthropocentrism and neoliberalism that shape worldviews. Here, a comparative analysis of 89 influential disaster management leaders in Australia, New Zealand, and the United States of America is conducted. The extent to which these leaders are influenced by a worldview labelled 'invulnerable', and/or by an alternative worldview informed by three ethical perspectives labelled 'relational', is examined. The extent that these two worldviews influence leaders when providing advice and protecting others is also examined. The results indicate a propensity towards a relational leadership worldview that is undermined by an invulnerable leadership worldview dominated by insensitivity to the suffering of others. How a relational leadership framework can actively contest this insensitivity is then discussed. The article concludes by advocating for a relational leadership framework that encourages leaders to think, speak, and act relatably with commitment, venturousness, and accountability, concomitant with an ethic of compassion, care, and justice, to reduce suffering.

TI  - U-shaped deep-learning models for island ecosystem type classification, a case study in Con Dao Island of Vietnam
T2  - ONE ECOSYSTEM
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring of ecosystem dynamics utilises time and resources from scientists and land-use managers, especially in wetland ecosystems in islands that have been affected significantly by both the current state of oceans and human-made activities. Deep-learning models for natural and anthropogenic ecosystem type classification, based on remote sensing data, have become a tool to potentially replace manual image interpretation. This study proposes a U-Net model to develop a deep learning model for classifying 10 island ecosystems with cloud-and shadow-based data using Sentinel-2, ALOS and NOAA remote sensing data. We tested and compared different optimiser methods with two benchmark methods, including support vector machines and random forests. In total, 48 U-Net models were trained and compared. The U-Net model with the Adadelta optimiser and 64 filters showed the best result, because it could classify all island ecosystems with 93 percent accuracy and a loss function value of 0.17. The model was used to classify and successfully manage ecosystems on a particular island in Vietnam. Compared to island ecosystems, it is not easy to detect coral reefs due to seasonal ocean currents. However, the trained deep-learning models proved to have high performances compared to the two traditional methods. The best U-Net model, which needs about two minutes to create a new classification, could become a suitable tool for island research and management in the future.

TI  - Epidemiology of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales in five US sites participating in the Emerging Infections Program, 2017
T2  - INFECTION CONTROL AND HOSPITAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The incidence of infections from extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) is increasing in the United States. We describe the epidemiology of ESBL-E at 5 Emerging Infections Program (EIP) sites.Methods: During October-December 2017, we piloted active laboratory- and population-based (New York, New Mexico, Tennessee) or sentinel (Colorado, Georgia) ESBL-E surveillance. An incident case was the first isolation from normally sterile body sites or urine of Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae/oxytoca resistant to >= 1 extended-spectrum cephalosporin and nonresistant to all carbapenems tested at a clinical laboratory from a surveillance area resident in a 30-day period. Demographic and clinical data were obtained from medical records. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) performed reference antimicrobial susceptibility testing and whole-genome sequencing on a convenience sample of case isolates.Results: We identified 884 incident cases. The estimated annual incidence in sites conducting population-based surveillance was 199.7 per 100,000 population. Overall, 800 isolates (96%) were from urine, and 790 (89%) were E. coli. Also, 393 cases (47%) were community-associated. Among 136 isolates (15%) tested at the CDC, 122 (90%) met the surveillance definition phenotype; 114 (93%) of 122 were shown to be ESBL producers by clavulanate testing. In total, 111 (97%) of confirmed ESBL producers harbored a bla (CTX-M) gene. Among ESBL-producing E. coli isolates, 52 (54%) were ST131; 44% of these cases were community associated.Conclusions: The burden of ESBL-E was high across surveillance sites, with nearly half of cases acquired in the community. EIP has implemented ongoing ESBL-E surveillance to inform prevention efforts, particularly in the community and to watch for the emergence of new ESBL-E strains.

TI  - A simultaneous assessment of multiple ecosystem services and disservices in vineyards and orchards on Terceira Island, Azores
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring ecosystem processes resulting in ecosystem services (ESs) and disservices (EDs) is crucial in agricultural ecosystems. Traditionally, ESs/EDs provided by arthropods have been estimated indirectly by measuring arthropod abundance and diversity, overlooking the recognised limitations of such approach. Using a consistent methodology based on the sentinel approach, we quantified the intensity of five ecological processes leading to four ESs and two EDs in vineyards and citrus orchards on Terceira Island, Azores. We assessed herbivory rates on lettuce plants (ED), predation rates on green plasticine caterpillars by vertebrates and invertebrates (ES), the intensity of insect pollination on strawberry plants (ES), the rates of predation on wheat and dandelion seeds (ED and ES, respectively) by rodents and invertebrates, and decomposition rates using tea and rooibos leaves (ES). Herbivory rates after 2 weeks were significantly lower in vineyards (mean +/- SD; 0.5 +/- 0.6%) than in citrus orchards (3.6 +/- 2.9%). Vertebrate predation rates in vineyards (4.0 +/- 13.6% d(-1)) were significantly higher than in citrus orchards (2.4 +/- 10.7% d(-1)), while no differences were observed for overall and invertebrate predation rates. Pollination efficiency in vineyards (214.5 +/- 23.9 seeds/fruit) was significantly higher than in citrus orchards (162.0 +/- 14.7 seeds/fruit). Seed predation rates were higher, although not significantly so, in citrus orchards (2.0 +/- 5.8% d(-1)) than in vineyards (0.3 +/- 0.8% d(-1)). Decomposition was significantly higher on tea than on rooibos leaves, both in vineyards (1.15 +/- 0.11 g vs. 0.72 +/- 0.16 g) and citrus orchards (1.34 +/- 0.06 g vs. 0.78 +/- 0.13 g); no differences between mass loss in the two habitats were observed. Our results demonstrated the suitability of simple, direct monitoring tools for a quantitative comparison of agricultural habitats, confirm that landscape complexity does not always support ESs, and that the same agro-ecosystem characteristics that support ESs could occasionally also favour EDs.

TI  - An empirical model based environmental pollution level analysis in coastal area of Gulf of Mannar using remote sensing data
T2  - CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the statistical relations among the remote sensing data and observed water quality parameters is the necessary task to develop an estimator model. In order to estimate the exact water quality parameter distribution map of the study area from remote sensing data, this present study proposed an empirical mathematical relational and signature (EMRS) model. Through this EMRS model, an environmental pollution level analysis has been carried out for coastal area of Gulf of Mannar. EMRS highly facilitates to map the distribution of the water quality parameters. The insitu samples were involved with ICP-OES and Physicochemical analysis and the test results were used for convergence of EMRS. The heavy metals such as Fe, Cu, Cd, Hg, and physicochemical parameters such as pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), biological oxygen demand (BOD), alkalinity, total suspended solids (TSS), turbidity and hardness are the experimented water quality parameters. The Landsat, Sentinal remote sensing data were used by the model to estimate the values and distribution and pollution level maps. The experimental analysis shows that the extracted element concentration using the proposed EMRS has highly correlated with the observed values based on the different measures such as R-2 and root mean square error (RMSE).

TI  - Spatially characterizing land surface deformation and permafrost active layer thickness for Donnelly installation of Alaska using DInSAR and MODIS data
T2  - COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The degradation of permafrost in the Earth's cold regions due to climate warming and human activities is of increasing concern because of its impact on ecosystems and land management, thus, monitoring the degradation becomes critical. This study aimed to demonstrate a method in which Sentinel-1 DInSAR and MODIS data were combined to estimate and map seasonal and long-term land surface deformation (subsidence/uplifting) and permafrost active layer thickness (ALT) in Donnelly Training Area (DTA) in Alaska. The coherence (similarity) between the paired SAR images was analyzed for their applicability. A sensitivity analysis and accuracy assessment of the estimates were conducted to account for their quality. Results showed that the estimated seasonal subsidence mainly occurring in June and July was in the range of 0 to-0.43 m, while the estimated uplifting mainly happening from September to May of next year was as great as +0.34 m. Moreover, the estimated long-term (2015 to 2018) subsidence and uplifting were mostly distributed in the southern and northern parts of DTA, respectively. The spatially variable time delays led to the ALT estimates greater along the east river and in the west and south parts, and smaller in the north parts. At the significance level of 0.05, the coherence estimates of the paired images were significantly different from zero and compared with the referenced predictions from a widely used annual prediction model, the average residual of the ALT estimates did not significantly differ from zero at the significance level of 0.05. The spatial distributions of the uncertainties for the seasonal surface deformation estimates were similar to those of the input uncertainties from the estimates of model coefficients, the phase change, the modelling error, and the image pairs. Thus, the DInSAR image based method coupled with MODIS data offered the potential of mapping and monitoring the dynamics of permafrost environment for the cold regions such as DTA in which collecting field observations is difficult and costly. This study also enhanced understanding spatiotemporal variability of permafrost deformation in DTA and provided guidelines for developing a near real-time monitoring system of the permafrost environment.

TI  - Identification of Geothermal Reservoirs in South Cameroon from a Combined Landsat 8 and AMT Data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This geothermal source prospecting work is carried out in order to respond to the energy deficit affecting the populations of South Cameroon in particular. The study combines audio-magnetotelluric (AMT) and Landsat 8 data for the geolocation of reservoirs, as well as the geological and tectonic information. The processing of these data defined 5 profiles and led to two-dimensional models of resistivity sections for each profile. The interpretation of the data identified a highly conductive zone with a resistivity ranged 1-10 omega center dot m at an estimated depth of 1200 m in the locality of Menve'ele. The Landsat 8 data collected in this area during the same period enabled the elaboration of temperature and lineament anomaly maps of the study area. High-temperature areas with high lineament predominance correlate better with areas of low resistivity. For example, Menve'ele (A1) has a surface temperature range of 20 degrees C-30 degrees C and a high density of lineaments. By correlating these results with those provided by previous authors, the Menve'ele locality may be the target of a potential geothermal reservoir. A 3D resistivity model is built to better understand the variations of resistivity and their depths. The geological and tectonic information of the region confirm the tectonic origin of the faults and lineaments as well as the predominance of metamorphic and sedimentary formations.

TI  - Plant ecology in Indian Siwalik range: a systematic map and its bibliometric analysis
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The Himalayan foothills or the Siwaliks have been considered as one of the most fragile ecosystems of India. The underlying cause of degradation includes natural settings (geological formation and climate change) and human-mediated pressures (sandstone mining, urbanisation and developmental activities). Since the Siwaliks is associated with the livelihood of about 20 million people, it becomes imperative to respond appropriately for sustaining this ecologically fragile region. Ecological principles have great potential to develop sustainable practices for the conservation and management of natural resources. These principles offer nature-based solutions to sustain the ecologically sensitive and degraded ecosystems such as the 'Siwaliks'. However, there is a need for concerted research to develop data-driven decisions for effective management. Therefore, a systematic analysis was conducted to assess the current patterns and knowledge gaps about plant ecological studies in the Indian Siwalik region. This article analysed the available peer-reviewed literature using established guidelines and bibliometric analyses. We found an increasing trend in the scientific output, and most studies were concentrated in the Siwalik region belonging to the Indian state of Uttarakhand. Although studies have been conducted on plant ecology, landscape ecology and ecosystem ecology have been disproportionately focused. Our findings suggest a growing interest in the plant ecology of the region; however, these studies seem relatively small compared to the complexity and diversity of this ecosystem structural and functional attributes. Further, with advances in computer application and remote sensing satellite data availability, we observed a shift towards ecological modelling studies, though experimental evidence also needs to be addressed.

TI  - Spatial-temporal trade-offs of land multi-functionality and function zoning at finer township scale in the middle reaches of the Heihe River
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Trade-off occurs when two or more land use functions compete with each other, and high degree of trade-off tends to impede the maximization of land resource utility. Identifying the pattern of trade-offs among multiple land functions is an essential way to achieve sustainable land management. However, effective governance depends heavily on the trade-off information at finer scales which is difficult to acquire due to the challenges in collecting social and economic data at these scales. To overcome this limitation, we developed a framework to reveal the spatio-temporal pattern of land multi-functionality in the middle reaches of the Heihe River in 2006 and 2016 at the township scale by assimilating datasets from multiple sources especially including remote sensing and Internet-based geospatial data. Then we examined the trade-offs and synergy among different land functions by correlation analysis and bivariate spatial autocorrelation analysis. Finally, we conducted land function zoning analysis using the k-means clustering method to get different zones for the purpose of land management. The results showed that land multi-functionality in the middle reaches of the Heihe River showed highly temporal and spatial variations, which was characterized by the strongest economic and social functions around town centers, the strongest environmental functions at the mountainous areas, and the prominent social functions in the ethnic towns. The quantified value of land multi-functionality increased rapidly by 35.0% from 2006 to 2016 with economic, social and environmental function increasing by 61.4%, 47.8% and 6.4% respectively. The trade-offs and synergies among land functions were complex. The synergy between economic function and social function was at a high level and stable, while the trade-off between environmental function and economic function was high but slightly weakened. We identified three hotspots of trade-offs and synergies among multiple land functions, which corresponded to low-intensity development, high-intensity development, and restrictive development for restoration and protection. Based on the trade-offs and synergies among land functions, we classified the study area into four zones, which were useful for land management. Our research highlights the use of Internet-based geospatial and remote sensing data to get fine-scale information about land multi-functionality, and provides scientific guidelines for sustainable land use.

TI  - Radar and optical remote sensing for near real-time assessments of cyclone impacts on coastal ecosystems
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid impact assessment of cyclones on coastal ecosystems is critical for timely rescue and rehabilitation operations in highly human-dominated landscapes. Such assessments should also include damage assessments of vegetation for restoration planning in impacted natural landscapes. Our objective is to develop a remote sensing-based approach combining satellite data derived from optical (Sentinel-2), radar (Sentinel-1), and LiDAR (Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation) platforms for rapid assessment of post-cyclone inundation in non-forested areas and vegetation damage in a primarily forested ecosystem. We apply this multi-scalar approach for assessing damages caused by the cyclone Amphan that hit coastal India and Bangladesh in May 2020, severely flooding several districts in the two countries, and causing destruction to the Sundarban mangrove forests. Our analysis shows that at least 6821 sq. km. land across the 39 study districts was inundated even after 10 days after the cyclone. We further calculated the change in forest greenness as the difference in normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) pre- and post-cyclone. Our findings indicate a <0.2 unit decline in NDVI in 3.45 sq. km. of the forest. Rapid assessment of post-cyclone damage in mangroves is challenging due to limited navigability of waterways, but critical for planning of mitigation and recovery measures. We demonstrate the utility of Otsu method, an automated statistical approach of the Google Earth Engine platform to identify inundated areas within days after a cyclone. Our radar-based inundation analysis advances current practices because it requires minimal user inputs, and is effective in the presence of high cloud cover. Such rapid assessment, when complemented with detailed information on species and vegetation composition, can inform appropriate restoration efforts in severely impacted regions and help decision makers efficiently manage resources for recovery and aid relief. We provide the datasets from this study on an open platform to aid in future research and planning endeavors.

TI  - Environmental Impacts of Urban Sprawl in Surat, Gujarat: An Examination Using Landsat Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the environmental impacts of urban sprawl in Surat inner city in India. Urban sprawl is examined by studying land-use land-cover change from 1998 to 2016. Changes in spatial characteristics of urban land cover are further verified using Shannon's entropy. The impact of urban sprawl is examined by computing normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI) and normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) values. Land surface temperature (LST) is also calculated using thermal band of multi-temporal Landsat data. Regression analysis is used to calculate the correlation between LST and NDVI, NDWI and NDBI. The study showed a negative correlation between NDVI, NDWI and LST and a positive correlation between NDBI and LST. Urban areas in Surat have grown an approximately 60.41 sq.km, a 102% increase while surface temperature in Surat inner city has risen by 5.1 degrees C during the study period. The study also showed that temperature increase was particularly pronounced throughout areas classified as urban and bare soil and showed an increasing trend in parts of the city with dense urban areas.

TI  - Extending a canopy reflectance model for mangroves: A case study in south east queensland, Australia
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves are essential coastal wetland vegetation and their extent and leaf area index (LAI) have been mapped using remotely sensed Earth Observation images. However, the physics-based relationship between biophysical properties of mangroves, tidal height, and their spectral values remains underexplored. In order to quantitatively evaluate the impact of woody material on mangrove spectra from optical imagery, a canopy reflectance model (CRM) was extended to simulate and analyse the reflectance of mangroves. The fractional cover, leaf-to-total area ratio and water depth were included as model parameters, increasing the fidelity of the canopy architecture in the CRM. A mangrove study area in South East Queensland, Australia, was chosen for model parameterisation and verification using field and satellite data. Simulated Sentinel-2 reflectance spectra of the mangrove plots closely matched the observed pixel reflectance spectra, with their coefficient of determination (R2) values higher than 0.98 and root mean square error values lower than 0.01, which was better than the performance of the original CRM omitting the fractional cover and woody material. The inverted plant area index and fractional cover values from the satellite imagery closely matched the field-derived reference values (R2 = 0.78 and 0.97, respectively). Simulation results revealed that a higher proportion of woody material in crowns reduced the canopy reflectance of mangroves in the near infrared region and increased the reflectance in the shortwave infrared region. Moreover, the simulated reflectance of the Sentinel-2 red edge 1 (695-714 nm) was not sensitive to the wood proportion for the examined cases. The modelling framework may be used to evaluate the impact of woody material for estimating mangrove LAI from optical imagery. The model may also be used to quantitatively analyse the mangrove reflectance spectra when including other important factors such as tidal height.

TI  - Automatic control and dispatching of charging currents to a charging station for power-assisted bikes
T2  - ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This work deals with the automatic dispatching of the charging currents in a charging station for power-assisted bikes (ebike). The decision variables such as arduousness index and urgency are determined. The arduousness index is carried out from the GPS ride data. Urgency is calculated using the parking time and ebike batteries state of charge. They are used to determine ebike's charging priorities at the charging station using continue fuzzy logic. Photovoltaic power forecasting is determined over the control horizon using the artificial neural network. On the one hand, the values of the priority, the photovoltaic power forecasting and the storage battery's state of charge are calculated. They allow to control the states of the switches associated with each charging spot and the operating mode of the storage battery (source or load) using discrete fuzzy logic. On the other hand, the interest of the ride's arduousness for a charging station is presented. A comparative study between the charging method integrating the ride arduousness and not is carried out. A case study of the polytech Annecy campus at the University of Savoie Mont Blanc in France is proposed. Results show that: the arduousness index is essential for controlling the charging priority of ebikes at the charging station; Fuzzy logic allows to manage the current dispatching on a charging station; taking into account the ride's arduousness allows to save up to 413.03 (Wh) of profit and 97.90% energy flexibility on the charging station.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Seroprevalence of <i>Coxiella burnetii</i> in pig-hunting dogs from north Queensland, Australia
T2  - AUSTRALIAN VETERINARY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The causative agent of Q fever, Coxiella burnetii, is endemic to Queensland and is one of the most important notifiable zoonotic diseases in Australia. The reservoir species for C. burnetii are classically ruminants, including sheep, cattle and goats. There is increasing evidence of C. burnetii exposure in dogs across eastern and central Australia. The present study aimed to determine if pig-hunting dogs above the Tropic of Capricorn in Queensland had similar rates of C. burnetii exposure to previous serosurveys of companion dogs in rural north-west New South Wales. A total of 104 pig-hunting dogs had serum IgG antibody titres to phase I and phase 2 C. burnetii determined using an indirect immunofluorescence assay test. Almost one in five dogs (18.3%; 19/104; 95% confidence interval 9.6%-35.5%) were seropositive to C. burnetii, with neutered dogs more likely to test positive compared to entire dogs (P = 0.0497). Seropositivity of the sampled pig-hunting dogs was one of the highest recorded in Australia. Thirty-nine owners of the pig-hunting dogs completed a survey, revealing 12.8% (5/39) had been vaccinated against Q fever and 90% (35/39) were aware that both feral pigs and dogs could potentially be sources of C. burnetii. Our findings indicate that pig hunters should be aware of the risk of exposure to Q fever during hunts and the sentinel role their dogs may play in C. burnetii exposure.

AB  - The excess of the chemical fertilizers not only causes the environmental pollution but also has many deteriorating effects including global warming and alteration of soil microbial diversity. In conventional researches, chemical fertilizers and their concentrations are selected based on the knowledge of experts involved in the projects, which this kind of models are usually subjective. Therefore, the present study aimed to introduce the optimal concentrations of three macro elements including nitrogen (0, 100, and 200 g), potassium (0, 100, 200, and 300 g), and magnesium (0, 50, and 100 g) on fruit yield (FY), fruit length (FL), and number of rows per spike (NRPS) of greenhouse banana using analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post hoc LSD test and two well-known artificial neural networks (ANNs) including multilayer perceptron (MLP) and generalized regression neural network (GRNN). According to the results of ANOVA, the highest mean value of the FY was obtained with 200 g of N, 300 g of K, and 50 g of Mg. Based on the results of the present study, the both ANNs models had high predictive accuracy (R-2 = 0.66-0.99) in the both training and testing data for the FY, FL, and NRPS. However, the GRNN model had better performance than MLP model for modeling and predicting the three characters of greenhouse banana. Therefore, genetic algorithm (GA) was subjected to the GRNN model in order to find the optimal amounts of N, K, and Mg for achieving the high amounts of the FY, FL, and NRPS. The GRNN-GA hybrid model confirmed that high yield of the plant could be achieved by reducing chemical fertilizers including nitrogen, potassium, and magnesium by 65, 44, and 62%, respectively, in compared to traditional method.

TI  - Intranodal delivery of modified docetaxel: Innovative therapeutic method to inhibit tumor cell growth in lymph nodes
T2  - CANCER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Delivery of chemotherapeutic agents into metastatic lymph nodes (LNs) is challenging as they are unevenly distributed in the body. They are difficult to access via traditional systemic routes of drug administration, which produce significant adverse effects and result in low accumulation of drugs into the cancerous LN. To improve the survival rate of patients with LN metastasis, a lymphatic drug delivery system (LDDS) has been developed to target metastatic LN by delivering chemotherapy agents into sentinel LN (SLN) under ultrasound guidance. The LDDS is an advanced method that can be applied in the early stage of the progression of tumor cells in the SLN before tumor mass formation has occurred. Here we investigated the optimal physicochemical ranges of chemotherapeutic agents' solvents with the aim of increasing treatment efficacy using the LDDS. We found that an appropriate osmotic pressure range for drug administration was 700-3,000 kPa, with a viscosity < 40 mPa.s. In these physicochemical ranges, expansion of lymphatic vessels and sinuses, drug retention, and subsequent antitumor effects could be more precisely controlled. Furthermore, the antitumor effects depended on the tumor progression stage in the SLN, the injection rate, and the volumes of administered drugs. We anticipate these optimal ranges to be a starting point for developing more effective drug regimens to treat metastatic LN with the LDDS.

TI  - Two-decadal estimation of sixteen phytoplankton pigments from satellite observations in coastal waters
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of the marine phytoplankton communities is vital for understanding the carbon cycle, ecological and biogeochemical processes, and climate change. Phytoplankton assemblages contain multiple pigments that play a significant role in describing the phytoplankton communities. Thus, detecting the concentrations of phytoplankton pigments is of great significance. Here, an extensive in situ observation dataset, including the phytoplankton absorption coefficient, concentrations of phytoplankton pigments, and remote sensing reflectance, was collected during seven cruise surveys in the Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea, and East China Sea. This study developed a customized absorption-based remote sensing model using the Gaussian decomposition technique, which closely links phytoplankton absorption characteristics with various pigments. This model was repeatedly assessed to guarantee its stable performance, and was evaluated using the in situ observation dataset and the leave-one-out cross-validation method, yielding results of competitive and acceptable errors (e.g., mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) below -60% for most pigments). Satellite match-up validation also generated promising predictive errors, with the derived MAPEs in a -10%-40% range for most pigments. Another contribution of our study is the application of the developed model to a long time series of satellite data (1998-2019), and the 22-year data record that documents the spatiotemporal variation of 16 pigment concentrations in the study areas. Accordingly, the long-term spatial and temporal evolution rules of 16 pigments are reported for the first time. This work concludes that the pigments (as the second-order delegates of phytoplankton pigments, compared to chlorophyll-a) can be retrieved from satellite data, despite the presence of optically complex turbid coastal waters, thus providing refined characteristics on phytoplankton assemblages for future marine research.

TI  - Analysis of surface temperature variation of lakes in China using MODIS land surface temperature data
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - China has a great wealth of lake resources over a great spatial extent and these lakes are highly sensitive to climate changes through their heat and water budgets. However, little is known about the changes in lake surface water temperature (LSWT) across China under the climate warming conditions over the past few decades. In this study, MODIS land surface temperature (LST) data were used to examine the spatial and temporal (diurnal, intra-annual, and inter-annual) variations in LSWT of China's lakes during 2001-2016. Our results indicated that 169 large lakes included in the study exhibited an overall increasing trend in LSWT, with an average rate of 0.26 degrees C/decade. The increasing rate of nighttime LSWT is 0.31 degrees C/decade, faster than that of daytime temperature (0.21 degrees C/decade). Overall, 121 (71.6%) lakes showed an increase in daytime temperature with a mean rate of 0.38 degrees C/decade, while the rest 48 (28.4%) lakes decreased in temperature with a mean rate of - 0.21 degrees C/decade. We also quantitatively analyzed the relationship of the lake surface temperature and diurnal temperature differences (DTDs) with geographical location, topography, and lake morphometry by utilizing multivariate regression analysis. Our analysis suggested that the geographical location (latitude and longitude) and topography (altitude) were primary driving factors in explaining the national lake water temperature variation (P < 0.001), which were also mediated by morphometric factors such as lake surface area and volume. Moreover, the diurnal lake temperature variations were significantly correlated with altitude, latitude, and lake surface area (R-2 = 0.426, P < 0.001). Correlation analyses of LSWT trend and air temperature trend for each lake indicated that LSWT was positively correlated with air temperature in both daytime and nighttime for most lakes.

TI  - NEMO-Bohai 1.0: a high-resolution ocean and sea ice modelling system for the Bohai Sea, China
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Severe ice conditions in the Bohai Sea could cause serious harm to maritime traffic, offshore oil exploitation, aquaculture, and other economic activities in the surrounding regions. In addition to providing sea ice forecasts for disaster prevention and risk mitigation, sea ice numerical models could help explain the sea ice variability within the context of climate change in marine ecosystems, such as spotted seals, which are the only ice-dependent animal that breeds in Chinese waters. Here, we developed NEMO-Bohai, an ocean-ice coupled model based on the Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean (NEMO) model version 4.0 and Sea Ice Modelling Integrated Initiative (SI3) (NEMO4.0-SI3) for the Bohai Sea. This study will present the scientific design and technical choices of the parameterizations for the NEMO-Bohai model. The model was calibrated and evaluated with in situ and satellite observations of the ocean and sea ice. The model simulations agree with the observations with respect to sea surface height (SSH), temperature (SST), salinity (SSS), currents, and temperature and salinity stratification. The seasonal variation of the sea ice area is well simulated by the model compared to the satellite remote sensing data for the period of 1996-2017. Overall agreement is found for the occurrence dates of the annual maximum sea ice area. The simulated sea ice thickness and volume are in general agreement with the observations with slight overestimations. NEMO-Bohai can simulate seasonal sea ice evolution and long-term interannual variations. Hence, NEMO-Bohai is a valuable tool for long-term ocean and ice simulations and climate change studies.

TI  - Improving the spatial resolution of GRACE-based groundwater storage estimates using a machine learning algorithm and hydrological model
T2  - HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The low-resolution characteristic of Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data greatly limits their application in many fields at regional or local scales. Aiming to overcome this limitation, the partial least squares regression (PLSR) model is firstly utilized to assess the importance of some independent variables that are commonly employed in GRACE downscaling research. Three kinds of downscaling models are chosen to improve the resolution of GRACE-based water storage estimates from 1 to 0.25 degrees, namely: multivariable linear regression, random forest (RF), and NoahV2.1. Results indicate that terrestrial water storage anomalies are more closely related to four independent variables in the Haihe River Basin, China: these variables are evapotranspiration, land surface temperature, air temperature, and soil moisture. With respect to the spatial distribution, the downscaled results based on the NoahV2.1 and RF models can effectively capture the subgrid heterogeneity while preserving the water storage characteristics at the original scale. By verifying the downscaled results with measured groundwater levels, it can be observed that the correlation coefficient between the RF-based downscaled groundwater storage anomalies (GWSA) and in-situ measurements is increased by 20.55% (Beijing), 9.13% (Tianjin), and 10.48% (Hebei) relative to the downscaled results based on the NoahV2.1 model. The cross wavelet transform illustrates that the meteorological factors have a strong influence on the GWSA series in the Haihe River Basin with an approximately 12-month signal during 2003-2016. This study can provide high-resolution GWSA datasets for water resources management and also provide a reference for the selection of dominant independent variables.

TI  - Axillary surgery and complication rates after mastectomy and reconstruction for breast cancer: an analysis of the NSQIP database
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose Some series have shown increased complications with extended nodal surgery and immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) with implants. We aim to explore complications associated with axillary dissection compared to sentinel lymph node biopsy at a population level. Methods American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program participant user files from 2008-2018 were searched to create a cohort of female patients undergoing unilateral mastectomy with IBR and axillary surgery for non-metastatic breast cancer. Patients were classified as having sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), axillary dissection (ALND), or sentinel lymph node biopsy and axillary dissection (SLNB + ALND). Baseline demographics were compared, and multivariable logistic regression was to assess for independent predictors of the primary outcome of 30-day morbidity. Results Between 2008 and 2018, 18,232 patients had mastectomy and IBR with axillary surgery; 12,632 patients underwent SLNB, 3727 had ALND and 1,873 underwent SLNB + ALND. Mean age of patients in the cohort was 52.5 (SD 11). There was no difference in 30-day morbidity between groups (SLNB: 4.3%, ALND: 4.9%, SLNB + ALND: 4.2%, p = 0.207). Multivariable regression showed that type of axillary surgery was not an independent predictor of 30-day complications (OR 0.78 (95% CI 0.52-1.15) for ALND, and OR 0.87 (95% CI 0.52-1.45) for ALND + SLNB vs SLNB alone). Significant independent predictors for complications were increased BMI (OR 1.06 (95%CI 1.04-1.08)) and increased operative time (OR 1.003 (95% CI 1.001-1.005)). Conclusions ALND does not increase 30-day morbidity in patients undergoing IBR when compared to SLNB. This supports concurrent axillary dissection for IBR patients when indicated.

TI  - Glacier inventory of the Subansiri River Basin in the Brahmaputra catchment using Landsat satellite data: A case study of the Daisaphu Glacier changes
T2  - GEOLOGICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring of glaciers of the Subansiri River Basin, regardless of geopolitical distribution, is pivotal, as the Subansiri River is one of the most important tributaries of the Brahmaputra River. However, the existing inventories in Eastern Himalayas mostly covered the Indian side, while most of the glacier regions are located in Tibet. For the first time, we constructed a complete, validated glacier and lake inventory using Landsat satellite data. We report 390 glaciers, where 191 are hanging glaciers, 59 ice aprons, 52 cirques, 40 niches, 37 valley glaciers, 9 icecaps and 2 outlet glaciers. The snow-covered region occupies 0.96% of the total basin area. The study also reports that there are 52 glacial lakes, covering a cumulative area of 3.358 km(2). Furthermore, the 37 valley glaciers cover an area of similar to 144 km(2), with lengths ranging between 1.3 and 15.3 km, and a total ice reserve of similar to 11.95 km(3). The largest glacier of the basin is the Daisaphu Glacier, which has an ice reserve of similar to 2.70 km(3). We calculated the retreat of the Daisaphu Glacier to be 16 ma(-1) between 1989 and 2014. However, the retreat has been seen to be enhanced, up to 21 ma(-1) after 2009. We also estimated the recession rate of 27 other valley glaciers, apart from the Daisaphu Glacier. The recession rate of the glaciers ranges between 2 and 51 ma(-1), where 30% of glaciers have retreated at a rate of <10 ma(-1), 55% of glaciers have retreated at a rate of >10 ma(-1) and 15% of glaciers show no frontal changes since 1985. The pro-glacial moraine-dammed lake of the Daisaphu glacier shows growth of 0.471 km(2) in area, and an increase of 0.0833 km(3) in water volume between 1978 and 2014. This inventory should help in the assessment of future water scenarios and climate change, as it will impact a large community downstream which is dependent on the glaciers which lie across two countries.

TI  - A framework for a forest ecological base map-An example from Norway
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the management of forest ecosystems, spatial information about the extent, condition and pressures are essential. In the current study, we present a framework for a remote sensing-based forest ecological base map covering Norway. Combining remotely sensed imagery from optical satellite systems such as Sentinel-2 and Landsat provides information about forest ecosystem extent and change over time. Utilizing a national dataset of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data allowed predicting a range of attributes describing forest condition, including naturalness. In total, seven definitions of naturalness were evaluated. Pressures on the forest ecosystems were mapped using a change detection algorithm and satellite data from 1986 to 2020. Change detection is the cornerstone in monitoring and for understanding the pressures on the ecosystems. The predicted forest extent had an overall accuracy of 85 to 89% using Sentinel-2 imagery from 2020 and 71 to 81% using Landsat imagery from 1986. For the forest condition attributes, the explained portion of the variances were >70% for biomass, height and volume and from 21% to 64% for number of stems, crown coverage and a diversity index. Naturalness was classified with accuracies of 77 to 98%, except for age-based definitions. Nevertheless, a large number of false positives were present. Change detection was evaluated in terms of final harvest and was identified with an overall accuracy of 84-92%. The land cover change classification had an overall accuracy of 70-92%. The detailed maps of forest condition and forest pressures were aggregated to a local level using model-based inference, providing estimates of mean values and uncertainty at a scale suitable for ecosystem indicator development. The collection of map layers describing forest extent, condition and pressures form a forest ecological base map important for environmental management.

TI  - Monitoring glacier characteristics and their mass balance using a multidimensional approach over the glaciers of the Chandra basin, western Himalaya
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier change monitoring provides a significant understanding of glacier health and its influence on freshwater availability. Therefore, we have utilized remotely sensed data to estimate the glacier characteristics, mass balance, and volume change during 2013-2019 over the Sutri Dhaka and Batal glaciers, Chandra basin, western Himalayas. The glacier feature classification and shifting in isoline were mapped on a spatio-temporal scale. Furthermore, the surface velocity was measured using Coregistration of Optically Sensed Images and Correlation (COSI-Corr) and then used for estimating the ice thickness. The estimated velocity was compared with the stake observations and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)- Inter-Mission Time Series of Land Ice Velocity and Elevation (ITS_LIVE) data. Further, the glaciers' geodetic mass balance and volume change were calculated, indicating an average value of -0.03 +/- 0.5, -0.34 +/- 0.40 and -0.13 +/- 0.14 m water equivalent (w.e.) year(-1) during 2000-2009, 2009-2020, and 2000-2020, respectively. This multidimensional analysis of the glaciers is critical, as the meltwater from both glaciers contributes to the Chandra basin and also influences the local ecosystem.

TI  - Mapping corn and soybean phenometrics at field scales over the United States Corn Belt by fusing time series of Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 data with VIIRS data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely crop phenology is essential for efficient crop management and precise modelling of crop yield and productivity. It has been commonly mapped from moderate or coarse resolution (>= 500 m) satellite data at a national or global scale, which generally represents the mixture of multiple crops or between crops and natural vegetation. Crop phenological progress at field scales (<= 30 m) is critical for monitoring the growth of specie-specific crop types, but it is very challenging at large scales because of limited cloud-free observations in the satellite time series. To map corn and soybean phenometrics at a field scale (30 m) over entire Corn Belt in the United States, this study for the first time develops a new approach that fuses high temporal resolution Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) observations (500 m) and high spatial resolution Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) data (30 m). The fused HLS-VIIRS time series (daily 30 m) is applied to map crop phenometrics of greenup onset, mid-greenup phase, maturity onset, senescence onset, mid-senescence phase, and dormancy onset. These six phenometrics are correlated to crop progress (CP) of seven corn and six soybean growth stages from planting to harvest that are observed by the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and are further validated using PhenoCam near-surface time series imagery. The result indicates that the HLS-VIIRS crop phenometrics are capable of tracking the CP very well. Although their biophysical definitions of CP stages and sample coverage were not the same in our comparisons, the HLS-VIIRS crop phenometrics and NASS CP at a state level are closely comparable with a difference < 4 days for corn and soybean emergence, 1 day for soybean dropping leaves, and 6-10 days for other corn and soybean growth stages. Their significant correlations (R-2 ranging from 0.81 to 0.99, p < 0.01) suggest that the HLS-VIIRS crop phenometrics are robust proxies for predicting NASS CP with a high accuracy. Moreover, the HLS-VIIRS phenometrics aligns closely with PhenoCam phenological timings at various crop growth stages with an absolute average difference from 3 days to 5.3 days and bias from 1.5 to 3.5 days. The result demonstrates that the proposed approach could be implemented for monitoring field scale crop progress at a national or global scale.

T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to assess the impacts of land use/land cover (LULC) changes on ecosystem service values (ESVs) in the Rib watershed of the Upper Blue Nile Basin between 2000 and 2020 periods. Image classifications were carried out using Landsat 5 TM for 2000 and 2010, and Landsat 8 OLI_TIRS for 2020 periods following the supervised classification technique with a Maximum Likelihood Algorithm (MLA) in ERDAS Imagine 2014. The study estimated the effects of LULC changes on ESVs using the modified ecosystem service value coefficients. The result indicated that a reduction of forest (46%), shrubland (44%), grassland (42%), and an increase of cultivated land (23%), settlement (137%), and waterbody (80%) during 2000 and 2020 periods. The total ESVs of the watershed were estimated about US$ 68.6 million in 2000, US$ 59.4 million in 2010, and US$ 59.3 million in 2020. The ESVs lost between 2000 and 2020 periods was about US$ 9.3 million (13.5%). The observed LULC changes during this period have also affected the individual ecosystem services. The reduction of ESVs through 2000 to 2020 periods indicates the effects of LULC changes on ecological degradation. Hence, the authors suggested the use of LULC change and ESVs together during land management decision-making processes.

TI  - Drought impacts in forest canopy and deciduous tree saplings in Central European forests
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests worldwide are increasingly exposed to extreme weather events. Drought deteriorates the health, struc-ture, and functioning of forests, which can lead to reduced diversity, decreased productivity, and increased tree mortality. Therefore, it is an urgent need to assess the impact of drought on tree species. Due to differences in tree physiology, saplings and mature trees are likely to respond specifically to drought conditions. In contrast to mature trees, little is known about the response of saplings to drought. Here, we combine in-situ field mea-surements for saplings of deciduous tree species with remote sensing for forest canopy to assess drought damage, recovery, and sapling mortality patterns during a centennial drought (2018, 2019) and beyond (2020). We measured 2051 saplings out of 214 plots in Central Germany. Forest canopy health was assessed using 10 x 10 m resolution satellite observations for the same locations. We (1) demonstrate that forest canopy exhibits long-lasting drought-induced effects, (2) show that saplings have a remarkable capacity to recover from drought and survive a subsequent drought, (3) demonstrate that reduced sapling recovery leads to their mortality, (4) reveal that drought damage on saplings increases from pioneer to non-pioneer species, and mortality is ranking from Sorbus aucuparia > Sambucus nigra > Fraxinus excelsior, Acer campestre, Frangula alnus > Ulmus glabra > Carpinus betulus > Betula pendula, Fagus sylvatica > Acer pseudoplatanus > Quercus petraea > Corylus avellana, Crataegus spp., > Prunus avium, Quercus robur; and (5) link drought response to site conditions, indicating that species diversity and winter precipitation as relevant indicators of tree health. If periods of drought become more frequent, as expected, this could negatively impact mid-term forest recovery, alter long-term tree species as-semblages and reduce biodiversity and functional resilience of forest ecosystems. We suggest that models of forest response to drought should differentiate between the forest canopy and understory and also consider species-specific responses as we found a broad spectrum of responses within the same plant functional type of deciduous tree species in terms of drought damage and recovery.

TI  - Irrigation estimates from space: Implementation of different approaches to model the evapotranspiration contribution within a soil-moisture-based inversion algorithm
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Irrigation is the most impacting and uncertain human intervention on the water resource. The possibility of retrieving information on irrigation practices through remote sensing technology opens unprecedented perspectives on the monitoring of anthropized basins. This study is aimed at assessing the impact of different approaches to model the contribution of the evapotranspiration in retrieving the amounts of water applied for irrigation through a soil-moisture-based (SM-based) inversion algorithm; such a contribution is conclusive especially over semi-arid regions. Three modeling approaches relying on both calculated and remotely sensed actual and potential evapotranspiration (ET and PET) data sets were implemented to represent the evapotranspiration rate within the SM-based inversion method, which allows backward estimation of irrigation through the soil water balance inversion. By combining the different evapotranspiration data sources and modeling approaches, seven experiments aimed at inverting DISPATCH (DISaggregation based on Physical And Theoretical scale CHange) downscaled SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) soil moisture at 1 km to estimate irrigation over four heavily irrigated agricultural districts located in Spain (Aragon and Catalonia) were compared. The results highlighted that the application of the FAO56 guidelines parametrization relying on the use of optical data as proposed by the authors in a previous study remains the most reliable configuration. In fact, the implementation of a simplified approach not considering the transpiration component of the specific crop led to irrigation underestimates. Finally, it is interesting to note that the application of the method with remotely sensed ET from MODIS (MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) produced reliable district-aggregated irrigation estimates, thus opening the perspective of an algorithm configuration forced with remote sensing data only.

TI  - The application of ResU-net and OBIA for landslide detection from multi-temporal sentinel-2 images
T2  - BIG EARTH DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Landslide detection is a hot topic in the remote sensing community, particularly with the current rapid growth in volume (and variety) of Earth observation data and the substantial progress of computer vision. Deep learning algorithms, especially fully convolutional networks (FCNs), and variations like the ResU-Net have been used recently as rapid and automatic landslide detection approaches. Although FCNs have shown cutting-edge results in automatic landslide detection, accuracy can be improved by adding prior knowledge through possible frameworks. This study evaluates a rule-based object-based image analysis (OBIA) approach built on probabilities resulting from the ResU-Net model for landslide detection. We train the ResU-Net model using a landslide dataset comprising landslide inventories from various geographic regions, including our study area and test the testing area not used for training. In the OBIA stage, we first calculate land cover and image difference indices for pre-and post-landslide multi-temporal images. Next, we use the generated indices and the resulting ResU-Net probabilities for image segmentation; the extracted landslide object candidates are then optimized using rule-based classification. In the result validation section, the landslide detection of the proposed integration of the ResU-Net with a rule-based classification of OBIA is compared with that of the ResU-Net alone. Our proposed approach improves the mean intersection-over-union of the resulting map from the ResU-Net by more than 22%.

TI  - Intercomparison of Sentinel-2 and modelled snow cover maps in a high-elevation Alpine catchment
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY X
M3  - Article
AB  - Modelling runoff generation in high-elevation Alpine catchments requires detailed knowledge on the spatiotemporal distribution of snow storage. With Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI), it is possible to map snow cover with a high temporal and spatial resolution. In contrast to the coarse MODIS data, Sentinel-2 MSI enables the investigation of small-scale differences in snow cover duration in complex terrains due to gravitational redistribution (slope), energy balance and wind-driven redistribution (aspect). In this study, we describe the generation of high-resolution spatial and temporal snow cover data sets from Sentinel-2 images for a highelevation Alpine catchment and discuss how the data contribute to our understanding of the spatio-temporal snow cover distribution. The quality of snow and cloud detection is evaluated against in-situ snow observations and against other snow and cloud products. The main problem was in the false detection of snow in the presence of clouds and in topographically shaded areas. We then seek to explore the potential of the generated high-resolution snow cover maps in calibrating the gravitational snow redistribution module of a physically based snow model, especially for an area with a very data-scarce point snow observation network. Generally, the calibrated snow model is able to simulate both the mean snow cover duration with a high F1 accuracy score of > 0.9 and the fractional snow-covered area with a correlation coefficient of 0.98. The snow model is also able to reproduce spatio-temporal variability in snow cover duration due to surface energy balance dynamics, wind and gravitational redistribution.

TI  - Assessment of SMAP and SMOS soil moisture products using triple collocation method over Inner Mongolia
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is an indispensable variable in drought monitoring and weather forecast. L-band is found to be the most suitable band for retrieving surface SM. Here, we evaluate two L-band passive microwave SM products Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) and Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) in Inner Mongolia. The collected in-situ data from 24 measured sites and the triple collocation (TC) analysis method (using Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) Noah and the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) SM data as a reference dataset) are used to evaluate SMAP and SMOS SM products. In the validation based on in-situ SM, SMAP shows the highest correlation with the in-situ SM, followed by GLDAS and SMOS. The root mean square error (RMSE) and bias value of SMAP is the lowest. The validation results of each in-situ station show that the median correlation coefficient of ASCAT is the highest, followed by SMAP, GLDAS, and SMOS. The median RMSE and bias of SMAP are the lowest, while SMOS performs the worst among the three products. TC analysis results show that SMAP has better performance with the majority of the random errors distributed between 0.02 and 0.03 m(3)/m(3). The average random error of SMAP is small, while SMOS has relatively large random errors. Simultaneously, SMAP performs better than GLDAS and SMOS in grassland and low vegetation coverage areas. The research results and analysis of this paper are expected to provide some insights for improving the quality of SM products.

AB  - The Florida Keys Mosquito Control District began deploying Biogents (R) BG Sentinel traps to monitor Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) populations in Key West during a small autochthonous dengue outbreak that began in November 2009. This paper provides weekly data for twelve collection points from January 2010 through December 2020. BG Sentinel traps were baited with dry ice and proprietary BG Lure and were set in the afternoon and retrieved the following morning totalling 19 collection hours. Trap collections also included Culex quinquefasciatus and thus data for that species is also included. The collection data could provide insight into dengue transmission in a small sub-tropical US city. (C) 2022 Florida Keys Mosquito Control District. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Responding to anthropocentrism with anthropocentrism: the biopolitics of environmental personhood
T2  - GRIFFITH LAW REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - This article critically analyses the novelty of the legal personhood of nature and, in particular, whether it signals cracks in the anthropocentrism of Western law. Drawing upon the work of Michel Foucault and Roberto Esposito, it contributes to the theorisation of environmental personhood by focusing on the biopolitical nature of personhood itself. It does so by engaging in a critical examination of the attribution of legal personality to the Whanganui River in Aotearoa New Zealand as the most detailed and sophisticated legislative example to date of legally personifying a natural thing. Working through three key conceptual terms in Foucault's and Esposito's work (population, personhood and immunisation), we demonstrate the way in which a biopolitical analysis raises questions about whether ascribing legal personhood to nature addresses anthropocentrism and its effects. We draw attention to the risk of ascribing legal personhood to nature, which is that, instead of signalling an ontological shift in the Western anthropocentric understandings of environment, it operates within and reinforces the dominant legal worldview - unless, that is, the granting of personhood to nature calls into question the dominant paradigm of personhood itself. The article concludes by suggesting alternative ways of developing human understandings of, and relationship with, nature.

TI  - Impact of urbanization on surface energy balance components over metropolitan cities of India during 2000-2018 winter seasons
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study attempts to evaluate the urban energy balance components concerning increasing urbanization and artificial surfaces over Indian metropolitan cities during the 2000-2018 winter seasons by using Landsat 7 and 8 satellite imageries. The results indicate that the estimated ranges of the energy fluxes are in the typical values reported in the earlier literature over global cities. The sensible heat flux (SHF) increased considerably, and the latent heat flux (LHF) slightly decreased during the study period. The mean SHF over the built-up areas (BA) and the dry lands (DL) of Delhi record a maximum increase of 28.2 Wm(-1)and 39.7 Wm(-2) during the study period. The inland cities have high values of SHF over DL than the coastal cities, and the LHF is high over all the land use classes for the west coast cities. The SHF (LHF) shows a positive (negative) correlation with the land surface temperature. The SHF (LHF) is about 19-33% (1.9-15%) of the net radiation flux, and the residual heat flux is about 60 to 80% of the net radiation flux. The present study advocates that the substantial changes of the surface energy balance parameters have a profound influence on the energy exchange mechanism and could affect regional climatic change.

TI  - Source model for buried thrust-dominated earthquakes using partial InSAR displacements: the 2018 Lombok, Indonesia, earthquake sequence
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - A remarkable earthquake sequence struck the island of Lombok in Indonesia during the period from 2018 July 28 to August 19. In this study, we use Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2 radar images to investigate the deformation related to these events. The co-seismic surface deformation was pre-dominated by uplift without surface rupture. It is worth noting that some of the rupture of the Lombok sequence is offshore. For the thrust-dominated island earthquakes, whether the incomplete onshore deformation obtained by InSAR observation can well constrain the geometry of the underground faults is a question worthy of attention. Considering the positional relationship between the deformation and the island, we assumed two types of deformation distribution mode. Through simulation experiments, we found that when the major deformation for the second mode is less than about half, the nonlinear inversion results will be unstable. According to source models of each event, the Lombok sequence may have ruptured the Flores thrust. The peak magnitudes of slip for three events are 1.59, 1.93 and 2.87 m. The large magmatic plumbing systems of Rinjani volcano play a critical role during the cascading fault rupture of the Lombok event. Stress changing map indicates that the earlier events promote the later events. There is an obvious seismic gap in the northern part of the Sumbawa region and this region has the potential to form some moderate earthquakes in the future.

TI  - A phytoplankton bloom with a cyclonic eddy enhanced by the tropical cyclone <i>Phethai</i> in eastern Sir Lanka
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Strong tropical cyclone (TC) Phethai occurred in the Bay of Bengal (BoB) in December 2018. A phytoplankton bloom within the area of 8.5?degrees N-10?degrees N, 81.9?degrees E-83.4?degrees E was studied in eastern Sri Lanka. The dynamic mechanisms of the chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) bloom was investigated with high-resolution satellite remote sensing data, reanalysis data and buoy data. Before the passage of Phethai, there was a weaker cyclonic eddy in eastern Sri Lanka. After the passage of Phethai, the cyclonic eddy vorticity was enhanced to 0.6445 and lasted for five days. With the passage of Phethai, the thermocline deepened to 49.12 m, causing nutrient upwelling into the mixed layer. The Chl-a flux below the thermocline accelerated from December 13 and reached 0.047 mg & BULL; m(-2) & BULL; s(-1) on December 17, when the average Chl-a concentration at the sea surface was 0.6445 mg & BULL; m(-3). This study can help evaluate the ecological impacts of TCs in eastern Sri Lanka. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - A method for estimating spatially continuous soil moisture from the synergistic use of geostationary and polar-orbit satellite data
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is a key variable in the surface energy balance and water cycle, and its spatiotemporal dynamics are of great significance to climate, agriculture and other fields. Optical remote sensing has been widely used to estimate SM with relatively fine spatial resolution. However, optical observations are easily contaminated by clouds, making it difficult to obtain spatially continuous SM over large regions. In the present study, a semimonthly SM dataset over the study area of the entire Inner Mongolia region with nearly full spatial coverage was derived from the synergistic use of China's Feng-Yun (FY) geostationary (FY-4A) and polar-orbit (FY-3D) observations, following a previously developed trapezoid feature space in a pixel-to-pixel manner. A preliminary assessment was conducted to evaluate the performances of the proposed method over two main dominant land cover types (grassland and cropland) in the study region, where the China Meteorological Administration Land Data Assimilation System (CLDAS) and the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) SM products were provided as references. The results indicated that the estimated SM was well correlated to the referenced SM datasets, with a significant correlation coefficient varying from 0.5 to 0.8. Furthermore, for the grassland (cropland), unbiased root mean square errors of approximately 0.062 (0.097) m(3)/m(3) and 0.055 (0.069) m(3)/m(3) can be found when comparing the estimated SM with the CLDAS and the SMAP product, respectively.

TI  - Retrieving soil heavy metals concentrations based on GaoFen-5 hyperspectral satellite image at an opencast coal mine, Inner Mongolia, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil heavy metals pollution has been becoming one of the severely environmental issues globally. Previous studies reported laboratory-measured spectra could be used to infer soil heavy metals concentrations to some extent. However, using field-obtained spectra to estimate soil heavy metals concentrations is still a great challenge due to the low precision and weak efficiency at large scales. The present study collected 110 topsoil samples from an Opencast Coal Mine of Ordos, Inner Mongolia, China. Then, the spectra and soil heavy metals concentrations of samples were measured under laboratory conditions. The direct standardization (DS) algorithm was introduced to calibrate the Gaofen-5 (GF-5) hyperspectral image based on the measured spectra of samples. The spectral reflectance of the GF-5 hyperspectral image was reconstructed using continuous wavelet transform (CWT) at different scales. The characteristic bands of GF-5 for estimating heavy metals concentrations were selected by the Boruta algorithm. Finally, the random forest (RF), the extreme learning machine (ELM), the support vector machine (SVM), and the back-propagation neural network (BPNN) algorithms were used to predict the heavy metals concentrations. Some findings were achieved. First, CWT can effectively eliminate the noise of satellite hyperspectral data. The characteristic bands of Zn (480-677, 827-1029, 1241-1334, 1435-1797, and 1949-2500 nm), Ni (514-630, 835-985, 1258-1325, 1460-1578, and 1949-2319 nm), and Cu (822-831; 1029-1300, 1486-1595, and 1730-2294 nm) can be effectively retrieved via the Boruta algorithm. Second, the estimation accuracy was significantly improved by using the DS algorithm. For zinc (Zn), nickel (Ni), and copper (Cu), the determination coefficients of the validation dataset (R-v(2)) were 0.77 (RF), 0.62 (RF), and 0.56 (ELM), respectively. Third, the distribution trends of heavy metals were almost consistent with the results of actual ground measurements. This paper revealed that the GF-5 can be one of the reliable satellite hyperspectral imagery for mapping soil heavy metals.

TI  - Ambient temperature and Covid-19 transmission: An evidence from a region of Iran based on weather station and satellite data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic is primarily transmitted by direct contact between infected and uninfected people, though, there are still many unknown factors influencing the survival and transmission of the virus. Air temperature is one of the main susceptible factors. This study aimed to explore the impact of air and land surface temperatures on Covid-19 transmission in a region of Iran. Method: Daily Land Surface Temperature (LST) measured by satellite and Air Temperature measured by weather station were used as the predictors of Covid-19 transmission. The data were obtained from February 2020 to April 2021. Spatio-temporal kriging was used in order to predict LST in some days in which no image was recorded by the satellite. The validity of the predicted values was assessed by Bland-Altman technique. The impact of the predictors was analyzed by Distributed Lag Non-linear Model (DLNM). In addition to main effect of temperature, its linear as well as non-linear interaction effect with relative humidity were considered using Generalized Additive Model (GAM) and a bivariate response surface model. Sensitivity analyses were done to select models' parameters, autocorrelation model and function of associations.Results: The dose-response curve revealed that the impact of both predictors was not obvious, though, the risk of transmission tended to be positive due to low values of temperatures. Although the linear interaction effect was not statistically significant, but joint patterns showed that the impact of both LST and AT tended to be different when humidity values were changed.Conclusion: However the findings suggested that both LST and AT were not statistically important predictors, but they tended to predict the Covid-19 transmission in some lags. Because of local based evidence, the wide con-fidence intervals and then non-significant values should be cautiously interpreted.

TI  - Modeling of hydro-oceanographic parameters and its possible impact on coral reef cover in Derawan Island waters, East Kalimantan, Indonesia
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Derawan waters in Indonesia have a high number of coral reefs diversity and ranked second after the Raja Ampat Islands in Papua. Unfortunately, the percentage of coral cover in Derawan Island tends to decrease due to various factors, such as hydro-oceanographic dynamics. This study aims to determine the hydro-oceanographic characteristics and their possible impacts on coral reef cover in Derawan waters using remote sensing analysis, field surveys, GIS modeling, and geostatistical analysis. We modeled the hydro-oceanographic parameters, i.e., SST, salinity, sea surface currents, and bathymetry, using the Kriging method in GIS software. We obtained benthic habitats through Sentinel-2 image processing, validated with video-recorded line transects to get the percentage of coral reef cover, coral mortality index, and spatial distribution of corals. The results showed that we could use the Kriging method to produce an accurate and valid model of hydro-oceanographic parameters in Derawan waters. Derawan waters have a wide range of coral reef coverage, with the highest in the West (74.55 percent) and the lowest in the East (28.60 percent). Furthermore, the highest and lowest coral mortality indexes are found in the South and West, respectively. The hydro-oceanographic parameters in Derawan waters are ideal for coral survival, and only salinity, which is extremely good for coral growth, according to Nybakken's theory. A more detailed study is needed to gain a complete description of the dynamics of hydro-oceanography and coral reef ecosystems in Derawan waters so that policymakers can use them to mitigate and conserve marine ecosystems.

TI  - HUMANITY MAY TRIUMPH OVER HEAVEN. WANG TINGXIANG'S NATURAL PHILOSOPHY IN ITS HISTORICAL CONTEXT
T2  - MING STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper examines Wang Tingxiang's natural philosophy within its historical context. Wang left numerous accounts on natural phenomena in which he sought to discover the causes or hidden mechanisms of the processes he uncovered. To this end, he first had to radically deconstruct the so-called correlative thinking that perceives a fundamental connection between humanity and the natural world. Wang deemed this worldview a critical blockage of his scholarly aim and instead articulated his empirical stance as an alternative pathway. In this sense, he emphasized the sensory data gathered from direct observations as the only legitimate source of natural knowledge. With such data, aided by the human faculty of thinking, one could eventually uncover the principles that underpin natural phenomena.Further, it is crucial to understand why and in what context Wang proposed this empirical stance. To answer this question, I highlight the environmental crisis associated with the Little Ice Age that resulted in numerous natural disasters during Wang's time. In order then to overcome such disasters, Wang emphasized the accurate understanding of natural phenomena so that people could predict future outbreaks of such disasters, thereby preventing the (re)occurrence of potential harms. Although Wang's worldview enjoyed little to no popularity in his time, a similar empirical strand re-emerged and garnered greater attention as the environmental crisis grew more severe during the seventeenth century.

TI  - Assessment of Sentinel-2 to monitor highly dynamic small water bodies: The case of Louro lagoon (Galicia, NW Spain)
T2  - OCEANOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal lagoons have been providing ecological, economic and cultural benefits for many centuries. Despite their importance, the monitoring of coastal lagoons poses numerous challenges related to their complex environmental processes, their large variability in size and their remote location, inhibiting effective management programmes. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of Sentinel-2 satellites to map highly dynamic morphological and hydrological changes in the Louro lagoon, a small choked lagoon located on the Galician coast (NW Spain). For this purpose, a simple methodology using the Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI) has been evaluated, which allows to monitor the sand barrier changes and the inlet formation. The results show that the sand barrier's opening and closing might take only a very short period, and the recovery of the lagoon to its full water level can happen in less than a month. Sentinel-2 images also reveal drastic changes in the water level once the sand barrier is broken. A water surface area of 0.24 km(2) was estimated on 04/11/2019, while this surface was reduced to 0.10 km(2) on 04/12/2019. Monitoring these changes is critical to understand the different processes ongoing in these valuable environments and making informed decisions for their management and protection.

TI  - Implementation of species distribution models in Google Earth Engine
T2  - DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a free Web-based spatial analysis platform that requires only a web browser and an Internet connection to programmatically access and analyse data from its multi-petabyte catalog of regularly updated satellite imagery (e.g. MODIS, Landsat, Sentinel) and other geospatial datasets. The high computing capacity of GEE can make computationally demanding analyses more accessible to researchers and practitioners, especially those with limited access to advanced computational resources. Here, we present a workflow in GEE to fit species distribution models, offering direct access to a multi-petabyte catalog of raster products to obtain estimates of habitat suitability.Innovation: We implemented a workflow for species distribution modelling in GEE that includes importing species occurrence data into the GEE platform, selecting and preparing predictor variables, and performing model fitting with spatial or temporal split-block cross-validation techniques. We present three case studies that demonstrate: (i) a baseline SDM workflow that produces informative model predictions, (ii) a workflow that accounts for temporal variability in predictor variables to study changes in habitat suitability over time and (iii) a complex and computationally demanding analysis incorporating thousands of satellite images for modelling habitat suitability at high spatial resolution.Main Conclusions: Our SDM workflow allows users to benefit from the high speed and performance of GEE without the need for significant computing infrastructure. This workflow may be especially beneficial to researchers in countries where computing power is limited, as SDMs frequently require the download, storage and processing of large raster datasets. We also discuss key limitations of implementing SDMs in GEE, such as user memory limits and the lack of high-level functions. We include a step-by-step guide for the general model workflow and for each of the case studies presented to facilitate its implementation.

TI  - Ground-Truthing Forest Change Detection Algorithms in Working Forests of the US Northeast
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The need for reliable landscape-scale monitoring of forest disturbance has grown with increased policy and regulatory attention to promoting the climate benefits of forests. Change detection algorithms based on satellite imagery can address this need but are largely untested for the forest types and disturbance regimes of the US Northeast, including management practices common in northern hardwoods and mixed hardwood-conifer forests. This study ground-truthed the "off-the-shelf" outputs of three satellite-based change detection algorithms using detailed harvest records and maps covering 43,000 ha of working forests in northeastern New York. Study Implications: Algorithms performed best in detecting clearcuts, but performed much worse and poorly overall in detecting the partial harvest prescriptions (e.g., shelterwoods, thinnings) that were far more common in our ground-truthing data (and for this region). Among the algorithms tested, Landtrendr was consistently superior at both detecting partial harvests and estimating harvest intensity (volume removals), but there still remained substantial room for improvement. Overall, we suggest that these algorithms need further training and tuning to be reliably used for accurate monitoring of harvest-related activities in working forests of the US Northeast.

TI  - Evaluation of Six Satellite-Based Soil Moisture Products Based on <i>in situ</i> Measurements in Hunan Province, Central China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term near-surface soil moisture (SM) data can be obtained on a regional scale through microwave remote sensing. Therefore, to quantitatively analyze the accuracy of multisource remote sensing-based observation products, improve the retrieval algorithm, and effectively use in terminal environments, a standardized comprehensive evaluation is imperative. The SM data obtained by the China Meteorological Administration and Ministry of Water Resources were used as reference data to verify the performance of six passive microwave remote sensing-based SM products from the SMOS, SMAP, GCOM-W, FY-3B, and FY-3C satellites in Hunan province, China. These data were also used to analyze the effects of topographical, land cover, and meteorological factors on SM retrieval accuracy. Results show that SMAP shows the best overall performance in Hunan province; furthermore, it exhibits stable accuracy and is not easily affected by environmental factors. The FY series of satellite products shows the worst performance, and some grid remote sensing data are negatively correlated with the ground measurement data. AMSR2 possesses the largest amount of data and the largest deviation, and only this product exhibits significant differences with the fluctuation trend of the measured SM and precipitation. Passive microwave detection technology presents the best performance in the central part of Hunan province and the largest bias in the Dongting Lake area. SMOS-L3 and SMOS-IC, two products of the same satellite, show the lowest bias but present differences in the SM fluctuation range, orbital accuracy, as well as dry or wet bias. Furthermore, FY-3B and FY-3C, two satellites belonging to the same series, exhibit excellent consistency in performance. The evaluation results and accuracy variation between products as well as other factors identified in the study provide a baseline reference for improving the retrieval algorithm. This study provides a quantitative basis for developing improved applications of passive microwave SM products.

TI  - Limited reciprocal surrogacy of bird and habitat diversity and inconsistencies in their representation in Romanian protected areas
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Because it is impossible to comprehensively characterize biodiversity at all levels of organization, conservation prioritization efforts need to rely on surrogates. As species distribution maps of relished groups as well as high-resolution remotely sensed data increasingly become available, both types of surrogates are commonly used. A good surrogate should represent as much of biodiversity as possible, but it often remains unclear to what extent this is the case. Here, we aimed to address this question by assessing how well bird species and habitat diversity represent one another. We conducted our study in Romania, a species-rich country with high landscape heterogeneity where bird species distribution data have only recently started to become available. First, we prioritized areas for conservation based on either 137 breeding bird species or 36 habitat classes, and then evaluated their reciprocal surrogacy performance. Second, we examined how well these features are represented in already existing protected areas. Finally, we identified target regions of high conservation value for the potential expansion of the current network of reserves (as planned under the new EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030). We found a limited reciprocal surrogacy performance, with bird species performing slightly better as a conservation surrogate for habitat diversity than vice versa. We could also show that areas with a high conservation value based on habitat diversity were represented better in already existing protected areas than areas based on bird species, which varied considerably between species. Our results highlight that taxonomic and environmental (i.e., habitat types) data may perform rather poorly as reciprocal surrogates, and multiple sources of data are required for a full evaluation of protected areas expansion.

TI  - Forest cover loss in the Nevado de Toluca volcano protected area (Mexico) after the change to a less restrictive category in 2013
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2013, the protection status of the Nevado de Toluca Volcano was changed from National Park to a less restrictive category. Much controversy has arisen surrounding this decision as the new category allows forest harvesting practices in most of the natural protected area. We assessed the forest cover loss in the Nevado de Toluca protected area and a 20 km buffer zone around it, before and after the change in protection status, and we established a map of forest types in view of assessing biodiversity vulnerability to the protection change in the forest harvesting areas. The forest type classification was carried out applying a Random Forest algorithm to Sentinel-2 imagery. The forest cover loss was assessed using the Landsat-based Global Forest Watch product during the period 2001-2019. Forest cover loss increased after the change of the Nevado de Toluca protection status; 39.7 hectares/year (+/- 16.7 ha/year) between 2001 and 2013 versus 106.0 hectares/year (+/- 40.2 ha/year) between 2014 and 2019. Clear-cut deforestation occurred in 49.6 hectares during year 2018. According to our forest map, 7171 ha (54.8%) of the Abies religiosa forest and 6511 ha (32.5%) of the pine forests of the Nevado de Toluca protected area are inside the forest harvesting zonation. Also, forest cover loss around the natural protected area has increased, especially in 2018, indicating that allowing forest harvesting practices in the natural protected area has not reduced the pressure in the surrounding forests either. We ponder the consequences of the category change and give some suggestions for the future of the forests in the Nevado de Toluca protected area.

TI  - Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Weeds and Crops Discrimination From UAS Imagery
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Weeds are among the significant factors that could harm crop yield by invading crops and smother pastures, and significantly decrease the quality of the harvested crops. Herbicides are widely used in agriculture to control weeds; however, excessive use of herbicides in agriculture can lead to environmental pollution as well as yield reduction. Accurate mapping of crops/weeds is essential to determine weeds' location and locally treat those areas. Increasing demand for flexible, accurate and lower cost precision agriculture technology has resulted in advancements in UAS-based remote sensing data collection and methods. Deep learning methods have been successfully employed for UAS data processing and mapping tasks in different domains. This research investigate, compares and evaluates the performance of deep learning methods for crop/weed discrimination on two open-source and published benchmark datasets captured by different UASs (field robot and UAV) and labeled by experts. We specifically investigate the following architectures: 1) U-Net Model 2) SegNet 3) FCN (FCN-32s, FCN-16s, FCN-8s) 4) DepLabV3+. The deep learning models were fine-tuned to classify the UAS datasets into three classes (background, crops, and weeds). The classification accuracy achieved by U-Net is 77.9% higher than 62.6% of SegNet, 68.4% of FCN-32s, 77.2% of FCN-16s, and slightly lower than 81.1% of FCN-8s, and 84.3% of DepLab v3+. Experimental results showed that the ResNet-18 based segmentation model such as DepLab v3+ could precisely extract weeds compared to other classifiers.

TI  - Safety at waste and recycling industry: Detection and mitigation of waste fire accidents
T2  - WASTE MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, NASA's VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) fire hotspots and data of the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB), collected between 2012 and 2018, was integrated to characterize waste fire incidents that were detected by VIIRS and reported to MSB (DaR), detected by VIIRS but not reported to MSB (DbNR) and that are reported to MSB but not detected by VIIRS (RbND). Results show that the average number of open waste fire incidents per million capita per year (AFIPMC) in Sweden, for the period 2012-2018, ranges from 2.4 to 4.7. Although a weak correlation exists (r = 0.44, P = 0.1563, one tailed) between years and number of fire incidents (MSB + VIIRS fires), a continuous increase in number of fire incidents was recorded between 2014 and 2018. It is concluded that the use of satellite data of fire anomalies, in-combination with the use of incident reports, will help in formalizing more reliable and comprehensive waste fire statistics. Another focus area of the article is to consolidate the recommendations and routines for safe storage of waste and biofuels and to present the lessons that can be learnt from past fire incidents. The article also discusses the technical, political, economic, social, and practical aspects of waste fires and provide a baseline for future research and experimentation.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variations in aerosol optical depth and associated risks for populations in the arid region of Central Asia
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - With the progress of urbanization, atmospheric pollution and physical health issues caused by the increase of aerosol optical depth (AOD) become more and more prominent. Hence, population exposure risk to AOD becomes a research hotspot. The arid Central Asia (ACA) has a generally high AOD and is a major source area for dust aerosols in the world. Only few studies have discussed population exposure risk to AOD in ACA. Based on multisource remote sensing data, and used population exposure risk model, this study evaluated population exposure risk to AOD in six ecological zones (Northern steppe region of ACA (NSCA), Aral Sea desert area (ASDA), Tianshan Mountains (TSMT), Junggar Basin desert area (JBDA), Tarim Basin desert area (TBDA) and Hexi corridor desert area (HCDA)). Generally, AOD in ACA was kept increasing from 2000 to 2015, and it increased mostly in HCDA and areas near the Aral Sea (p < 0.001). With respect to seasonal variations, the maximum AOD was observed in spring and autumn, and the minimum was in winter. Considering land use changes, AOD was mainly manifested by the reduction of water bodies and expansion of construction lands. This was the mostly significant in NSCA and ASDA (p < 0.01). The population exposure risk to AOD in ACA was increasing continuously from 2000 to 2015, and high-value regions (>9) concentrated in oases, specifically, in the Aral Sea basin and Tarim River basin.The Aral Sea basin became the major AOD source region in ACA due to the shrinking water area after unreasonable development and utilization of water resources. These further increase population exposure risk to AOD in the Aral Sea area. Hence, ecological restoration in terminal lakes of ACA will become the key to lower population exposure risk to AOD practically. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Before European contact, Maori disposed of the dead in environmentally sustainable ways. Revitalizing pre-colonial burial practices presents an opportunity for Maori to evaluate current practices and reconnect with their ancient tribal customs and practices. The research question asks: What is the decolonizing potential of urupa tautaiao (natural burials)? Paradoxically, environmentally unsustainable modern tangihanga (funerals) retain the ethos of customary funerary traditions. Urupa tautaiao presents an opportunity for iwi (tribes) to retain cultural integrity in the death space, without compromising Papatuanuku (earthmother). Methodologically, a Maori worldview frames an action research mindset. The study captures a tribal community's exploratory journey into urupa tautaiao.

TI  - The analysis of pre-monsoon dust storm over Delhi using ground-based observations
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Three major sequential widespread dust events were experienced in the northern parts of India in May 2018. A significant impact of these pre-monsoon dust storms on the aerosol characteristics over the Indian National capital region (NCR) has been studied using remotely sensed ceilometer and ground-based measurements at Indira Gandhi International airport, New Delhi, India. The results show that after each dust activity, the significant inclusion of dust aerosols loaded in the free troposphere. Consequently, the direct impact on the lower atmospheric parameters like increase in daily average temperature (by 4-5 K), stepped up (stepped down) diurnal cycles of longwave fluxes (shortwave fluxes), has been recorded within 15 days of dust span. Mainly, the adverse meteorological and radiation features noticed before the first dust storm (DS1), which pinpoints the sudden dust intrusion over NCR, Delhi. However, this dust storm has extensively impacted on the atmospheric vertical dust loading, surface boundary layer mechanisms, and socioeconomic way. Therefore, the detailed analysis of vertical dust distribution and its interaction with mid-tropospheric processes has been carried by using the vertical normalized attenuated backscatter coefficients accompanying the radiosonde observation. The aloft floating dust layer up to 3-4 km has been noticed even after shallow rainfall and persisted at almost the same height for the next 34 h due to low-level clouds. Meanwhile, the sub-dust layer below 1 km is formed due to local activity, which also sustains for a long time.

TI  - Depicting ethical dilemma in Islamic financial institutions; addressing the gender heterogeneity
T2  - EURASIAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Though the lex loci applicable to Islamic financial institutions (IFIs) are derived from Shariah that embeds ethical and moral values, IFIs still face ethical dilemma. Since the leadership and managerial roles are played by both genders, it is imperative to understand the implication of their contribution in this. As such, the objective of this paper is to examine the influence of gender using the aspects of al-Ghazali's ethical philosophy in explaining the formation of ethical and unethical behavior within the purview of the Islamic finance industry of Malaysia, where both genders play a pivotal role in the industry. A total of 418 samples were collected from IFIs in Malaysia using a purposive sampling technique, and the empirical analysis was conducted with the measures of model fit and bootstrapping technique using Partial least square Structural equation modeling and Multi-group analysis. The empirical findings indicate the dedicated use of intellect in making decisions related to ethical issues where desires and emotions tend to overwhelm reason and human choices. While divine knowledge is found ineffective guidance of the intellect, the element of satanic force is found to significantly impacting decision-making. As the lack of religious consciousness is evident among respondents, higher exposure to operational risk is expected. These findings were found identical among both genders under study. Findings suggest respective authorities of Islamic financial institutions to intensify the capacity-building programs on the foundation of faith which includes Islamic thought and worldview, to enhance the corporate ethical decision-making irrespective of gender.

T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was aimed to explore the effect of climatic conditions on changes in surface biophysical properties driven by urban growth using remote sensing and climatic data. For this purpose, Landsat 5 and 8 multi-time satellite images of Tabriz, Rasht, Yazd and Mashhad metropolises have been used. Firstly, a land use/cover map was prepared for the study area using the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. In the secondly, surface biophysical properties including land surface temperature (LST) data, and brightness, greenness, and wetness properties were extracted using single channel algorithm and tasseled-cap band transformation, respectively. Then, their spatial and temporal variations across the study area were investigated. In the third step, the effect of climatic conditions on the spatial-temporal Changes in surface biophysical properties driven by urban physical expansion were investigated. The results showed the area of built-up area in Mashhad, Rasht, Tabriz, and Yazd has increased by 97, 148, 106 and 145 % from 1990 to 2019. The difference in surface biophysical properties inside and outside the cities was higher in cities with wet climates (e.g. Rasht) than cities with dry and hot climates (e.g. Yazd). The effect of urban physical expansion on temporal changes in surface biophysical properties was more pronounced in metropolises with humid climates than those in arid climates. According to our findings, long-term spatial and temporal analysis can help decision-makers to better plan for the reduction and control of LST changes according to the dominant climatic conditions of different metropolises.

TI  - Trends in Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsies in Patients With Inflammatory Breast Cancer in the US
T2  - JAMA NETWORK OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - IMPORTANCE The standard of care for inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is neoadjuvant chemotherapy, total mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), and postmastectomy radiation therapy. Existing studies suggest that sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) may not be reliable in IBC. The use and frequency of SLNB in women with IBC is not well characterized.OBJECTIVE To determine the frequency and temporal trend of SLNB in patients with IBC.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective cohort study used the National Cancer Database, a nationwide hospital-based cancer registry, and included women who were diagnosed with nonmetastatic IBC and underwent axillary surgery from 2012 to 2017. Data were analyzed from January 2021to May 2021.EXPOSURES Any SLNB, induding SLNB alone and SLNB followed by ALND, and ALND alone.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Scatterplot fit with a linear regression model were used to evaluate the yearly increase of any SLNB use. Multivariable logistic regression models to evaluate the association of study variables with the outcome of any SLNB.RESULTS This study included a total of 1096 women (mean [SD] age, 56.1 [12.9] years) who were 18 years or older with nonmetastatic IBC diagnosed between 2012 and 2017. Of the 186 of 1096 women (17%) who received any SLNB, 137 (73.7%) were White individuals; and of the 910 of 1096 women (83%) who received an ALND only, 676 (74.3%) were White individuals. Among women undergoing any SLNB, 119 of 186 (64%) did not undergo a completion ALND. There was a statistically significant increasing trend in the use of SLNB from 2012 to 2017 (22 of 205 patients [11%] vs 32 of 148 patients [22%]; P = .004). In multivariable analysis, the use of SLNB was associated with diagnosis year (2017 vs 2012; odds ratio [OR], 2.26; 95% CI, 1.26-4.20), clinical nodal status (cN3 vs 0; OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.22-0.67), and receipt of reconstructive surgery (OR, 1.80; 95% Cl, 1.09-2.96).CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The findings of this cohort study suggest that there is frequent and increasing use of SLNB in patients with IBC that is not evidence-based or supported by current treatment guidelines.

TI  - Estimating the hazard of tree fall along railway lines: a new GIS tool
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Trees along railway networks represent a high risk due to their potential to fall during extreme weather events. The identification of locations along railway tracks with highest tree fall hazard is an important part of a proactive natural hazard management. A new user-friendly GIS tool (as ArcGIS toolbox) was developed that provides the opportunity to detect individual trees along railway lines and to estimate the hazard of tree fall. By an automated analysis of open source digital remote sensing data and additional open source geodata, the tool allows for an up-to-date and area-wide monitoring of trees on railway lines and other infrastructural elements. Important parameters describing meteorological conditions, site conditions, topographic conditions and tree characteristics are implemented. The tool was successfully tested and applied to two federal states in Germany (Northrhine-Westphalia and Thuringia). Due to the automatization of most of the processes, it is possible to extend the application to larger areas with low effort, i.e., to the Germany-wide rail network or to other countries. It is also possible to perform the analysis for other modes of transport. In the context of natural hazard management, the tool can be applied in prevention and can usefully support already existing vegetation management concepts.

TI  - Flood damage assessment with Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data after Sardoba dam break with GLCM features and Random Forest method
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate mapping and monitoring of flooded areas are immensely required for disaster management purposes, such as for damage assessment and mitigation. In this study, the flood damage mapping performances of two satellite Earth Observation sensors, i.e., European Space Agency's Sentinel-1 (S1) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 (S2) multispectral optical instruments, were evaluated using the Random Forest (RF) supervised classification method and various feature types. The study area was Sardoba Reservoir (Uzbekistan) and its surroundings, in which a disastrous dam failure occurred on May 1, 2020. After the failure of a part of the earthfill dam, a large region with settlements and agricultural areas in Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan was flooded. S1 and S2 cloudless data with a short temporal interval acquired soon after the event were available for the area. Four different data availability scenarios, such as (i) only S1 pre-and post-flood data; (ii) only S2 pre-and post flood data; (iii) S1 pre-and post-flood and S2 pre-flood data; and (iv) S1 and S2 pre-and post-flood data were evaluated in terms of classification accuracy. In addition to the polarization information of S1 and the intensity values of S2 bands, feature maps produced from these datasets, such as vegetation and water indices, textural information obtained from gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), and the principal component analysis (PCA) bands were employed in the RF method. The results show that the fusion of S1 and S2 data exhibit very high classification accuracy for the flooded areas and can separate the inundated vegetation as well. The use of S2 pre event data together with the S1 pre-and post-event data is recommended for obtaining high accuracy even when post-event optical data is not available. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Evaluating the impact of land use and land cover change on unprotected wetland ecosystems in the arid-tropical areas of South Africa using the Landsat dataset and support vector machine
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The study explored the impact of Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) change dynamics in relation to the condition and status of an unprotected wetland located in the arid-tropical parts of the Limpopo Province, South Africa. The long-term Landsat archival data series was used to map and quantify the impacts of LULC change on the wetland over a period of 36 years (1983-2019). A multi-source satellite image analysis was performed, using the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm and advanced spatially- explicit geographic information system tools. Landsat data series covering the entire study area was used to assess, map and monitor LULC change that occurred over-time. Post-classification maps for the Maungani wetland area were analysed to provide a quantitative assessment and a detailed overview of the rate of change. The generated wetland detection maps for four temporal phases (i.e., 1983-1992, 1992-2001, 2002-2010) were analysed. This study found that the spatial extent of the wetland area declined severely during the period under study with 728 300 ha. The findings of this work provide critical insights and baseline information about the state of unprotected wetlands in the rural parts. This information is useful for the development of tailor-made wetland management strategies and a possible rehabilitation framework for unprotected wetland ecosystems.

TI  - Tropical peat subsidence rates are related to decadal LULC changes: Insights from InSAR analysis
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Peatlands in Indonesia are subject to subsidence in recent years, resulting in significant soil organic carbon loss. Their degradation is responsible for several environmental issues; however, understanding the causes of peatland subsidence is of prime concern for implementing mitigation measures. Here, we employed time-series Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) using ALOS PALSAR-2 images to assess the relationship between subsidence rates and land use/land cover (LULC) change (including drainage periods) derived from decadal Landsat data (1972-2019). Overall, the study area subsided with a mean rate of -2.646 +/- 1.839 cm/year in 2018-2019. The subsidence rates slowed over time, with significant subsidence decreases in peatlands after being drained for 9 years. We found that the long-time persistence of vegetated areas leads to subsidence deceleration. The relatively lower subsidence rates are in areas that changed to rubber/mixed plantations. Further, the potential of subsidence prediction was assessed using Random Forest (RF) regression based on LULC change, distance from peat edge, and elevation. With an R-2 of 0.532 (RMSE = 0.594 cm/year), this machine learning method potentially enlarges the spatial coverage of InSAR method for the higher frequency SAR data (such as Sentinel-1) that mainly have limited coverage due to decorrelation in vegetated areas. According to feature importance in the RF model, the contribution of LULC change (including drainage period) to the subsidence model is comparable with distance from peat edge and elevation. Other uncertainties are from unexplained factors related to drainage and peat condition, which need to be accounted for as well. This work shows the significance of decadal LULC change analysis to supplement InSAR measurement in tropical peatland subsidence monitoring programs.

TI  - A World without Satellite Data as a Result of a Global Cyber-Attack
T2  - SPACE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The probability that all satellites in space fail simultaneously is by experts qualified as highly improbable but not excluded. In literature, we find two major potential risks that can cause this, a mega solar storm (so-called Carrington Effect) or a space debris chain reaction (called the Kessler effect). However, a survey with experts described in detail in this article points out an equally harmful and even more presently plausible scenario, namely cyber-attacks.Irrespective of the probability, it deserves an attempt to imagine the economic major damage that such total satellite collapse would represent for society. It will clearly illustrate our dependency on satellite data and areas that may be less obvious at first sight. Therefore, the consequences of such a scenario, even if there is a low probability, are explored under this assumption.Cyber-attacks on satellites have already taken place on several occasions, from which a few past and recent ones are reported in this article. In particular, satellite operators and military organizations are not frequently reporting such attacks publicly given the loss of confidence by the clients or the general public respectively. There seems to be no solution to the existing problem of pinpointing the source of an invisible and non-observable yet successful attack. We can say without hesitation that, with the investments in cyberwarfare and improved techniques, such threats will become more frequent, and unfortunately, more effective soon.This article will discuss potential technical countermeasures such as Rapid Response programs, as well as policy-oriented measures. In the latter, the effectiveness of agreements in this field is questionable. Therefore, emphasis will be put on Transparency and Confidence Building Measures (TCBM).(c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Rapid flash flood calamity in Chamoli, Uttarakhand region during Feb 2021: an analysis based on satellite data
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study investigates the accelerating factors for extreme flash flood at Chamoli district of Uttarakhand on 7 February 2021. The Sentinel-2A and 2B satellite data have been used to depict changes in pre-flood (16th of January) i.e., 5 years of 2016 to 2021 to post-flood (10 February, 2021) situation over the study domain. Vegetation and snow-cover from 2016 to 2021 has been obtained using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) classification over study area. Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) is used to extract the pre and post-flood water pixels for flood inundation mapping. The Cartosat-1 digital elevation model (DEM) product is used for drainage pattern and stream order mapping. Correlation between the meteorological parameters such as snowfall, wind speed and wind direction of Nanda Gunti peak during the time of flood with the flood event is analysed. The overall results indicate heavy snowfall (4.22 mm/day) over Nanda Gunti hills followed by high wind speed (23 km/hr.) that might have led to initiation of avalanche/landslide, giving rise to massive flash flood and eroded approximately 0.0263 km(3) volume of landmass along with snow cover. Further, the 5 years NDVI analysis shows decrease in vegetation near Rishiganga and Alaknanda, a higher order river streams, is also crucial factor for flood intensification that caused massive destruction within the study area. The work highlights the importance of mapping of intense events and underline factors to reduce the impact and losses in case of future events.

TI  - An eco-friendly pulsed magnetic field treatment on cemented carbide (WC-12Co) for enhanced milling performance
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - To explore an eco-friendly way to improve the milling performance and obtain high-quality milling tools, pulsed magnetic field treatment is applied to the cemented carbide (WC-12Co) milling tools, which is a clean, rapid, and sustainable method. The effect of pulsed magnetic field treatment on the milling performance of cemented carbide tools was investigated. To evaluate the effect of this treatment technique, the milling forces, tool wear, and surface roughness were compared with those of untreated tools using polar coordinate, short-time Fourier transform, standard deviation. The results reveal that pulsed magnetic field treatment can reduce milling force (Fx is reduced by 15.90%, Fy is reduced by 13.29%, Fz is reduced by 47.6%), delay tool wear, and improve machined surface quality (surface roughness is decreased by 63.7%). Enhanced performance comes from the reduction of adhesive wear and the attraction of fine wear debris by the treated tool, especially, the remanence to realize the transition from two-body friction to three-body friction. In addition, the increased hardness and improved heat dissipation caused by pulsed magnetic field treatment further optimize the milling performance of the treated tool.

TI  - Mapping causal agents of disturbance in boreal and arctic ecosystems of North America using time series of Landsat data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The arctic and boreal biomes are changing as temperatures increase, including changes in the type, frequency, intensity, and seasonality of disturbances. However, our understanding of the frequency, extent, and causes of disturbance events remains incomplete. Disturbances such as fire, forest harvest, drought, wind, flooding, and insects and pathogens occur at different frequencies and severities, posing challenges to characterize and assess them under a single framework. We used the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) algorithm on all available Landsat observations from 1984 to 2014 to detect land cover and land condition change. We mapped the following causes of disturbances annually across the study domain of NASA's Arctic Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE): fire, logging, and pest damage. Differences between Landsat Tasseled Cap (TC) values pre- and post-disturbance were used in a random forest classifier to map causal agents. For forested ecosystems, we mapped causal agents including fire, insect, and logging. In areas that were not forest before disturbance, only the fire class was mapped. The result shows that multidimensional spectral-temporal change information is useful for mapping the causes of disturbance in arctic and boreal biomes. We employed two rounds of post-processing and used the information obtained from the comparison between the map and reference data to improve the final map. The user's and producer's accuracies of an aggregated disturbance map were 94.6% (+/- 2.37%) and 89.3% (+/- 21.78%) (95% confidence intervals in parenthesis). When evaluating the causal agents, insect damage was found the most challenging to map and validate. We estimated that 10.8% of the ABoVE core domain was disturbed between 1987 and 2012, with a margin of error of 0.5% at the 95% confidence level. Rates of disturbance due to logging remained constant over time, while fires were more episodic, and insect damage was highest between 2005 and 2010. Overall, fires affected 8.8% of the study area, while logging was 1.4% and insect damage 0.6%. Our maps indicate that pest damage became a significant issue after 2000, but it was more severe for forest ecosystems in Western Canada than in Alaska.

TI  - Combining GOES-R and ECOSTRESS land surface temperature data to investigate diurnal variations of surface urban heat island
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The surface urban heat island (SUHI) phenomenon is characterized by both high spatial and temporal variability, while its diurnal (i.e., diel) variations have rarely been investigated because traditional satellites and sensors flying on polar orbits (e.g., Landsat, MODIS) have no diurnal sampling capability. Here we combined land surface temperature (LST) data from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES-R) and the Ecosystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) to explore the diurnal variations of SUHI and thermal differentiation among various land covers over the Boston Metropolitan Area. With the combined use of the LST data from GOES-R and ECOSTRESS, we took advantage of the strengths of both GOES-R (i.e., high frequency in each day and night) and ECOSTRESS (i.e., much finer spatial resolution). The SUHI intensity of the urban-core and suburban areas both exhibited clear diurnal patterns for different seasons: a continuous increase in the SUHI intensity from sunrise to noon and a decrease thereafter to sunset, followed by a relatively low and constant intensity during nighttime. The LST contrasts among different land cover types were clearly larger in the daytime than at nighttime and peaked around midday. At noon in summer, the LST of 'Developed, High Intensity' was 2.6 degrees C higher than that of 'Developed, Medium Intensity', and about 4.6 degrees C higher than that of "Developed, Open Space" and "Developed, Low Intensity". Controlling the percent impervious surface in construction land at a relatively low level (e.g., below similar to 49%) could effectively alleviate the impacts of SUHI. Compared with GOES-R data, ECOSTRESS LST is suitable for monitoring the diurnal variations of intracity thermal environment at the subdistrict (or neighborhood) scale. Our study highlights the value of the combined use of geostationary satellite and ECOSTRESS LST in exploring the diurnal cycling of the SUHI, and can help inform urban planning and land-based climate mitigation policies in the context of climate change.

T2  - FUTURE ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Aims: To develop a model based on breast MRI to stratify axillary lymph node metastasis (ALNM) in breast cancer. Patients & methods: A total of 134 eligible patients were used to build a predicting model, which was validated with an independent group of 57 patients and evaluated for accuracy and sensitivity. Results: A model based on breast MRI was developed and yielded total accuracy of 82.5% and sensitivities of 94.3, 64.3 and 62.5% to predict patients with no, low and heavy ALNM burden, respectively, in the validation group. Conclusion: A noninvasive model based on breast MRI was developed to preoperatively stratify ALNM in breast cancer; its performance needs to be validated and improved in future research.Plain language summary Assessment of axillary lymph node metastasis burden before surgery in breast cancer patients is warranted for axillary management. This study tried to develop a simple model based on breast MRI to differentiate patients with no, low or heavy axillary metastasis burden. By providing the probability of different axillary metastasis burdens, this model would help patients and clinicians to make more rational decisions when choosing to omit intervention, undergo sentinel lymph node biopsy or axillary lymph node dissection for axilla management.

TI  - Combining satellite geophysical data with continuous on-site measurements for monitoring the dynamic parameters of civil structures
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - One key issue in the Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) of buildings is the influence of the soil on the dynamics of the system. The lack of accurate information on soil-structure interaction represents a source of significant uncertainty and generates difficulties in assessing the state of structural health. In this respect, satellite data could represent a valuable tool for soil knowledge. This paper presents the first study of satellite data coming from the environmental Copernicus program of the European Space Agency (ESA) for the alternative application in the field of SHM. In particular, Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Soil Water Index (SWI) data are elected to study surface temperature and moisture condition of the soil. Once examined and processed, these records have been statistically analyzed, crossed with on-site experimental quantities (natural frequencies and environmental variations), and given as input to a Finite Element (FE) model. The final goal is to understand the actual structural behavior, but also to monitor the evolution of the dynamic parameters for the purposes of structural and seismic monitoring. The largest oval masonry dome in the world was chosen as a prominent case study to demonstrate this novel approach to SHM.

AB  - Objective: To analyze the epidemiological characteristics of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) among people ≥6 years old in Beijing from 2011 to 2020. Methods: The incidence data of HFMD cases from 2011 to 2020 were collected from the National Notifiable Infectious Disease Reporting System of China Information for Disease Control and Prevention and the etiological surveillance of HFMD in 29 sentinel hospitals from 16 districts of Beijing. Descriptive epidemiological methods were used to analyze the distributions, pathogen constituents, and changes of HFMD cases in Beijing people ≥6 years old. Results: From 2011 to 2020, a total of 38 183 cases of HFMD were reported among people ≥6 years old in Beijing, of which 46 (0.12%) cases were severe. The average annual reported incidence was 19.04/100 000. The ratio of males to females were 1.37∶1(22 064∶16 119). The proportion of HFMD in people ≥6 years old increased from 7.56%(2 606/34 488) in 2011 to 24.54% (546/2 225) in 2020. The average incidence of HFMD was higher in Shunyi district, Yanqing district, and Tongzhou district than in other districts in Beijing. The positive rate of enterovirus in sentinel surveillance was 66.78% (1 976/2 959), the proportion of enterovirus group A 71 (EV-A71) was 45.29% (101/223) in 2014, no EV-A71 positive was detected in 2020, and the proportion of Coxsackievirus A 6 (CV-A6) increased from 15.11% (34/225) in 2016 to 81.08% (60/74) in 2020. Conclusions: From 2011 to 2020, the proportion of cases with HFMD in people ≥6 years old in Beijing increased yearly, and the proportion of EV-A71 positive patients decreased basically. Since 2016, CV-A6 has gradually become the dominant pathogen. More attention should be paid to the epidemic situation and dynamic pathogen changes of hand foot mouth disease in people ≥6 years old.

TI  - Ternary strategy enabling high-efficiency rigid and flexible organic solar cells with reduced non-radiative voltage loss
T2  - ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The ternary strategy has been identified as a feasible and effective way to obtain high-efficiency organic solar cells (OSCs). However, for most ternary OSCs, the voltage loss (V-loss) lies between those of the two binary devices, which inevitably limits the further efficiency improvements. Herein, a non-fullerene acceptor ZY-4Cl, possessing complementary absorption spectra and forming a cascade LUMO energy level alignment with the PM6:BTP-eC9 blend, was introduced as a third component to fabricate ternary OSCs. Compared to the binary blends, the ternary system exhibits reduced density of trap states, improved molecular ordering, and suppressed non-radiative recombination, and thereby yields an obviously lower V-loss than either of the binary OSCs. As a result, high efficiencies of 18.69% (certified as 18.2%) and 16.07% are obtained for the rigid and flexible OSCs, respectively. This work highlights the importance of suppressing non-radiative recombination in OSCs by using a ternary strategy and expands an effective avenue for the realization of efficient wearable electronics as novel photovoltaic power sources.

TI  - Commercial agriculture inside reserve forests-the case of natural rubber cultivation in Kanyakumari district, Tamil Nadu, India
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based remote sensing data was used in conjunction with toposheets of forest maps to estimate the extent of natural rubber cultivation existing inside reserve forests and their immediate peripheries in Kanyakumari district. The study revealed that nearly 15% of the total natural rubber cultivated area in the district was inside reserve forests and another 14% was within a radius of 500 m from the forest boundary. Ironically the entire natural rubber cultivated inside the forests and bulk of that existed adjacent to the forests were owned by a public sector undertaking (PSU) of the state government. This PSU was formed in 1984 with the objective of rehabilitating the Sri Lankan Tamil repatriates. There are more such PSU plantations inside and adjacent to forest periphery in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka that were established with equally noble causes, but they put severe pressure on the forests, fragmenting them and blocking wildlife corridors. Incidents of man-wildlife conflicts are not uncommon in these plantations. A serious scientific introspection is needed about the ecological, economic and social sustainability of these commercial PSU plantations developed inside and close to forests and whether they should be now reverted to forests and set a new and bold example for conservation. The current better jobs elsewhere.

TI  - Validation of <i>in situ</i> and remote sensing-derived methane refinery emissions in a complex wind environment and chemical implications
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution emissions from ports are major sources of contaminant exposures to downwind communities. Elevated pollutant concentrations relate to emissions from port activities and nearby heavy industries including refining. Methane (CH4) in the 66 Refinery plume, located west of the Los Angeles Port, provided a real-world validation opportunity for in situ-derived emissions in comparison with imaging spectroscopy-derived emissions. Airborne remote sensing data were acquired by the airborne thermal infrared Mako imaging spectrometer, while contemporaneous in situ meteorology and trace gas measurements and air samples were collected using a ground based mobile system, SISTERTM (Standard Instrumentation Suite: Truck Enabled for Response). SISTER measures 13 trace gases, meteorology, aerosol size distributions, and vertical aerosol profiles at up to highway speeds. Real-time data visualization is used to target sample collection. SISTER & Mako data were collected 19 June 2020 with additional SISTER data including air samples collected 16 July 2020. In situ CH4 emissions were derived from two series of inversion plume models with different numbers of plumes for comparison with Mako reference emissions. The informed series used Mako spatial data, whereas the uninformed series did not. In situ survey data and air samples also were collected for two nearby oil wells and found significantly elevated alkanes through undecane and aromatics in the refinery and oil well plumes compared to nearby reference air. Remote sensing CH4 emissions were 69 gs- 1(2.18 Gg yr(-1)), within 20% of the informed in situ emissions of 87 g s(-1) (2.73 Gg yr(-1)) and within 10% of four-plume uninformed emissions of 80 g s(-1) (2.51 Gg yr(-1)). On an annualized basis, this is 10% of estimated US refining CH4 emissions. Derived emissions were robust - agreeing within 10-20% for the various models; however, partitioning between plumes was very poor for the uninformed plumes because neglecting wind veering caused emissions mis-assignment. Monte Carlo simulation emission uncertainties were 12-13% for 19 June and 24-25% for 16 July when emissions were much lower, 0.25 Gg CH4 yr(-1). This study emphasized the importance of fine-scale structure in winds with respect to characterizing emissions at the sub-facility (kilometer) scale, while also showing robust estimation of emissions at the facility scale by in situ survey for a wide range of models. Wind structure on kilometer and smaller scales plays a key role in understanding the fate of emissions.

TI  - Public health surveillance in the US Department of Veterans Affairs: evaluation of the Praedico surveillance system
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Early threat detection and situational awareness are vital to achieving a comprehensive and accurate view of health-related events for federal, state, and local health agencies. Key to this are public health and syndromic surveillance systems that can analyze large data sets to discover patterns, trends, and correlations of public health significance. In 2020, Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) evaluated its public health surveillance system and identified areas for improvement. Methods Using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Guidelines for Evaluating Public Health Surveillance Systems, we assessed the ability of the Praedico Surveillance System to perform public health surveillance for a variety of health issues and evaluated its performance compared to an enterprise data solution (VA Corporate Data Warehouse), legacy surveillance system (VA ESSENCE) and a national, collaborative syndromic surveillance platform (CDC NSSP BioSense). Results Review of system attributes found that the system was simple, flexible, and stable. Representativeness, timeliness, sensitivity, and Predictive Value Positive were acceptable but could be further improved. Data quality issues and acceptability present challenges that potentially affect the overall usefulness of the system. Conclusions Praedico is a customizable surveillance and data analytics platform built on big data technologies. Functionality is straightforward, with rapid query generation and runtimes. Data can be graphed, mapped, analyzed, and shared with key decision makers and stakeholders. Evaluation findings suggest that future development and system enhancements should focus on addressing Praedico data quality issues and improving user acceptability. Because Praedico is designed to handle big data queries and work with data from a variety of sources, it could be enlisted as a tool for interdepartmental and interagency collaboration and public health data sharing. We suggest that future system evaluations include measurements of value and effectiveness along with additional organizations and functional assessments.

AB  - The palaeo-course of the Assi river in Uttar Pradesh, India was delineated through visual image impressions using remote sensing data. To corroborate on the existence of this palaeo-course 192 open wells and several ponds along and within the palaeo-course were observed showing very shallow groundwater table. Also, eight trenches dug within the channel and over the natural levees confirmed the existence of very shallow groundwater conditions. The observations of wells were made and trenches were dug during January-February 2020, by which time most of the ponds away from the channel dry out and the water column in the wells outside the course is reduced compared to the ponds and wells located over the banks and wells within the palaeocourse and outside it corroborates the existence of the

TI  - Improving Forest Above-Ground Biomass Retrieval Using Multi-Sensor L- and C- Band SAR Data and Multi-Temporal Spaceborne LiDAR Data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the great structural and species diversity of tropical forests and limitations of the methods used to estimate aboveground biomass, there is uncertainty in quantifying its carbon sequestration potential. Measuring carbon sequestered in the terrestrial ecosystem and monitoring its dynamics is one of the key objectives in sustainable development goals. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has evolved as a key satellite technology in measuring and monitoring terrestrial carbon sink stored as biomass in plants. This study attempts to model forest above-ground biomass (AGB) using a random forest machine-learning approach where the predictor variables are from C-band (Radarsat-2), L-band (ALOS-2/PALSAR-2), and multi-temporal spaceborne LiDAR data from the GEDI platform. Training and validation data for the machine learning approach are obtained from the field measured inventory campaigns to evaluate the modeled forest biomass accuracies. The results show that variables from L-band (HH, HV), C-band (HV), and canopy height from the GEDI LiDAR platform performed effectively to model forest AGB with the coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.81 and root mean squared error (rmse) of 19.35 Mg/ha (%rmse - 17.17). In the case of single frequency SAR data, the analysis shows that the model derived from the L-band SAR data and LiDAR performed comparably better than the combination of C-band SAR and LiDAR data with an R-2 of 0.78 and rmse of 21.36 Mg/ha (%rmse - 18.94). The results, thus, demonstrate the potential of SAR data (both single frequency and multiple frequencies) in combination with GEDI LiDAR data in effectively modeling AGB over highly biodiverse tropical forest regions.

TI  - Present-Day Tectonic Deformation Partitioning Across South Tianshan From Satellite Geodetic Imaging
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tianshan orogenic belt has intense crustal deformation and shortening in the near north-south direction. We processed ascending and descending Sentinel-1A/B (1)synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data to obtain the first line-of-sight deformation field over South Tianshan (75-78 E), and combined with GPS velocity data to construct the current three dimensions surface velocity fields with high quality and high spatial resolution. The results show that: 1) deformation is not evenly distributed in the study area. The convergence across the Tianshan ranges is approximately 15-24 mm/yr; the deformation gradient in the junction area between South Tianshan and Pamir is the largest, and adjusts similar to 68% of the total convergence deformation. South Tianshan is relatively stable without sharp gradients, and similar to 58% of the deformation is distributed in the intermontane faults and basin systems in the north of South Tianshan. 2) Thrust slip of faults, uplift of folds, and slippage of decollement jointly play important roles in accommodating regional strain. The Maidan fault, which is the boundary between South Tianshan and Tarim Basin, has strike-slip and thrust characteristics, and is the root fault of the slip partitioning system. Our results can provide effective kinematic boundary constraints for the study of Asian crustal movement models.

TI  - Aging Well for Indigenous Peoples: A Scoping Review
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - As life expectancy increases for Indigenous populations, so does the number of older adults with complex, chronic health conditions and age-related geriatric syndromes. Many of these conditions are associated with modifiable lifestyle factors that, if addressed, may improve the health and wellbeing of Indigenous peoples as they age. If models of healthy aging are to be promoted within health services, a clearer understanding of what aging well means for Indigenous peoples is needed. Indigenous peoples hold a holistic worldview of health and aging that likely differs from Western models. The aims of this review were to: investigate the literature that exists and where the gaps are, on aging well for Indigenous peoples; assess the quality of the existing literature on Indigenous aging; identify the domains of aging well for Indigenous peoples; and identify the enablers and barriers to aging well for Indigenous peoples. A systematic search of online databases, book chapters, gray literature, and websites identified 32 eligible publications on Indigenous aging. Reflexive thematic analysis identified four major themes on aging well: (1) achieving holistic health and wellbeing; (2) maintaining connections; (3) revealing resilience, humor, and a positive attitude; and (4) facing the challenges. Findings revealed that aging well is a holistic concept enabled by spiritual, physical, and mental wellbeing and where reliance on connections to person, place, and culture is central. Participants who demonstrated aging well took personal responsibility, adapted to change, took a positive attitude to life, and showed resilience. Conversely, barriers to aging well arose from the social determinants of health such as lack of access to housing, transport, and adequate nutrition. Furthermore, the impacts of colonization such as loss of language and culture and ongoing grief and trauma all challenged the ability to age well. Knowing what aging well means for Indigenous communities can facilitate health services to provide culturally appropriate and effective care.

T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/aim: The relationship between air pollution and respiratory morbidity has been widely addressed in urban and metropolitan areas but little is known about the effects in non-urban settings. Our aim was to assess the short-term effects of PM10 and PM2.5 on respiratory admissions in the whole country of Italy during 2006-2015.Methods: We estimated daily PM concentrations at the municipality level using satellite data and spatiotemporal predictors. We collected daily counts of respiratory hospital admissions for each Italian municipality. We considered five different outcomes: all respiratory diseases, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lower and upper respiratory tract infections (LRTI and URTI). Meta-analysis of province-specific estimates obtained by time-series models, adjusting for temperature, humidity and other confounders, was applied to extrapolate national estimates for each outcome. At last, we tested for effect modification by sex, age, period, and urbanization score. Analyses for PM2.5 were restricted to 2013-2015 cause the goodness of fit of exposure estimation.Results: A total of 4,154,887 respiratory admission were registered during 2006-2015, of which 29% for LRTI, 12% for COPD, 6% for URTI, and 3% for asthma. Daily mean PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations over the study period were 23.3 and 17 mu g/m(3) , respectively. For each 10 mu g/m(3) increases in PM10 and PM2.5 at lag 0-5 days, we found excess risks of total respiratory diseases equal to 1.20% (95% confidence intervals, 0.92, 1.49) and 1.22% (0.76, 1.68), respectively. The effects for the specific diseases were similar, with the strongest ones for asthma and COPD. Higher effects were found in the elderly and in less urbanized areas.Conclusions: Short-term exposure to PM is harmful for the respiratory system throughout an entire country, especially in elderly patients. Strong effects can be found also in less urbanized areas. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

T2  - NEUROHOSPITALIST
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Morbidity and Mortality (M&M) conferences are widespread but vary in goals and methodology. Some focus on clinical enigmas while an increasing number utilize quality improvement (QI) tools to effect systems change. Little is known about the current state of US Neurology M&Ms. Methods We surveyed 56 US academic neurology departments regarding their M&Ms to understand the use of QI tools and assess variability. Additionally, we reviewed the evolution of M&Ms in our department. Results The survey was completed by 44 (80%) departments; 68% reported quarterly frequency with 61% discussing 1-2 safety events per conference. The number of written guidelines or protocols resulting from M&Ms in 2 years varied from 0 (14% of departments), 1-2 (45%), to >5 (5%). Institutional culture regarding quality and safety and conference timing were cited by 71% as important in improving participation. In our own department, the M&M format changed in 2014 based on a sentinel patient event combined with improving safety culture across the hospital: neurology M&Ms transformed into thematic quarterly conferences utilizing QI tools. Attendance increased 3-fold, and in 7 years, we have generated 26 guidelines or pathways with corresponding decision-support tools, among other improvement efforts, resulting in specific systems changes. Based on survey results and our experience, suggested M&M "best practices" include the use of just culture, peer review protection, safety event analysis with QI methodology, trainee involvement, and logistical optimization. Conclusion Structured M&Ms incorporating suggested QI-informed "best practices" can be highly effective in driving system change within neurology.

Glacier mass balances in Svalbard and northern Canada were asynchronous since the 1990s, related to changes in patterns of atmospheric heat advection.Glaciers in the Arctic respond sensitively to climate change, recording the polar amplification of global warming with increasing mass loss. Here, we use glacier mass balances in Svalbard and northern Arctic Canada to categorize tropospheric variability and the associated summer circulation over the Arctic. We establish a link between annual glacier mass balances and their respective atmospheric forcings since 1950 using GRACE/GRACE-FO satellite data (2002-2021), as well as regional climate models and reanalysis data (1950-2019). We find that asynchronous behaviour of mass balance between the regions has become very likely since the early 2000s, exceeding the range of previous decadal variability. Related tropospheric circulation exhibits more meridional patterns, a greater influence of meridional heat advection and a wavier summer circulation. The traceable impact on glacier mass balances emphasizes the importance of dynamic next to thermodynamic climate changes for the future of glacier mass loss, Arctic ecology and societal impacts.

TI  - The effect of farmland on the surface water of the Aral Sea Region using Multi-source Satellite Data
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The improper land utilization has brought tremendous pressure on the surface water of the Aral Sea Region in the past decades. It was seriously hindered for construction of the Green Silk Road Economic Belt by the fragile environment. Therefore, it is of great necessity for environmental protection and social development to monitor the change of surface water in the Aral Sea Region.Methods: In this study, LandTrendr algorithm was used on Landsat time-series data to characterize the change in farmland on the Google Earth Engine platform. Based on multi-source data, the water area changes of the Aral Sea were extracted based on the Google Earth Engine, and the mean method was utilized to extract the changes in water level and water storage. Finally, a water-farmland coupling degree model was utilized to evaluate the impact of farmland changes on the surface water in the Aral Sea Region.Results: As a result, the change of farmland is as follows: the farmland area of the Aral Sea Region has abandoned 3,129 km(2) from 1987 to 2019, with overall accuracy of 85.3%. The farmland change had increased the drainage downstream of the Amu Darya River and the Syr Darya River. It has led area of the Aral Sea to decrease each year continuously. The area of the Aral Sea shrank by 1,606.36 km(2) per year from 1987 to 2019. Furthermore, Aral Sea's water level decreased by 0.13 m per year from 2003 to 2009. The amount of water storage in the Aral Sea Region also showed a downward trend from 2002 to 2016. There was a high-quality coupling coordination 0.903 relationship between surface water and farmland. It will increase the burden of water for people's normal daily life by the water loss resources caused by abandoned farmland. This study emphasized threat of unreasonable farmland management to surface water of the Aral Sea Region. The findings contributed for decision makers to formulating effective reasonable policies to protect surface water and use land of the Aral Sea Region. Meanwhile, the application of coupling degree model can provide a new method for studying the connection of independent systems in the farmland, water, environment and more.

TI  - Syndromic surveillance: A key component of population health monitoring during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak in France, February-June 2020
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe French syndromic surveillance (SyS) system, SurSaUD (R) , was one of the systems used to monitor the COVID-19 outbreak.AimThis study described the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19-related visits to both emergency departments (EDs) and the network of emergency general practitioners known as SOS Medecins (SOSMed) in France from 17 February to 28 June 2020.MethodsData on all visits to 634 EDs and 60 SOSMed associations were collected daily. COVID-19-related visits were identified using ICD-10 codes after coding recommendations were sent to all ED and SOSMed doctors. The time course of COVID-19-related visits was described by age group and region. During the lockdown period, the characteristics of ED and SOSMed visits and hospitalisations after visits were described by age group and gender. The most frequent diagnoses associated with COVID-19-related visits were analysed.ResultsCOVID-19 SyS was implemented on 29 February and 4 March for EDs and SOSMed, respectively. A total of 170,113 ED and 59,087 SOSMed visits relating to COVID-19 were recorded, representing 4.0% and 5.6% of the overall coded activity with a peak in late March representing 22.5% and 25% of all ED and SOSMed visits, respectively. COVID-19-related visits were most frequently reported for women and those aged 15-64 years, although patients who were subsequently hospitalised were more often men and persons aged 65 years and older.ConclusionSyS allowed for population health monitoring of the COVID-19 epidemic in France. As SyS has more than 15 years of historical data with high quality and reliability, it was considered sufficiently robust to contribute to defining the post-lockdown strategy.

TI  - Strong acceleration of glacier area loss in the Greater Caucasus between 2000 and 2020
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - An updated glacier inventory is important for understanding glacier behaviour given the accelerating glacier retreat observed around the world. Here, we present data from a new glacier inventory for two points in time (2000, 2020) covering the entire Greater Caucasus (Georgia, Russia, and Azerbaijan). Satellite imagery (Landsat, Sentinel, SPOT) was used to conduct a remote-sensing survey of glacier change. The 30m resolution Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer Global Digital Elevation Model (ASTER GDEM; 17 November 2011) was used to determine aspect, slope, and elevations, for all glaciers. Glacier margins were mapped manually and reveal that in 2000 the mountain range contained 2186 glaciers with a total glacier area of 1381.5 +/- 58.2 km(2). By 2020, the area had decreased to 1060.9 +/- 33.6 km(2) a reduction of 23.2 +/- 3.8% (320.6 +/- 45.9 km(2)) or 1.16% yr 1 over the last 20 years in the Greater Caucasus. Of the 2223 glaciers, 14 have an area > 10 km(2), resulting in the 221.9 km(2) or 20.9% of total glacier area in 2020. The Bezengi Glacier with an area of 39.4 +/- 0.9 km(2) was the largest glacier mapped in the 2020 database. Glaciers between 1.0 and 5.0 km(2) accounted for 478.1 km(2) or 34.6% in total area in 2000, while they accounted for 354.0 km(2) or 33.4% in total area in 2020. The rates of area shrinkage and mean elevation vary between the northern and southern and between the western, central, and eastern Greater Caucasus. Area shrinkage is significantly stronger in the eastern Greater Caucasus (1.82% yr(-1)), where most glaciers are very small. The observed increased summer temperatures and decreased winter precipitation along with increased Saharan dust deposition might be responsible for the predominantly negative mass balances of Djankuat and Garabashi glaciers with long-term measurements. Both glacier inventories are available from the Global Land Ice Measurements from Space (GLIMS) database and can be used for future studies.

TI  - Sarcopenia in Distal Radius Fractures: A Scoping Review
T2  - JOURNAL OF FRAILTY & AGING
M3  - Review
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia is an emerging disease that adversely impacts outcomes of older adults across the spectrum of fragility fractures. Few studies have examined sarcopenia in upstream fragility fractures such as the distal radius. Understanding the state of current evidence is essential in defining a research agenda in this critical area of sentinel distal radius fractures and sarcopenia.OBJECTIVES: The aim of this scoping review was to summarize existing literature on sarcopenia in distal radius fracture in older adults, and to identify research areas and gaps to guide future studies.METHODS: We utilized the 5-stage framework of A rksey and O' Malley. We searched studies from 2010 to 2020 relating to "Sarcopenia" and "Distal radius fractures" in major databases. Two reviewers independently screened articles for inclusion and conducted full text reviews of shortlisted articles. We extracted data on research areas, key findings, and study limitations.RESULTS: Thirteen studies met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. They covered the areas of epidemiology (N=9), risk factors (N=4), basic science (N=2), outcomes (N=1), and diagnostic modalities (N=1). There were no studies on screening/case finding, prognostic scoring, intervention, or health economics. Identified limitations included the lack of clear definition and diagnostic criteria for sarcopenia, and lack of, or inappropriate, control group. Majority of studies were retrospective or cross-sectional in study design.CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review on sarcopenia in distal radius fractures highlighted gaps in research areas and in the rigor of studies conducted, and the need for more prospective cohort and interventional studies. Building upon current consensus criteria, we propose setting a research agenda along the timeline of sarcopenia management, from screening through to intervention and follow-up, which will inform future research in this early disease cohort of fragility fractures.

TI  - Specific diagnosis of lymph node micrometastasis in breast cancer by targeting activatable near-infrared fluorescence imaging
T2  - BIOMATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Axillary lymph node metastasis has always been defined as the most important prognostic factor in the treatment of early breast cancer. Ultrasound and MRI can detect only 10% of lymph node micrometastases in early breast cancer. Therefore, it is crucial to detect early breast cancer with lymph node metastasis, however, there is no current examination method for accurate diagnosis. When breast cancer presents a malignant tendency, colony stimulating factor-1 and chemokine CCL-2 absorb mononuclear cells from the surrounding environment and differentiate into M2 Tumor associated macrophages (TAM), which increase the invasion of tumor cells and further promote the development of tumors. Mannose, as a simple natural ligand, can selectively bind to TAM surface CD206 (macrophage mannose receptor, MMR). In this study, mannose was connected with near infrared dye (NIR) IR780 via disulfide bond to obtain Mannose-IR780 conjugate (MR780), which was further selfassembled into near infrared nanoprobe (MR780 NPs) with quenched fluorescence. When selectively targeting CD206 highly expressed on the surface of TAM, disulfide bond was cleaved by the glutathione enriched in the microenvironment, resulting in fluorescence recovery, thus achieving NIR fluorescence molecular imaging of TAM and diagnosis of tumor lymph node metastasis in mouse models. Our findings suggest that targeted imaging of TAM enable noninvasive and sensitive detection of metastatic lymph nodes in vivo, which is instructive for tumor therapy.

TI  - Assessing Spatial and Temporal Distribution of Algal Blooms Using Gini Coefficient and Lorenz Asymmetry Coefficient
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Algal bloom in an inland lake is characterized by significant spatial and temporal dynamics. Accurate assessment of algal bloom distribution and dynamics is highly required for tracing the causes of and creating countermeasures for algal bloom. Satellite remote sensing provides a fast and efficient way to capture algal bloom distribution at a large scale, but it is difficult to directly derive accurate and quantitative assessment based on satellite images. In this study, the Gini coefficient and Lorenz asymmetry coefficient were introduced to examine the spatio-temporal algal bloom distribution of Chaohu Lake, the fifth largest inland lake in China. A total of 61 remote sensing images from three satellite sensors, Landsat, Gaofen, and Sentinel were selected to obtain algal bloom distributions. By dividing remote sensing images into 0.01 degrees*0.01 degrees grid cells, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for each grid cell was derived, forming a spatial and time series database for quantitative analysis. Two coefficients, Gini coefficient and Lorenz asymmetry coefficient, were used to evaluate the overall intensity, unevenness, and attribution of algal bloom in Chaohu Lake from 2011 to 2020. The Gini coefficient results show a large variety of algal bloom in the spatial and temporal scales of Chaohu lake. The lake edge and northwestern part had longer lasting and more severe algal bloom than the lake center, which was mainly due to nutrient import, especially from three northwestern tributaries that flow through the upstream city. The Lorenz asymmetry coefficient revealed the exact source of the unevenness. Spatial uncertainties were mostly caused by the tiny areas with high NDVI values, accounting for 53 cases out of 61 cases. Temporal unevenness in northwestern and northeastern parts of the lake was due to the most severe breakout occurrences, while unevenness in the lake center was mainly due to the large number of light occurrences. Finally, the advantage of Gini coefficient and Lorenz asymmetry coefficient are discussed by comparison with traditional statistical coefficients. By incorporating the two coefficients, this paper provides a quantitative and comprehensive assessment method for the spatial and temporal distribution of algal bloom.

TI  - The use of local climate zones in the urban environment: A systematic review of data sources, methods, and themes
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Review
AB  - The concept of local climate zones (LCZ) has emerged to identify the nature of urban climate, air quality, and temperature at local levels. Thus, this study reviews the literature on methodologies and data sources used in LCZs empirical research and identifies recurrent themes. A systematic review was conducted using bibliometric analysis and the PRISMA framework. Web of Science and Scopus databases were used to extract relevant datasets, and records were screened and extracted. Descriptive analyses reveal that most LCZ empirical research has been done on Chinese cities. Numerous data sources and analytical methods have been used, but Landsat and WUDAPT methodology is generally favored in the LCZ research due to its simplicity and freely available global datasets. Similarly, the review also shows that various software and methodologies are available to identify climate-sensitive areas of urban settlements with varying functionalities, accuracy, and visualizations. The thematic analysis indicates that the LCZ framework and its associated processes are being used in crosscutting phenomena such as thermal comfort, urban planning, climate change adaptation, and energy use. The review also suggests incorporating institutional and social aspects in local climate zones. LCZs can integrate the philosophies of climate change adaptation, urban resilience, and sustainability.

TI  - Surveillance of Hospital-Presenting Intentional Self-Harm in Western Sydney, Australia, During the Implementation of a New Self-Harm Reporting Field
T2  - CRISIS-THE JOURNAL OF CRISIS INTERVENTION AND SUICIDE PREVENTION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background: Hospital-presenting self-harm is a strong predictor of suicide and has substantial human and health service costs. Aims: We aimed to identify changes in case ascertainment after implementation of a new self-harm reporting field at a tertiary hospital in New South Wales, and to report event rates, demographic, and clinical characteristics. Method: Self-harm events presenting to the emergency department (October 2017 to August 2020) were identified using clinical documentation and a new reporting field. Changes in the frequency of self-harm in the period after implementation of the self-harm field were assessed through Poisson regression models. Results: A twofold increase in the frequency of self-harm was detected following the implementation of the new reporting field. The annual average age-standardized event rate of self-harm was 110.4 per 100,000 (120.8 per 100,000 for females; 100.1 per 100,000 for males). The highest rates by age and sex were for females aged 15-19 years (375 per 100,000) and mates aged 20-24 years (175 per 100,000). Limitations: Self-harm identification relies on clinician coding practice, which is subject to variability and potential under-enumeration. Conclusion: These findings highlight the value of a self-harm reporting field in hospital record systems for accurate recording and tong-term monitoring of self-harm event rates.

AB  - BackgroundThe current distribution of Zostera spp. seagrass meadows along the Bulgarian Black Sea coast was studied. We used a combination of historical and recent observations of the habitat along the studied coastline. Remote sensing data (satellite images, sonar side scans) was groundtruthed with georeferenced drop camera observations, scuba diving sampling and georeferenced scuba diving photo and video transects.New informationThe total area of the habitat type 'MB548 - Black Sea seagrass meadows on lower infralittoral sands' (EUNIS habitat type list 2019) in the study area is 916.9 ha, of which only 17.9 ha are in man-made sheltered environments (harbours). All seagrass meadows identified in 1978-79 were also located during the current survey, despite the increased eutrophication pressure and overall degradation of benthic habitats in the western Black Sea during the 1980s and early 1990s.

TI  - Assessing the impact of urbanization on urban evapotranspiration and its components using a novel four-source energy balance model
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization substantially changes many aspects including the regional hydrological cycle, energy balance, and microclimate. However, the degree to which urbanization alters urban evapotranspiration (ET) and its components (soil evaporation (E), vegetation transpiration (T), impervious surface evaporation (I) and water body evaporation (W)) remains unclear. A significant obstacle is the absence of a multi-source energy balance model for an urban area. To solve this issue, a customized four-source energy balance model for urban areas (FSU model) is proposed that differentiates between urban E, T, W, and I. The performance of the FSU model was verified using the eddy correlation (EC), stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope observations in a mega city: Tianjin, China. Long-term urban ET and its composition changes were reconstructed using the Landsat image during the period of 1986-2021 in Tianjin. Trend analyses demonstrate that urban ET, E, and T exhibit significant decreases of trend, while urban W, sensible heat flux (H), and Bowen ratio (BR) exhibit significant increases in trends with urbanization. Urban ET decreased at a rate of 1.41 mm/yr, corresponding to a ~ 13% decrease below the longterm mean value of total urban ET during the period 1986-2021. Correlation analyses revealed a declining trend of urban ET, E, and T primarily caused by urban land use changes, while the increasing trends of urban W, H, and BR were mainly due to the urban microclimate changes. The proposed FSU model aids in assessment of the urban heat island (UHI) effect and facilitates scientific water resources management in urban areas. This research improves the in-depth understanding of the impact of urbanization on urban ET and its components.

TI  - A high-resolution monitoring approach of canopy urban heat island using a random forest model and multi-platform observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to rapid urbanization and intense human activities, the urban heat island (UHI) effect has become a more concerning climatic and environmental issue. A high-spatial-resolution canopy UHI monitoring method would help better understand the urban thermal environment. Taking the city of Nanjing in China as an example, we propose a method for evaluating canopy UHI intensity (CUHII) at high resolution by using remote sensing data and machine learning with a random forest (RF) model. Firstly, the observed environmental parameters, e.g., surface albedo, land use/land cover, impervious surface, and anthropogenic heat flux (AHF), around densely distributed meteorological stations were extracted from satellite images. These parameters were used as independent variables to construct an RF model for predicting air temperature. The correlation coefficient between the predicted and observed air temperature in the test set was 0.73, and the average root-mean-square error was 0.72 degrees C. Then, the spatial distribution of CUHII was evaluated at 30 m resolution based on the output of the RF model. We found that wind speed was negatively correlated with CUHII, and wind direction was strongly correlated with the CUHII offset direction. The CUHII reduced with the distance to the city center, due to the decreasing proportion of built-up areas and reduced AHF in the same direction. The RF model framework developed for real-time monitoring and assessment of high spatial and temporal resolution (30 m and 1 h) CUHII provides scientific support for studying the changes and causes of CUHII, as well as the spatial pattern of urban thermal environments.

TI  - A Flexible Smoother Adapted to Censored Data With Outliers and Its Application to SARS-CoV-2 Monitoring in Wastewater
T2  - FRONTIERS IN APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND STATISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - A sentinel network, Obepine, has been designed to monitor SARS-CoV-2 viral load in wastewaters arriving at wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in France as an indirect macro-epidemiological parameter. The sources of uncertainty in such a monitoring system are numerous, and the concentration measurements it provides are left-censored and contain outliers, which biases the results of usual smoothing methods. Hence, the need for an adapted pre-processing in order to evaluate the real daily amount of viruses arriving at each WWTP. We propose a method based on an auto-regressive model adapted to censored data with outliers. Inference and prediction are produced via a discretized smoother which makes it a very flexible tool. This method is both validated on simulations and real data from Obepine. The resulting smoothed signal shows a good correlation with other epidemiological indicators and is currently used by Obepine to provide an estimate of virus circulation over the watersheds corresponding to about 200 WWTPs.

TI  - Application of fuzzy-AHP method for desertification assessment in Sabzevar area of Iran
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Desertification is a serious problem in most arid and semi-arid areas of the world, and especially in Iran. Combating desertification planning and any preparatory measures require detailed mapping of the current status of desertification as well as its evolvement during the time. This study, basically relying on remote sensing datasets, strives to map desertification in the Sabzevar area of Iran and identify its changes between the years 2001 and 2020. The indicators used in this study included Enhanced Vegetation Index, Vegetation Condition Index, Salinity Index, Synthetized Drought Index, Temperature Condition Index, Precipitation, Normalized Vegetation Index, and Land Surface Temperature. Analytical Hierarchical Process was used to determine the weight of the factors and the fuzzy overlay approach was used for synthesizing the thematic layer maps. According to the expert judgments, precipitation and salinity are the most important desertification factors in the area (similar to 50% of the total weight). In terms of land-use changes over the past 20 years, urban, desert, croplands and bare lands grew in size at the expense of rangelands and open canopy forests which shrank greater than 3.5% (435 km(2)). Based on our findings, the total area of desertification classes has not changed considerably during the period but there has been a growth in very high and high desertification intensity classes by 12%. According to our findings, very high and high classes have increased between the years 2001 and 2020 mostly in the central and southern parts of the study area. The results obtained in this research are very important to the land managers of the Khorasan Razavi Province, for formulating sustainable development programs and avoiding the unwanted consequences of desertification.

TI  - Optimal localization strategies for non-palpable breast cancers -A network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials
T2  - BREAST
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Mammographic screening programmes have increased detection rates of non-palpable breast cancers. In these cases, wire-guided localization (WGL) is the most common approach used to guide breast conserving surgery (BCS). Several RCTs have compared WGL to a range of novel localization techniques. We aimed to perform a network meta-analysis (NMA) of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing methods of non-palpable breast cancer localization.Methods: A NMA was performed according to PRISMA-NMA guidelines. Analysis was performed using R packages and Shiny.Results: 24 RCTs assessing 9 tumour localization methods in 4236 breasts were included. Margin positivity and reoperation rates were 16.9% (714/4236) and 14.3% (409/2870) respectively. Cryo-assisted localization had the highest margin positivity (28.2%, 58/206) and reoperation (18.9%, 39/206) rates. Compared to WGL (n = 2045 from 24 RCTs) only ultrasound guided localization (USGL) (n = 316 from 3 RCTs) significantly lowered margin positivity (odds ratio (OR): 0.192, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.079-0.450) and reoperation rates (OR: 0.182, 95%CI: 0.069-0.434). Anchor-guided localization (n = 52, 1 RCT) significantly lowered margin positivity (OR: 0.229, 95%CI: 0.050-0.938) and magnetic-marker localization improved patient satisfaction (OR: 0.021, 95%CI: 0.001-0.548). There was no difference in operation duration, overall complications, haematoma, seroma, surgical site infection rates, or specimen size/vol/wt between methods.Conclusion: USGL and AGL are non-inferior to WGL for the localization of non-palpable breast cancers. The reported data suggests that these techniques confer reduced margin positivity rates and requirement for reoperation. However, caution when interpreting results relating to RCTs with small sample sizes and further validation is required in larger prospective, randomized studies.

TI  - Magnetization reversal, field-induced transitions and <i>H</i>-<i>T</i> phase diagram of Y<sub>1-<i>x</i></sub>Ce<i><sub>x</sub></i>CrO<sub>3</sub>
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER
M3  - Article
AB  - We report a systematic study of the magnetic phase diagram in the H-T plane, negative magnetization (NM), exchange interactions and field-induced spin-flop transitions in the distorted perovskite Y1-xCexCrO3. Locked AFM and weak-FM configurations in Gamma(4)(G(z) , F-y , A(x) ) phase of YCrO3 (S = 3/2 ground state) unlocks into the Gamma(2)(F-z , G(y) , C-x ; F-z(R),C-x(R)) phase of the canted AFM and FM structures with the dilute substitution of Ce (x >= 0.05). The asymmetric and symmetric exchange interaction (J(AS) similar to 0.11 meV and J(S) similar to 0.85 meV) between the trivalent Ce and Cr enable the positive quartic-anisotropy field (H-K4 similar to 2.85 x 10(2) Oe) along with the second order anisotropy field (H-K2 similar to 5.93 x 10(2) Oe). Unlike the pristine YCrO3 compound, the Ce incorporated system exhibits a giant fourth-order anisotropy constant (K-4 = 1.35 x 10(5) erg/c.c.) due to the asymmetric exchange interaction between the trivalent Ce-Cr which further lifts the free energy of the system and causes lag in the onset of AFM ordering showing the significant thermal hysteresis (Delta T similar to 10 K) in the field-cooled (FC)-warming measurement protocol as compared to the FC-cooling mode. The H-T phase diagram, mapped from the isothermal magnetization data and differential magnetic susceptibility data with different measurement protocols clearly distinguishes three prominent regions below the T-N (similar to 150 K), viz (i) long-range canted AFM + weak FM phase (Gamma(4) (G(z) , F-y , A(x) )), (ii) Gamma(24) mixed phase and (iii) robust Gamma(2) (F-z , G(y) , C-x ; F-z(R), C-x(R)) AFM + FM phases. Tunable spin-flopped transition (similar to 30 kOe), significant negative exchange-bias field (H-EB similar to 2.5 kOe), huge coercive field (H-C similar to 22 kOe) and large NM (Delta M similar to 280 emu/mole) are the unique characteristic features of the current investigated system.

TI  - Automated detection of atmospheric NO<sub>2</sub> plumes from satellite data: a tool to help infer anthropogenic combustion emissions
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - We use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify plumes of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a tracer of combustion, from NO2 column data collected by the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). This approach allows us to exploit efficiently the growing volume of satellite data available to characterize Earth's climate. For the purposes of demonstration, we focus on data collected between July 2018 and June 2020. We train the deep learning model using six thousand 28 x 28 pixel images of TROPOMI data (corresponding to similar or equal to 266 km x 133 km) and find that the model can identify plumes with a success rate of more than 90 %. Over our study period, we find over 310 000 individual NO2 plumes, of which similar or equal to 19 % are found over mainland China. We have attempted to remove the influence of open biomass burning using correlative high-resolution thermal infrared data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). We relate the remaining NO2 plumes to large urban centres, oil and gas production, and major power plants. We find no correlation between NO2 plumes and the location of natural gas flaring. We also find persistent NO2 plumes from regions where inventories do not currently include emissions. Using an established anthropogenic CO2 emission inventory, we find that our NO2 plume distribution captures 92 % of total CO2 emissions, with the remaining 8 % mostly due to a large number of small sources (< 0.2 g C m(-2) d(-1)) to which our NO2 plume model is less sensitive. We argue that the underlying CNN approach could form the basis of a Bayesian framework to estimate anthropogenic combustion emissions.

TI  - Radiotherapy of breast cancer
T2  - CANCER RADIOTHERAPIE
M3  - Article
AB  - Adjuvant radiotherapy is an essential component of the treatment of breast cancer. After conservative surgery for an infiltrating carcinoma, radiotherapy must be systematically performed, regardless of the characteristics of the disease, because it decreases the rate of local recurrence and by this way, specific mortality. A boost dose over the tumour bed is required if the patient is younger than 50 years -old. Partial breast irradiation could be routinely proposed as an alternative to whole breast irradiation, but only in selected and informed patients. For ductal carcinoma in situ, adjuvant radiotherapy must be also systematically performed after lumpectomy. After mastectomy, chest wall irradiation is required for pT3-T4 tumours and if there is an axillary nodal involvement, whatever the number of involved lymph nodes. After neoadjuvant chemotherapy and mastectomy, in case of pN0 disease, chest wall irradiation is recommended if there is a clinically or radiologically T3 -T4 or node positive disease before chemotherapy. Axillary irradiation is recommended only if there is no axillary surgical dissection and a positive sentinel lymph node. Supra- and infraclavicular irradiation is advised in case of positive axillary nodes. Internal mammary irradiation must be discussed case by case, according to the benefit/risk ratio (cardiac toxicity). Hypofractionation regimens (42.5 Gy in 16 fractions, or 41,6 Gy en 13 or 40 Gy en 15) are equivalent to conventional irradiation and must prescribe after tumorectomy in selected patients. Delineation of the breast, the chest wall and the nodal areas are based on clinical and radiological evaluations. 3D-conformal irradiation is the recommended technique, intensity-modulated radiotherapy must be proposed only in specific clinical situations. Respiratory gating could be useful to decrease the cardiac dose. Concomitant administration of chemotherapy in unadvised, but hormonal treatment could be start with or after radiotherapy.

TI  - Malignant Adenomyoepithelioma of the Breast and Associated Epithelial-Myoepithelial Carcinoma; A Rare Case Report
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGICAL PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Adenomyoepithelioma comprises a spectrum of lesions with variable morphology and clinical behavior, presenting at a wide age range. The most common presenting symptom is palpable abnormality. Mammographic abnormalities include focal asymmetries, masses and microcalcifications. Adenomyoepithelioma is a biphasic neoplasm characterized by proliferation of epithelial and myoepithelial cells. Adenomyoepitheliomas can be benign, atypical and malignant (adenomyoepithelioma with carcinoma). Malignant transformation occurs in either one or both cellular components leading to the development of invasive carcinoma. Invasive carcinoma types include invasive breast carcinoma of no special type, invasive lobular carcinoma, invasive carcinoma of special types, myoepithelial carcinoma, metaplastic carcinoma and biphasic carcinoma such as epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma. While the majority of classic adenomyoepitheliomas have a benign clinical course and can be treated by local excision, local recurrence and distant metastasis have been reported. In malignant cases, treatment is determined by the associated carcinoma to include radiotherapy after breast conserving surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy or axillary lymph node dissection, as indicated. Herein we report a case of a 62 year old woman who was found to have focal asymmetry on screening mammogram. She underwent a core biopsy of the lesion which showed atypical epithelial-myoepithelial neoplasm and excision was recommended. Upon excision, a diagnosis of malignant adenomyoepithelioma with associated epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma was rendered with negative margins. The patient declined additional surgery for sentinel lymph node biopsy and declined adjuvant therapy. Six months after surgery, the patient is doing well with no complains. A follow-up mammogram and ultrasound of the axilla showed no abnormalities.

TI  - A Secured Zobrist Hash Symmetric Sentinel List Based Malicious Attack Detection in Vanet
T2  - IETE JOURNAL OF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - VANET enables communication between the vehicles and Road Side units (RSUs). With the ever fast growth in industry and research necessitates the design of smart transportation system. Moreover, VANET success lies in the security features provided and it cannot be achieved precisely due to all type of security attacks. To secure the VANET against these types of security attacks, most of the research persons have proposed different security mechanisms based on lightweight and one way hash function. While both lightweight and one way hash function are efficient to certain degree, each method has some weakness to entirely secure the network. In this paper, we propose a list-based malicious attack detection scheme based on Zobrist Hash, called, Secured Zobrist Hash Symmetric Attack Detection (SZ-HSAD) to secure VANET to a larger extent. A system initialization is an essential part of trust establishment and secure communications between vehicles, the proposed SZ-HSAD integrates symmetric cryptography based initialization for efficient and robust trust management scheme. The system initialization includes Zobrist Hash Optimal Distance Registration. The trusted authority (TA) evaluates key for both the Road Side Unit (RSU) and vehicles based on the identity. Next, a list-based malicious attack detection using symmetric and sentinel node is designed for timely and early attack detection in VANET. The results are acquired with immense simulations to validate the proposed scheme. The results show that the proposed scheme converge security prerequisites, therefore reducing the average traffic overhead with minimum execution time and verification delay.

TI  - A Prospective Self-Controlled Study of Indocyanine Green, Radioisotope, and Methylene Blue for Combined Imaging of Axillary Sentinel Lymph Nodes in Breast Cancer
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeThis self-controlled study aimed to clarify whether indocyanine green (ICG) could be an alternative tracer in the absence of radioisotope (RI) for combined imaging of axillary sentinel lymph node (SLN) in breast cancer. MethodsPrimary breast cancer, clinically axillary node-negative patients (n = 182) were prospectively enrolled from March 2015 to November 2020. ICG, methylene blue (MB), and RI were used to perform axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). The main observation index was the positivity of ICG + MB vs. RI + MB in axillary SLNB; the secondary observation indicators were the axillary SLN detection rate, mean number of axillary SLNs detected, mean number of metastatic axillary SLNs detected, and safety. ResultsAll 182 patients had axillary SLNs; a total of 925 axillary SLNs were detected. Pathological examination confirmed metastatic axillary SLN in 42 patients (total of 79 metastatic SLNs). Positivity, detection rate of SLNs, detection rate of metastatic SLNs, and the number of metastatic SLNs detected were comparable with RI+MB and ICG+MB (p > 0.05). The mean number of axillary SLNs detected was significantly higher with ICG+MB than with RI+MB (4.99 +/- 2.42 vs. 4.02 +/- 2.33, p < 0.001). No tracer-related adverse events occurred. ConclusionsICG appears to be a safe and effective axillary SLN tracer, and a feasible alternative to RI in combined imaging for axillary SLN of breast cancer.

TI  - Changes in the Surface Elevation of the Laohugou Glacier No. 12 in Western Qilian Mountains
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - As the largest valley glacier in the Qilian Mountains, the Laohugou glacier No. 12 (LHG12) has shrunk significantly since 1957. In this study, two topographic maps and a WorldView-2 satellite stereopair image data were used to assess the volume and cumulative mass balance of LHG12 located at the western Qilian Mountains during 1957-2015. During the study period, the LHG12 exhibited changes in two processes: slightly ablation and stability in a brief period during 1957-1989 and strong melting and accelerated ablation during 1989-2015. During 1957-2015, the volume of LHG12 decreased by 0.38 km(3), the average thickness decreased by 17.23 m, the cumulative mass balance (MB) was -14.69 +/- 3.00 m w. e., and ablation was found glacier-wide. By comparing the previous MB simulation and digital elevation model (DEM) differencing results, it was found that the MB simulation results underestimated the strong melting trend of LHG12 since the 1990s. Temperature rose, especially in autumn and winter, and could cause the ice temperature of LHG12 to increase, and LHG12 may become more sensitive to climate change.

TI  - Direct photogrammetry with multispectral imagery for UAV-based snow depth estimation
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - More accurate snow quality predictions are needed to economically and socially support communities in a changing Arctic environment. This contrasts with the current availability of affordable and efficient snow monitoring methods. In this study, a novel approach is presented to determine spatial snow depth distribution in challenging alpine terrain that was tested during a field campaign performed in the Tarfala valley, Kebnekaise mountains, northern Sweden, in April 2019. The combination of a multispectral camera and an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) was used to derive three-dimensional (3D) snow surface models via Structure from Motion (SfM) with direct georeferencing. The main advantage over conventional photogrammetric surveys is the utilization of accurate Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) positioning which enables direct georeferencing of the images, and therefore eliminates the need for ground control points. The proposed method is capable of producing high -resolution 3D snow-covered surface models (<7 cm/pixel) of alpine areas up to eight hectares in a fast, reli-able and affordable way. The test sites' average snow depth was 160 cm with an average standard deviation of 78 cm. The overall Root-Mean-Square Errors (RMSE) of the snow depth range from 11.52 cm for data acquired in ideal surveying conditions to 41.03 cm in aggravated light and wind conditions. Results of this study suggest that the red components in the electromagnetic spectrum, i.e., the red, red edge, and near-infrared (NIR) band, contain the majority of information used in photogrammetric processing. The experiments highlighted a sig-nificant influence of the multi-spectral imagery on the quality of the final snow depth estimation as well as a strong potential to reduce processing times and computational resources by limiting the dimensionality of the imagery through the application of a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) before the photogrammetric 3D reconstruction. The proposed method is part of closing the scale gap between discrete point measurements and regional-scale remote sensing and complements large-scale remote sensing data and snow model output with an adequate validation source.

TI  - Analysis of improvements in MOPITT observational coverage over Canada
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) satellite instrument has been measuring global tropospheric carbon monoxide (CO) since March 2000, providing the longest nearly continuous record of CO from space. During its long mission, the data processing algorithms have been updated to improve the quality of CO retrievals and the sensitivity to the lower troposphere. Currently, MOPITT retrievals are only performed for clear-sky observations or over low clouds for ocean scenes. The cloud detection scheme was modified in the new V9 product, resulting in an improvement in observational coverage, especially over land. Comparison of the spatial and seasonal variations of the data coverage in V9 and V8 shows differences with significant geographical and temporal variability, with some regions such as Canada and the Amazon exhibiting a doubling of data in winter. Here we conducted an analysis of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) cloud heights and cloud mask products along with MOPITT retrieval cloud flag descriptors to understand the impact of cloud conditions on the MOPITT observational coverage, with a particular focus on observations over Canada. The MOPITT CO total column (TC) data were modified by turning off the cloud detection scheme to allow for a CO retrieval result, regardless of their cloud status. Analyses of the standard V8 CO TC product (cloud filtered) and non-standard product (non-cloud-masked) were conducted for selected days. Results showed some coherent structures that were observed frequently in the non-masked CO product that was not present in the V8 product and could potentially be actual CO features. Many times, these CO plumes were also seen in the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) CO TC product. The MODIS cloud height analysis revealed that a significant number of low-cloud CO retrievals were discarded in the V8 product. Most of the missed CO plumes in the V8 product are now detected in the new V9 product as a result of the dependence of the MOPITT radiance ratio (MRT) test over land. Comparisons of the MRT and MODIS cloud height data indicate a remarkable negative correlation. As a result of the modified V9 cloud detection algorithm, a significant portion of the low-cloud CO retrievals is now incorporated in the new V9 MOPITT product. Consequently, the observational coverage over Canada is significantly improved, which benefits analyses of regional CO variability, especially during extreme pollution events. We also conducted a comparison of MOPITT and IASI CO TC and found generally good agreement, with about a 5 %-10 % positive bias that is more pronounced in highly polluted scenes.

TI  - Predicting sediment connectivity in a mountain basin: A quantitative analysis of the index of connectivity
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sediment connectivity underlies the relationships between sediment source areas and stream network and the use of topography-based indices, such as the index of connectivity (IC), has become a common approach to investigate these relationships. However, few studies have tested the potential of the IC as an independent variable for predicting observable processes. In this study, the aim is the validation of the IC as a semi-quantitative tool for depicting structural connectivity and predicting sediment dynamics linking sediment sources to the channel network after a large infrequent disturbance in the Rio Cordon catchment (Italy). First, the assessment of lateral connectivity was carried out using a combination of remote sensing data and field observations. In this way, it was possible to classify the sediment sources into disconnected, connected or functionally connected. Second, logistic regression analyses were performed using different IC variants, with different weighting factors and spatial resolutions as independent variables and connectivity status as dependent variable. Hence, the predictive capacity of the IC was tested and a threshold was derived to distinguish between low and high sediment connectivity. The results showed that only 15% of sediment sources are connected to the stream network. Moreover, the IC proved to be a reliable tool for depicting structural connectivity when using surface roughness as weighting factor and high-resolution digital terrain models. On the contrary, it failed at predicting sediment dynamics as it did not classify correctly the functionally connected areas, so it cannot infer functional sediment connectivity in this case study. As a consequence, it was possible to obtain an IC threshold of -2.32, capable of differentiating between low and high structural sediment connectivity and useful for future management decisions. The threshold, in fact, represents an objective boundary between disconnected and connected sources in the Rio Cordon catchment.

TI  - Machine learning algorithm based prediction of land use land cover and land surface temperature changes to characterize the surface urban heat island phenomena over Ahmedabad city, India
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization over the world's dense urban centers cause an enormous change in the land use land cover (LULC) over a metropolitan area, which adversely affects the land surface temperature (LST) and intensify the urban heat island phenomena. The present study emphasizes the prediction of LULC, seasonal LST, and urban thermal field variance (UTFVI) over Ahmedabad city, India using multi date Landsat data. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based Cellular Automata (CA) model is use to predict the LULC, while the XGB Regression model is used to predict seasonal LST with input data from 2010, 2015, and 2020 to predict future scenarios of 2025 and 2030. The result suggests an addition in the built-up area of about 5.77% and 13.08%, while a deduction in cropland area of about 4.15% and 12.54% is manifest in the year 2025 and 2030, respectively. This excessive urban growth in the study area will cause to face higher LST ranges of greater than 45 degrees C (24.9 km(2) in 2025 and 24.2 km(2) in 2030) in summer and 35 degrees C (19.9 km(2) in 2025 and 43.6 km(2) in 2030) in winter. The concentration of higher LST zones is evident in the rural areas than urban areas, witnessing cool urban islands. The predicted LST analysis suggests a dominant occurrence of none UTFVI zone in the city area and the strongest UTFVI zone in the surrounding rural area during both the seasons. An increase in green space area and avoidance of non-impermeable surfaces is suggest in future scenarios to mitigate UHI. Furthermore, the outcome of the research can help urban planners and policymakers while formulating urban heat island related mitigation strategies in the near-future scenario.

TI  - Mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (MET) immunoreactivity in positive sentinel nodes from patients with melanoma
T2  - ANNALS OF DIAGNOSTIC PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Patients with cutaneous melanoma and a positive sentinel node (SN) are currently eligible for adjuvant treatment with targeted therapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging could be an alternative and less invasive tool for SN biopsy to select patients for adjuvant treatment. One potential target for NIR is the mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (MET). This study aimed to assess MET immunoreactivity in positive SNs and to evaluate its potential diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic value.Methods: In this retrospective study, positive SN samples from patients with primary cutaneous melanoma were collected to assess MET immunoreactivity. To this end, paraffin-embedded SNs were stained for MET (mono-clonal antibody D1C2). A 4-point Histoscore was used to determine cytoplasmic and membranous immunoreactivity (0 negative/1 weak/2 moderate/3 strong). Samples were considered positive when > 10% of the cancer cells showed MET expression (staining intensity > 1). Patient and clinicopathological characteristics were used for descriptive statistics, binary logistic regression, and survival analyses.& nbsp;Results: Positive MET immunohistochemistry was observed in 24 out of 37 samples (65%). No statistically significant associations were found between MET positivity and the following prognostic factors: Breslow thickness (P = 0.961), ulceration (P = 1.000), and SN tumor burden (P = 0.792). According to MET positivity, Kaplan -Meier curves showed no significant differences in survival.& nbsp;Conclusion: This exploratory study found no evidence to support MET immunoreactivity in positive SNs as a possible diagnostic or prognostic indicator in patients with melanoma.

TI  - Synergetic use of multi-temporal Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, NDVI, and topographic factors for estimating soil organic carbon
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a reliable indicator of soil productivity and land management. Despite the widespread use of remote sensing data in estimating SOC variation, the predictive power of single-date and multi-temporal as well as the individual and combined effects of radar and optical images have rarely been investigated. This study created six two-month interval composite layers including VH and VV polarizations of Sentinel-1 (S1), spectral bands of Sentinel-2 (S2), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), slope and altitude for the target year of 2019-2020 to estimate the SOC variation. Based on 80 soil samples (0-20 cm) taken in a field survey from northern Iran, random forest (RF) and support vector regression (SVR) were calibrated to estimate the SOC content. All models were fine-tuned using grid search and evaluated using spatial cross-validation. The results showed that multi-temporal data were more predictive than single-date data, and SVR outperformed the RF algorithm. SVR model using the multi-temporal S2 achieved the highest R-2 and RMSE values of 57.59% and 0.94%, respectively. Feature selection has shown no benefit of adding S1 data and identified band-2 (green), band-3 (red), and band-10 (shortwave infrared) of S2 imagery as the most explanatory variables of SOC variation. The results of this study highlight the potential of freely available high-resolution S2 for mapping SOC variation using the SVR model. SVR is particularly suggested in small sample size studies, an issue which is dominant in soil studies.

TI  - Application of maximum entropy for mineral prospectivity mapping in heavily vegetated areas of Greater Kurile Chain with Landsat 8 data
T2  - ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - Exploration for strategic mineral resources, like precious metals, in remote areas of the Greater Kurile Chain is challenging. Climate and weather conditions, dissected relief, soil and forest cover in this region impede acquisition of geological data. Mineral exploration requires development of fast and cost-effective methods that allow processing of insufficient and fragmented data like spaceborne images. Consideration of specific defolia-tion technique of directed principal components (DPC) and mineral mapping as well as application of assessment technique of Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt, also Logistic Regression, logit) led us to use Landsat 8 OLI for modeling of mineralization distribution in the Kunashir and Iturup Islands. DPC analysis is an image enhancement tech-nique that processes two band ratio images. One of these images contains information of the component of in-terest (e.g., hydrothermal alteration), the other image contains information related to the spectrally interfering component (e.g., vegetation). Computed DPCs with loadings of opposite signs on either of input images, highlight unique contributions of each band ratio. Therefore, DPC analysis allows to decrease influence of noise related to vegetation. MaxEnt is a general-purpose technique of spatial prognosis based on incomplete data; its key feature is to assess the degree of target presence or absence by approximating the probability distribution of maximum entropy or nearest to uniform distribution based on a set of constraints taken from the incomplete data. Mapping based on DPC analysis in this work aimed to outline hydrothermal alteration associated with known mineralization. Division of the study area into zones according to their mineral prospectivity was then achieved with configured, trained and validated MaxEnt model using the datasets pertaining to a part of the Kunashir Island, which is better studied and explored. The trained predictive model was then applied to the less explored Iturup Island. As a result, the predictive model rendered a mineral prospectivity map, which correctly outlines the locations of the known mineralization. The application of the specific computation techniques to spectral data processing allows assessment of the contribution of Landsat 8 band ratios into the directed principal components and their implementation for cost effective prospectivity mapping including known and probable locations of unknown Au-Ag-bearing zones.

TI  - Remote sensing-based biomass estimation of dry deciduous tropical forest using machine learning and ensemble analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests play a vital role in maintaining the global carbon balance. However, globally, forest ecosystems are increasingly threatened by climate change and deforestation in recent years. Monitoring forests, specifically forest biomass is essential for tracking changes in carbon stocks and the global carbon cycle. However, developing countries lack the capacity to actively monitor forest carbon stocks, which ultimately adds uncertainties in estimating country specific contribution to the global carbon emissions. In India, authorities use field-based measurements to estimate biomass, which becomes unfeasible to implement at finer scales due to higher costs. To address this, the present study proposed a framework to monitor above-ground biomass (AGB) at finer scales using open-source satellite data. The framework integrated four machine learning (ML) techniques with field surveys and satellite data to provide continuous spatial estimates of AGB at finer resolution. The application of this framework is exemplified as a case study for a dry deciduous tropical forest in India. The results revealed that for wet season Sentinel-2 satellite data, the Random Forest (adjusted R-2 = 0.91) and Artificial Neural Network (adjusted R-2 = 0.77) ML models were better-suited for estimating AGB in the study area. For dry season satellite data, all the ML models failed to estimate AGB adequately (adjusted R-2 between-0.05 - 0.43). Ensemble analysis of ML predictions not only made the results more reliable, but also quantified spatial uncertainty in the predictions as a metric to identify its robustness.

TI  - Realistic galaxy image simulation via score-based generative models
T2  - MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - We show that a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM), a class of score-based generative model, can be used to produce realistic mock images that mimic observations of galaxies. Our method is tested with Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) grz imaging of galaxies from the Photometry and Rotation curve OBservations from Extragalactic Surveys (PROBES) sample and galaxies selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Subjectively, the generated galaxies are highly realistic when compared with samples from the real data set. We quantify the similarity by borrowing from the deep generative learning literature, using the 'Frechet inception distance' to test for subjective and morphological similarity. We also introduce the 'synthetic galaxy distance' metric to compare the emergent physical properties (such as total magnitude, colour, and half-light radius) of a ground truth parent and synthesized child data set. We argue that the DDPM approach produces sharper and more realistic images than other generative methods such as adversarial networks (with the downside of more costly inference), and could be used to produce large samples of synthetic observations tailored to a specific imaging survey. We demonstrate two potential uses of the DDPM: (1) accurate inpainting of occluded data, such as satellite trails, and (2) domain transfer, where new input images can be processed to mimic the properties of the DDPM training set. Here we 'DESI-fy' cartoon images as a proof of concept for domain transfer. Finally, we suggest potential applications for score-based approaches that could motivate further research on this topic within the astronomical community.

TI  - Study on the changes in vegetation structural coverage and its response mechanism to hydrology
T2  - OPEN GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation is an important factor that affects the hydrological process of a watershed. In recent years, the vegetation in the hilly and gully regions of the Loess Plateau has undergone significant changes, which have greatly changed the relationship between rainfall and runoff and sediment in the region. A single vegetation cover index cannot represent the important impact of vegetation grade on the effectiveness of soil and water conservation. It is of great scientific significance to deeply study the influence of the vegetation structure change mechanism in the hilly and gully area on the hydrological process of the watershed. In this article, a typical watershed in the loess hilly and gully area is used as the research object, and the method of combining field sampling experiment and remote sensing inversion is used to establish a vegetation index remote sensing model reflecting the vegetation canopy cover and litter. The impact of changes in vegetation structure on hydrological processes is quantitatively assessed. The results show that the more annual precipitation in the basin, the more sensitive the runoff coefficient is to changes in structural vegetation index. The greater the rainfall intensity, the weaker the sensitivity of the sediment yield coefficient to changes in structural vegetation index. The use of remote sensing data to retrieve the underlying surface vegetation still has the problem of the scale effect. It is necessary to further use remote sensing data with a higher spectral resolution to carry out field observations at different scales to improve the applicability of this method in a wider range of watersheds.

TI  - Relationship between urban morphology and land surface temperature-A case study of Nanjing City
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the relationship between urban form and land surface temperature (LST) using the Multi-access Geographically Weighted Regression (MGWR) model. A case study on Nanjing City was conducted using building data, point-of-interest (POI) data, land use data, remote sensing data, and elevation data. The results show that the MGWR model can reveal the influence of altitude, urban green space, road, building height (BH), building density (BD) and POI on LST, with a superior fitting effect over the geographically weighted regression model. LST in Nanjing exhibits a significant spatial differentiation, and the distribution of LST hotspots is spatially consistent with the level of urban construction. In terms of the two-dimensional landscape pattern, LST decreases with altitude and increases with POI. In terms of the three-dimensional structure, building height has a positive correlation with LST. POI, urban roads, and urban buildings positively affect LST, while urban green space and altitude negatively affect LST. The results of this study were verified against existing findings. The LST of areas with high-rise and super high-rise buildings is lower than that of areas with mid-rise building, which can be attributed to the large number of shadow areas formed by high-rise and super high-rise buildings. A similar phenomenon was also observed between areas with medium- and high-density buildings. These findings provide a reference for urban architecture planning and can help to develop urban heat island adaptation strategies based on local conditions.

TI  - What controls the surging of Karayaylak glacier in eastern Pamir? New insights from remote sensing data
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier surges in the Pamir have been widely documented, but the surge mechanism remains poorly known. The Karayaylak Glacier is the first reported surging glacier in eastern Pamir but different dates and possible triggers were published. In this research, the Karayaylak Glacier was studied using an extensive Landsat and Ziyuan-3 (ZY-3) satellite image set. The active phase initiated in May to June 2014, and experienced a peak velocity of 20.1 +/- 0.7 m d(-1) in May 2015, terminating in October 2015. During 2014-2015, the reservoir zone experienced an average surface elevation reduction of 33.1 +/- 1.5 m, and the receiving zone experienced an average surface elevation gain of 36.8 +/- 1.5 m. The large basal sliding during the active phase (2014-2015) was likely driven by high water pressure at the bed in an inefficient drainage system. A large volume of water released at the end of the active phase indicated the drainage at the glacier base became more efficient. The abrupt peak velocity, the short active phase and the changes in drainage suggest that the Karayaylak Glacier surge was controlled by hydrology. The behaviour of the Karayaylak Glacier was similar to that of the Kyagar Glacier and Shispare Glacier in the Karakoram.

TI  - Estimating mangrove forest gross primary production by quantifying environmental stressors in the coastal area
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove ecosystems play an important role in global carbon budget, however, the quantitative relationships between environmental drivers and productivity in these forests remain poorly understood. This study presented a remote sensing (RS)-based productivity model to estimate the light use efficiency (LUE) and gross primary production (GPP) of mangrove forests in China. Firstly, LUE model considered the effects of tidal inundation and therefore involved sea surface temperature (SST) and salinity as environmental scalars. Secondly, the downscaling effect of photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) on the mangrove LUE was quantified according to different PAR values. Thirdly, the maximum LUE varied with temperature and was therefore determined based on the response of daytime net ecosystem exchange and PAR at different temperatures. Lastly, GPP was estimated by combining the LUE model with the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation from Sentinel-2 images. The results showed that the LUE model developed for mangrove forests has higher overall accuracy (RMSE = 0.0051, R-2 = 0.64) than the terrestrial model (RMSE = 0.0220, R-2 = 0.24). The main environmental stressor for the photosynthesis of mangrove forests in China was PAR. The estimated GPP was, in general, in agreement with the in-situ measurement from the two carbon flux towers. Compared to the MODIS GPP product, the derived GPP had higher accuracy, with RMSE improving from 39.09 to 19.05 g C/m(2)/8 days in 2012, and from 33.76 to 19.51 g C/m(2)/8 days in 2015. The spatiotemporal distributions of the mangrove GPP revealed that GPP was most strongly controlled by environmental conditions, especially temperature and PAR, as well as the distribution of mangroves. These results demonstrate the potential of the RS-based productivity model for scaling up GPP in mangrove forests, a key to explore the carbon cycle of mangrove ecosystems at national and global scales.

TI  - High resolution inventory and hazard assessment of potentially dangerous glacial lakes in upper Jhelum basin, Kashmir Himalaya, India
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Himalayan Mountain region, a large number of glacial lakes have developed in the recent past due to glacier recession under the influence of climate change. In this study, we used high resolution satellite data such as Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) LISS-IV (5.8 m) and Google earth images supplemented with field survey to generate an updated glacial lake inventory of Upper Jhelum Basin (UJB) of Kashmir Himalaya. The Sentinel-2A (10 m), Landsat-OLI (30 m) and MSS (60 m), and Cartosat-DEM (30 m) were additional data sources used for glacial lake mapping and change detection analysis. A total of 393 glacial lakes covering an area of 21.55 +/- 3.8 km(2) were identified, mapped and inventoried. The lake inventory includes 102 proglacial lakes, 13 supraglacial lakes and 278 unconnected glacial lakes. Using the weighted index-based method, 21 glacial lakes were found as Potentially Dangerous Glacial Lakes (PDGLs). Out of these, 7 lakes were classified as High, 9 as Medium and 5 as Low hazard glacial lakes as per the hazard assessment. Change detection analysis of PDGLs from 1980 to 2020 revealed an increase in area from 5.92 km(2) to 8.46 km(2) thereby, indicating a growth of 2.51 +/- 0.9 km(2)(30%) at a rate of 0.063 km(2)/year. The formation and growth of glacial lakes in this area is attributed to continuous glacier recession under the warming trend of temperature and declining nature of precipitation. In this study, the findings showed that T-avg and T-min are rising significantly at a rate of 0.004oC/year and 0.013oC/year respectively. This study provides an important database for future GLOF studies in the region.

TI  - Ground-truthing predictions of a demographic model driven by land surface temperatures with a weed biocontrol cage experiment
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - Herbivorous insects play important roles in agriculture as pests or as weed biological control agents. Predicting the timing of herbivore insect population development can thus be of paramount importance for agricultural planning and sustainable land management. Numerical simulation models driven by temperature are often used to predict insect pest population build-up in agriculture. Such simulation models intend to use station-derived temperatures to drive the development of the target insect, although this temperature may differ substantially from that experienced by the insect on the plant. To improve the estimations, it has been suggested to replace air temperature in the model by land surface temperature (LST) data. Here, we use a numerical simulation model of insect population dynamics driven by either air temperature (combined with atmospheric temperature soundings) or land surface temperature derived from satellites to predict the population trends of the leaf beetle Ophraella communa, a potential biological control agent of Ambrosia artemisiifolia in Europe. For this, we conducted an extensive field experiment that included caged O. communa populations at five sites along an altitudinal gradient (125-1250 m a.s.l.) in Northern Italy during 2015 and 2016. We compared our model predictions using air or land surface temperature with observed beetle population build-up. Model predictions with both air and land surface temperatures predicted a similar phenology to observed populations but overestimated the abundance of the observed populations. When taking into consideration the error of the two measurement methods, the predictions of the model were in overlapping timeframes. Therefore, the current model driven by LST can be used as a proxy for herbivore impact, which is a novel tool for weed biocontrol.

TI  - Estimating cloud condensation nuclei concentrations from CALIPSO lidar measurements
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a novel methodology to estimate cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations from spaceborne CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations) lidar measurements. The algorithm utilizes (i) the CALIPSO-derived backscatter and extinction coefficient, depolarization ratio, and aerosol subtype information; (ii) the normalized volume size distributions and refractive indices from the CALIPSO aerosol model; and (iii) the MOPSMAP (modelled optical properties of ensembles of aerosol particles) optical modelling package. For each CALIPSO height bin, we first select the aerosol-type specific size distribution and then adjust it to reproduce the extinction coefficient derived from the CALIPSO retrieval. The scaled size distribution is integrated to estimate the aerosol number concentration, which is then used in the CCN parameterizations to calculate CCN concentrations at different supersaturations. To account for the hygroscopicity of continental and marine aerosols, we use the kappa parameterization and correct the size distributions before the scaling step. The sensitivity of the derived CCN concentrations to variations in the initial size distributions is also examined. It is found that the uncertainty associated with the algorithm can range between a factor of 2 and 3. Our results are comparable to results obtained using the POLIPHON (Polarization Lidar Photometer Networking) method for extinction coefficients larger than 0.05 km(-1). An initial application to a case with coincident airborne in situ measurements for independent validation shows promising results and illustrates the potential of CALIPSO for constructing a global height-resolved CCN climatology.

TI  - Water Hyacinth (<i>Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms</i>) Impacts on Land-Use Land-Cover Change Across Northeastern Lake Tana
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the dynamics of land use land cover (LULC) is crucial for the sustainable use of natural resources. This study was intended to analyze the impact of water hyacinth on LULC on Lake Tana, Ethiopia. Satellite images and key informants interview (KII) were sources of the data. Satellite images were captured in October 2010 and 2019 from USGS, and KIIs were conducted with officials and local leaders. Maximum likelihood classification and post-classification were used to analyze the data, and ArcGIS 10.4, Envi 5.3, QGIS 3.12.1 plug in CSP and Excel were tools of data analysis. Spectral separability analysis of endmember files showed that clear windows to separate water hyacinth from other LULC classes were Band 7 VRE, Band 8 NIR and Band 8a Narrow NIR for Sentinel 2 images. The overall classification accuracies of classified images were found to be 95.84% to 98.91%, while the kappa value ranged from 0.93 to 0.97. The land-use land-cover change (LULCC) analysis displayed important changes in the study area. The water hyacinth proliferated from zero in 2010 to 1360.78 ha in 2019 at the expense of water, agricultural land, bare land and other vegetation. The general LULCC of the area from 2010 to 2019 revealed the expansion of water hyacinth, other vegetation and forest with annual rate of 136.08, 312.09 and 58.01 ha, respectively. On the other hand, reduction of area coverage was recorded in agricultural land (115.54 ha/year), water (154.82 ha/year) and bare land (235.8 ha/year). The study concludes that significant LULCC is caused by the water hyacinth, while a continuous assessment of the weed and restoration of healthy the LULC in the lake and surrounding areas is recommended.

TI  - Assessment of the impacts of climate change on drought in an arid area using drought indices and Landsat remote sensing data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LOW-CARBON TECHNOLOGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Located in the arid climatic zone of Algeria, the region of Ain Sefra is a victim of climatic change, which faces several geographical, ecological, economic and even social problems. The present study investigated the relationships between various drought indices and the evolution of land use elements in Ain Sefra from 1977 to 2017 using the Modified Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index. It was revealed that there is a considerable growth of sands estimated at 286.61% of the area, moving toward the north and northeast of the study area during the last decades. The combination of drought indices and remote sensing seems to be most promising, whose results are valuable tools for guidance and decision support to local and regional authorities.

TI  - A global 1-km downscaled SMAP soil moisture product based on thermal inertia theory
T2  - VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Microwave remote sensing technology has been applied to produce soil moisture (SM) retrievals on a global scale for various studies and applications. However, due to the limitations of current technology, the native spatial resolution of currently available passive microwave SM products is on the order of tens of kilometers, and this resolution cannot be used to characterize SM variability on a regional scale. To overcome this limitation, a downscaling algorithm based on the thermal inertia theory-derived relationship between SM and temperature difference was developed using outputs from the Global Land Data Assimilation System-Noah Land Surface Model and the land long-term data record-Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) dataset and applied to the Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer land surface temperature/NDVI data to produce a downscaled 1-km Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) radiometer daily SM product, respectively, at 6:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. on a global scale from 2015 to 2020. The evaluation results reveal that the downscaling model performs better in the middle or low latitudes than in high latitudes. It also performs better in warm months than in cold months. The in situ SM observations from dense networks around the world were used to validate the 1-km and enhanced 9-km SMAP SM data. The validation metrics indicated that both the 1-km and 9-km SM data have overall overestimation trends, and the unbiased RMSE (0.063 m(3) m(-3) on average), mean absolute error (0.052 m(3) m(-3) on average), and spatial standard deviation (0.025 m(3) m(-3) on average) of the 1 km data are generally more accurate than the metrics of the 9-km SM data, which indicates that the downscaled data provide reliable observed SM information.

TI  - Synergy of optical and synthetic aperture radar data for early-stage crop yield estimation: a case study over a state of Germany
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional crop cutting experiment-based yield estimation method captures the regional yield variability but lacks field-level information. Satellite images hold enormous crop information at finer spatial resolution. Crop yield mapping with optical images is particularly challenging if cloud-free images are unavailable during the crucial crop developmental stages. All-weather availability and sensitivity to crop structure, dielectric properties make synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images an excellent resource for yield estimation. Both types of data provide complementary information about crop conditions. A random forest regression model with genetic algorithm-based feature selection is developed to exploit the Sentinel-2 optical and Sentinel-1 SAR images for yield estimation. We utilized the crop harvest and quality survey (BEE) yield data set collected by the Hessisches Statistisches Landesamt (HSL), Wiesbaden, Germany, over 490 fields. We prepared 20 m resolution yield maps for winter wheat, winter barley, winter rye and winter rapeseed. Input features for the yield estimation model are selected based on the prior knowledge of remote sensing of vegetation. Baseline random forest regression models are developed for all the four crop types with optical and SAR input features. An optimized random forest regression model with genetic algorithm-based feature selection results in performance improvement. Dissimilarity in genetic algorithm selected image features highlights the significance of crop-specific feature selection for yield estimation. The optimized models reliably estimate yield by achieving correlation coefficient (r) of 0.65-0.86, mean absolute error 0.93-1.16 t ha(-1) and root mean square error 1.12-1.56 t ha(-1) with BEE yield on testing data set. The proposed models could estimate the intra-field yield variation when winter wheat, winter barley, winter rye were in the shooting phase to the beginning of ear-shifting, and winter rapeseed began to flower or was already flowering. These results demonstrate the merits of our model for early-stage crop yield estimation at the field level with mono-temporal image and adaptability for the cropping season with high cloud cover.

TI  - Surveillance and genetic data support the introduction and establishment of <i>Aedes albopictus</i> in Iowa, USA
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aedes albopictus is a competent vector of several arboviruses that has spread throughout the United States over the last three decades. With the emergence of Zika virus in the Americas in 2015-2016 and an increased need to understand the current distributions of Ae. albopictus in the US, we initiated surveillance efforts to determine the abundance of invasive Aedes species in Iowa. Here, we describe surveillance efforts from 2016 to 2020 in which we detect stable and persistent populations of Aedes albopictus in three Iowa counties. Based on temporal patterns in abundance and genetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA haplotypes between years, our data support that Ae. albopictus are overwintering and have likely become established in the state. The localization of Ae. albopictus predominantly in areas of urbanization, and noticeable absence in rural areas, suggests that these ecological factors may contribute to overwintering success. Together, these data document the establishment of Ae. albopictus in Iowa and their expansion into the Upper Midwest, where freezing winter temperatures were previously believed to limit their spread. With impending climate change, our study provides evidence for the further expansion of Ae. albopictus into temperate regions of the United States resulting in increased risks for vector-borne disease transmission.

TI  - Ipsilateral microcalcifications after breast-conserving surgery: is it possible to differentiate benign from malignant calcifications?
T2  - CLINICAL RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - AIM: To analyse stereotactic biopsies of microcalcifications in patients with previous ipsi-lateral breast-conserving surgery (BCS) to identify the positivity rate, assess for an association between the patient's primary cancer or mammographic appearances of the micro -calcifications, and the risk of recurrence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Relevant patients from 2018-2020 were identified via a retrospective review of the prospectively maintained radiological procedure database. Clini-copathological features of the patients' primary tumour and new calcifications were obtained from the hospital electronic patient record system and the national integrated medical imaging system. RESULTS: Thirty-one percent of recurrences post-ipsilateral BCS presented as isolated microcalcifications on mammography. Fifty-three percent of patients undergoing stereotactic biopsy of ipsilateral calcifications had recurrence. A positive margin status was associated with new or recurrent malignancy. There was no significant correlation between oestrogen-receptor status, sentinel lymph node status, adjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy and the risk of recurrence. Calcifications within the tumour bed were more likely to be benign while calci-fications within the same quadrant but remote from the tumour bed were more likely ma -lignant. All coarse calcifications were benign while 67% of fine linear/fine linear branching and 89% of fine pleomorphic calcifications were malignant. CONCLUSION: Increased time since diagnosis, positive margin status, fine pleomorphic and fine linear calcifications in the same quadrant as the tumour bed were associated with ma-lignancy. Patients with coarse calcifications and calcifications within the tumour bed may avoid stereotactic biopsy and undergo short-interval surveillance. (c) 2021 The Royal College of Radiologists.

TI  - Decaying villages in the centre of Europe with no population decline: Long-term analysis using historical aerial images and remote sensing data
T2  - HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural land abandonment and depopulation of rural areas are a problem observed in numerous regions of the world, especially in Europe. Effectively counteracting this phenomenon requires the development of tools adapted to its nature in a given area as well as the origin and dynamics of observed changes. The article presents a study on the dynamics of land abandonment in central Poland, which has resulted in the complete abandonment of land cultivation of an area of hundreds of square kilometres. Historical stereometric aerial photographs from 1973 and the results of ALS measurements taken in 2012 were used in the study. The historical data was used to generate point data clouds representing the three-dimensional, historical structure of vegetation height in a specific year, with an accuracy similar to that of contemporary ALS measurements. The results obtained were quite surprising because, unlike many other studies of this issue, no intensive depopulation was found, and the change in the age structure, although noticeable, does not differ significantly from the changes observed in the entire population of Poland during the period in question. This approach allows for a very accurate assessment of changes in land use, in particular the process of the abandonment of land use, combined with secondary forest succession and self-reforestation processes. Such an analysis may cover a period of several decades and its results allow a precise diagnosis of the duration and dynamics of abandonment.

TI  - Predictors of axillary node response in node-positive patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The ability to accurately predict which patients will achieve a pathologic complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy could help identify those who could safely be spared the potential morbidity of axillary lymph node dissection. We performed a retrospective analysis of a cohort of clinically node-positive patients managed with neoadjuvant chemotherapy with the goal of identifying predictors of axillary pCR.Methods: Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, had clinical T1-T4, N1-N3, M0 breast cancer and received neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgical axillary lymph node staging between 2001 and 2017 at Misericordia Hospital, Edmonton, Alberta. Patient data, including tumour characteristics, details of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, imaging results before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and final pathologic analysis, were collected from the appropriate provincial electronic data repositories. We summarized the data using descriptive statistics. We characterized associations between clinical/tumour characteristics and pCR using univariate and multivariate regression analysis.Results: Of the 323 patients included in the study, 130 (40.2%) achieved axillary pCR. Absence of residual disease in the breast was associated with axillary pCR (odds ratio 6.74, 95% confidence interval 2.89-15.67). HER2-positive, triple-negative and ER-positive/PR-negative/HER2-negative tumours were significantly associated with a pCR on univariate analysis; the association trended toward significance on multivariate analysis.Conclusion: Our findings support the routine use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with an absence of residual disease in the breast, and potentially in those with HER2-positive or triple-negative subtypes, and highlight the ER-positive/PR-negative biomarker subtype as a potential predictor of nodal response.

TI  - Irrelevant insights make worldviews ring true
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Our basic beliefs about reality can be impossible to prove and yet we can feel a strong intuitive conviction about them, as exemplified by insights that imbue an idea with immediate certainty. Here we presented participants with worldview beliefs such as "people's core qualities are fixed" and simultaneously elicited an aha moment. In the first experiment (N = 3000, which included a direct replication), participants rated worldview beliefs as truer when they solved anagrams and also experienced aha moments. A second experiment (N = 1564) showed that the worldview statement and the aha moment must be perceived simultaneously for this 'insight misattribution' effect to occur. These results demonstrate that artificially induced aha moments can make worldview beliefs seem truer, possibly because humans partially rely on feelings of insight to appraise an idea's veracity. Feelings of insight are therefore not epiphenomenal and should be investigated for their effects on decisions, beliefs, and delusions.

TI  - Resonance Raman and polarized Raman scattering of single-crystal hematite
T2  - JOURNAL OF RAMAN SPECTROSCOPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Researchers have demonstrated that the Raman spectra collected on hematite nanoparticles undergo an intensity enhancement, due to a dependence on excitation energy. Especially, the bands at approximately 660 and approximately 1320 cm(-1), which are assigned as the 1LO and 2LO modes, respectively, experience the strongest intensity enhancement, which has been attributed to resonance Raman scattering when excited with excitation energy at or close to the band gap. However, the resonance Raman scattering mechanism is not clear and further has not been experimentally determined. To this end, we have undertaken measurements to examine the excitation energy dependence and polarized Raman scattering on a pure single-crystal of hematite to gain a better understanding of the resonance enhancement mechanism for the 1LO and 2LO modes. Resonance enhancement mechanisms giving rise to LO phonons in semiconductors can be attributed to either the deformation potential (DP) or Frohlich interactions (F) scattering, or a combination of the two. The DP and F contributions that give rise to LO phonon scattering in semiconductors are distinguishable due to their contrasting selection rules. Here, employing these selection rules, we conducted the following polarization Raman scattering measurements: ZoXXTHORNZ, ZoXYTHORNZ, ZoYYTHORNZ, ZoYXTHORNZ, XoYYTHORNX, XoZZTHORNX, and YoXXTHORNY on single-crystal hematite to distinguish between DP (dipole-allowed) and F (dipole-forbidden) scattering. Our polarization experiments strongly suggest that the Frohlich LO phonon interaction dominates the Raman scattering over the weaker DP contribution. Furthermore, polarization experiments collected using the following geometries Z X 0Xo 0THORNZ and Z Y 0 Yo 0THORNZ demonstrate that the interference between dipoleallowed and dipole-forbidden Raman scattering is constructive for LO phonons. Therefore, we attribute the mechanism of resonance Raman scattering of the 1LO and 2LO modes in the Raman spectrum of hematite due to contributions from F and DP processes.

TI  - Geospatial modelling of rainfall erosivity in the humid tropics using remotely sensed data
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Intense rainfall events characterise the humid tropical small island developing states (HuT-SIDS). Therefore, appropriate computation of rainfall erosivity is essential in predicting soil loss in the face of climate change. The rainfall erosivity index is calculated using kinetic energy and rainfall intensity of individual storm events requiring data that are often unavailable in HuT-SIDS. The objectives of our study were: (i) to investigate event-based rainfall erosivity using two erosive rainfall indices; and (ii) to create iso-erodent lines using Global Precipitation Measurement Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals (GPM IMERG). We developed a Storm Event Tool (SE-TOOL) in the ArcGIS environment using Python scripts to automate the processing of sub-hourly precipitation data. The methodological approach integrated Python Scripts, Model Builder, geostatistical analytics and GPM IMERG data to calculate the erosivity indices, offering a novel approach to soil loss modelling. The results showed that the mean EI30 index, the product of total storm kinetic energy (E) and its maximum continuous 30-min intensity (I-30), was 5080 MJ-mm-/ha-h. The Kinetic Energy greater than 25 mm (KE >25) index, recorded a mean erosivity of 1928 MJ/ha. The difference between the GPM IMERG and the Automated Weather Station was not significant (t (30) = 2.07; p < 0.05, 0.67). EI30 was determined to be the more appropriate erosivity index for predicting soil loss in the HuT-SIDS. The integration of higher temporal and spatial resolution data and including all storm events above the 0 mm threshold, increased the model accuracy, providing baseline data for soil erosion risk assessment.

TI  - Clinical and Economic Impact of COVID-19 on Plantation Workers: Preliminary Results from the Guatemala Agricultural Workers and Respiratory Illness Impact (AGRI) Study.
T2  - medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences
M3  - Preprint
AB  - We evaluated the clinical and socioeconomic burdens of respiratory disease in a cohort of Guatemalan banana plantation workers. All eligible workers were offered enrollment from June 15-December 30, 2020, and annually, then followed for influenza-like illnesses (ILI) through: 1) self-reporting to study nurses, 2) sentinel surveillance at health posts, and 3) absenteeism. Workers with ILI submitted nasopharyngeal swabs for influenza, RSV, and SARS-CoV-2 testing, then completed surveys at days 0, 7, and 28. Through October 10, 2021, 1,833 workers developed 169 ILIs (12.0/100 person-years) and 43 (25.4%) of these ILIs were laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (3.1/100 person-years). Workers with SARS-CoV-2-positive ILI reported more anosmia (p<0.01), dysgeusia (p<0.01), difficulty concentrating (p=0.01), and irritability (p=0.01), and greater clinical and well-being severity scores (Flu-iiQ) than test-negative ILIs; they also had greater absenteeism (p<0.01) and lost income (median US$127.1, p<0.01). These results support the prioritization of Guatemalan farm workers for COVID-19 vaccination.

TI  - Worldview literacy as intercultural citizenship education: A framework for critical, reflexive engagement in plural democracy
T2  - EDUCATION CITIZENSHIP AND SOCIAL JUSTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Within plural democracies, the concept of 'religious literacy' is commonly understood as denoting the knowledge, skills and understanding vis- a -vis religious diversity required of the citizen. In schools across Europe such learning is traditionally housed within Religious Education (RE), the aims of which are increasingly framed in terms of citizenship education, yet the two school subjects are often unhelpfully siloed, and both criticised for lack of criticality and an over-focus on knowledge acquisition. This article introduces the concept of 'worldview literacy' as a reworking of 'religious literacy' that addresses concerns around inclusivity and criticality. Rather than a product of good RE or citizenship education, worldview literacy is envisaged as a transformational process of educational praxis through encounter in plurality, that forges a pathway between the two school subjects and contributes to the broader educational endeavour of engagement in social life.

TI  - Can we detect more ephemeral floods with higher density harmonized Landsat Sentinel 2 data compared to Landsat 8 alone?
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal quantification of surface water and flooding is essential given that floods are among the largest natural hazards. Effective disaster response management requires near real-time information on flood extent. Satellite remote sensing is the only way of monitoring these dynamics across vast areas and over time. Previous water and flood mapping efforts have relied on optical time series, despite cloud contamination. This reliance on optical data is due to the availability of systematically acquired and easily accessible optical data globally for over 40 years. Prior research used either MODIS or Landsat data, trading either high temporal density but lower spatial resolution or lower cadence but higher spatial resolution. Both MODIS and Landsat pose limitations as Landsat can miss ephemeral floods, whereas MODIS misses small floods and inaccurately delineates flood edges. Leveraging high temporal frequency of 3-4 days of the existing Landsat-8 (L8) and two Sentinel-2 (S2) satellites combined, in this research, we assessed whether the increased temporal frequency of the three sensors improves our ability to detect surface water and flooding extent compared to a single sensor (L8 alone). Our study area was Australia's Murray-Darling Basin, one of the world's largest dryland basins that experiences ephemeral floods. We applied machine learning to NASA's Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) Surface Reflectance Product, which combines L8 and S2 observations, to map surface water and flooding dynamics. Our overall accuracy, estimated from a stratified random sample, was 99%. Our user's and producer's accuracy for the water class was 80% (& PLUSMN;3.6%, standard error) and 76% (& PLUSMN;5.8%). We focused on 2019, one of the most recent years when all three HLS sensors operated at full capacity. Our results show that water area (permanent and flooding) identified with the HLS was greater than that identified by L8, and some short-lived flooding events were detected only by the HLS. Comparison with high resolution (3 m) PlanetScope data identified extensive mixed pixels at the 30 m HLS resolution, highlighting the need for improved spatial resolution in future work. The HLS has been able to detect floods in cases when one sensor (L8) alone was not, despite 2019 being one of the driest years in the area, with few flooding events. The dense optical time-series offered by the HLS data is thus critical for capturing temporally dynamic phenomena (i.e., ephemeral floods in drylands), highlighting the importance of harmonized data such as the HLS.

TI  - Effect of silver nanoparticles on gene transcription of land snail <i>Helix aspersa</i>
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) are extremely useful in a diverse range of consumer goods. However, their impact on the environment is still under research, especially regarding the mechanisms involved in their effect. Aiming to provide some insight, the present work analyzes the transcriptional activity of six genes (Hsp83, Hsp17.2, Hsp19.8, SOD Cu-Zn, Mn-SOD, and BPI) in the terrestrial snail Helix aspersa in the presence of different concentrations of Ag-NPs. The animals were exposed for seven days to Lactuca sativa soaked for one hour in different concentrations of Ag-NPs (20, 50, 100 mg/L). The results revealed that the highest concentration tested of Ag-NPs (100 mg/L) led to a statistically significant induction of the Hsp83 and BPI expression in the digestive gland compared to the control group. However, a trend to upregulation with no statistical significance was observed for all the genes in the digestive gland and the foot, while in the hemolymph, the trend was to downregulation. Ag-NPs affected the stress response and immunity under the tested conditions, although the impact was weak. It is necessary to explore longer exposure times to confirm that the effect can be maintained and impact on health. Our results highlight the usefulness of the terrestrial snail Helix aspersa as a bioindicator organism for silver nanoparticle pollution biomonitoring and, in particular, the use of molecular biomarkers of pollutant effect as candidates to be included in a multi-biomarker strategy.

TI  - Psychological ownership of nature: A conceptual elaboration and research agenda
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Psychological ownership, i.e., the sense that an object is "mine/ours", has been adapted from the organisational psychology literature and applied to the environmental sphere to promote individuals' conservation behaviours. However, the concept-"psychological ownership of nature"-requires greater scrutiny to inform its usefulness in human dimensions of conservation. Our paper conceptually explores whether nature could be viable objects for ownership feelings. We theoretically differentiate psychological ownership of nature, with sense/feelings of ownership toward nature being the conceptual core, from other similar concepts like place attachment and connection to nature. We also discuss that psychological ownership of nature may effectively elicit conservation behaviours in individuals with strong anthropocentric worldviews but be less influential for those with high ecocentric beliefs. Psychological ownership of nature might also result in adverse outcomes (e.g., nature exploitation). This paper contributes a conceptual elaboration of psychological ownership of nature and its research agenda in conservation.

TI  - Evaluation of the effectiveness of BG-Sentinel and CDC light traps in assessing the abundance, richness, and community composition of mosquitoes in rural and natural areas
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Vector-borne diseases are a major burden to public health. Controlling mosquitoes is considered the most effective way to prevent vector-borne disease transmission. Mosquito surveillance is a core component of integrated vector management, as surveillance programs are often the cornerstone for the development of mosquito control operations. Two traps are the most commonly used for the surveillance of adult mosquitoes: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention miniature light trap (CDC light trap) and BG-Sentinel trap (BioGents, Regensburg, Germany). However, despite the importance of the BG-Sentinel trap in surveillance programs in the United States, especially in the Southern states, its effectiveness in consistently and reliably collecting mosquitoes in rural and natural areas is still unknown. We hypothesized that BG-Sentinel and CDC light traps would be more attractive to specific mosquito species present in rural and natural areas. Therefore, our objective was to compare the relative abundance, species richness, and community composition of mosquitoes collected in natural and rural areas by BG-Sentinel and CDC light traps.Methods: Mosquitoes were collected from October 2020 to March 2021 using BG-Sentinel and CDC light traps baited with dry ice, totaling 105 trap-nights.Results: The BG-Sentinel traps collected 195,115 mosquitoes comprising 23 species from eight genera, and the CDC light traps collected 188,594 mosquitoes comprising 23 species from eight genera. The results from the permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) and generalized estimating equation model for repeated measures indicate the BG-Sentinel and CDC light traps had similar sampling power.Conclusion: Even though BG-Sentinel traps had a slightly better performance, the difference was not statistically significant indicating that both traps are suitable to be used in mosquito surveillance in rural and natural areas.

TI  - Terrestrial carbon sinks in China and around the world and their contribution to carbon neutrality
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-LIFE SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Enhancing the terrestrial ecosystem carbon sink (referred to as terrestrial C sink) is an important way to slow down the continuous increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration and to achieve carbon neutrality target. To better understand the characteristics of terrestrial C sinks and their contribution to carbon neutrality, this review summarizes major progress in terrestrial C budget researches during the past decades, clarifies spatial patterns and drivers of terrestrial C sources and sinks in China and around the world, and examines the role of terrestrial C sinks in achieving carbon neutrality target. According to recent studies, the global terrestrial C sink has been increasing from a source of (-0.2 +/- 0.9) Pg C yr(-1) (1 Pg=10(15) g) in the 1960s to a sink of (1.9 +/- 1.1) Pg C yr(-1) in the 2010s. By synthesizing the published data, we estimate terrestrial C sink of 0.20-0.25 Pg C yr(-1) in China during the past decades, and predict it to be 0.15-0.52 Pg C yr(-1) by 2060. The terrestrial C sinks are mainly located in the mid- and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, while tropical regions act as a weak C sink or source. The C balance differs much among ecosystem types: forest is the major C sink; shrubland, wetland and farmland soil act as C sinks; and whether the grassland functions as C sink or source remains unclear. Desert might be a C sink, but the magnitude and the associated mechanisms are still controversial. Elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration, nitrogen deposition, climate change, and land cover change are the main drivers of terrestrial C sinks, while other factors such as fires and aerosols would also affect ecosystem C balance. The driving factors of terrestrial C sink differ among regions. Elevated CO2 concentration and climate change are major drivers of the C sinks in North America and Europe, while afforestation and ecological restoration are additionally important forcing factors of terrestrial C sinks in China. For future studies, we recommend the necessity for intensive and long term ecosystem C monitoring over broad geographic scale to improve terrestrial biosphere models for accurately evaluating terrestrial C budget and its dynamics under various climate change and policy scenarios.

TI  - Feasibility of Magnetic Technique for Axillary Staging after Neoadjuvant Therapy in Breast Cancer Patients
T2  - JOURNAL OF INVESTIGATIVE SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Optimal axillary staging after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in node-negative breast cancer is an area of controversy. Sentinel node biopsy with Technetium-sulphur colloid (99m Tc) alone or with blue dye is the recommended technique for evaluating axilla in these patients. However, this technique has drawbacks such as limited access to nuclear departments and timing limitations related to Tc injection exposing patients to unnecessary radiation. Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIO) may represent a valid option for SLN biopsy. In this study, we assessed the feasibility of the magnetic technique (Sentimag) with combination of isosulfan blue dye in breast cancer patients who received NAC. Methods The study sample consisted of 54 female breast cancer patients who received NAC. Sentinel node localization was performed using magnetic technique and blue dye. Sentinel node identification rate (IFR) of magnetic technique was calculated and postoperative complications were assessed. Results Sentinel lymph node was detected in 52 patients with Sentimag method (identification rate = 96.3%, 95% CI: 87.4-98.9%). Blue dye was successful to find SLN in 38 patients (identification rate = 70%). The most common histologic type was invasive ductal (n = 51; 94.4%). Mean tumor size was 2.1 cm after NAC. Most of patients had T2 (n = 30; 55.5%) and HER2 + positive (n = 49; 90.7%) cancer. Conclusion Sentimag which is a magnetic technique appears to be safe, easy to perform with minimal adverse effects, may be an alternative and accurate technique in patients with NAC, especially in breast units where nuclear medicine unit is not available.

T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and rising sea level is transforming global coastlines as corroborated by significant changes in the position of shoreline witnessed through coastal erosion or accretion. Andhra Pradesh has the second longest (972 km) coastline in India. The present study analyzed shoreline change and its future prediction by employing satellite-derived data and geographic information system. End point rate (EPR) and linear regression rate (LRR) statistical tools in the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) were used to estimate historical shoreline change rate between 1973 and 2015. Erosion and accretion of the coastline were delineated from Landsat satellite images for 1973, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2015; subsequently, shoreline is predicted for short-term (2025) and long-term (2050) periods. The study showcased that the river mouths of Krishna and Godavari experienced higher rate of change in shoreline position influenced by the deltaic environment and fluvial processes. LRR model prediction depicts the average rate of shoreline change during 2015-2025 will be -4.64 m, while between 2015 and 2050 it will increase to -16.25 m. The study observed that the error between predicted and actual shoreline is higher in the river mouth and deltaic plains. Predicted shoreline position will provide baseline information for adaptation strategies and policy framework for coastal management.

TI  - Influence of modeling domain and meteorological forcing data on daily evapotranspiration estimates from a Shuttleworth-Wallace model using Sentinel-2 surface reflectance data
T2  - IRRIGATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable use of available water resources in viticulture can be aided by frequent high-resolution information on vineyard water status. Recently, a new Shuttleworth-Wallace evapotranspiration (ET) model, which uses a contextual framework to determine dry and wet extremes from the Sentinel-2 surface reflectance data (SW-S2), showed promising results when tested over a GRAPEX (Grape Remote-sensing Atmospheric Profile and ET eXperiment) site in California. However, current knowledge on its applicability across the climate gradient in California and how the selections of modeling domain and meteorological data influence model outputs are limited. This study expands the evaluation of the SW-S2 model across multiple domains and meteorological inputs covering all three GRAPEX sites over the 2018-2020 growing seasons. In comparison with flux tower observations, the size of the modeling domain did not have a strong influence on model performance, although the model performed marginally better under a larger domain (yielding root mean square error within 1.03-1.11 mm d(-1) and mean biases within 2%). The source and quality of meteorological forcing data, in particular vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and wind speed (u), were found to have a strong influence on model output as indicated by the poor performance of the model with less accurate regional and coarse-scale gridded meteorological inputs. Results suggest that simple regression for local bias correction of VPD and u significantly improved model performance. Overall, this study supports future research aiming to merge outputs from more frequent spectral and less frequent thermal-based ET models and reduce latency in ET monitoring of California vineyards.

TI  - The Einstein effect provides global evidence for scientific source credibility effects and the influence of religiosity
T2  - NATURE HUMAN BEHAVIOUR
M3  - Article
AB  - People tend to evaluate information from reliable sources more favourably, but it is unclear exactly how perceivers' worldviews interact with this source credibility effect. In a large and diverse cross-cultural sample (N = 10,195 from 24 countries), we presented participants with obscure, meaningless statements attributed to either a spiritual guru or a scientist. We found a robust global source credibility effect for scientific authorities, which we dub 'the Einstein effect': across all 24 countries and all levels of religiosity, scientists held greater authority than spiritual gurus. In addition, individual religiosity predicted a weaker relative preference for the statement from the scientist compared with the spiritual guru, and was more strongly associated with credibility judgements for the guru than the scientist. Independent data on explicit trust ratings across 143 countries mirrored our experimental findings. These findings suggest that irrespective of one's religious worldview, across cultures science is a powerful and universal heuristic that signals the reliability of information.Across 24 countries, Hoogeveen et al. found that gobbledegook coming from a scientist was considered more credible than when coming from a spiritual guru. This 'Einstein effect' was less pronounced for religious individuals.

TI  - The effect of spring flooding on management and distribution of cotton bollworm (<i>Helicoverpa armigera</i>) by flood mapping using SAR sentinel-1 and optical imagery landsat-8; a case study in golestan province, Iran
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PEST MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - On March 2019 a severe flood episode inundated large agricultural areas of Golestan province, in northern Iran. In this study, we assessed the impacts of the flooding episode on cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). To do so, a network of pheromone-bait traps distributed throughout Golestan was installed and used to weekly record moth captures from May to September. The interpolated spatial distribution of cotton bollworm infestation by the Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) interpolation method was overlaid by satellite-imagery flood maps. Flood extent maps were provided by seven mosaicked images of Sentinel-1. In addition to SAR products, a 15 m-NDWI of Landsat-8 was used. The flood extent based on NDWI (pan-sharped 15 m) was 52752 ha (47423 ha based on slope mask). Using ground control points of flooded and non-flooded areas within the supervised SVM classification procedure, the kappa coefficient (kappa) was as 0.89 and 0.91 for VH polarization and NDWI, respectively. Our results showed a reduction in moth populations in the areas that were flooded in spring for the earlier generations of H. armigera.

TI  - Epidemiology of Hospital Admissions for Craniosynostosis in Australia: A Population-Based Study
T2  - CLEFT PALATE CRANIOFACIAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To describe trends, age, and sex-specific patterns of population hospital admissions with a diagnosis of craniosynostosis (CS) in Australia. Data Source Population data for hospital separations (in-patient) from public and private hospitals (July 1996-June 2018) were obtained from the publicly available Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) National Hospital Morbidity Database. Main outcome measures The outcome variables were hospital separation rates (HSR) (number of hospital separations divided by the estimated resident population [ERP] per year) and average length of stay (aLOS) (patient days divided by the number of hospital separations) with a diagnosis of CS. Trends in HSR and aLOS adjusted for age, sex, and type of CS were investigated by negative binomial regression presented as annual percent change (APC). Results In 8057 admissions identified, we observed no significant change in the annual trend for HSR for the 22-year period. However, a marginal annual decrease of 1.6% (95% CI: -0.7, -2.4) in the aLOS was identified for the same time period. HSR were higher for males, infants, and single suture synostosis. aLOS was 3.8 days (95% CI: 3.8, 3.9) per visit, longer for syndromic conditions. Conclusion There was a minor reduction in the average length of hospital stay for CS over the 22-year period potentially indicative of improved care. Population-level information on hospitalisations for rare craniofacial conditions can inform research, clinical, and surgical practice.

TI  - Study on Sentinel Lymph Node and Its Lymphatic Drainage Pattern of Breast Cancer by Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound
T2  - JOURNAL OF ULTRASOUND IN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives Sentinel lymph node (SLN) and its lymphatic drainage pattern (LDP) of breast cancer were studied by contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS). Methods From July 2017 to December 2019, patients with SLN localization of breast cancer in Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences center dot Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital were selected. The sentinel lymph system of breast cancer was observed by CEUS before both operation and blue staining in the surgery. The location, number, and route of sentinel lymphatic channel (SLC) were recorded, along with the number, size, and the depth from skin of SLN. LDPs were summarized according to these basic characteristics of SLC and SLN. Results A total of 368 cases were included; 465 SLCs and 423 SLNs were detected. Most of the SLCs were originated from the outer upper quadrant of areola. Eleven LDPs were found, including 31 subtypes of LDPs. There were 6 cases of type A (1.63%), 15 cases of type B (4.08%), 223 cases of type C (57.88%), 38 cases of type D (10.33%), 2 cases of type E (0.54%), 3 cases of type F (0.82%), 50 cases of type G (13.59%), 30 cases of type H (8.15%), 2 cases of type I (0.54%), 6 cases of type J (1.63%), and 3 cases of type K (0.82%). Conclusions The most common LDP of breast cancer was one SLC originated from the upper quadrant of areola with one SLN. CEUS can identify the LDP before surgery to reduce the false negative rate of SLN biopsy.

TI  - Incidence of Sindbis Virus in Hospitalized Patients With Acute Fevers of Unknown Cause in South Africa, 2019-2020
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundSindbis virus (SINV) is a mosquito-borne alphavirus that is widely distributed worldwide. Little is known about the febrile and neurological disease burden due to SINV in South Africa. Patients and MethodsClinical samples of patients with acute febrile disease of unknown cause (AFDUC) were collected through the African Network for Improved Diagnostics, Epidemiology and Management of Common Infectious Agents at three sentinel hospital surveillance sites in South Africa. In total, 639 patients were screened using a PCR-based macroarray that can simultaneously detect nucleic acids of 30 pathogens, including SINV, from January 2019 to December 2020. Serum samples were randomly selected from the arbovirus season (January-June) and also screened with a commercial indirect immunofluorescence assay for anti-SINV IgM. In addition, 31 paired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens from the same patients were screened for IgM. Micro-neutralization assays were performed on all IgM-positive samples. ResultsNone of the specimens tested positive for SINV by molecular screening; however, 38/197 (19.0%) samples were positive for SINV-specific IgM. A total of 25/38 (65.8%) IgM-positive samples tested positive for SINV-neutralizing antibodies, giving an overall incidence of 12.7%. Furthermore, 2/31 (6.5%) CSF specimens tested positive for IgM but were negative for neutralizing antibodies. There was a higher incidence of SINV-positive cases in Mpumalanga (26.0%) than Gauteng province (15.0%). The most significant months for IgM-positive cases were April 2019 (OR = 2.9, p < 0.05), and May 2020 (OR = 7.7, p < 0.05). ConclusionSINV or a closely related virus contributed to 12.7% of AFDUC cases in hospitalized patients during the late summer and autumn months in South Africa and was significantly associated with arthralgia, meningitis, and headaches.

TI  - Year-to-year variability of oil pollution along the Eastern Arabian Sea: The impact of COVID-19 imposed lock-downs
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the year-to-year variability in the occurrence, abundance and sources of oil spills in the Eastern Arabian Sea (EAS) using sentinel-1 imagery and identified the potential oil spills vulnerable zones. The four consecutive year's data acquired from 2017 to 2020 (March-May) reveal three oil spill hot spot zones. The ship-based oil spills were dominant over zone's-1 (off Gujarat) and 3 (off Karnataka and Kerala), and the oil field based over zone-2 (off Maharashtra). The abundance of oil spills was significantly low in zone-1, only 14.30km(2) (1.2%) during lock-down due to the covid-19 pandemic. Whereas, the year-to-year oil spills over zone's 2 and 3 are not significantly varied (170.29 km(2) and 195.01 km(2)), further suggesting the influence of oil exploration and international tanker traffic are in operation during the lock-down. This study further recommends that manual clustering is the best method to study the distribution of unknown oil spills.

TI  - Th17 CD4+T-Cell as a Preferential Target for HIV Reservoirs
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Among CD4+ T-cells, T helper 17 (Th17) cells play a sentinel role in the defense against bacterial/fungal pathogens at mucosal barriers. However, Th17 cells are also highly susceptible to HIV-1 infection and are rapidly depleted from gut mucosal sites, causing an imbalance of the Th17/Treg ratio and impairing cytokines production. Consequently, damage to the gut mucosal barrier leads to an enhanced microbial translocation and systemic inflammation, a hallmark of HIV-1 disease progression. Th17 cells' expression of mucosal homing receptors (CCR6 and alpha 4 beta 7), as well as HIV receptors and co-receptors (CD4, alpha 4 beta 7, CCR5, and CXCR4), contributes to susceptibility to HIV infection. The up-regulation of numerous intracellular factors facilitating HIV production, alongside the downregulation of factors inhibiting HIV, helps to explain the frequency of HIV DNA within Th17 cells. Th17 cells harbor long-lived viral reservoirs in people living with HIV (PLWH) receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). Moreover, cell longevity and the proliferation of a fraction of Th17 CD4 T cells allow HIV reservoirs to be maintained in ART patients.

TI  - "Folly of the Fiction" and the "Native Taste": Cultural Interfaces in Two Bengali Adaptations of <i>Cymbeline</i>
T2  - LITERATURE COMPASS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article examines how two nineteenth-century Bengali adaptations of Cymbeline transfer Shakespeare's play to a Hindu field of signifiers and reinterpret the elements of tragicomedy according to the worldview of traditional Indian drama. Kusumkumari Natak (1868) by Chandrakali Ghosh, which was enacted before a ticket-buying audience at the nascent phase of the Bengali public theatre in Kolkata (formerly Calcutta), condenses or rejects much of the action and dialogue of Cymbeline for the sake of economy. For example, it excludes Cloten and the confusion over his beheading and discards Posthumus's dream together with the prophetic riddle. On the other hand, Sushila Birsingha (1868) by Satyendranath Tagore, which was probably never staged, follows the convoluted plot and characterisation of Cymbeline quite closely. Cymbeline would appeal to the Bengali audience because it recalls traditional Hindu tales of reunion and reconciliation, including those of Sakuntala-Dushyanta (referenced by Kusumkumari Natak) and Damayanti-Nala (referenced by Sushila Birsingha). Moreover, Innogen's ordeals would be compatible with the trope of the abandoned faithful wife (as exemplified by Sita, Sakuntala, Damayanti) in Sanskrit epic and drama. This would also enable the valorisation of wifely fidelity and chastity, a favourite topic of Hindu patriarchal imagination in the nineteenth century. More importantly, the theme of loss and recuperation inherent in Cymbeline accords with the episteme and aesthetics of classical Sanskrit drama, which avoided exploring grave moral challenges and rejected the finality of sufferings (thanks to the doctrines of Vedanta or monistic theism, karma and reincarnation). This article also suggests that Cymbetine fell out of favour with subsequent Bengali translators and playgoers as the taste for tragedy grew among them.

TI  - Subfield maize yield prediction improves when in-season crop water deficit is included in remote sensing imagery-based models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In-season prediction of crop yield is a topic of research studied by several scientists using different methods. Seasonal forecasts provide critical insights to different stakeholders who use the information for strategic and tactical decisions. In this study, we propose a novel scalable method to forecast in season subfield crop yield through a machine learning model based on remotely sensed imagery and data from a process-based crop model on a cumulative crop drought index (CDI) designed to capture the impact of in-season crop water deficit on crops. To evaluate the performance of our proposed model, we used 352 growers' fields of different sizes across the states of Michigan, Indiana, Iowa, and Illinois, with 2520 respective yield maps generated by combine harvesters equipped with precise high-resolution yield monitor sensor, over multiple years (from 2006 up to 2019). We obtained high resolution digital elevation model, climate, and soil data to execute the SALUS model, a processbased crop model, to calculate the CDI for each field used in the study. We used Landsat Analysis Ready Dataset (ARD) products generated by USGS as image source to calculate the green chlorophyll vegetation index (GCVI). We found that the inclusion of the CDI in remote sensing-based random forest models substantially improved inseason subfield corn yield prediction. The addition of the CDI in the yield prediction model showed that the greatest improvements in predictions were observed in the driest year (2012) in our case study. The proposed approach also showed that the subfield spatial variations of corn yield are better captured with the inclusion of CDI for most fields. The earliest prediction in the growing season with GCVI and CDI together outperformed the latest prediction with GCVI alone, highlighting the potential of CDI for predicting spatial variability of maize yield around grain filling period, which is on average close to two months before typical crop harvest in the US Midwest.

TI  - The Backfire Effect After Correcting Misinformation Is Strongly Associated With Reliability
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-GENERAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The backfire effect is when a correction increases belief in the very misconception it is attempting to correct, and it is often used as a reason not to correct misinformation. The current study aimed to test whether correcting misinformation increases belief more than a no-correction control. Furthermore, we aimed to examine whether item-level differences in backfire rates were associated with test-retest reliability or theoretically meaningful factors. These factors included worldview-related attributes, including perceived importance and strength of precorrection belief, and familiarity-related attributes, including perceived novelty and the illusory truth effect. In 2 nearly identical experiments, we conducted a longitudinal pre/post design with N = 388 and 532 participants. Participants rated 21 misinformation items and were assigned to a correction condition or test-retest control. We found that no items backfired more in the correction condition compared to test-retest control or initial belief ratings. Item backfire rates were strongly negatively correlated with item reliability (rho = -.61/-.73) and did not correlate with worldview-related attributes. Familiarity-related attributes were significantly correlated with backfire rate, though they did not consistently account for unique variance beyond reliability. While there have been previous papers highlighting the nonreplicable nature of backfire effects, the current findings provide a potential mechanism for this poor replicability. It is crucial for future research into backfire effects to use reliable measures, report the reliability of their measures, and take reliability into account in analyses. Furthermore, fact-checkers and communicators should not avoid giving corrective information due to backfire concerns.

TI  - To Plant or Not to Plant: When can Planting Facilitate Mangrove Restoration?
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Global change processes such as sea level rise and the increasing frequency of severe storms threaten many coastlines around the world and trigger the need for interventions to make these often densely-populated areas safer. Mangroves could be implemented in Nature-Based Flood Defense, provided that we know how to conserve and restore these ecosystems at those locations where they are most needed. In this study, we investigate how best to restore mangroves along an aquaculture coast that is subject to land-subsidence, comparing two common mangrove restoration methods: 1) mangrove restoration by planting and 2) Ecological Mangrove Restoration (EMR); the assistance of natural mangrove regeneration through mangrove habitat restoration. Satellite data revealed that historically, landward mangrove expansion into the active pond zone has mainly occurred through mangrove planting on pond bunds. However, there is potential to create greenbelts along waterways by means of EMR measures, as propagule trap data from the field revealed that propagules of pioneer species were up to 21 times more abundant in creeks of the pond zone than near their source in the coastal zone. This was especially true during the prevailing onshore winds of the wet-season, suggesting that smart seasonal sluice gate management could help to efficiently trap seeds in target ponds. In the coastal zone, field experiments showed that permeable brushwood dams, aimed at expanding mangrove habitat, could not sufficiently overcome subsidence rates to increase natural mangrove expansion in the seaward direction, but did significantly increase the survival of already established (planted) seedlings compared to more wave-exposed sites. The survival and growth rate of EMR-supported plantings greatly varied between species. Out of the four planted species, Rhizophora mucronata had the highest survival (67%) but the lowest growth rate. Whereas the pioneer species Avicennia alba and Avicennia marina had lower survival rates (resp. 35 and 21%), but significantly higher growth rates, even resulting in fruiting young trees within a 16-month timeframe. Overall, we conclude that 1) EMR has potential in the pond zone, given that propagules were observed to reach well into the backwaters; and 2) that mangrove recovery in the coastal zone may be facilitated even at very challenging coastal sites by combining EMR with the planting of pioneer species.

TI  - High-resolution mapping of water photovoltaic development in China through satellite imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Renewable energy is crucial to address climate change and achieve carbon neutrality. Within the existing technologies, photovoltaics is one of the most promising renewable energies. However, large-scale development of photovoltaics always needs a large amount of space, competing for land with other usages. Installing photovoltaics on water surfaces such as lakes and reservoirs is one of the major solutions to solve the contradiction between photovoltaic development and land shortage. In recent years, many countries have been actively promoting the development of water photovoltaic (WPV) to reduce carbon emission and meet increased energy demand, of which China is far ahead. Mapping the spatial distribution of WPV with satellite image time series will help reveal the spatial distribution, assess the scale and future potential of national WPV development, and understand its environmental impact. However, studies and reliable spatial data on the extent and distribution of WPV are still lacking. To address this gap, we proposed a classification algorithm based on Random Forest to extract WPV features and determine the types of the WPV from the Sentinel time series. The results show that the area of WPV in China reached 165 km(2) in 2019, with an average annual growth of 43.8 km(2) from 2016 to 2019. Among them, Stationary Photovoltaic (SPV) accounts for 95% of the total WPV, while Floating Photovoltaic (FPV) only accounts for 5%. Based on our WPV mapping results, we estimated the installed capacity and power generation of WPV would be approximately 6911 MW and 7.8 TWh yr(-1), accounting for 3.4% and 3.5% of the total cumulative installed PV capacity and total PV power generation, respectively. This study provides an efficient and robust approach for extracting WPV at a large scale. The WPV data can be a valuable supplement to official tabulate data because it contains much finer spatial information that can assist stakeholders with future WPV planning and environmental impact assessment.

TI  - Active fires show an increasing elevation trend in the tropical highlands
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - As an inherent element of the Earth's ecosystem, forest, and vegetation fires are one of the key contributors to and direct consequences of climate change. Given that topography is one of the key drivers of forest landscapes and fire behavior, it is important to clarify what the topographical characteristics and trends of global fire events are, particularly in the tropics. Here, we have investigated the variations in elevation of active fires at the continental to a global scale, including the tropics, the extra-tropics, the lowlands, and the highlands (greater than 200 m above sea level [asl]), using the available MODIS Collection 6 active fire products (2001-2019). The main conclusions are: (1) the annual totality (average of 4.5 million) of global active fire events decreased and over 97% of them occurred frequently below 1500 m asl. (2) The tropics and the highlands accounted for similar to 74% (+/- 3%) and 71% (+/- 2%) of global active fires, respectively, and 77% (+/- 2%) were observed in the tropical highlands. (3) From the beginning of the 21st century, active fires in the highlands displayed an upward elevational trend, particularly in the tropics, while the opposite trend was observed for the lowlands. More importantly, the rate of the increasing elevation in the highlands had a greater magnitude than that of decreasing elevation in the lowlands. (4) Finally, the United Nations collaborative program on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (UN-REDD) in Developing Countries seemed to slow down or even result in a reversal of the upward elevational trend of fire occurrences in the tropics for the partner countries, especially in the lowlands. In the context of global climate change and rampant fires, the trend of rising elevation for active fire occurrences, particularly in the tropical highlands, indicates that more vegetation burning events occur or will occur in hilly to mountainous areas, thus posing further threats to tropical forests and some important biodiversity refuges. More sustained efforts should be made by governments and the scientific community to instigate enhanced fire management practices and to conduct in-depth research programs.

TI  - Mapping the annual dynamics of land cover in Beijing from 2001 to 2020 using Landsat dense time series stack
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Compared to change detection using two-dates satellite images, monitoring the changes at high temporal frequencies using dense observations can provide more comprehensive understanding of the land cover dynamics for a given place. Beijing, the capital of China, has undergone fast urban growth in the past decades. The existing studies on Landsat-derived land cover dynamics in Beijing mainly focus on 5- or 10-year intervals, or annual mapping of single land cover type; however, the dynamics of all-types land cover in Beijing at one-year scale were rarely investigated. To fill this research gap, we presented a time-series land-cover mapping approach by combining the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) algorithm with Markov random field (MRF) model to explore the annual dynamics of land cover in Beijing from 2001 to 2020 using Landsat time series. First, the annual land cover maps for Beijing were generated using CCDC algorithm. Then, the MRF model was applied to annual land cover maps to alleviate the salt and pepper noise arising from the classification of CCDC at the pixel level. Results showed that CCDC-MRF proposed in this study could produce temporally and spatially consistent results which have higher annual average overall accuracy (81.93%) than the results derived from CCDC (79.18%). In addition, the accuracy of annual land cover changes for CCDC-MRF was 92.50% in spatial domain and 80.49% in temporal domain, which were higher than the results for CCDC with 89.36% in spatial domain and 78.38% in temporal domain. The major land cover change in Beijing over the last two decades was characterized by urban expansion with the replacement of cultivated land, leading to 13.53% of cultivated land being replaced by artificial impervious surface, mainly occurring between the fifth and sixth ring roads. The method proposed in this study could generate accurate land cover maps at high temporal frequencies and the findings of this research could provide a better understanding for sustainable urban development and management.

TI  - Nanoparticle-assisted axillary staging: an alternative approach after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with pretreatment node-positive breast cancers
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose In order to achieve an optimized method of axillary staging after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer patients with pretreatment positive axillary lymph nodes, we evaluated the feasibility and accuracy of nanoparticle-assisted axillary staging (NAAS) which combines carbon nanoparticles with standard sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) with radioisotope and blue dye. Methods Invasive breast cancer patients with pre-NAC positive axillary lymph nodes who converted to ycN0 and received surgeries from November 2020 to March 2021 were included. All patients underwent ipsilateral NAAS followed by axillary lymph node dissection. Detection rate (DR), false-negative rate (FNR), negative predictive value (NPV) and accuracy of axillary staging were calculated. Results Eighty of 136 (58.8%) breast cancer patients converted to ycN0 after NAC and received NAAS. The DR, NPV and accuracy was 95.0%, 93.3% and 97.4% for NAAS, respectively. And the FNR was 4.2% (2/48) for NAAS, which was lower than that of standard dual-tracer SLNB (SD-SLNB) (9.5%, 4/42). Pretreatment clinical T4 classification was a risk factor for detection failure in NAAS (p = 0.016). When patients with pretreatment inflammatory breast cancers were excluded from analysis, FNR dropped to 2.2% (1/45) for NAAS. Conclusion NAAS revealed great performance in invasive breast cancer patients with pre-NAC positive axillary lymph nodes who converted to ycN0. The application of NAAS reached a better balance between more accurate axillary evaluation and less intervention. Trial registration Chictr.org.cn (ChiCTR2000039814). Registered Nov 11, 2020.

TI  - Exploring the relationships between ground-measured particulate matter and satellite-retrieved aerosol parameters in China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations from 367 cities in China were integrated with MODIS-retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Angstrom exponent (AE) data to explore the relationship between ground-measured surface particle concentrations and remote-sensing aerosol parameters. The impact of meteorological and topographical factors and seasonality were also taken into consideration and the partial least squares (PLS) regression model was adopted to evaluate the effects of surface particulate matter (PM) concentration and meteorological factors on the variation of aerosol parameters. PM concentrations and aerosol parameters all presented strong spatial disparity and seasonal patterns in China. After implementation of stringent clean air actions and policies, both the ground-measured and satellite-retrieved aerosol parameters revealed that the concentrations of suspended particles in China's cities declined dramatically from 2015 to 2018. The PM/AOD ratio showed conspicuous south-north and west-east differences. The ratio was strongly correlated to meteorological and topographic factors, and it tended to be higher in arid and less polluted regions. Moreover, the dominant factors affecting seasonal PM/AOD ratios varied among China's five regions. The correlations of daily PM-AOD were always strong in southwest China and in basin terrain (e.g., Sichuan Basin and Tarim Basin). In contrast, the PM-AOD correlation was found to be negative in some cities on the Tibetan Plateau because local relative humidity makes a greater contribution to AOD variation. Since the climate is arid and the ratio of coarse particles (e.g., PM10) is much higher, PM tended to have a significantly negative correlation with AE in northwestern cities. Whereas in many southern cities, PM was positively correlated with AE because of the area's high relative humidity and aerosol hygroscopic properties.

TI  - Neighborhood environmental exposures and incidence of attention deficit/ hyperactivity disorder: A population-based cohort study
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Emerging studies have associated low greenspace and high air pollution exposure with risk of child attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Population-based studies are limited, however, and joint effects are rarely evaluated. We investigated associations of ADHD incidence with greenspace, air pollution, and noise in a population-based birth cohort.Methods: We assembled a cohort from administrative data of births from 2000 to 2001 (N similar to 37,000) in Metro Vancouver, Canada. ADHD was identified by hospital records, physician visits, and prescriptions. Cox propor-tional hazards models were applied to assess associations between environmental exposures and ADHD incidence adjusting for available covariates. Greenspace was estimated using vegetation percentage derived from linear spectral unmixing of Landsat imagery. Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were esti-mated using land use regression models; noise was estimated using a deterministic model. Exposure period was from birth until the age of three. Joint effects of greenspace and PM2.5 were analysed in two-exposure models and by categorizing values into quintiles.Results: During seven-year follow-up, 1217 ADHD cases were diagnosed. Greenspace was associated with lower incidence of ADHD (hazard ratio, HR: 0.90 [0.81-0.99] per interquartile range increment), while PM2.5 was associated with increased incidence (HR: 1.11 [1.06-1.17] per interquartile range increment). NO2 (HR: 1.01 [0.96, 1.07]) and noise (HR: 1.00 [0.95, 1.05]) were not associated with ADHD. There was a 50% decrease in the HR for ADHD in locations with the lowest PM2.5 and highest greenspace exposure, compared to a 62% increase in HR in locations with the highest PM2.5 and lowest greenspace exposure. Effects of PM2.5 were attenuated by greenspace in two-exposure models.Conclusions: We found evidence suggesting environmental inequalities where children living in greener neigh-borhoods with low air pollution had substantially lower risk of ADHD compared to those with higher air pollution and lower greenspace exposure.

TI  - Estimation of fractional vegetation cover dynamics based on satellite remote sensing in pakistan: A comprehensive study on the FVC and its drivers
T2  - JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The present investigation exposes the significant variations of Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC) and dri-vers from year 2003 to 2013 in Pakistan. It is directly calculated by remote-sensing data using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (MODIS-NDVI) and Compound Night Light Index/Defense Meteorological Program/Operational Line-Scan System (CNLI/ DMSP/OLS). The spatial patterns of FVC variation are mainly categorized into three levels, low (<10%), medium (40%) and high (70%), with consequent findings. The FVC time series analysis exhibited the fit-ting curve with straight lines at 0.29 (29%). These findings displayed the utmost annual mean values 26% to 31% and 28% and 29% correspond to level 70% and 40%, respectively. Among all levels, level 10% has the lowest mean. The trend analysis displayed the low FVC for the southwest and south-eastern regions. This is attributed to industrialization, urbanization, land use, land cover change, and related climatic factors: the northeast and the northwest areas displayed medium and high FVC due to less human disturbance. Using different remotely sensed data, human activities (industrialization and urbanization, etc.) and cli-matic factors such as rainfall and temperature are considered driving factors of FVC dynamics. Finally, the correlation value of the coefficient verified the link between climatic factors, FVC and CNLI. These findings present the positive correlation of FVC with rainfall and the negative with compounded night light index and temperature. (c) 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - Environmental factors and spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of the global outbreaks of the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 has posed a major threat to global public health. Understanding the spatiotemporal outbreak characteristics and environmental factors of H5N1 outbreaks is of great significance for the establishment of effective prevention and control systems. The time and location of H5N1 outbreaks in poultry and wild birds officially confirmed by the World Organization for Animal Health from 2005 to 2019 were collected. Spatial autocorrelation analysis and multidistance spatial agglomeration analysis methods were used to analyze the global outbreak sites of H5N1. Combined with remote sensing data, the correlation between H5N1 outbreaks and environmental factors was analyzed using binary logistic regression methods. We analyzed the correlation between the H5N1 outbreak and environmental factors and finally made a risk prediction for the global H5N1 outbreaks. The results show that the peak of the H5N1 outbreaks occurs in winter and spring. H5N1 outbreaks exhibit aggregation, and a weak aggregation phenomenon is noted on the scale close to 5000 km. Water distance, road distance, railway distance, wind speed, leaf area index (LAI), and specific humidity were protective factors for the outbreak of H5N1, and the odds ratio (OR) were 0.985, 0.989, 0.995, 0.717, 0.832, and 0.935, respectively. Temperature was a risk factor with an OR of 1.073. The significance of these ORs was greater than 95%. The global risk prediction map was obtained. Given that the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is spreading globally, the methods and results of this study can provide a reference for studying the spread of COVID-19.

TI  - Estimating building height in China from ALOS AW3D30
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Building height plays an essential role in urban remote sensing and is of great significance for understanding the functioning of urban systems. However, there is little information about building height in China at the country-scale. Previous studies have employed a digital surface model (DSM) to map building height, but the slope correction for buildings in sloping areas remains understudied. In this context, we developed a method to es-timate building height for all of China based on the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) World 3D-30 m (AW3D30) DSM and other ancillary data including the Global Artificial Impervious Area (GAIA) dataset, the NASADEM dataset and the Global Roads Inventory Project (GRIP) dataset. The proposed method enabled us to accurately estimate building height with a special slope correction algorithm, improving the accuracy of building height estimation. The outcome of our procedure is a map of building height for China at a spatial resolution of 30 m. Compared to field-measured building height data and reference building height data from Baidu map, results indicate that the proposed method performed well (root mean square error (RMSE) of 4.26 m and 4.98 m, respectively). Moreover, the new building height product further demonstrates that our method alleviates the overestimation effect of buildings with small footprint area in the suburbs when compared with the existing building height product. Overall, the new building height map of China contributes to the improved management of urban areas and further studies of urban environments.

TI  - Spatial-temporal modeling of root zone soil moisture dynamics in a vineyard using machine learning and remote sensing
T2  - IRRIGATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution spatial-temporal root zone soil moisture (RZSM) information collected at different scales is useful for a variety of agricultural, hydrologic, and climate applications. RZSM can be estimated using remote sensing, empirical equations, or process-based simulation models. Machine learning (ML) approaches for evaluating RZSM across numerous spatial-temporal scales are less generalizable than process-based models. However, data-driven ML approaches offer a unique opportunity to develop complex models of soil moisture without making assumptions about the processes governing soil water dynamics in a given study region. In this study, comparisons were made between two models, pySEBAL and EFSOIL, which were based on evaporation fraction (EF) and soil properties, and a data-driven model based on the Random Forest (RF) ensemble algorithm. These approaches were evaluated to demonstrate their capabilities for RZSM estimation. The EF obtained from Landsat images was used after validation with eddy covariance measurements as the major input to all three models, along with other meteorological and soil physical properties. The RF model was trained using in situ soil moisture data from Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) sensors installed in a vineyard from 2018 to 2020. The predictor variables comprised of meteorological, soil properties, EF, and a vegetation index. The results reveal that there was a strong correlation between the in situ measured soil moisture and the RF predicted soil moisture at all sensor locations. Due to the complexity of the physical processes involved in soil water flow, the empirical models pySEBAL and EFSOIL were unable to reliably predict RZSM values at all monitored locations. The high RZSM predicted by pySEBAL demonstrated the presence of possible bias in the model's algorithm used to estimate soil moisture. We also demonstrated that ML based on the RF algorithm may be used to predict spatially distributed RZSM when a few soil moisture ground measurements are combined with remote sensing to produce soil moisture maps.

AB  - Background The specificity of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for detecting lymph node metastasis in head and neck melanoma (HNM) is low under current National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) treatment guidelines. Methods Multiple machine learning (ML) algorithms were developed to identify HNM patients at very low risk of occult nodal metastasis using National Cancer Database (NCDB) data from 8466 clinically node negative HNM patients who underwent SLNB. SLNB performance under NCCN guidelines and ML algorithm recommendations was compared on independent test data from the NCDB (n = 2117) and an academic medical center (n = 96). Results The top-performing ML algorithm (AUC = 0.734) recommendations obtained significantly higher specificity compared to the NCCN guidelines in both internal (25.8% vs. 11.3%, p < 0.001) and external test populations (30.1% vs. 7.1%, p < 0.001), while achieving sensitivity >97%. Conclusion Machine learning can identify clinically node negative HNM patients at very low risk of nodal metastasis, who may not benefit from SLNB.

TI  - Generating pre-harvest crop maps by applying convolutional neural network on multi-temporal Sentinel-1 data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pre-harvest crop mapping, the fundamental requirement for many of the crop management decisions, continues to be challenging either due to cloud cover in satellite images or due to spectral separability issues. These limitations are overcome in this study by using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data and deep learning technique. Two-dimensional convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) architecture is applied on multi-temporal SAR data of Sentinel-1 to classify soybean, jowar, cotton and sugarcane crops in a large geographic area located in a Central Indian state. Classification experiments are conducted with full season data from nine overpasses in three modes namely VH alone, VH and VH/VV ratio, and VH and VV, and these experimental results reveal that VH and VV combination performed better with an overall accuracy of 91.75% as compared to 84.96% and 88.75% respectively by others. Classification performances with three sets of temporal data, covering part of the season, reveal that crop map can be generated as early as 27th August (i.e. roughly 45 days prior harvesting) with an accuracy of 89.15% slightly less than the mapping accuracy achieved with full season data (i.e. till 14th October). 2D-CNN algorithm has performed better than SVM and RF techniques. This methodology can be extended to similar agro-ecological regions of the country. Richly available SAR data from Sentinel-1 and the potential of deep learning techniques for recognising complex phenological patterns offer immense opportunities for early-season crop mapping even during monsoon season in tropical countries like India.

TI  - Land surface phenology retrievals for arid and semi-arid ecosystems
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface phenology (LSP) plays a critical role in the regulation of photosynthesis, evapotranspiration, and energy fluxes. Significant progress has been made in extracting LSP information over large areas using satellite data, yet LSP retrievals remain a challenge over vast arid and semi-arid ecosystems because of sparse greenness, high variability and the lack of distinct annual patterns; for example, the MODerate Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) Land Cover Dynamics Product MCD12Q2 that provides LSP metrics globally often failed to provide LSP information in these ecosystems. In this study, we used a modified threshold algorithm to extract LSP timing metrics, including the start, peak, and end of growing seasons, using the 16-day composite Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) time series from MODIS data. We applied this regionally customized algorithm across all arid and semi-arid climate regions of Australia (75% of the continental land area) encompassing shrublands, grasslands, savannas, woodlands, and croplands, extracting LSP metrics annually from 2003 to 2018, with up to two (phenology) seasons accounted for in each year. Our algorithm yielded an average of 64.9% successful rate of retrieval (proportion of pixels with retrieved LSP metrics) across 16 years in Arid and Semi-arid AUStralia (ASAUS), which was a significant increase compared to the 14.5% rate of retrieval yielded in our study area by the global product and the major cause of the different performances between these two approaches was the different EVI amplitude restrictions utilized to avoid spurious peaks (i.e. EVI amplitude > 0.1 used by the global product and peak EVI > time series average EVI used by our algorithm). Gross primary productivity (GPP) measurements at OzFlux eddy covariance (EC) tower sites were used to cross-compare with the presence/absence of growing seasons detected by our algorithm, and 97% of our retrieved seasons matched with those extracted using EC data. Preliminary tests at five OzFlux sites showed that our algorithm was robust to view angle-induced sensitivity of the input data and showed similar performance when using EVI data calculated using MODIS Nadir BRDFAdjusted Reflectance product. Our retrieved LSP metrics revealed that vegetation growth in arid ecosystems is highly irregular and can occur at any time of the year, more than once in a year, or can skip a year. The proportion of pixels with two growing seasons was found to be correlated with the average annual precipitation of the study area (p < 0.01), providing an estimation approach of LSP via rainfall. Our study improves the detection and measurement of vegetation phenology in arid and semi-arid regions by improving the spatial extend of LSP retrievals, which contributes to studies on LSP variations and dryland ecosystem resilience to climate change.

TI  - Land Suitability Evaluation for Pigeon Pea in Semi-arid Land, South Telangana Plateau, India, Using GIS, Remote Sensing and Detailed Survey
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil-crop suitability evaluation is a prerequisite to achieve elevated production and productivity per unit land, cost, inputs, and manpower. In order to identify potential crop land for pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan L. Mill sp.) cultivation in South Telangana Plateau (Rayalseema), a case study was taken at Rayachoty mandal (23240.7 ha), Yeduguri Sandinti Rajasekhara Reddy (YSR) Kadapa district, Andhra Pradesh. A detailed soil survey at 1:10000 scale was carried out to inventory land resources using sentinel-2 satellite imagery and toposheet as base. Based on physical, chemical, and morphological properties, 10 soil series and 53 mapping units were identified. Among 53 mapping units, 5 mapping units (6.61%) are moderately suitable (Class S1), 40 mapping units (57.48%) are marginally suitable (Class S3) and 8.07% of total area is unsuitable for pigeon pea cultivation. The major limitations were topography, soil texture, gravelliness, soil fertility, root restriction and drainage. The study has implications on increasing the area under pigeon pea cultivation by addressing the limitations in specific mapping units in semi-arid land of south Telangana plateau by adopting suitable soil and water conservation measures for elevated pigeon pea production and productivity.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variability of turbid freshwater plumes in the Inner Sea of Chiloe, northern Patagonia
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Northern Patagonia is characterized by multiple rivers that discharge considerable amounts of freshwater into the coastal ocean, forming large river plumes that influence hydrographic and ecological processes. In this study, we use satellite ocean color data from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) to characterize the seasonal and interannual variability of turbid freshwater plumes in the inner waters of northern Patagonia for the first time, with a focus on the connections to river discharge and large-scale climatic variability. The turbidity signal from the surface reflectance product centered at 645 nm, Rrs(645), correlates well with peaks in river discharge data and surface salinity minima from boat-based profiles and a surface buoy, validating its use for the identification of turbid river plumes in the region. The seasonal climatology of Rrs(645) showed the presence of large river plumes throughout the year, with variability associated mainly to that of river discharge. Analysis of Rrs(645) fields under low and high discharge conditions allowed for the identification of a threshold value to delineate plume fronts and determine the probability of plume occurrence. EOF analysis reveals the dominant modes of plume variability, associated to turbidity differences between the coastal margin and deeper waters and to in-phase variability of large river plumes throughout the study area. The largest plume event occurred in year 2008, during negative (cold) phases of ENSO (La Nina) and PDO but a positive phase of SAM. The severe drought event of 2016 that occurred during positives phase of ENSO (El Nino), PDO and SAM is well captured by the EOF analysis and is characterized by large negative anomalies in the Rrs(645) signal. In general, complex co-variations are observed between monthly anomalies of Rrs(645) and the ENSO, PDO and SAM indices, highlighting the heterogeneity of climatic regulation in the region.

TI  - What drives long-term PM2.5-attributable premature mortality change? A case study in central China using high-resolution satellite data from 2003 to 2018
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Ambient PM2.5 was reported to be related to numerous negative health outcomes, leading to adverse public health impacts in many countries such as China. Despite the apparent reduction in PM2.5 levels over China due to its emission control policies in recent years, the health burdens were not reduced as much as expected. This calls for a comprehensive analysis to explain the reasons behind to provide a useful reference for formulating effective emission control strategies. Taking central China as an example due to its large population and high levels of PM2.5, this study quantified the spatiotemporal dynamics of premature mortality associated with PM2.5 pollution in central China for each year during 2003-2018 and applied a decomposition analysis to dissect the contribution of various driving factors including ambient PM2.5 level, demographic distribution and baseline incidence rate of four diseases related to air pollution. Results show significant spatiotemporal variations in PM2.5-attributed health impact in central China, including Henan, Hubei, and Hunan provinces. Five Henan cities had the largest PM2.5-attributable premature mortality (similar to 8-12 K premature mortalities), while three Hubei cities and one Hebei city had the least chronic PM2.5-related all-cause mortality numbers (<1 K mortalities). Throughout the study period, the PM2.5-caused premature mortality decreased by 54 K, in which changes in PM2.5 levels and baseline incidence rates of stroke and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease contributed to the positive effect, whereas demographic changes and baseline incidence rate change of ischemic heart disease and lung cancer brought a countervailing effect. Our findings suggest more dynamic and comprehensive policies and measures that take into account spatiotemporal variations of health burden for effective alleviation of the health impact of PM2.5 pollution in the country.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SPATIAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study estimates the surface soil moisture content in a case study situated in the Vietnamese Red River Delta, using the Landsat 8 satellite images. The trapezoidal relationship between land surface temperature and vegetation index was used to obtain soil wetness indexes. A split-window algorithm was developed to overcome the missing of atmospheric data. The method was validated with ground truth across different land covers. The RMSE between the calculated and measured SMC ranges between 0.556 and 0.971 and varies across different types of land covers. The method is important to monitor SMC across large areas with limited surveyed data.

TI  - Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> liposome for photothermal/chemo-synergistic inhibition of metastatic breast tumor
T2  - COLLOIDS AND SURFACES A-PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND ENGINEERING ASPECTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tumor metastasis is the main reason for the high mortality rate of breast cancer patients and lymph node metastasis is the primary means of tumor spreading. Liposomes loaded with bufalin (BF), a steroidal inhibitor of various inflammatory signaling pathways in cancer, and superparamagnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles were developed to inhibit lymphatic metastasis in breast cancer. Fe3O4 functioned as both a magnetic targeting and photothermal agent. In vivo studies using a mouse model of lymph metastatic breast cancer demonstrated that BF-Fe3O4-L (liposomes), administered by iv injection, accumulated in sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) with high efficiency under magnetic direction and exhibited significant photothermal character under near-infrared (NIR) light irradiation. The combination of targeted delivery, photothermal and chemotherapeutic properties resulted in a 91% tumor inhibition rate in SLNs compared with untreated (PBS) controls and 81% lower incidence of pulmonary metastases formation. These findings reveal the significant potential of BF- Fe3O4-Ls for delivering -targeted, chemo-photothermal therapy in the treatment of metastasic cancer.

TI  - Filling gaps of black-sky surface albedo of the Arctic sea ice using gradient boosting and brightness temperature data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface albedo is a necessary parameter for climate studies and modeling. There is a need for a full spatial coverage of albedo data, but clouds and high solar zenith angle cause missing values to the optical satellite products, especially around the polar areas. Therefore, our motivation is to develop gap filling models. For that purpose, we will apply monthly gradient boosting (GB) based models to the Arctic sea ice area of the 34 years long albedo time series of the Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring (CM SAF) project. We demonstrate the ability of the GB models to accurately fill missing data using albedo monthly mean, brightness temperature, and sea ice concentration as model inputs. Monthly GB models produce the most unbiased, precise, and robust estimates when compared to alternative estimates presented, such as monthly mean albedo values or estimates from monthly linear regression (LR) models. The mean relative differences between GB based estimates and original pentad values vary from-20% to 20% with RMSE being 0.048, compared to relative differences varying from-20% to over 60% with RMSE varying from 0.054 to 0.074 between other estimates and original pentad values. Pixelwise mean differences and standard deviations (std) over the whole Arctic sea ice area show that GB based estimates are more accurate (mean differences from-0.02 to 0.02) and more precise (std from 0.02 to 0.08) than other estimates (mean differences varying between-0.05 to over 0.05, and std varying from around 0.03 to over 0.1). Also, albedo of the melting sea ice is predicted better by the GB model, with negligible mean differences, compared to the LR model. Based on these results, we show that GB method is a useful technique to fill missing data, and the brightness temperature and sea ice concentration are useful additional model input data sources.

TI  - Better together? Assessing different remote sensing products for predicting habitat suitability of wetland birds
T2  - DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim The increasing availability of remote sensing (RS) products from airborne laser scanning (ALS) surveys, synthetic aperture radar acquisitions and multispectral satellite imagery provides unprecedented opportunities for describing the physical structure and seasonal changes of vegetation. However, the added value of these RS products for predicting species distributions and animal habitats beyond land cover maps remains little explored. Here, we aim to assess how metrics derived from different types of high-resolution (10 m) RS products predict the habitat suitability of wetland birds. Location North-eastern part of the Netherlands. Methods We built species distribution models (SDMs) with occurrence observations from territory mapping of two selected wetland bird species (great reed warbler and Savi's warbler) and metrics from a Dutch land cover map, country-wide ALS and Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 RS products. We then compared model performance, relative variable importance and response curves of the SDMs to assess the contribution and ecological relevance of each RS product and metric. Results Our results showed that ALS and Sentinel metrics improve SDMs with only land cover metrics by 11% and 10% of the Area Under Curve (AUC) for the great reed warbler and the Savi's warbler respectively. Assessments of feature importance revealed that all types of RS products contributed substantially to predicting the habitat suitability of these wetland birds, but that the most important variables vary among species. Main conclusions Our study demonstrates that metrics from different high-resolution RS products capture complementary ecological information on animal habitats, including aspects such as the proportional cover of habitat types, vegetation density and the horizontal variability of vegetation height. Land cover maps with detailed spatial and thematic information can already achieve high model accuracies, but adding metrics derived from ALS point clouds and Sentinel imagery further improve model accuracy and enhance the understanding of animal-habitat relationships.

TI  - Seasonality in recurrent Potential Fishing Zones along India's Southwest coast and its relationship to the prevailing hydrographic settings
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents the linkage between recurrent (repeat) Potential Fishing Zones (PFZ) and seasonal hydrographic conditions along India's Southwest (Kerala) coast in the Southeastern Arabian Sea (SEAS). The PFZ advisories released by the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS), Hyderabad, India are based on the fact that ocean processes that enhance biological production leave imprints on surface ocean parameters that can be tracked using satellite remote sensing techniques and used to forecast fish availability. Sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-a features of satellite remote sensing data sets usually coincide in regions and situations where physical processes and biological responses are closely coupled, which is used by INCOIS to create PFZ advisories. Nonetheless, it is unknown how PFZ frequency varies seasonally or how the recurrent PFZs are related to the region's predominant seasonal hydrographic settings, which have been addressed here based on a retrospective analysis of PFZs disseminated by INCOIS in advisories distributed over five years (2008-2012). For the current investigation, 432 PFZ advisories over five years were analysed, and the regions of repeat PFZs were demarcated every month along the Kerala coast in the SEAS. This study found that almost all of the very prominent repeat PFZs are formed within the 50 m depth contour and the most frequent and pronounced repeat PFZs were observed across the entire SEAS during the Northeast Monsoon in December, January, and February. On the other hand, the lowest repeat PFZs were discovered in April and May, during the Pre-monsoon season. We show that that the observed increase in repeat PFZs in the study area during the Northeast Monsoon is primarily due to the hydrographical setting created by the intrusion of low-salinity Bay of Bengal waters, which has the potential to increase the occurrence of mesoscale and sub-mesoscale ocean surface features such as fronts and eddies that might get imprinted as more frequent and prominant repeat PFZs in the study area. Instead, very weak winds and thermally stratified surface waters during the Pre-monsoon result in fewer cases of physical processes to enhance plankton production, resulting in a low frequency of imprints in satellite data sets and low repeat PFZs.

TI  - Geomorphic insights into Australia's coastal change using a national dataset derived from the multi-decadal Landsat archive
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Australia has a vast, diverse and dynamic shoreline, and national perspectives on the mechanisms, magnitude and trajectories of coastal adjustment are required to underpin informed management. Geoscience Australia's national Digital Earth Australia Coastlines (DEA Coastlines) was developed to help address this need. These datasets were derived by the application of sub-pixel analysis techniques to the Landsat archive to provide annual coastal contours for the years 1988-2019, and accompanying national point datasets provide change statistics at two scales (30 m and 5 km alongshore spacing). This study examines the utility of these three datasets for understanding temporal and spatial patterns of geomorphic change for representative case examples around Australia. These examples have been selected to demonstrate DEA Coastlines capability for examining the dynamics of Australia's diverse shorelines, from the mangrove-fringed, macrotidal systems of north-western Australia to the microtidal clastic barrier systems of the south-east. We examine this capability at tertiary to sub-tertiary coastal compartment (TCC; sediment cell) spatial scales. While some TCC are strongly and consistently net-progradational or net-erosional, most TCC demonstrate alongshore variations in trajectories and rates of change. We use these patterns of change to infer sub-TCC sediment pathways, and examine the temporal trends contained within representative point datasets to link changes to known process drivers. DEA Coastlines also captures diminishing widths of coastal barriers and has the potential to be combined with more detailed site analyses to forecast future trajectories of change. There are, however, some limitations to DEA Coastlines. Owing to the annual scale of the analysis used to develop the datasets, rapidly moving intertidal bars can introduce considerable error, and an uncertainty field successfully flags most of these locations. Other overlapping and complex coastline contours can sometimes be unpacked into more discrete phases to provide a richer understanding of non-linear coastal trends, and these examples highlight the need to simultaneously consider both of the DEA Coastlines 30 m point statistic and contour datasets. The Australian DEA Coastlines dataset thus provides nationally consistent perspectives for improved coastal management, and has been made freely available online to support a broad range of end users. While these datasets are presently exclusive to the Australian coast, the approach also lends itself to future application to the global Landsat archive.

TI  - Assessment of land-use change and its impact on the environment using GIS techniques: a case of Kolkata Municipal Corporation, West Bengal, India
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - It is axiomatically true that urbanization in India's metropolises and large cities has been exacerbated since the beginning of the millennium, consuming the natural and semi-natural ecosystem on the outskirts of the city, resulting in a zone with a distinct climate known as urban climate. Such a climate-the result of a built-up environment is distinctly different from the natural climate as the paved surface and concrete skyscrapers not only destroy the natural ecosystem, it peculiarly induce a different kind of insolation, cooling and air drainage were lacking in green space, water bodies and open space cannot accommodate with environmental rhythm properly, resulting into the accumulation of heat, ecological derangement of subsurface soil which can easily be predicted by GIS analysis. This paper is an attempt to measure urban growth and its impact on the environment in the metropolitan city Kolkata. The use of satellite data and GIS techniques to detect urban expansion is a highly scientific strategy. Using geospatial techniques, the current study attempts to examine major urban changes in Kolkata and its surroundings from 1988 to 2021. Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI temporal data are used to identify land-use change through unsupervised classification; Spectral Radiance Model and Split Window Algorithm method are used for identifying land surface temperature change. SRTM DEM (30 m) has been used to identify flood risk zones and several spectral indices like Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Modified Normalized Difference Water Index are a further extension for environmental assessment. By all such suitable methods, a clearer change in an urban environment is detected within the period of 33 years (1988-2021). The result shows that the population changes, vegetation cover and built-up area, and accessibility are at a rapid rate. These changes are causing major environmental degradation in the city. The classification result indicates that appropriate land use planning and environmental monitoring are required for the long-term exploitation of these resources.

TI  - Satellite magnetic anomalies with a smooth spectral transition to long wavelengths
T2  - PHYSICS OF THE EARTH AND PLANETARY INTERIORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In most cases, the magnetic field anomalies from satellite data and models are determined by using a cut-off degree that splits the Earth's internal magnetic field (supposed to be of the core and lithospheric origin) into long-wavelength and a short-wavelength parts. This practice allows to effectively compare the signal of both components with other models and controls the signal content as well. In this study an alternative approach is followed to provide the components in long and short wavelengths without cutting the spectrum. Instead, we seek iteratively for the signal loss when the magnetic signal (from degree 1 to the maximum degree of the model) is propagated from the core-mantle boundary to satellite altitude. The problem is generally non-unique, it is required that the signal fit has to follow the slope of the geomagnetic spectrum over the lowest degrees (the degrees least affected by the magnetic lithosphere). The tool operates in the spatial domain - the spectral slope criterion is met after the procedure ends by selecting an appropriate solution. The method can be applied to the vector components individually as soon as they are given in the Earth-fixed Earth-centered frame, for which the integral equation is valid. The obtained magnetic anomalies have different spectral properties because the transition from the long wavelengths to the short wavelengths becomes smooth, although the appropriate number of iterations is questionable. It is found that the long-wavelength signal hands over the magnitude dominance to the short-wavelength part at around degrees 16 to 18.

TI  - Farming and Earth Observation: Sentinel-2 data to estimate within-field wheat grain yield
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Wheat grain yield (GY) is a crop feature of central importance affecting agricultural, environmental, and socioeconomic sustainability worldwide. Hence, the estimation of within-field variability of GY is pivotal for the agricultural management, especially in the current global change context. In this sense, Earth Observation Systems (EOS) are key technologies that use satellite data to monitor crop yield, which can guide the application of precision farming. Yet, novel research is required to improve the multiplatform integration of data, including data processing, and the application of this discipline in agricultural management. This article provides a novel methodological analysis and assessment of its applications in precision farming. It presents an integration of wheat GY, Global Positioning Systems (GPS), combine harvester data, and EOS Sentinel-2 multispectral bands. Moreover, it compares several indices and machine learning (ML) approaches to map within-field wheat GY. It also analyses the importance of multi-date remote sensing imagery and explores its potential applications in precision agriculture. The study was conducted in Spain, a major European wheat producer. Within-field GY data was obtained from a GPS combine harvester machine for 8 fields over three seasons (2017-2019) and consecutively processed to match Sentinel-2 10 m pixel size. Seven vegetation indices (NDVI, GNDVI, EVI, RVI, TGI, CVI and NGRDI) as well as the biophysical parameter LAI (leaf area index) retrieved with radiative transfer models (RTM) were calculated from Sentinel-2 bands. Sentinel-2 10 m resolution bands alone were also used as variables. Random forest, support vector machine and boosted regressions were used as modelling approaches, and multilinear regression was calculated as baseline. Different combinations of dates of measurement were tested to find the most suitable model feeding data. LAI retrieved from RTM had a slightly improved performance in estimating within-field GY in comparison with vegetation indices or Sentinel-2 bands alone. At validation, the use of multi-date Sentinel-2 data was found to be the most suitable in comparison with single date images. Thus, the model developed with random forest regression (e.g. R-2 = 0.89, and RSME = 0.74 t/ha when using LAI) outperformed support vector machine (R-2 = 0.84 and RSME = 0.92 t/ha), boosting regression (R-2 = 0.85 and RSME = 0.88 t/ha) and multilinear regression (R-2 = 0.69 and RSME = 1.29 t/ha). However, single date images at specific phenological stages (e.g. R-2 = 0.84, and RSME = 0.88 t/ha using random forest at stem elongation) also posed relatively high R-2 and low RMSE, with potential for precision farming management before harvest.

TI  - Single shot lymphoscintigraphy in breast cancer: Effective single tracer sentinel node detection protocol with reduction in procedural pain
T2  - CLINICAL IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Variation in protocols for axillary sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping exists. We strive to evaluate the effectiveness of reduction in number of injections on reducing procedural pain, while maintaining nodal detection.Methods: Over 7 years, the number of periareolar injections performed was reduced stepwise from 4 to 1. This was analyzed for SLN detection and patients' subjective perceived pain.Results: 828 patients with invasive breast cancer who underwent SLN mapping were included. Laterality of breast injection site included 326 (39.4%) in the right breast, 354 (42.8%) in the left breast and 148 (17.9%) in bilateral breasts. In patients who had 4 injection sites in a unilateral breast (n = 143), the reported pain score was 4.3 +/- 2.4. Patients with 3 injections (n = 163), 2 injections (n = 163) and 1 injection (n = 211) in a breast reported pain scores of 3.4 +/- 2.4, 3.2 +/- 2.2, and 2.9 +/- 2.6, respectively. In patients who had bilateral sentinel node procedures, those with 4 injections in each breast for a total of 8 injections (n = 37) reported a pain score of 5.7 +/- 2.4. Patients with 3 (n = 51), 2 (n = 31) and 1 (n = 39) injection(s) in each breast reported perceived pain of 4.8 +/- 2.8, 3.7 +/- 2.7 and 3.5 +/- 1.9, respectively. Incremental decreased pain scores were achieved with decreasing number of injections (p < 0.001). Nodal detection was maintained.Conclusion: A single periareolar subdermal injection site reduces periprocedural pain while maintaining nodal detection.

TI  - Validation of Landsat 8 high resolution Sea Surface Temperature using surfers
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Nearshore coastal waters are highly dynamic in both space and time. They can be difficult to sample using conventional methods due to their shallow depth, tidal variability, and the presence of strong currents and breaking waves. High resolution satellite sensors can be used to provide synoptic views of Surface Temperature (ST), but the performance of such ST products in the nearshore zone is poorly understood. Close to the shoreline, the ST pixels can be influenced by mixed composition of water and land, as a result of the sensor's spatial resolution. This can cause thermal adjacency effects due to the highly different diurnal temperature cycles of water bodies and land. Previously, temperature data collected during surfing sessions has been proposed for validation of moderate resolution (1 km pixel size) satellite ST products. In this paper we use surfing temperature data to validate three high resolution (100 m resampled to 30 m pixel size) ST products derived from the Thermal InfraRed Sensor (TIRS) on board Landsat 8 (L8). ST was derived from Collection 1 and 2 Level 1 data (C1L1 and C2L1) using the Thermal Atmospheric Correction Tool (TACT), and was obtained from the standard Collection 2 Level 2 product (USGS C2L2). This study represents one of the first evaluations of the new C2 products, both L1 and L2, released by USGS at the end of 2020. Using automated matchup and image quality control, 88 matchups between L8/TIRS and surfers were identified, distributed across the NorthWestern semihemisphere. The unbiased Root Mean Squared Difference (uRMSD) between satellite and in situ measurements was generally < 2 K, with warm biases (Mean Average Difference, MAD) of 1.7 K (USGS C2L2), 1.3 K (TACT C1L1) and 0.8 K (TACT C2L1). Large interquartile ranges of ST in 5 x 5 satellite pixels around the matchup location were found for several images, especially for the summer matchups around the Californian coast. By filtering on target stability the number of matchups reduced to 31, which halved the uRMSD across the three methods (to around 1.1K), MAD were much lower, i.e. 1.1 K (USGS C2L2), 0.6 K (TACT C1L1), and 0.2 K (TACT C2L1). The larger biases of the C2L2 product compared to TACT C2L1 are caused as a result of: (1) a lower emissivity value for water targets used in USGS C2L2, and (2) differences in atmospheric parameter retrieval, mainly from differences in upwelling atmospheric radiance and lower atmospheric transmittance retrieved by USGS C2L2. Additionally, tiling artefacts are present in the C2L2 product, which originate from a coarser atmospheric correction process. Overall, the L8/TIRS derived ST product compares well with in situ measurements made while surfing, and we found the best performing ST product for nearshore coastal waters to be the Collection 2 Level 1 data processed with TACT.

TI  - Off-peak NDVI correction to reconstruct Landsat time series for post-fire recovery in high-latitude forests
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Collecting long-term satellite image series in high latitudes has been challenging due to its short growing season. For off-peak imagery, its reflective properties need to be corrected to maintain the spectral consistency. This study compares three statistical approaches to reconstructing a 30-year normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) series for forest recovery assessment after the 1987 Black Dragon Fire in the Greater Hinggan Mountains Forest, Northeast China. To correct the off-peak NDVI to peak NDVI, the Landsat paired regression takes advantage of the scene-to-scene linear relationship between the two images, the GIMMS booster approach compensates the NDVI increment rate based on the 15-day AVHRR NDVI3g products between the two dates, and the climatic adjustment approach compensates the absolute NDVI change relying on the non-linear climatic influence on forest growth. The results find that the Landsat paired regression achieves the best performance with the image-wide residues within & PLUSMN; 0.2. The climatic adjustment picks the first-level NDVI under climatic control, while the GIMMS booster is heavily affected by the NDVI3g data quality. All approaches agree that the early-season (May-June) images are better sources for NDVI series reconstruction. The late-season images (especially October) are subject to fall senescence and early snowfall and therefore, are not recommended for satellite image series in high-latitude forests. The reconstructed NDVI series effectively corrects the off-season troughs along the trajectory. NDVI in burned forests increase rapidly in five years, and the heavily burned forests have the highest rate. Forest greenness could recover back to normal in ten years. This study confirms the feasibility of off-peak correction for building sparse image series. With advanced data availability such as the 5 day Sentinel-2 (10-60 m), daily MODIS imagery (500-1000 m), and hourly climatic reanalysis dataset (1-10 km), all three proposed approaches in this study could be improved for better application for post-fire monitoring of high-latitude forests.

TI  - Can slope spectrum information entropy replace slope length and steepness factor: A case study of the rocky mountain area in northern China
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Slope spectrum information entropy (SSIE) can reflect the overall fluctuation characteristics of the topography with convenient calculation. In order to explore whether the complex slope length and steepness factor (LS factor) can be replaced by SSIE in the evaluation of soil erosion in the rocky mountain area, this study took the rocky mountain area in northern China (the first zone of soil and water conservation) as the research object. The soil texture of study area is the most typical "soil-rock dual structure ". The SSIE, soil erosion intensity (SEI), and LS factor were calculated using ASTER GDEM and Landsat8 image data (30 m x 30 m). The correlation between the SSIE and SEI was revealed, and a functional relationship model of SSIE and LS factor was built. This study clarified whether SSIE could replace the LS factor to evaluate soil erosion in the "soil-rock dual structure " area. The results showed that: (1) The slope spectrum curves of the six secondary zones of soil and water conservation in the study area presented "L " shape, and the SSIE was between 0.59 and 2.79 nat. SEI grades were mainly micro-erosion, with strong erosion and above accounting for 1.7%. The spatial distribution difference was significant and strong erosion and above was mostly distributed in mountainous and hilly areas. The LS factor of the whole region was between 0 and 55.03, with an average value of 1.37. The regions with an average LS factor < 5 accounted for more than 82% in each secondary zone. (2) The significant logarithmic function relationship of SSIE and SEI was displayed on the secondary zone (R2 = 0.9372, P < 0.01), tertiary zone (R2 = 0.7908, P < 0.01), and basin scales (R2 = 0.3534, P < 0.01). (3) The relationship of SSIE and LS factor also was significant logarithmic function on the secondary zone (R2 = 0.7866, P < 0.05), tertiary zone (R2 = 0.8269, P < 0.01), and basin scales (R2 = 0.8958, P < 0.01). It was indicated that in the typical hydraulic erosion areas of "soil-rock dual structure ", SSIE can replace the LS factor to evaluate SEI and soil erosion modulus.

TI  - Encapsulated Papillary Carcinoma: A Case Report and Review of the Literature
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Papillary neoplasms are a distinct assemblage of breast lesions whose main characteristic is the presence of fibrovascular cores which are surrounded by epithelial cells. Papillary lesions are of heterogenous nature, with similar clinical behavior and histomorphologic characteristics. Their biological patterns, however, can be quite different. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) (2019), breast tumors have been recently classified into five subdivisions of papillary neoplasms. They are namely: intraductal papilloma, papillary ductal carcinoma in situ, encapsulated papillary carcinoma (EPC), solid-papillary carcinoma and invasive papillary carcinoma. Despite the papillary architecture being easily recognized, histological variations are diagnostically challenging. The presence or absence of myoepithelial cells in the papillary cores can distinguish the malignant from the benign lesions respectively. EPC is a rare, histologically unique carcinoma type whose main characteristic is a thick fibrous capsule at the periphery and a prolific cell structure with fibrovascular stalk support. A characteristic feature is the absence of myoepithelial cells at the surrounding thick fibrous capsule. Usually, EPC maintains a slowly developing tumor despite the absence of myoepithelial cells. An EPC case presents diagnostic difficulties since it bears close resemblance to malignant and benign papillary breast lesions. Upon a clinical and radiological evaluation, EPC commonly appears as a benign lump. In mammography, the tumor is frequently found in a retroareolar position as a well-defined mass. On the other hand, in an ultrasound, the tumor will appear as a cystic lesion characterized by solid components. The clinical picture of EPC is usually an asymptomatic benign mass which at times can be felt through auto-palpation or screening mammography. A bloody nipple discharge is regarded as a common symptom. We report a case of an EPC of a 81-year-old woman who presented with a mass in the left breast.

TI  - Delineating Flood Zones upon Employing Synthetic Aperture Data for the 2020 Flood in Bangladesh
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Delineating a flood map is critical to perceive the potential risks of the event at diverse communities living both in urban and rural settings in Bangladesh. A timely generated flood map can help determine the losses of properties, calculate payment options from insurances, and set up mitigation measures when required. Application of satellite remote sensing (RS) and geographic information systems (GIS) are common these days to determine inundated areas, and to calculate possible losses of economies at scale. However, challenges remain while considering the available options for collecting satellite imageries obtained during the monsoon season with more than 70% cloud coverages found in the data. As a result, active synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors are a better choice to utilize the data in delineating the inundated areas. In doing so, this scientific paper sets up a few objectives to (1) prepare a flood map of Bangladesh using SAR remote-sensing data available from Sentinel-1 satellite; and (2) generate the inundated maps using cloud-based product, i.e., Google Earth Engine (GEE) in categorizing flood-affected districts of Bangladesh in 2020. Results have demonstrated that approximately 11% area of Bangladesh has been affected by the 2020 flood mainly located in the north-central and north-eastern part of the country. Moreover, the old Brahmaputra floodplain, Tista floodplain, lower Ganges-River floodplain, and Karataya-Bangali floodplain have been severely affected by the flood. Note that, the GEE-based automated processing systems adopted in this study have enhanced the computational time while obtaining freely available satellite data to generate mitigation strategies for the betterment of the communities suffered by the flood event.

TI  - Exploring open-source multispectral satellite remote sensing as a tool to map long-term evolution of salt marsh shorelines
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - From an ecological and socio-economic perspective, salt marshes are one of the most valuable natural assets on Earth. As external pressures are causing their extensive degradation and loss globally, the ability to monitor salt marshes on a long-term scale and identify drivers of change is essential for their conservation. Remote sensing has been demonstrated to be one of the most adept methods for this purpose and open-source multispectral satellite remote sensing missions have the potential to provide worldwide long-term time-series coverage that is non-cost-prohibitive. This study derives the long-term lateral evolution of four salt marsh patches in the Ria Formosa coastal lagoon (Portugal) using data from the Sentinel-2 and Landsat missions as well as from aerial photography surveys to quantitatively examine the accuracy and associated uncertainty in using open-source multispectral satellite remote sensing for this purpose. The results show that these open-source satellite archives can be a useful tool for tracking long-term salt marsh extent dynamics. During 1976-2020, there was a net loss of salt marsh in the study area, with erosion rates reaching an average of-3.3 m/yr opposite a tidal inlet. The main source of error in the satellite results was the dataset spatial resolution limits, but the specific salt marsh shoreline environment contributed to the relative magnitude of that error. The study notes the influence of eco-geomorphological dynamics on the mapping of sedimentary environments, so far not extensively discussed in scientific literature, highlighting the difference between mapping a morphological process and a sedimentary environment.

TI  - Seyakha catastrophic blowout and explosion of gas from the permafrost in the Arctic, Yamal Peninsula
T2  - COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - For the first time, in a channel of the Arctic river, on the Yamal Peninsula, a pingo-like feature (PLF) was revealed, where, as a result of powerful blowout, self-ignition and explosion of gas on the 28th of June 2017, the giant Seyakha Crater (C11) was formed. Expeditions in 2017, 2018 and 2019 on the C11 Crater and analysis of remote sensing data allowed to reconstruct geodynamical processes of rapid (approximately 3.5 years) growth of the PLF, caused by high gas pressure, and active thermoabrasive processes in summer seasons (speed up to 1.6 m per day), destroying the C11 Crater walls. It was discovered that before the explosion, a gas-filled thermokarst chamber (ice cavity) had existed in permafrost. Based on the use of the ground penetrating radar survey, a model of the crater and the structure of near-surface deposits was created. A previously unknown rise in the base of ground ice, probably connected with gas-dynamic process, was revealed. A scheme of distribution of frozen soil and ground ice fragments, ejected from the crater, was created and analyzed, their maximum distance from the explosion epicenter was defined as 380 m. Long-term gas emission from the crater was observed, which allowed to make a conclusion about volcanic mechanism of eruption. Large distances from deep wells to the location of the explosion (15 km and more) and determined microbial genesis of gas indicate high probability of natural origin of gas blowout and formation of the C11 Crater.

TI  - Invasive lobular carcinoma enclosed by a benign phyllodes tumor: A case report
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction and importance: Phyllodes tumors (PT) account for approximately 1% of all breast tumors. The coexistence of phyllodes tumor and invasive lobular carcinoma in the ipsilateral breast is extremely rare with fewer than six cases reported worldwide in the last 20 years. We hereby present the first in Taiwan. Case presentation: A 43-year-old female was presented with a protruding tumor with bleeding tendency over left breast in 2016. Breast sonography revealed highly suspected malignancy (ACR BI-RADS category 5). Computed tomography scan disclosed a protruding mass occupying the left breast. Core needle biopsy showed a fibroepithelial lesion favoring fibroadenoma. Considering clinicopathological discrepancy, a nipple-sparing mastectomy was conducted. Pathology report revealed a benign PT with an incidental finding of invasive lobular carcinoma (pT1cN0) within the tumor. Due to tumor recurrence, the patient received re-operation of total mastectomy in 2017, and is under regular adjuvant hormonal therapy without cancer recurrence to date. Clinical discussion: Physicians could easily overlook carcinomas enclosed by PTs due to its occult property. However, when carcinomatous changes arise from within or along with the PT, the proposed therapeutical course may be altered. Moreover, invasive carcinoma components in PTs possess potential for lymph node metastasis. Multidisciplinary cooperation is key in detecting and managing PT with synchronous carcinomatosis. Conclusion: Thorough examination of the excised tumor specimen and ensuring an adequate surgical margin is necessary. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) should be considered whenever suspicious clinical features occur in PT patients. This may aid in the detection of microscopic invasive carcinomatous change.

TI  - Provision of eucalyptus wood farming potential map in Iran: An application of land cover, ecological, climatic, hydrologic, and edaphic analysis in a GIS-based fuzzy AHP framework
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Iran is a low-forest cover country (<10% of country area is forested) and has problems with deforestation and increasing demands for wood products. This wood scarcity has prompted the country to curtail industrial logging to meet other demands for wood. The costs of importing wood are rising, so farming wood industrially with fastgrowing species may help with this problem. Eucalyptus is a fast-growing species that can be used for industrial production and has been proven adaptable to the environments of southern Iran. This study identifies the most suitable locations for eucalyptus wood-farming in Khuzestan Province. Twenty-two factors and fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) were used to identify the best locations for eucalyptus wood-farming in this Province in southern Iran. The independent variables used reflect four components of the environment: soil, water, climate, and land cover. Maps of twenty-two factors were prepared from satellite data, ground sampling, and other geospatial data sources. Eucalyptus plantations in Khuzestan Province were mapped by combining GPS-located ground surveys with data from the Khuzestan Natural Resources Administration. The ecological needs of E. camaldulensis were determined from a review of eucalyptus adaptation studies conducted in southern Iran. The factor maps were classified based on their suitability for eucalyptus farming and these classes served as within layer weights. The weights of effective factors were calculated using FAHP and Chang's fuzzy-extent analysis (outside-of-layer weights). The accuracies of the fuzzy weights of effective factors were assessed by consistency ratio. A eucalyptus wood-farming potential map was created by overlaying the weighted sub-factor maps. This map was validated with real data (the map of current eucalyptus plantations), overall accuracy assessment, and the kappa index. The results showed that among the primary factors, water (weight: 0.34) and land cover (weight: 0.32) were the most influential determinants of the best locations for eucalyptus farming. The accuracy assessment revealed that the FAHP method produced an overall accuracy of 82% and kappa index of 0.71. This is acceptably strong for the identification of the best eucalyptus farm locations in Khuzestan Province. The wood farming potential map developed from this research, can be used as a foundation to plan eucalyptus farming in southern Iran to meet the demand for wood in Iran.

TI  - Prognostic value and management of regional lymph nodes in locoregional breast cancer recurrence: a systematic review of the literature
T2  - ARCHIVES OF GYNECOLOGY AND OBSTETRICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose Management of regional lymph nodes in breast cancer recurrence has been heterogeneous. To facilitate clinical practice, this review aims to give an overview on the prognosis, staging and operative management of (inapparent) regional lymph nodes. Methods Current national and international guidelines are reviewed and a structured search of the literature between Jan 1, 1999 and Feb 1, 2021 on the repeat sentinel node biopsy (re-SNB) procedure was performed. Results Positive regional lymph nodes in recurrent breast cancer indicate a poorer outcome with axillary recurrences being the most favorable tumor site among all nodal regions. Most preferred staging method is ultrasound +/- guided biopsy. PET-CT, scintimammography, SPECT-CT may improve visualization of affected lymph nodes outside the axilla. Concerning operative management 30 articles on re-SNB were identified with a mean harvesting rate of 66.4%, aberrant drainage and aberrant metastasis in 1/3 of the cases. Total rate of metastasis is 17.9%. After previous axillary dissection (ALND) the re-SNB has a significantly lower harvesting rate and higher aberrant drainage and aberrant metastasis rate. The prognostic outcome after re-SNB has been favorable. Conclusion Nodal status in recurrent disease has prognostic value. The choice of operative management of clinically inapparent regional lymph nodes during local recurrence should be based on the previous nodal staging method. Patients with previous ALND should be spared a second systematic ALND. Re-SNB or no axillary surgery at all are possible alternatives. Lymphoscintigraphy may be performed to identify extraaxillary drainage. However, for definite recommendations randomized controlled studies are heavily needed.

TI  - Impact of the land-use/cover on the dust emission using meteorological data and satellite imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Some land use and land cover change has led to destructive environmental stresses, resulting in detachment and emission of dust particles. Land use and land cover changes created in Central Iran have provided favorable conditions for the formation of dust sources. The consequences of these storms go beyond dust sources and affect longer distances. This study is thus aimed to monitor changes in land use and land cover and study their relationship with dust emission rate. To this end, the land use and land cover changes during 2003-2017 in Yazd province were studied by the support vector machine algorithm. The aerosol optical depth obtained from the MODIS sensor was used in dust events with codes 07, 09, 32, and 35 to investigate the impact of the land use and land cover on the dust emission rate. Most of the land use and land cover changes were observed in the salt lands, which showed an increase from 14,017 to 27,221 hectares. The results showed the highest aerosol optical depth (above 0.6) in salt lands and salt pans. Statistical results indicated a significant relationship between the aerosol optical depth and type of land use and land cover during dust events with codes 32 and 35. The types of land use and land cover affected the amount of particle detachment. The highest rates of dust emission were observed in salt lands, salt pans, and bare lands.

TI  - Land use/land cover changes of Noyyal watershed in Coimbatore district, India, mapped using remote sensing techniques
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study undertakes to produce the land use/land cover map and to explore the change detection analysis of Noyyal watershed, Coimbatore, for a time period of 18 years. Based on the remote sensing and geographical information system for monitoring the temporal variations of land use/land cover, multi-temporal Landsat satellite 30-m spatial resolution images of Landsat 4/5 MSS and TM (1999), Landsat 7 ETM + (2008), and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) were obtained from the USGS website. The satellite images were geocoded into the universal transverse mercator (UTM) coordinate system zone 43 N. The unsupervised classification method was done by using an iterative self-organizing data analysis algorithm to compare the images and to classify the images into various land cover categories. Kappa statistics were used to assess the validation of the present study. The analysis suggests the total forest covered in 1999 was 22.69% and that of 2008 was 24.04% and reduced to 6.09%, in 2017. The agricultural land of 17.8% is reduced to 3.11% in 2008 and 0.86% in 2017. The settlements increased from 15.59 to 24.21% in 2008 and 27.14% in 2017. Increase in deforestation leads to increase in barren land. In 1999, the percentage of barren land was 17.2%; in 2008, it was 13.19%, and 50.93% in 2017. The overall accuracy estimation of the study is 73.19% and Kappa coefficient is 0.72. This study has proven a substantial strength of agreement for the map of 2017 from the result of validation rating criteria of Kappa statistics.

TI  - Cognitive dimension of culture and social axioms: using methods of multidimensional analysis to research Ukrainian cultural beliefs about success and inequality
T2  - JOURNAL OF CULTURAL COGNITIVE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The significance of cultural factors in the context of surveying cognitive processes, perception, emotions and mental health has long been acknowledged by social scientists. Shared collective belief systems represent one of the long established research foci in the social sciences. Presently studying the large cultural dimensions in their connections to individual predispositions and behavior is one of the core interests in cultural psychology as well as cognitively-oriented anthropology and sociology. To explore the patterned collective agreement in belief systems quantitatively, data reduction techniques is the strategy used most often and most successfully. The present study is premised on the principles of culture consensus model and uses cultural models framework to explain how Ukrainians view success and understand its prerequisites. The analysis is anchored in the cognitive dimension of the Ukrainian cultural worldview, specifically in the intersubjectively shared cultural assumptions (social axioms) regarding the opportunities for social advancement and their unequal distribution across different social groups. Based on the ISSP 2019 data set (N = 2001), the present study sought to uncover the content and organization of social axiomatic beliefs the Ukrainians have regarding the social characteristics facilitating self-advancement within a group, as well the degree of sharedness and homogeneity of these beliefs and their demographic correlates in the sample. The results converge on the four-factorial structure partitioning the "ingredients of success" into the categories of structural attributes, social capital, family background and individual agency.

TI  - Focus on axillary anatomy: The Carl Langer muscle, a great forgotten muscle in the training of medical residents in gynecology and obstetrics
T2  - GYNECOLOGIE OBSTETRIQUE FERTILITE & SENOLOGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. - The Carl Langer muscle is the main anatomical variation of the walls of the axillary area, its incidence being about 7%. The presence of this muscle crossing the anterior edge of the axillary vessels can induce difficulties of exposure, location and dissection during axillary surgery. In addition, it may be responsible for primary lymphedema of the upper limb, venous thrombosis of the axillary vein or thoracic outlet syndrome due to vascular or nervous compression. The objective of this work was to evaluate the state of knowledge on Carl Langer muscle of the gynecology-obstetrics medical residents of the French Eastern Region. Material and methods. - All the medical residents enrolled in the specialized diploma in gynecology obstetrics in the 5 regions (Alsace, Bourgogne, Lorraine, Champagne-Ardenne and Franche-Comte acute accent ) were questioned by means of a questionnaire sent by e-mail. Results. - From February to March 2021, 94 of the 160 medical residents interviewed answered to the questionnaire. Ninety-one of them (97%) did not know Carl Langer's muscle. Three medical residents thought they knew this muscle (3%) but their knowledge was imperfect. Conclusion. - Our work has highlighted the general lack of knowledge of this anatomical variation, which is relatively frequent, among French gynecology-obstetrics medical residents who are required to examine or perform surgery on this area. This updated review of the literature should optimize the knowledge of the anatomy of the axillary area and consequently its surgery. xe002;C 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

T2  - MOBILE NETWORKS & APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - 5G/6G communication are first generation high speed wireless communication network which integrates the aerial data, terrestrial data and maritime data via satellite to IoT cellular devices. Technological motivation tends to increase the satellites day by day for supporting most of global applications. These applications highly relay on satellite data for processing users request and giving appropriate outcome to the users. World grows very fastly with new technologies which makes demand for fastest data communication. Handling the satellite IoT data is worthiest research problem and it must be paid with more attention. At present inter satellite communication face high delay with lower data utilization rate. The effective utilization of data generated by satellite IoT is processed using our proposed intelligent model called smart edge computing (SEC-5G) for 5G. The SEC-5G embeds with satellite for reducing the data transfer limitation and delay in inter satellite communication. In this research we highly concentrate on satellite IoT data and its problem. Our proposed system reduces the limitation in inter satellite data communication rate which makes higher delay in data processing and utilization. In this article, smart edge computing is designed for satellite IoT using SDN/NFV and deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) with logical ring construction. The task uses SDN/NFV model to choose edge node, cloud node in the smart edge computing. Based on training data, DCNN works on SEC-5G software model. Smart architecture helps to increase the performance, scalability, reliability of satellite edge computing model. This architecture works with machine learning model and helps to improve the future satellite speed on data processing. The performance of the proposed is compared with existing Ground 5G. Evaluated outcome shows proposed embedded satellite outperforms in data communication.

TI  - Landsat Data Ecosystem Case Study: Actor Perceptions of the Use and Value of Landsat
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - It is well-known that Earth observation (EO) data plays a critical role in scientific understanding about the global environment. There is also growing support for the use of EO data to provide context-specific insights, with significant implications for their use in decision support systems. Technological development over recent years, including cloud computing infrastructure, machine learning techniques, and rapid expansion of the velocity, volume, and variety of space-borne data sources, offer huge potential to provide solutions to the myriad environmental problems facing society and the planet. The USGS/NASA Landsat Program, the longest continuously gathered source of land surface data, has played a central role in our understanding of environmental change, particularly for its contribution of longitudinal products that offer greater context for present research and decision support activities. The challenge facing the Landsat and EO data community, however, now lies in moving beyond context-specific knowledge generation to translating such knowledge into tangible value for society. Drawing from an open data ecosystem framework and qualitative social science methods, we map the Landsat data ecosystem (LDE) and the relationships linking multiple actors responsible for processing, indexing, analyzing, synthesizing, and translating raw Landsat data into information that is useful, useable, and used by end users in particular social-environmental contexts. Both the role of Big Data and associated technologies are discussed as they relate to the ultimate use of Landsat-derived information products to guide decision-making, and key data ecosystem characteristics that shape the likelihood of these products' use are highlighted.

TI  - Estimation of Seagrass Biomass by In Situ Measurement and Remote Sensing Technology on Small Islands, Indonesia
T2  - OCEAN SCIENCE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the major blue carbon ecosystems, studying, conserving, and monitoring seagrass meadows, especially on small populated islands, has become very important due to their vulnerability to anthropogenic and global environmental factors. In this study, we used satellite image analysis and biological data to map seagrass percent cover (SPC), above-ground biomass (AGB), and below-ground biomass (BGB) on the three most populated islands of the Spermonde Archipelago, Indonesia, i.e., Kodingareng Lompo, Barrang Lompo, and Barrang Caddi. Reflectance and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values of Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery were used to classify and calculate SPC and AGB. In situ biological data measurements were carried out from 3 to 14 of June, 2020, on the three islands to measure AGB and BGB. The result from image classification shows a total area of 126.37 Ha of seagrass, which was divided into three SPC categories: medium (30-59.9%) with a total area of 78.38 Ha; low (0-29.9%) with a total area of 13.1 Ha; and high (60-100%) with a total area of 34.89 Ha. The highest SPC area was observed on Kodingareng Lompo Island with 61.07Ha, followed by Barrang Lompo Island with 53.18Ha, and Barrangcaddi Island with 12.12Ha. The total AGB on Barrang Lompo, Kodingareng Lompo, and Barrangcaddi in tons of dry weight/ha were 1.83, 1.05, and 2.38, respectively. The highest BGB was reported on Barrangcaddi Island with 8.61 tons of dry weight/ha, followed by Barrang Lompo Island with 6.78 tons of dry weight/ha, and Kodingareng Lompo Island with 2.78 tons of dry weight/ha. Regression analysis showed a linear correlation between NDVI value and in situ SPC with R-2 = 0.8255. The framework of this study can be applied to monitor temporal changes of seagrass meadows distribution on small islands to promote a more sustainable ecosystem.

TI  - Derivation of spatially distributed thermal comfort levels in Jordan as investigated from remote sensing, GIS tools, and computational methods
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermal comfort is usually calculated using discrete point measurements. This procedure is not suitable to study thermal comfort for inhabited areas with rugged terrains where climate gradient is high. The wide availability of remote sensing data and GIS tools has revolutionized data management, processing, and visualization. The present paper implemented digital elevation data, GIS tools, and a computational algorithm to generate spatially continuous maps of climatological elements which were employed to derive thermal comfort levels across Jordan. Results show detailed information of the spatial distribution of the degree of thermal comfort in winter and summer across the country which cannot be resolved using discrete point measurements. It is shown that most mountainous areas in the country, where most urban centers are situated, experience "slightly warm" to "warm" indoor apparent temperatures in summer in 50% of the diurnal cycle. The Jordan Valley and the desert experience high indoor apparent temperatures in summer with warm and hot conditions for the most part of the diurnal cycle. Cold conditions prevail over most parts of the country in winter, with the heating degree days ranging from 2200 in the southern mountains to values close to zero near the Dead Sea area. Mountainous and desert areas experience cold or very cold conditions in more than 75% of the diurnal cycle. The presented procedure demonstrated that the very low levels of ambient vapor pressure is an important atmospheric forcing contributing to the widespread cold conditions prevailing over the desert areas in winter. The efficiency of direct evaporative cooling systems to achieve thermal comfort in the various parts of the country is investigated. The procedure presented can be used over regional scales with different levels of spatial resolutions for a wide range of climatological studies.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Well-exposed fluvio-deltaic deposits of the Middle Jurassic Ravenscar Group (Yorkshire coast) provide a direct analogue for North Sea reservoirs, but previous studies were restricted to a few accessible bays. This study used lidar and drone photogrammetry to create near-continuous virtual outcrops, 21 km long and 30-150 m thick, in an area which is largely inaccessible. Remote sensing data were supplemented by 45 outcrop logs and data from 27 pre-existing, behind-outcrop boreholes to improve understanding of the geometries, architectures and stacking patterns of 10 distinct sandbody types; the most important reservoir analogue units are channels and crevasse splay bodies. Channel bodies are 30-2038 m wide and 2-28 m thick with W/T ratio ranges of 5-105; the majority are multi-storey with an average thickness of 8 m and width of 182 m, while the single-storey channel bodies average 4 m thick and 50 m wide. Crevasse splays are 15->1285 m wide and 0.3-6.5 m thick with W/T ratio ranges of 50->541. There is a marked lateral and vertical change in channel body dimensions and facies proportion. The study suggests that the channel architecture and depositional nature of these successions are controlled by base-level fluctuation and floodplain topography.

T2  - HEALTH & PLACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Satellite observations following flooding coupled with electronic health data collected through syndromic surveillance systems (SyS) may be useful in efficiently characterizing and responding to health risks associated with flooding. Results: There was a 10% (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1%-19%) increase in asthma related ED visits and 22% (95% CI: 5%-41%) increase in insect bite related ED visits in the flooded ZCTAs compared to non-flooded ZCTAs during the flood period. One month following the floods, diarrhea related ED visits were increased by 15% (95% CI: 4%-27%) for flooded ZCTAs and children and adolescents from flooded ZCTAs had elevated risk for dehydration related ED visits. During the protracted period (2-3 months after the flood period), the risk for asthma, insect bite, and diarrhea related ED visits were elevated among the flooded ZCTAs. Effect modification by reported age, ethnicity and race was observed.Conclusion: Combining satellite observations with SyS data can be helpful in characterizing the location and timing of environmentally mediated adverse health outcomes, which may be useful for refining disaster resilience measures to mitigate health outcomes following flooding.

TI  - Validation of Sentinel-2 (MSI) and Sentinel-3 (OLCI) Water Quality Products in Turbid Estuaries Using Fixed Monitoring Stations
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is common in estuarine waters to place fixed monitoring stations, with the advantages of easy maintenance and continuous measurements. These two features make fixed monitoring stations indispensable for understanding the optical complexity of estuarine waters and enable an improved quantification of uncertainties in satellite-derived water quality variables. However, comparing the point-scale measurements of stationary monitoring systems to time-snapshots of satellite pixels suffers from additional uncertainties related to temporal/spatial discrepancies. This research presents a method for validating satellite-derived water quality variables with the continuous measurements of a fixed monitoring station in the Ems Dollard estuary on the Dutch-German borders. The method has two steps; first, similar in-situ measurements are grouped. Second, satellite observations are upscaled to match these point measurements in time and spatial scales. The upscaling approach was based on harmonizing the probability distribution functions of satellite observations and in-situ measurements using the first and second moments. The fixed station provided a continuous record of data on suspended particulate matter (SPM) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations at 1 min intervals for 1 year (2016-2017). Satellite observations were provided by Sentinel-2 (MultiSpectral Instrument, S2-MSI) and Sentinel-3 (Ocean and Land Color Instrument, S3-OLCI) sensors for the same location and time of in-situ measurements. Compared to traditional validation procedures, the proposed method has improved the overall fit and produced valuable information on the ranges of goodness-of-fit measures (slope, intercept, correlation coefficient, and normalized root-mean-square deviation). The correlation coefficient between measured and derived SPM concentrations has improved from 0.16 to 0.52 for S2-MSI and 0.14 to 0.84 for S3-OLCI. For the Chl-a matchup, the improvement was from 0.26 to 0.82 and from 0.14 to 0.63 for S2-MSI and S3-OLCI, respectively. The uncertainty in the derived SPM and Chl-a concentrations was reduced by 30 and 23% for S2-SMI and by 28 and 16% for S3-OLCI. The high correlation and reduced uncertainty signify that the matchup pairs are observing the same fluctuations in the measured variable. These new goodness-of-fit measures correspond to the results of the performed sensitivity analysis, previous literature, and reflect the inherent accuracy of the applied derivation model.

TI  - Infectious disease surveillance for refugees at borders and in destination countries: a scoping review
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Background Data on infectious disease surveillance for migrants on arrival and in destination countries are limited, despite global migration increases, and more are needed to inform national surveillance policies. Our study aimed to examine the scope of existing literature including existing infectious disease surveillance activities, surveillance methods used, surveillance policies or protocols, and potential lessons reported. Methods Using Arksey and O'Malley's six-stage approach, we screened four scientific databases systematically and 11 websites, Google, and Google Scholar purposively using search terms related to 'refugee' and 'infectious disease surveillance' with no restrictions on time-period or country. Title/abstracts and full texts were screened against eligibility criteria and extracted data were synthesised thematically. Results We included 20 eligible sources of 728 identified. Reporting countries were primarily European and all were published between 1999 and 2019. Surveillance methods included 9 sources on syndromic surveillance, 2 on Early Warning and Response (EWAR), 1 on cross-border surveillance, and 1 on GeoSentinel clinic surveillance. Only 7 sources mentioned existing surveillance protocols and communication with reporting sites, while policies around surveillance were almost non-existent. Eleven included achievements such as improved partner collaboration, while 6 reported the lack of systematic approaches to surveillance. Conclusion This study identified minimal literature on infectious disease surveillance for migrants in transit and destination countries. We found significant gaps geographically and on surveillance policies and protocols. Countries receiving refugees could document and share disease surveillance methods and findings to fill these gaps and support other countries in improving disease surveillance.

TI  - Assessing machine leaning algorithms on crop yield forecasts using functional covariates derived from remotely sensed data
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Machine learning methods are increasingly used in analyzing remotely sensed data and studying different aspects of agricultural production. In particular, several of these flexible models are widely adopted to predict regional crop yield during or after the growing season. However, most existing models cannot be applied when dealing with functional covariates. In this paper, an approach based on multidimensional scaling is proposed to generate a set of artificial covariates from empirical density functions of different phenomena captured within specific administrative boundaries through satellites. In contrast to traditional aggregation methods, this approach is designed to reduce the loss of information associated with the use of summary statistics as covariates. The proposed methodology is applied to NASA remote sensing data, combined with information from surveys and USDA's end-of-season county estimates, to study the prediction accuracy of different crop-yield models for three major crops in North Dakota.

TI  - UAV/Drone-Based Identification of Geomorphic and Structural Anomalies as Probable Indicators of Economic Mineral Deposits in Girar Area of Lalitpur District, UP, (India)
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing data and UAV/Drone images have been conjunctively used for identification and mapping of probable indicators of economic mineral deposits in Girar area of Lalitpur district. Area of interest for UAV/Drone survey was selected from the digitally enhanced IRS P6 LISS-IV images. Very high-resolution (3.95 cm/pix) UAV/Drone images have been captured, and their photogrammetric processing and DEM generation were performed using Agisoft Metashape software. Subsequently, digital image enhancements such as principal component analysis and some filtering techniques viz. high-pass and low-pass filters using 3 x 3, 5 x 5 kernel have been applied on UAV images. Abrupt changes in regular linear and curvilinear pattern and also in the dimension of the landforms and the macro-level terrain information have also been detected from digitally enhanced and filtered drone data. Anomalous orientation, disposition and abrupt changes in the shape and pattern of landforms, particularly the ridges at some places, have been referred to as geomorphic anomalies. Lineaments with a few hundreds of meters of length have been delineated on spatially enhanced images and DEMs generated from UAV/Drone data. Sudden change in slope and relatively steeper valley walls are distinguishable on UAV data-based Digital Elevation Model (DEM), thereby vindicating the existence of lineaments. Intersections of ENE-WSW and NW-SE trending lineaments in Girar ridge area have been marked as structural anomalies. UAV/Drone images have not only yielded precise information about the spatial extent of anomalies (earlier been identified on IRS P6 LISS-IV satellite images), but have also helped in the identification of smaller geomorphic and structural anomalies, which were otherwise difficult to identify on satellite images. Further, the field investigations have revealed the rock outcrops of Banded Haematite Quartzite (BHQ) within these geomorphic and structural anomalies with BHQ considered to be potential host rocks for iron oxides (Fe2O3). The structural and geomorphic anomalies demarcated on digitally processed UAV/Drone images and DEMs of this area seem to be the probable indicators for iron deposits.

TI  - Healthcare professionals' experiences and perceptions regarding health care of indigenous pregnant women in Ecuador
T2  - BMC PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Pregnancy is an important life experience that requires uniquely tailored approach to health care. The socio-cultural care practices of indigenous pregnant women (IPW) are passed along the maternal line with respect to identity, worldview and nature. The cultural differences between non-indigenous healthcare professionals (HPs) and IPW could present a great challenge in women's health care. This article presents an analysis from a human rights and gender perspective of this potential cultural divide that could affect the health of the IPW in an Andean region of Ecuador with the objective of describing the health challenges of IPWs as rights holders through the experiences and perceptions of HP as guarantors of rights. Methods We conducted 15 in-depth interviews with HPs who care for IPW in Chimborazo, Pichincha provinces of Ecuador. We utilized a semi-structured interview guide including questions about the experiences and perceptions of HPs in delivering health care to IPW. The interviews were recorded, transcribed and subjected to thematic analysis in Spanish and translated for reporting. Results We found disagreements and discrepancies in the Ecuadorian health service that led to the ignorance of indigenous cultural values. Common characteristics among the indigenous population such as illiteracy, low income and the age of pregnancy are important challenges for the health system. The gender approach highlights the enormous challenges: machismo, gender stereotypes and communication problems that IPWs face in accessing quality healthcare. Conclusions Understanding the diverse perspectives of IPW, acknowledging their human rights particularly those related to gender, has the potential to lead to more comprehensive and respectful health care delivery in Ecuador. Further, recognizing there is a gender and power differential between the provider and the IPW can lead to improvements in the quality of health care delivery and reproductive, maternal and child health outcomes.

TI  - Addressing critical influences on L-band radar backscatter for improved estimates of basal area and change
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - L-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscatter intensity is sensitive to land cover and can be used to estimate vegetation measures such as basal area (BA) and biomass. However, the estimation of BA, and especially change in BA, can be hampered by the influences upon backscatter of external factors such as imaging geometry, terrain topology, prevailing moisture conditions and even SAR sensor characteristics. This paper describes a method of reducing the adverse effects of such extraneous influences on vegetation and change estimates derived from single-channel SAR data. Empirical corrections for terrain slope and cross-track tendencies were applied and linear least squares difference minimization used to normalize the backscatter differences between scenes. The method was applied to state-wide coverage of L-band, fine-mode, HV polarization Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array L-band SAR (PALSAR) data over New South Wales (NSW), Australia. The data were acquired with different sensors over two "observational epochs": ALOS PALSAR in 2009 and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 in 2016/17. The SAR datasets presented significant variations in backscatter intensity beyond those attributable to changes in vegetation cover. The corrective procedures resulted in improved uniformity of observed backscatter dependence on vegetation. Variations in backscattering coefficient between swaths were reduced by as much as 1.75 dB and 25% of the standard deviation in mean backscattering coefficients in common areas and at near- and far-range. This corresponded to a correction in BA estimate of 4.4 m2 ha-1. The method was observed to reduce ambiguities in regrowth estimates at swath boundaries and correct estimates of BA change by as much as 30% over large areas. The resulting estimates of 7-year change in BA provide spatially explicit forest structural information that is assisting in monitoring changes in woody vegetation across NSW.

TI  - Fish assemblage monitoring in Alberta's Ells River: Baseline fish and habitat variability prior to major development
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The collection of sentinel fish species for Environmental Effects Monitoring (EEM) has provided ancillary fish assemblage surveys on several tributaries in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region (AOSR) of Alberta, Canada over the last decade. Using available, comparable data we investigated baseline fish assemblage variability along the Ells River, a tributary of the Athabasca River experiencing increasing proximity to natural bitumen deposits and proposed mining development as it approaches confluence with the mainstem Athabasca. Transect-based electrofishing data from four sites surveyed in September 2013, 2014 and 2018 showed significant spatiotemporal variability in assemblages, where spatial variability was greatest in 2013 and temporal variability was observed in assemblages both upstream (2013-2014) and downstream (2014-2018) of proposed development. Habitat assessments in 2018 revealed significant relationships among pH, algae cover and site slope with fish assemblages of the same year. Due to the complementary nature of assemblage surveys, data challenges (changing methodologies, sampling effort, and limited ancillary physiochemical data) have presented limitations to the multivariate approach applied in the study. Moving forward, employing consistent methods for fish collections and fine scale habitat assessments will improve the ability to correlate assemblage variability with changes in the physical environment. Ultimately, this will aid in developing potential triggers of change that may be attributed to or confound adjacent, expanding Oil Sands activities. These findings will also inform monitoring programs on the use of fish assemblages as indicators of change, potentially providing an alternative to existing biomonitoring approaches in small streams with small fish populations.

TI  - Exploring the potential of Chinese GF-6 images for crop mapping in regions with complex agricultural landscapes
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely crop mapping is crucial for environment assessment, food security and agricultural production. However, for the areas with high landscape heterogeneity and frequent cloudy and rainy weather, the insufficient high-quality satellite images limit the accuracy of crop classification. The recently launched Chinese GF-6 wide field-of-view camera (WFV) with a revisit cycle of 4-day and spatial resolution of 16-meter shows great potential for agricultural monitoring. In this study, Qianjiang City characterized by complex agricultural landscapes was selected as the research area to assess the potential of GF-6 data in identifying crop types. Firstly, the pairwise and global separability were calculated to analyze the effect of different spectral-temporal features of GF-6 images on crop classification. A total of 255 spectral-temporal features derived from 15 GF-6 tiles were then used to perform random forest classification. Furthermore, the classification results were evaluated based on 671 field samples and then compared the accuracy between GF-6 data and Sentinel-2 or Landsat-8 data. In addition, the earliest identifiable time of crop types was also determined by iteratively using all available GF-6 data during each time period. The results suggested that the overall accuracy (OA) of all available GF-6 images was 91.55%, which was significantly higher than that of Landsat-8 data (OA = 85.97%) and was slightly lower than that of Sentinel-2 data (OA = 93.10%). The newly added red-edge bands (0.69 0.73 mu m, 0.73 0.77 mu m) and their derivative vegetation indices were important spectral features, and the period from mid-March to early-April was the best temporal window for crop identification in our research area. Moreover, late July was the earliest crop identifiable time with overall accuracy of 90% for the first time of the year. These results indicated the great potential of GF-6 images for classifying crop types in the areas with complex cropping system and fragmented agricultural landscapes, particularly when integrating other satellite data with comparable spatial resolution (e.g. Chinese GF-1 data and Sentinel-2 data).

TI  - The Diagnostic Performance of Machine Learning-Based Radiomics of DCE-MRI in Predicting Axillary Lymph Node Metastasis in Breast Cancer: A Meta-Analysis
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to perform a meta-analysis to evaluate the diagnostic performance of machine learning(ML)-based radiomics of dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) DCE-MRI in predicting axillary lymph node metastasis (ALNM) and sentinel lymph node metastasis(SLNM) in breast cancer.Methods: English and Chinese databases were searched for original studies. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) and Radiomics Quality Score (RQS) were used to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and area under the curve (AUC) were used to summarize the diagnostic accuracy. Spearman's correlation coefficient and subgroup analysis were performed to investigate the cause of the heterogeneity.Results: Thirteen studies (1618 participants) were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, DOR, and AUC with 95% confidence intervals were 0.82 (0.75, 0.87), 0.83 (0.74, 0.89), 21.56 (10.60, 43.85), and 0.89 (0.86, 0.91), respectively. The meta-analysis showed significant heterogeneity among the included studies. There was no threshold effect in the test. The result of subgroup analysis showed that ML, 3.0 T, area of interest comprising the ALN, being manually drawn, and including ALNs and combined sentinel lymph node (SLN)s and ALNs groups could slightly improve diagnostic performance compared to deep learning, 1.5 T, area of interest comprising the breast tumor, semiautomatic scanning, and the SLN, respectively.Conclusions: ML-based radiomics of DCE-MRI has the potential to predict ALNM and SLNM accurately. The heterogeneity of the ALNM and SLNM diagnoses included between the studies is a major limitation.

TI  - Acute hepatitis A in international travellers: a GeoSentinel analysis, 2008-2020
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAVEL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Non-immune international travellers are at risk of acquiring hepatitis A. Although hepatitis A vaccination is recommended for unvaccinated travellers to high or intermediate hepatitis A virus endemicity, compliance with this recommendation is not universal. The main objective was to describe the demographic and travel characteristics of international travellers infected with hepatitis A during travel.Methods: Available data on travellers with confirmed (positive molecular test) or probable (symptomatic individuals with a single positive IgM test) hepatitis A diagnosed during and after travel from January 2008 to December 2020 were obtained from the GeoSentinel Surveillance Network database. We analysed demographic and travel characteristics of infected travellers.Results: Among 254 travellers with hepatitis A (185 confirmed and 69 probable), the median age was 28 years (interquartile range: 19-40), 150 (59%) were male, and among 54 travellers with information available, 53 (98%) were unvaccinated. The most common reasons for travel included tourism (n = 120; 47%) and visiting friends or relatives (VFR; n = 72; 28%). About two-thirds of VFR travellers with hepatitis A (n = 50; 69%) were younger than 20 years old. Hepatitis A was acquired most frequently in South-Central Asia (n = 63; 25%) and sub-Saharan Africa (n = 61; 24%), but 16 travellers (6%) acquired hepatitis A in regions with low endemicity including Western Europe (n = 7; 3%), the Caribbean (n = 6; 2%) and North America (n = 3; 1%). Median duration from illness onset to GeoSentinel site presentation was similar to 7 days (interquartile range : 4-14 days). Among 88 travellers with information available, 59% were hospitalized.Conclusions: Despite availability of highly effective vaccines, travellers still acquire hepatitis A, even when traveling to low-endemicity destinations. Providing pre-departure hepatitis A vaccine to susceptible travellers is crucial to reducing travel-associated hepatitis A and should be offered to all travellers as part of the pre-travel consultation, regardless of destination.

TI  - Water quality monitoring with Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 satellites during the 2021 volcanic eruption in La Palma (Canary Islands)
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, seawater quality was monitored with high-resolution satellite imagery during the 2021 volcanic eruption (September-December) on La Palma Island (Spain), the longest recorded in the history of the island, and the most destructive in the last century in Europe. The Sentinel-2A/B twin satellites and Landsat-8 satellite were jointly used as an optical constellation, which allowed us to successfully characterize the short-and medium-term evolution of the new lava delta and subsequent impact on the seawater. Robust atmospheric and sunglint correction approaches were applied to thoroughly quantify the environmental changes caused on the adjacent coastal waters. The cloud and volcanic ash coverage remained very high over the coast during the event, so restricted information with 14 images (45% of the total scenes) was retrieved from the multi-sensor approach. Nevertheless, the availability of pre-, syn-, and post eruption satellite products allowed us to map and detect the main water quality variations in the marine environment. On the one hand, during the eruption, a change in the properties of the water quality was observed, with a markedly increased turbidity on the western side of the island near the new lava delta due to the deposition of volcanic ash and material. On the other hand, chlorophyll-a concentration did not significantly increase, algal blooms were not observed, and oligotrophic conditions were not swiftly altered towards eutrophic conditions. This information offered an excellent opportunity to characterize the emplacement of the new lava delta and its impact on the marine environment in La Palma. The present multi-sensor strategy is an excellent opportunity to highlight the potential of remote sensing technology as a relevant and powerful tool for future hazard monitoring and assessment during catastrophes and for a better interpretation of their impact on the marine environment.

TI  - Oral Fungal Infections: Past, Present, and Future
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ORAL HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Oral fungal infections have afflicted humans for millennia. Hippocrates (ca. 460-370 BCE) described two cases of oral aphthae associated with severe underlying diseases that could well have been oral candidiasis. While oral infections caused by other fungi such as cryptococcosis, aspergillosis, mucormycosis, histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, and coccidioidomycosis occur infrequently, oral candidiasis came to the fore during the AIDS epidemic as a sentinel opportunistic infection signaling the transition from HIV infection to AIDS. The incidence of candidiasis in immunocompromised AIDS patients highlighted the importance of host defenses in preventing oral fungal infections. A greater understanding of the nuances of human immune systems has revealed that mucosal immunity in the mouth delivers a unique response to fungal pathogens. Oral fungal infection does not depend solely on the fungus and the host, however, and attention has now focussed on interactions with other members of the oral microbiome. It is evident that there is inter-kingdom signaling that affects microbial pathogenicity. The last decade has seen significant advances in the rapid qualitative and quantitative analysis of oral microbiomes and in the simultaneous quantification of immune cells and cytokines. The time is ripe for the application of machine learning and artificial intelligence to integrate more refined analyses of oral microbiome composition (including fungi, bacteria, archaea, protozoa and viruses-including SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19). This analysis should incorporate the quantification of immune cells, cytokines, and microbial cell signaling molecules with signs of oral fungal infections in order to better diagnose and predict susceptibility to oral fungal disease.

TI  - Use of Riparian Spiders as Sentinels of Persistent and Bioavailable Chemical Contaminants in Aquatic Ecosystems: A Review
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY
M3  - Review
AB  - Aquatic ecosystems around the world are contaminated with a wide range of anthropogenic chemicals, including metals and organic pollutants, that originate from point and nonpoint sources. Many of these chemical contaminants have complex environmental cycles, are persistent and bioavailable, can be incorporated into aquatic food webs, and pose a threat to the health of wildlife and humans. Identifying appropriate sentinels that reflect bioavailability is critical to assessing and managing aquatic ecosystems impacted by contaminants. The objective of the present study is to review research on riparian spiders as sentinels of persistent and bioavailable chemical contaminants in aquatic ecosystems. Our review of the literature on riparian spiders as sentinels suggests that significant progress has been made during the last two decades of research. We identified 55 published studies conducted around the world in which riparian spiders (primarily of the families Tetragnathidae, Araneidae, Lycosidae, and Pisauridae) were used as sentinels of chemical contamination of lotic, lentic, and estuarine systems. For several contaminants, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), Hg, and Se, it is now clear that riparian spiders are appropriate sentinels. However, many contaminants and factors that could impact chemical concentrations in riparian spiders have not been well characterized. Further study of riparian spiders and their potential role as sentinels is critical because it would allow for development of national-scale programs that utilize riparian spiders as sentinels to monitor chemical contaminants in aquatic ecosystems. A riparian spider sentinel program in the United States would be complementary to existing national sentinel programs, including those for fish and immature dragonflies.

TI  - Inter-comparisons of mean, trend and interannual variability of global terrestrial gross primary production retrieved from remote sensing approach
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Many models were established to estimate gross primary production (GPP) of terrestrial ecosystems based on vegetation light use efficiency (LUE). Analysing the spatial-temporal variations of global terrestrial GPP became capable with the increasing length of satellite data. Previous studies mainly focused on evaluating the model performance or investigating the mean, the temporal trend or the interannual variability (IAV) of global terrestrial GPP based on one single or multiple models, which is difficult to identify common merits of a same cluster of GPP models. This study compared eight satellite-based LEU-type GPP models in capturing the mean, temporal trend and IAV of global GPP concurrently. Our results showed that current common-used models based on LUE methodology estimated global mean GPP ranging from 128.5 to 158.3 Pg C year(-1), and global mean IAV ranging from 0.1 to 0.35, but the trends ranging from -0.22 to 0.51 Pg C year(-1). In the context of plant functional types (PFTs) and climate classifications, no consistent feature for either of the mean, trend or IAV of GPP are identified among eight models. Future studies should integrate the latest advances on the mechanisms and associated environmental factors into models and consolidate performance of models to better understand the evolutions of terrestrial ecosystem functioning.

TI  - Using remote sensing data for geological mapping in semi-arid environment: a machine learning approach
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The geological map encapsulates basic information that can be crucial in a multitude of fields such as landslide risk assessment, engineering projects, as well as petroleum and mineral resources studies. In addition, it is difficult, expensive and time-consuming to achieve it in complex and inaccessible lands. However, remote sensing data linking and the application of Machine Learning Algorithms (MLAs) can be interesting for geological mapping of large areas, especially in arid and semi-arid regions, where remote sensing provides a diversified and detailed spatial database and MLAs offer the possibility of effective and efficient classification of remotely sensed images. This article highlights the use of Aster spectral data in a comparative approach of the performance of six (MLAs) to better produce the geological map of a portion of the Ait Ahmane region. The results indicated an overall Accuracy and a kappa coefficient that exceeded 60% for the different models. Prioritizing the Regularized Discriminant Analysis (RDA) (Kappa = 83.5%) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) (Kappa = 81%) algorithms, they managed to classify the lithology on Aster images of the region. However, the classification of lithology using the RDA was slightly more accurate than the one obtained by SVM with 2.3%. From the results shown, we can conclude that the ability of RDA as a learning algorithm is the best for the geological mapping of our study site.

TI  - Ultrasound-guided lymph node biopsy sampling to study the immunopathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis: a well-tolerated valuable research tool
T2  - ARTHRITIS RESEARCH & THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Analyses of lymphoid organs are required to further elucidate the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Yet, invasive tissue collection methods are scarcely applied, because they are often considered burdensome, although patients do not always consider invasive methods as a high burden. We aimed to investigate the perspectives of study participants undergoing ultrasound-guided inguinal lymph node (LN) needle biopsy sampling and determine the molecular and cellular quantity and quality of LN biopsies. Methods Together with patient research partners, questionnaires were developed to evaluate the motives, expectations, and experiences of participants undergoing a LN biopsy. Healthy controls and RA(-risk) patients were asked to complete these questionnaires before and after the procedure. RNA and lymphocyte yields from obtained LN biopsies were also calculated. Results We included 50 individuals, of which 43 (86%) reported their pre- and post-procedure experiences. The median reported pain on a 5-point Likert scale (1 not to 5 very painful) was 1. Interestingly, almost all (n = 32; 74%) study participants would undergo a second procedure and more than half (n = 23; 54%) would encourage others to take part in the LN biopsy study. Motives for current and future participation were mostly altruistic. Inguinal hematoma occurred frequently, but no other significant or unexpected complications ensued. The LN biopsies yielded sufficient and high-quality RNA and lymphocyte numbers. Conclusions Ultrasound-guided inguinal LN biopsy sampling is well-tolerated, safe, and provides sufficient material for further molecular and cellular analyses. Our participants' positive experiences endorse the application of this research tool to further elucidate the pathogenesis of RA and other inflammatory diseases.

TI  - Surface evolution and dynamics of the Kangriz glacier, western Himalaya in past 50 years
T2  - COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier specific studies, in a relatively unexplored terrain of Ladakh, hold immense importance to comprehend not only the glacier response but also its synchronicity with the general regional trend. Accordingly, in this study, the Kangriz glacier in the Suru sub-basin, western Himalaya, has been taken up for multiparametric (area, terminal retreat, debriscover, snow line altitude, surface dynamics) assessment for the period 1971-2018. Results reveal an overall shrinkage of 3.3 +/- 1.6%, with an expansion in the supraglacial debris cover by 45% (1971-2018). Concomitantly, the glacier surface velocity has reduced by 10.85 +/- 5.68 ma(-1) (35%), from 31.2 +/- 5.8 ma(-1) (1993/94) to 20.3 +/- 1.7 ma(-1) (2017/18), with mass wastage of-0.52 +/- 0.19 m w.e.a(-1) during 2000-17. The notable glacier degeneration is synchronous with regional warming (T(max )increase by 7%, T(min )increase by 43%, T(avg )increase by 64%) and a decrease in precipitation by 3% (significant at alpha < 0.05). Besides, frontal dynamics have changed recently, with an enhanced intensity of terminal retreat (2016-2018: 57 & PLUSMN; 13 (Stdev) ma(-1)). The overall glacier status suggests a degenerative pattern of the glacier, which is in sync with the other western Himalayan glaciers. In view of the recently amplified ice-calving events and rapid mass loss observed in the snout region, the frontal glacier morphology may change drastically in the coming years .

TI  - Supporting the design of useful and relevant holistic frameworks for land use opportunity assessment for indigenous people
T2  - AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Choices about how to use land are critical to efforts to manage water quality in Aotearoa-New Zealand. Maori and non-Maori communities need decision-making frameworks that enable their values and priorities to inform land use choices. However, few of the available frameworks meet the needs of Maori communities. It is challenging to construct decision-making frameworks that have true utility for both Maori and non-Maori land stewards because of differences in their relationships with the whenua (land), the wai (the water) and te taiao (the environment). Additionally, Maori may utilise different types and formats of data in their decision-making from those traditionally encompassed by science-based frameworks. This paper aims to help non-indigenous researchers understand the required development processes and design features if a framework aimed at a broad audience is to have genuine relevance and utility for indigenous users. To achieve this, we utilised a modified version of Cash et al.'s Credibility, Salience and Legitimacy framework to evaluate a range of land use decision-making frameworks. We discuss why science-based concepts of holism are not the same as those embodied by a Maori worldview. We conclude that it is essential to co-develop frameworks in genuine partnership with Maori.

TI  - Global mapping reveals increase in lacustrine algal blooms over the past decade
T2  - NATURE GEOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Algal blooms constitute an emerging threat to global inland water quality, yet their spatial and temporal distribution at the global scale remains largely unknown. Here we establish a global bloom database, using 2.91 million Landsat satellite images from 1982 to 2019 to characterize algal blooms in 248,243 freshwater lakes, representing 57.1% of the global lake area. We show that 21,878 lakes (8.8%) spread across six continents have experienced algal blooms. The median bloom occurrence of affected lakes was 4.6%, but this frequency is increasing; we found increased bloom risks in the 2010s, globally (except for Oceania). The most pronounced increases were found in Asia and Africa, mostly in developing countries that remain reliant on agricultural fertilizer. As algal blooms continue to expand in scale and magnitude, this baseline census will be vital towards future risk assessments and mitigation efforts.Algal blooms are occurring more frequently, as seen in a global database compiled from satellite imagery from the past few decades.

TI  - Tissue-Resident Macrophages in the Stria Vascularis
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Tissue-resident macrophages play an important role in clearance, development, and regulation of metabolism. They also function as sentinel immune cells, initiating inflammatory responses, clearing inflammatory debris, and maintaining homeostatic tissue environment. In the cochlea, the roles of tissue-resident macrophages include maintaining steady-state tissues, immunological defense, and repairing pathological conditions associated with noise, ototoxic drugs, aging, and various pathogens. Perivascular macrophages (PVMs) are a unique subset of tissue-resident macrophages that are closely associated with blood vessels and have unique expression markers in certain tissues. PVMs are found in the inner ear, brain, skin, liver, and retina. The origin of PVMs in the inner ear is unclear, but they are already present during embryonic development. PVMs are members of the blood labyrinth barrier and regulate blood vessel permeability in the stria vascularis, which lies on the lateral wall of the cochlear duct and is crucial for endocochlear potential formation. The cytoplasm of strial PVMs can contain pigment granules that increase in number with age. Strial PVMs are activated by the loss of Slc26a4 in the cochleae, and they subsequently phagocytose aggregated pigment granules and possibly degenerated intermediate cells. This review summarizes the current knowledge of characteristic features and proposed roles of PVMs in the stria vascularis. We also address macrophage activation and involvement of pigment granules with the loss of Slc26a4 in the cochleae.

TI  - An Integrated Approach for Determining the Anthropogenic Stress Responsible for Degradation of a Ramsar Site - Wular Lake in Kashmir, India
T2  - MARINE GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - During the last one and half decade, Kashmir valley's water bodies have been facing widespread water quality deterioration due to anthropogenic interferences' enhancement. In this context, the present study aims to monitor the water quality of Wular Lake by subjecting the acquired datasets to statistical approaches to infer status about distinctions and similarities among different sampling sites under investigation. The study integrated multiple data sets pertaining to analysis and assessment of water quality parameters, physicochemical concentration values, land use change systems, and water quality index through remote sensing and GIS environments. For limnological characterization of the lake, surface water quality data have been collected from seven randomly selected site pertaining to 22 physicochemical parameters, which were further analyzed. Settlements, agriculture, and horticulture in the lake's immediate vicinity were mapped using LISS IV satellite data of the year 2008-2019. The water quality index under this study comprises 12 measurable physicochemical parameters - pH, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, total hardness, calcium content, magnesium content, nitrate nitrogen, chloride, turbidity, potassium, sodium and total alkalinity. Based on WQI values, the whole lake was divided into five zones, comprising least polluted zone (<50), moderately polluted zone (50-100), highly polluted zone (100-200), very highly polluted zone (200-300) and extremely polluted zone (>300). From this study, it has been found that WQI values for site S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6 and S7 are 179.62, 149.8, 160.61, 205.21, 200.5, 164.95 and 183.74, respectively. Thus, revealing that site S4 and S5 fall under the 'very highly polluted zone' and the remaining sites S1, S2, S3, S6 and S7 under 'highly polluted zone'. Land use category settlement record a growth rate of +50.79%, horticulture +25.96%, agriculture -11.8% and water body (open waters) -24.3% from the year 2008-2019. The reckless use of fertilizers, insecticides, pesticides in orchards and agricultural farms reinforced by concrete jungles in the immediate vicinity of Wular Lake have also enhanced the nutrient enrichment and deterioration of the water quality. Thus, escalating its scope towards the process of eutrophication.

TI  - Characterization of column flow regimes on horizontal tubes for falling-film systems: An experimental approach
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The intertube flow regimes and hydrodynamic behavior of the liquid profile have a significant impact on the functioning of falling-film evaporators. Column flow is one of the fundamental flow modes, which is actively observed in many industrial evaporators. A high-speed digital photographic device is utilized to visualize the complete progression of column flow phases for intertube distances of 10/20/30/40 mm and Reynolds number (Re) values ranging from 41 to 583. The Sobel edge detection algorithm is implemented to quantify the flow parameters for each frame of a sequence. The research results indicated that the column flow regime between the inline horizontal tubes can be broadly classified into the following phases: columnar droplet flow, periodic column flow, satellite drops column flow, drift column flow, and mixing liquid film column flow. The findings show that the liquid jet diameters between the tubes range from 1.6 to 8.46 mm, an increase in the liquid jet diameter with Re and a decrease with tube-to-tube distance. The axial coverage of the liquid film profile beneath the tube differed from 2.07 to 3.99 mm and over the tube surface ranged from 1.14 to 2.68 mm. The formation of dry spots and flooding is a major problem in the operation of falling-film heat exchangers. The shape and size of the liquid jet have a direct impact on the interfacial area; understanding the entire progression of column flow regimes, as well as their characteristics, can help designers avoid the aforementioned problem.

TI  - Performance evaluation of deep e-CNN with integrated spatial-spectral features in hyperspectral image classification
T2  - MEASUREMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep neural networks, an emerging paradigm in deep learning, have proven to make feature extraction from remote sensing data easier. Deep learning has been shown to be capable of effectively classifying hyperspectral images (HSI). Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are one of the most effective approaches for HSI classification. The deep learning architecture needs to be capable of providing a better spatial-spectral classification performance. In increasing the depth of layers in CNN might lead to overfitting issues. As spatial-spectral information is not correlated along different layers, hence information is lost. This paper attempts to solve these problems by presenting an enhanced-CNN. Initially, proposed e-CNN method explores the merging of the outputs of successive two layers within the huge convolutional block and the merged feature extract outcome is fed as the input to the next layer, which renders relevant feature extraction. Then, from low-level layers to deep high-level layers, spectral-spatial features are retrieved by concatenating the spectral features to four-stage spatial features. Finally, to communicate with hybridized extracted feature information, a 1 x 1 convolution layer is used throughout the block. With the limited training samples and the provided pixel-size the proposed e-CNN model works much effectively. In order to obtain the standard generalizing ability of classification an adaptive AdaBound optimization method is used. Finally, HSI classification is performed with the enhanced CNN model. The existing models and optimizers (SGD, AdaGrad, AdaDelta, Adam) are used to compare the results. The experiments were carried out on widely used HSI datasets (i.e., Indian Pines and Salinas) and the result of the proposed e-CNN model with AdaBound optimizer obtains ~2% higher accuracy compared with existing methods. Optimization result of e-CNN model with AdaBound optimizer have the highest classification accuracy in the least amount of time.

M3  - Article
AB  - Urban areas of major cities in developing countries are expanding rapidly due to rapid population growth and industrialization. Determining the reasons for rapid urbanization and the amount of urban area that will be needed in the future is important for the planned growth of these cities. In this study, the LU/LC change of Eskisehir city center that has a rapid rate of urbanization and industrialization in Turkey between 1984 and 2020 was determined. Then, the area needed for urban and industrial areas in 2030 was investigated using the Cullullar Automata-Markov Chain (CA-MC) hybrid model simulation. Each year's LU/LC map was produced with over 80% kappa accuracies performing the pixel-based Random Forest (RF) algorithm for change analysis. In the change analysis made between 1984 and 2020, it was determined that there was a change of 117% in the urban area and 977% in the industrial area. The prediction was made for the validation of the CA-MC model from the period 2000-2010 to 2020. When compared with the 2020 LU/LC map, the model success was obtained as 0.84, 0.87, and 0.87 in the Kstandard, Klocation, and Kno Kappa metrics, respectively. By using the 2010-2020 periods in the estimation of 2030, it has been observed that the urban and industrial area will increase by 22.95%; therefore, there will be decreases in agriculture and other natural areas as in previous years.

This article will review the advances that have led to our current understanding of tear trough anatomy. We propose a new functional classification of the lid-cheek junction for soft tissue filler treatment, and suggest simpler stratification of patients seeking lower eyelid treatment based on the etiology of their tear trough depression. We aim to describe a stepwise approach to management, with specific technical considerations targeting the underlying causes of lower eyelid pathology. The common complications and pitfalls of non-surgical tear trough management will be discussed.

TI  - Unwrapping reworked crust at the Columbia supercontinent margin within central southern Amazon Craton using multi-source geophysics and geochronology data synergy
T2  - GEOSCIENCE FRONTIERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The geometry and evolution of pre-existing basement in accretionary belts bordering supercontinents are often unclear. Integrative interpretation of long-wavelength potential field satellite data can image deep crust structure, improving our understanding of lithospheric processes that formed these margins bottom-up. Here, we present a multidisciplinary interpretation of the lithospheric architecture of the central southern Amazon Craton, a fragment of an accretionary belt at the southwestern Columbia super-continent margin. Satellite-borne gravity and magnetic data, airborne magnetic data, passive seismic (V-p/V-s, ratio, crustal thickness) and seismic tomography data reveals that basement terranes from the interior of the craton extend into the accretionary margin of Columbia. We demonstrate a vertically heterogeneous structure with an underlying strongly reworked pre-Columbia tectonic wedge that sustained prolonged modification during the supercontinent assembly as corroborated by Nd isotope and geochronology data. Nd isotope data suggest that the protracted orogenic wedge was influenced by subduction angle shifts over time, including addition of substantial juvenile material during slab retreat events. This interplay promoted Craton growth at the supercontinent margin while keeping a subtle record of the pre-existing framework. Our findings point to the possible misrepresentation of basement extension and geometry of supercontinent margins elsewhere.

TI  - Mt. Everest's highest glacier is a sentinel for accelerating ice loss
T2  - NPJ CLIMATE AND ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mountain glacier systems are decreasing in volume worldwide yet relatively little is known about their upper reaches (>5000 m). Here we show, based on the world's highest ice core and highest automatic weather stations, the significant and increasing role that melting and sublimation have on the mass loss of even Mt. Everest's highest glacier (South Col Glacier, 8020 m). Estimated contemporary thinning rates approaching similar to 2 m a(-)(1) water equivalent (w.e.) indicate several decades of accumulation may be lost on an annual basis now that glacier ice has been exposed. These results identify extreme sensitivity to glacier surface type for high altitude Himalayan ice masses and forewarn of rapidly emerging impacts as Mt. Everest's highest glacier appears destined for rapid retreat.

TI  - NDVI-based ecological dynamics of forest vegetation and its relationship to climate change in Romania during 1987-2018
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests have become increasingly stressed by climate change, including in Romania over recent decades, but their response to climate dynamics has not yet been analysed in this country. This study aims to investigate, for the first time, recent ecological changes in forests across Romania, in relation to climate dynamics that affected the country from 1987 to 2018. To this end, countrywide remote sensing (Landsat) data were processed for forest boundaries over the 32 years, in order to compute annual (summer season data) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) datasets, which were subsequently investigated as trends using the Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope estimator. Simultaneously, various climatic data (temperature, precipitation and reference evapotranspiration) were processed through interpolation techniques and via the same two statistical tools, and were subsequently used for exploring the impact of climate change on Romanian forestlands after 1987. The results highlighted general greening (increasing NDVI) trends of forests nationally (65% of all NDVI changes, which total over 30.000 km(2) across Romania), which were dominated by widespread positive NDVI trends detected in the Carpathians region of Romania. This general ecological dynamic suggests a possible enhancement in vegetation productivity in the country's high-altitude areas. Contrasting browning (decreasing NDVI) trends were found for 35% of Romanian forestlands marked by NDVI changes, especially apparent in the Extra-Carpathians (lowland) region, which indicates that in these cases forests were degraded or devitalized. However, the statistical significance of both greening and browning trends is limited across the country. The analysis of climatic trends and of correlations between annual NDVI and climate data indicated that recent warming throughout Carpathians may be an important driving force of forest greening in temperature-limited mountain regions. This finding is supported by an at least moderate intensity of air temperature - NDVI relationships (r correlation coefficient values of similar to 50%, the highest of all eco-climatic relationships analysed), generally detected throughout mountain environments. At the same time, it seems that evapotranspiration increase accounted at least in part for forest browning in lowland areas, while the impact of precipitation in forest ecological dynamics remains unclear. All these findings can be useful for a better forest management under the future climate change conditions in Romania.

TI  - Long-term data reveal greater intertidal oyster biomass in predicted suitable habitat
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Habitat suitability models have been used for decades to develop spatially explicit predictions of landscape capacity to support populations of target species. As high-resolution remote sensing data are increasingly included in habitat suitability models that inform spatial conservation and restoration decisions, it is essential to validate model predictions with independent, quantitative data collected over sustained time frames. Here, we used data collected from 12 reefs over a 14 yr sampling period to validate a recently developed physical habitat suitability model for intertidal oyster reefs in coastal Virginia, USA. The model used intertidal elevation, water residence time, and fetch to predict the likelihood of suitable conditions for eastern oysters Crassostrea virginica across a coastal landscape, and remotely sensed elevation was the most restrictive parameter in the model. Model validation revealed that adult oyster biomass was on average 1.5 times greater on oyster reefs located in predicted 'suitable' habitat relative to reefs located in predicted 'less suitable' habitat over the 14 yr sampling period. By validating this model with long-term population data, we highlight the importance of elevation as a driver of sustained intertidal oyster success. These findings extend the validation of habitat suitability models by quantitatively supporting the inclusion of remotely sensed data in habitat suitability models for intertidal species. Our results suggest that future oyster restoration and aquaculture projects could enhance oyster biomass by using habitat suitability models to select optimal site locations.

TI  - Applications of a thermal-based two-source energy balance model coupled to surface soil moisture
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The two-source energy balance (TSEB) model using the land surface temperature (LST) as a key boundary has been used to estimate land surface evapotranspiration (ET) over various landcovers and environmental conditions. However, LST may not always provide an adequate boundary condition to simultaneously constrain the soil evaporation and plant transpiration especially under water limited conditions. A refinement to TSEB model by coupling surface soil moisture information to derive the soil and vegetation component temperatures and a new transpiration algorithm was developed (TSEB-SM). The TSEB-SM model was evaluated under a wide range of surface soil water content values and vegetation cover conditions and compared with the performance with the original TSEB model using only LST. While the results showed that the TSEB-SM model produced similar agreement in the fluxes and ET as the original TSEB for the cropland and grassland sites, TSEB-SM model performance was notably improved at the shrub-forest and desert steppe sites with a significant reduction in mean absolute percent difference in daily ET from nearly 65% to 25% and from approximately 50% to 40%, respectively. It also appears to be more reliable in partitioning ET into soil evaporation and plant transpiration when compared to the partitioning using the water use efficiency (uWUE) approach in combination with the eddy covariance measurements. With satellite data such as MODIS LST and leaf area index, and surface soil moisture retrievals from microwave satellite observations, the TSEB-SM model may potentially be a more reliable tool for monitoring regional ET partitioning under sparse canopy cover conditions.

TI  - Wildlife hair as bioindicators of metal exposure
T2  - BIOLOGICAL TRACE ELEMENT RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Animal hair is a useful biomonitoring tool for assessing the occurrence of trace elements in ecosystems. Essential (chromium, copper, iron, manganese, nickel, and zinc) and nonessential (aluminum, arsenic, cadmium, mercury, lead, palladium, platinum, rubidium, tin, and vanadium) elements were investigated in hair of badger (Meles meles), wild boar (Sus scrofa), marmot (Marmota marmota), wolf (Canis lupus), fox (Vulpes vulpes) and deer (Cervus elaphus) from Northwestern Italy. Badger was found to be the highest bioaccumulator of metals, while wolf, fox and deer recorded the lowest values. Essential elements contribute in higher degree to the sum of metals for all species except for wild boar. Results have shown that animals with omnivorous diet such as badger, marmot and wild boar have metal content (especially Al, As, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, V) higher than carnivores (wolf and fox) and herbivores (deer) and could represent an effective sentinel of environmental exposure to metals.

TI  - Potential of functional analysis applied to Sentinel-2 time-series to assess relevant agronomic parameters at the within-field level in viticulture
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-2 satellite imagery offers a wealth of spectral information combined with a weekly temporal resolution. It is seen as a promising tool to extract spatial information about vineyards and link them to agronomic parameters. Usually, only one or a few images are commonly employed at specific stages like veraison in viticulture. Extracting further information from time-series images may be of interest; however, this remains an issue due to the noisy and complex nature of extracted time-series. The functional analysis proposes a robust continuous representation of these time-series, which can then be used with adapted statistical tools. This paper focuses on extracting relevant information at the within-field level on two vineyards in Spain, which can be jointly interpreted with field observations and measurements. More precisely, it discusses the use of popular linear dimensionality reduction techniques, namely Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least Square (PLS), adapted to functional data in order to decompose NDVI time-series into a weighted sum of several functional components. The unsupervised methods, like PCA, decomposed the spatial structure within the vineyards using a few components, resulting in a better and more manageable dataset than the one obtained using simple non-constrained methods. The results show significant correlations with ground-truth data showing the added value of considering the whole NDVI temporal series compared to a single NDVI map at veraison. The proposed approach provided helpful information about each component's yearly trend. Moreover, the results are linked to grapevines' seasonal phenology and management practices, highlighting phenomena affecting the vineyard's development. This method is particularly suited for interactions with field experts, who may derive relevant agronomic information from the decomposition maps.

TI  - Assessing the Effects of Surface Conditions on Potential Evapotranspiration in a Humid Subtropical Region of China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The ability of the atmosphere to remove water from land surface is measured by potential evapotranspiration (ETp), which is often inferred by the reference evapotranspiration (ETo). Therefore, ETp is often considered only influenced by the above-ground meteorological conditions. Based on its concept, ETp should also link with surface conditions that influence the surface resistance. Such linkages differ in dry and wet regions with different surface covers. Here, we calculated ETo and especially analyzed the effects of surface conditions including vegetation cover indicated by NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and root-zone SWC (soil water content) in a humid subtropical province of China. Results show that ETp, NDVI, wind speed, temperatures have increased significantly during 1982-2015 and relative humidity (RH) has decreased significantly. Linear trends of these variables varied across seasons, but similarities were found between spring and winter and between summer and autumn. Summer saw the greatest changes in ETp per unit of environmental variable change. Solar radiation, RH, and precipitation exerted overall stronger influence on ETp (R-2 > 0.50) than other factors. NDVI and SWC were found positively and negatively affecting ETp at all time scales. Partial correlation analysis showed significant influence of NDVI and SWC at the monthly scale; moreover, SWC influenced ETp more significantly in summer than other seasons (p < 0.05). Since actual evapotranspiration is often deducted from ETp by multiplicative stress functions in many hydrologic models, understanding the relationships between ETp and environmental changes can help improve the formulation and estimation of actual evapotranspiration.

TI  - Combining both spectral and textural indices for alleviating saturation problem in forest LAI estimation using Sentinel-2 data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is an important structural parameter that controls energy, water, and gas exchanges of plant ecosystems. At present, remote sensing techniques, especially passive optical remote sensing, are the most widely used approaches to estimate LAI. However, the prevalent usage of spectral information alone often saturates, which is a major issue for retrieving LAI in particular for forests. In this study, our goal was to improve LAI estimation using Sentinel-2 data by combining both spectral and texture information to minimize the saturation effect in a typical cool-temperate deciduous forest in Japan. Two LAI field datasets obtained using digital hemispherical photographs, representing a range of LAI conditions, were used to investigate the performance of spectral and texture features or a combination of both. Texture information was derived using the grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) method. Commonly used vegetation indices and newly developed textural indices were computed for comparison. Spatial autocorrelation was determined prior to exploratory regression analyses to explore methods for estimating LAI using a combination of spectral- and texture-based features. Regression methods included generalized least squares (GLS), stepwise, principal components (PCR), and partial least squares (PLS). The results demonstrate that the texture information derived from Sentinel-2 imagery helps estimate LAI by minimizing the saturation problem, especially in the period of maximum LAI values. The combination of both features using the PLS model provided a higher accuracy estimation scheme for LAI (R-2: 0.66-0.75, RMSE: 0.23-0.37) and we foresee the wide application of the approach especially for a closed-canopy forest facing serious saturation problem when deriving LAI from reflected spectral information.

TI  - Monitoring glacial lake outburst flood susceptibility using Sentinel-1 SAR data, Google Earth Engine, and persistent scatterer interferometry
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuous monitoring of glacial lakes, their parent glaciers and their surroundings is crucial because possible outbursts of these lakes pose a serious hazard to downstream areas. Ongoing climate change increases the risk of this hazard globally due to recession of glaciers leading to formation and expansion of glacial lakes, and permafrost degradation which impacts the stability of glaciers, slopes and moraines. Here, we demonstrate the capability of our approach for monitoring lake outburst susceptibility using time-series of Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (S-1 SAR) data. We selected Lunana in the Bhutanese Himalayas as an example region as it is highly susceptible to glacial lake outburst floods and suitable baseline data were available. We used Google Earth Engine (GEE) to calculate average radar backscatter intensity (ARBI) of glaciers, lakes, basins, and moraines. To determine the periodicity of the highest and the lowest radar backscatter intensity, we denoised the ARBI data using a Fast Fourier Transform and autocorrelated using a Pearson correlation function. Additionally, we determined glacier melt area, basin melt area, lake area, open water area, and lake ice area using radar backscatter intensity data. The Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) technique was used to investigate the stability of moraines and slopes around glacial lakes. The PSI results were qualitatively validated by comparison with high-resolution digital elevation model differencing results. Our approach showed that glaciers and basins in the region underwent seasonal and periodic changes in their radar backscatter intensity related to changes in ice and snow melt. Lakes also showed seasonal changes in their radar backscatter intensity related to the variation of lake ice and open water area, but the radar backscatter intensity change was not periodic. We could also infer lake area change using a time-series radar backscatter intensity data such as the rapid expansion of Bechung Tsho. The PSI analysis showed that all the terminal moraines were stable except Drukchung Tsho. Its terminal moraine showed subsidence at the rate of -5.18 mm/yr. Sidewalls of lakes were also stable with the exception of Lugge Tsho at site 4. Due to the free availability of S-1 SAR data, the efficiency of processing a large amount of imagery within GEE, and the PSI technique, we were able to understand the outburst susceptibility of glacial lakes in the region at great detail. The regular acquisition of S-1 SAR data enables continuous monitoring of glacial lakes. A similar approach and concept can be transferred to any geographic region on earth that shares similar challenges in glacial lake monitoring.

TI  - Weakening of the pinning point buttressing Thwaites Glacier, West Antarctica
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Thwaites Eastern Ice Shelf buttresses a significant portion of Thwaites Glacier through contact with a pinning point 40 km offshore of the present grounding line. Predicting future rates of Thwaites Glacier's contribution to sea-level rise depends on the evolution of this pinning point and the resultant change in the ice-shelf stress field since the breakup of the Thwaites Western Glacier Tongue in 2009. Here we use Landsat-8 feature tracking of ice velocity in combination with ice-sheet model perturbation experiments to show how past changes in flow velocity have been governed in large part by changes in lateral shear and pinning point interactions with the Thwaites Western Glacier Tongue. We then use recent satellite altimetry data from ICESat-2 to show that Thwaites Glacier's grounding line has continued to retreat rapidly; in particular, the grounded area of the pinning point is greatly reduced from earlier mappings in 2014, and grounded ice elevations are continuing to decrease. This loss has created two pinned areas with ice flow now funneled between them. If current rates of surface lowering persist, the Thwaites Eastern Ice Shelf will unpin from the seafloor in less than a decade, despite our finding from airborne radar data that the seafloor underneath the pinning point is about 200 m shallower than previously reported. Advection of relatively thin and mechanically damaged ice onto the remaining portions of the pinning point and feedback mechanisms involving basal melting may further accelerate the unpinning As a result, ice discharge will likely increase up to 10 % along a 45 km stretch of the grounding line that is currently buttressed by the Thwaites Eastern Ice Shelf.

TI  - New insights into the 2020 Sardoba dam failure in Uzbekistan from Earth observation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - On 1 May 2020, the Sardoba Reservoir in Uzbekistan breached its western wall, and the uncontrolled release of water caused casualties, environmental damages and economic losses. We investigate the dam failure based on three sets of Earth observation data, including: (i) satellite altimetry products, i.e., ICESat-2 data, with the aim of understanding the topographic features in the study area; (ii) multi-geometry Sentinel-1 SAR data to retrieve the pre-failure deformation along the vertical and horizontal east-west directions between 2017 and 2020; (iii) optical images from Sentinel-2 satellites and Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) products, which are involved in exploring the environmental status before the failure. We analyse the possible causes of the collapse in terms of both physical and human factors. The differential settlement of-60 mm revealed by InSAR at the failure section is a sign of internal erosion through the embankment, which is the physical factor contributing to the failure. The opportunity to prevent the collapse were missed due to the human factor of ignorance brought by limitations of the conventional monitoring methods. Neither ground observations nor satellite-based GPM products show extreme precipitation in the region, ruling out the likelihood of rainfall-induced overtopping. The settlement rate of the embankment shows no decaying trend, indicating that the dam is undergoing the primary consolidation phase of total settlement. Maximum settlement of-270 mm (-0.8% of the dam height) has happened on the north bank since the reservoir impoundment, which should raise concern in future monitoring and surveillance. The results reveal that InSAR can discern the failure precursor by detecting surface motion, and that the deformation signals can help to warn of risks and avoid dam damage. We recommend InSAR defor-mation monitoring be included in future safety programs, providing detailed deformation and resisting risks of ignorance.

TI  - Contrasting impacts of forests on cloud cover based on satellite observations
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - How forests influence cloud cover in different regions is not well understood. Here, the authors use satellite data to show that forests enhance clouds over most temperate and boreal forests but inhibited clouds over forests of Amazon, Central Africa, and Southeast US relative to nonforest areas.Forests play a pivotal role in regulating climate and sustaining the hydrological cycle. The biophysical impacts of forests on clouds, however, remain unclear. Here, we use satellite data to show that forests in different regions have opposite effects on summer cloud cover. We find enhanced clouds over most temperate and boreal forests but inhibited clouds over Amazon, Central Africa, and Southeast US. The spatial variation in the sign of cloud effects is driven by sensible heating, where cloud enhancement is more likely to occur over forests with larger sensible heat, and cloud inhibition over forests with smaller sensible heat. Ongoing forest cover loss has led to cloud increase over forest loss hotspots in the Amazon (+0.78%), Indonesia (+1.19%), and Southeast US (+ 0.09%), but cloud reduction in East Siberia (-0.20%) from 2002-2018. Our data-driven assessment improves mechanistic understanding of forest-cloud interactions, which remain uncertain in Earth system models.

TI  - Fine-resolution mapping of the circumpolar Arctic Man-made impervious areas (CAMI) using sentinels, OpenStreetMap and ArcticDEM
T2  - BIG EARTH DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Man-made impervious areas map is of great demand in environmental and urbanization studies since impervious areas are considered as a key indication of urbanization, especially for circumpolar Arctic. However, to date, finer resolution and spatially continuous impervious areas information remains scarce in the Arctic. In this study, we developed an accurate and complete circumpolar Arctic Man-made impervious areas (CAMI) map at a resolution of 10 m by combining Sentinel-1 C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar, Sentinel-2 multispectral images, OpenStreetMap, and ArcticDEM via Google Earth Engine platform. A random forest classifier model was trained and used to generate corresponding impervious areas map for the year 2020. The evaluation results suggested that CAMI was the most accurate with an overall accuracy of 86.36% and kappa coefficient of 70.73% as against the three existing impervious areas products. Based on the generated map and OpenStreetMap, we estimated that total impervious areas area in the Arctic has achieved 807.80 km(2), of which roads, industrial and resident land were three major land use types, accounting for 54.08%, 17.85% and 10.34%, respectively. The CAMI map will support for new application and provide advanced insight into the infrastructure vulnerability evaluation and environmental sustainability in the Arctic.

TI  - Radiometric calibration stability assessment of Sentinel-1B using point targets at Surat Basin, Australia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MICROWAVE AND WIRELESS TECHNOLOGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The launch of the Sentinel-1B satellite in April 2016 completed the two-satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) constellation of the European Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission. The European Space Agency executed the calibration of this sensor during the commissioning phase and an independent calibration by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in 2016. The calibration parameters must be monitored to assess the stability of the instrument. This study reports the temporal stability assessment of radiometric calibration and image quality parameters of Sentinel-1B SAR data using the corner reflector (CR) array, Surat Basin, Australia. Impulse response functions generated from the CRs in the satellite images were used to derive the image quality parameters. The average radar cross-section difference between estimated and theoretical values (38.40 dB m(2)) was 0.53 dB m(2) for 1.5 m CRs, which is accordant with the absolute radiometric accuracy specified for the Sentinel-1 SAR system. Derived image quality parameters viz. the mean peak-to-side lobe ratio, mean integrated side lobe ratio, and spatial resolutions in the range and azimuth directions were found to be accordant with the specified value for the Sentinel-1 SAR system. The results indicate the excellent quality of the Sentinel-1B data.

TI  - Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B cleaves GSDMA and triggers pyroptosis
T2  - NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Gasdermins, a family of five pore-forming proteins (GSDMA-GSDME) in humans expressed predominantly in the skin, mucosa and immune sentinel cells, are key executioners of inflammatory cell death (pyroptosis), which recruits immune cells to infection sites and promotes protective immunity(1,2). Pore formation is triggered by gasdermin cleavage(1,2). Although the proteases that activate GSDMB, C, D and E have been identified, how GSDMA-the dominant gasdermin in the skin-is activated, remains unknown. Streptococcus pyogenes, also known as group A Streptococcus (GAS), is a major skin pathogen that causes substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide(3). Here we show that the GAS cysteine protease SpeB virulence factor triggers keratinocyte pyroptosis by cleaving GSDMA after Gln246, unleashing an active N-terminal fragment that triggers pyroptosis. Gsdma1 genetic deficiency blunts mouse immune responses to GAS, resulting in uncontrolled bacterial dissemination and death. GSDMA acts as both a sensor and substrate of GAS SpeB and as an effector to trigger pyroptosis, adding a simple one-molecule mechanism for host recognition and control of virulence of a dangerous microbial pathogen.

TI  - Rodlet cells, fish immune cells and a sentinel of parasitic harm in teleost organs
T2  - FISH & SHELLFISH IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rodlet cells (RCs) are the enigmatic and distinctive pear-shaped cells had found in many tissues of marine and freshwater teleosts. They have a distinctive fibrous capsule or the cell cortex that envelopes conspicuous inclusions called rodlets, basally situated nucleus, and poorly developed mitochondria. The contraction of the cell cortex results in the expulsion of the cell contents through an apical opening. One hundred and thirty years since rodlet cells were first reported, many questions remain about their origin and a function. This review will present new evidence regarding the relationship between RCs and metazoan parasites, and a protozoan infecting organs of different fish species, and update the state of knowledge about the origin, structure and the function of these intriguing fish cells.

TI  - Water quality spatial-temporal analysis of gravel pit ponds in the southeast regional park Madrid (Spain) from 1984 to 2009.
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - We used a time series of Secchi disk values retrieved from Landsat 5 images to study temporal and spatial patterns of water quality across gravel pit ponds located in Madrid, Spain from 1984 to 2009. There is a seasonal behavior in the water quality, with higher values of Secchi disks in autumn and winter (December-February) and lower values in summer (July-August), which can be explained by the relationship between Secchi disk values and temperature and solar radiation. We found that the 1994 administrative declaration of the regional park has had a positive impact on the water quality. The trophic state of the studied pit ponds has slowly improved, though the ponds have not reached the oligotrophic state.

TI  - An integrated field data and remote sensing approach for impact assessment of human activities on epifauna macrobenthos biodiversity along the western coast of Aqaba Gulf
T2  - ECOHYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Egyptian coast of Gulf of Aqaba, north of the Red Sea, suffers from severe destruction and deterioration in habitat and biodiversity due to anthropogenic activities and flooding. The present work aims to evaluate the impacts of different human activities and flooding on the biodiversity of macrobenthic invertebrates along the Egyptian coast of the Gulf of Aqaba. From January 2019 to December 2019, many field trips (12 trips) were conducted to survey macrobenthic invertebrate communities and monitor water quality at nine sites within three sectors along the study area. Each site was divided into four ecological zones and one of five categories, according to the main activities at each site. Furthermore, satellite data were used to monitor the progress of land use and turbidity in the study area. Therefore, the current study assesses the relationship between these factors and water quality and macrobenthic invertebrate distributions, similarity, diversity, dominance and abundance. The results revealed that 53 macrobenthic invertebrate species belonging to three phyla (Mollusca, Echinodermata and Annelida) and one subphylum (Crustacea) were recorded. The echinoderm Echinometra mathaei was the major eudominant species. The northern part of the Gulf was higher in abundance and diversity with low land use and lowest water turbidity, while the south part showed contrary findings. All statistical analysis confirmed that the dissolved oxygen concentration was considered the only limiting factor for the abundance and diversity of macrobenthic invertebrates. Also, the variation in activities at investigated sites affected the dominance state of species in each site. Moreover, GPS data confirmed that the tourism activity had the largest influence on marine ecosystems and biodiversity, followed by fishing and desalination practices. Otherwise, flooding has significant influence on marine habitats and creates a habitat in which other certain species can survive. In the absence of awareness, intervention and disregard for the effective coastal zone management concept, especially for the unique marine ecosystems such as the Gulf of Aqaba, the degradation of biodiversity will continue until extinction, and human life is rendered unsustainable.

TI  - Challenges of operating a drilling instrument on a small rover at the lunar poles - LVS-PIE phase A study results
T2  - PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The "LVS-PIE Phase A" project successfully investigated the feasibility of using the Lunar Volatiles Scout instrument on the ispace Polar Ice Explorer rover to search for possible cold-trapped water ice deposits at the lunar poles. The suitability of the two systems for a joint mission was studied based on identified conflicts between both initial systems, such as the envelope for integration or the power budget. The interfaces were made compatible, mechanical structure and mechanisms were updated to enable system integration and thermal simulations were performed to refine the thermal design for safe operation within the thermal limits under lunar conditions. Thermal extraction simulations for the instrument constrained the power requirement during the instrument's heating phase. Real drilling down forces and reaction torques were determined with representative experiments for both rover and instrument revealing stable conditions during the envisioned drilling process. In the developed mission scenario, operational feasibility of the LVS-PIE mission concept was demonstrated using a notional traverse, remote sensing data and investigation of technical budgets. The mission can reach sites of high scientific interest at the lunar poles and perform relevant measurements with the instrument. A joined mission consisting of an instrument package for drilling and gas analysis on a rover below 20 kg total mass is found to be technically feasible and scientifically valuable.

T2  - WATER SUPPLY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assessed the performance remote sensing and geographic information system techniques for analysing of flood events in agricultural areas and estimating the flooded areas in agricultural lands. The Berdan Plain in the southern part of Turkey is below sea level and prone to flood events. The flooded agricultural areas were estimated by using Sentinel-2 satellite data for the Berdan Irrigation Scheme in December 2019-January 2020 period. The flooded area in the old Aynaz marsh was estimated as 486.79 hectares on 9 January 2020, while the total flooded area in the Berdan Irrigation Project was 4,515.58 hectares. Flood volume was calculated as 2.61 hm(3) and the highest water level was estimated to be -0.76 metres in the old Aynaz marsh.HIGHLIGHTSFlood inundation maps were produced by using Sentinel-2 images.MNDWI were used for inundation area detection.Dynamically monitoring the extent of the flood area during the event is possible with remote sensing.

TI  - A study to investigate the relationship between ionospheric disturbance and seismic activity based on Swarm satellite data
T2  - PHYSICS OF THE EARTH AND PLANETARY INTERIORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The 7 years electron density data observed by the Swarm constellation and 527 earthquakes with M >= 6.0 are used to investigate the relationship between ionospheric disturbances and seismic events. The disturbances of the ionospheric electron density, defined as the difference between the orbital observation data and its fitting data, are considered to be possible signals of the seismic activity and are often reported before or after earthquakes near the epicenter. To investigate the relationship between them, the spatial distribution characteristics of the disturbances are analysed, taking into account the influence of solar and geomagnetic activity on the disturbances; the variation characteristics of the disturbances in seismic and non-seismic regions are compared; the numbers of the disturbances before and after earthquakes are statistically analysed; and the statistical results of different earthquake groups are verified by comparison with random events. Finally, according to these analysis results, it can be concluded that most of the disturbances are related to ionospheric activities; some of disturbances are indeed related to seismic activity; the disturbances caused by seismic activities usually appear before the earthquakes. In terms of standardized probability, the results for M >= 6 earthquakes and sea earthquakes are most significant, exceeding two times the standard deviation at least 10 and 25 days before the earthquake, while the results for deep earthquakes (D >= 60 km) and land earthquakes are not significant. However, the disturbances caused by seismic activities are very weak and are hidden in those strong ionospheric activities. Therefore, the seismic ionospheric phenomena are so difficult to extract and identify, and more caution should be taken in the identification in future seismo-ionospheric phenomena research.

TI  - Land use change in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta: New evidence from remote sensing
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the first attempt to capture a comprehensive spatial view of land use change in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD) for a long period, i.e., from 2000 to 2020. It is aimed at monitoring holistically the land use change and flooding situation in the region, addressing the reasons for land use change, and assessing the impacts of land use change on hydraulic aspects and farmer livelihoods during the last 21 years. MODIS products, in particular, are used to study the dynamics of land use and floods after demonstrating high validation with statistical data and radar satellites, with R-2 = 0.96 and R-2 >= 0.97 for land use and flood maps, respectively. The results show that rice cultivation is the most dominant land use type, accounting for 40% to 46% of the delta area, while aquaculture accounts for 10% to 22%, respectively. The total rice cultivation area increased from 3764 thousand hectares (thous. ha) in 2001 to 4343 thous. ha in 2015 based on the intensive development of triple rice cropping in the upper zone, then decreased to 3963 thous. ha in 2020. In contrast, aquaculture areas are farmed mainly in the coastal area and remained relatively steady, increasing slightly from 619 thous. ha in 2001 to 856 thous. ha in 2020. The massive construction of dikes for triple rice cropping in the upper zone appears to cause a significant impact on the annual flooding regime. Land use policies have influenced the changes in land use patterns, flooding situations, and the livelihoods of local farmers. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Evaluating Confounding Control in Estimations of Influenza Antiviral Effectiveness in Electronic Health Plan Data
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Observational studies of oseltamivir use and influenza complications could suffer from residual confounding. Using negative control risk periods and a negative control outcome, we examined confounding control in a health-insurance-claims-based study of oseltamivir and influenza complications (pneumonia, all-cause hospitalization, and dispensing of an antibiotic). Within the Food and Drug Administration's Sentinel System, we identified individuals aged >= 18 years who initiated oseltamivir use on the influenza diagnosis date versus those who did not, during 3 influenza seasons (2014-2017). We evaluated primary outcomes within the following 1-30 days (the primary risk period) and 61-90 days (the negative control period) and nonvertebral fractures (the negative control outcome) within days 1-30. We estimated propensity-score-matched risk ratios (RRs) per season. During the 2014-2015 influenza season, oseltamivir use was associated with a reduction in the risk of pneumonia (RR = 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.70, 0.75) and all-cause hospitalization (RR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.53, 0.55) in days 1-30. During days 61-90, estimates were near-null for pneumonia (RR = 1.04, 95% CI: 0.95, 1.15) and hospitalization (RR = 0.94, 95% CI: 0.91, 0.98) but slightly increased for antibiotic dispensing (RR = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.21). The RR for fractures was near-null (RR = 1.09, 95% CI: 0.99, 1.20). Estimates for the 2016-2017 influenza season were comparable, while the 2015-2016 season had conflicting results. Our study suggests minimal residual confounding for specific outcomes, but results differed by season.

TI  - Evaluating the assimilation of S5P/TROPOMI near real-time SO<sub>2</sub> columns and layer height data into the CAMS integrated forecasting system (CY47R1), based on a case study of the 2019 Raikoke eruption
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS), operated by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts on behalf of the European Commission, provides daily analyses and 5 d forecasts of atmospheric composition, including forecasts of volcanic sulfur dioxide (SO2) in near real time. CAMS currently assimilates total column SO2 products from the GOME-2 instruments on MetOp-B and MetOp-C and the TROPOMI instrument on Sentinel-5P, which give information about the location and strength of volcanic plumes. However, the operational TROPOMI and GOME-2 data do not provide any information about the height of the volcanic plumes, and therefore some prior assumptions need to be made in the CAMS data assimilation system about where to place the resulting SO2 increments in the vertical. In the current operational CAMS configuration, the SO2 increments are placed in the mid-troposphere, around 550 hPa or 5 km. While this gives good results for the majority of volcanic emissions, it will clearly be wrong for eruptions that inject SO2 at very different altitudes, in particular exceptional events where part of the SO2 plume reaches the stratosphere.A new algorithm, developed by the German Aerospace Centre (DLR) for GOME-2 and TROPOMI, optimized in the frame of the ESA-funded Sentinel-5P Innovation-502 Layer Height Project, and known as the Full-Physics Inverse Learning Machine (FP_ILM) algorithm, retrieves SO2 layer height from TROPOMI in near real time (NRT) in addition to the SO2 column. CAMS is testing the assimilation of these products, making use of the NRT layer height information to place the SO2 increments at a retrieved altitude. Assimilation tests with the TROPOMI SO2 layer height data for the Raikoke eruption in June 2019 show that the resulting CAMS SO2 plume heights agree better with IASI plume height data than operational CAMS runs without the TROPOMI SO2 layer height information and show that making use of the additional layer height information leads to improved SO2 forecasts. Including the layer height information leads to higher modelled total column SO2 values in better agreement with the satellite observations. However, the plume area and SO2 burden are generally also overestimated in the CAMS analysis when layer height data are used. The main reason for this overestimation is the coarse horizontal resolution used in the minimizations. By assimilating the SO2 layer height data, the CAMS system can predict the overall location of the Raikoke SO2 plume up to 5 d in advance for about 20 d after the initial eruption, which is better than with the operational CAMS configuration (without prior knowledge of the plume height) where the forecast skill is much more reduced for longer forecast lead times.

TI  - Identifying determinants of spatio-temporal disparities in soil moisture of the Northern Hemisphere using a geographically optimal zones-based heterogeneity model
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is a fundamental ecological component for climate and hydrological studies. However, the distribution patterns of soil moisture are spatially heterogenous and influenced by multiple environmental factors. The knowledge is still limited in assessing the large-scale spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture in in situ data modelling, in situ network design, spatial down-scaling, and remote sensing-based soil moisture retrieval. Heterogeneity models are effective in characterizing spatial disparities, but they are not capable of examining the maximum regional disparities. To address this bottleneck, the authors of this study developed a geographically optimal zones-based heterogeneity (GOZH) model. By progressively optimizing geographical zones of soil moisture and quantifying the heterogeneity among zones, GOZH may help identify individual and interactive determinants of soil moisture across a large study area. It was applied to identify spatial determinants of in situ soil moisture data collected at 653 monitoring stations in the Northern Hemisphere in unfrozen and frozen seasons from April 2015 to December 2017, with only thawed data considered in both seasons. Correspondingly, a series of variables were derived from Google Earth Engine (GEE) remote sensing data. The results demonstrated the significant regional disparities of soil moisture, and the combinations of determinants are critically different among geographical zones and between unfrozen and frozen seasons. At a global scale, the combinations of determinants can explain about 48% of the spatial pattern of soil moisture. Spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture in frozen seasons is much more complex than that in unfrozen seasons regarding geographical zones and explanatory variables. The variability of soil moisture during unfrozen seasons can be more explainable than that during frozen seasons, which was a convincing evidence for previous studies that soil moisture predictions were mostly performed during unfrozen seasons. Primary variables that determine spatial patterns of soil moisture are changed from climate variables during the unfrozen season to geographical variables during the frozen season. Results show that GOZH model can effectively explore spatial determinants of soil moisture through avoiding the underestimation of individual variables, overestimation of multiple variables, and finely divide zones. The research findings from this study provide an in-depth understanding of the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture and can be implemented in more effective in situ sampling network design, spatial down-scaling of soil moisture, and accurate inversion of surface parameters from the satellite data of soil moisture.

TI  - Research on the spatiotemporal coupling relationships between land use/land cover compositions or patterns and the surface urban heat island effect
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization leads to changes in landscape configuration and land use/land cover (LULC) patterns, and these changes are important factors affecting the surface urban heat island (SUHI) effect. However, from the perspective of spatiotemporal changes, quantitative analytical results regarding the impacts of the LULC composition, configuration, and pattern in inland plateau lakeside cities on the SUHI effect, and the responsive relationships among these factors remain unclear. By combining satellite remote sensing data with analytical methods, such as urban-rural gradients, spatial statistics, and landscape pattern indices, the impacts of LULC changes on the SUHI effect in Kunming, China, are revealed. The results show the following. (1) The explosive growth in impervious surfaces (ISs) caused by urbanization, leading to changes in the LULC composition, configuration and pattern, is the main reason for the deterioration of the SUHI effect. Over the past 30 years, Kunming's ISs have increased by 304.58 km(2), SUHI has expanded by 764.26 km(2), and the regional average land surface temperature (LST) has increased by 1 degrees C. (2) This study also found that a large area of bare ground is another important reason for the sharp rise in LST, explaining why bare land (BL) has the highest average LST (28.72 degrees C). (3) The pattern of LULC can well explain the spatial distribution characteristics of SUHIs. The normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), normalized difference bareness index (NDBaI), and LST have the same change curve along the urban-rural gradient, while the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI), and LST have opposite trends. (4) ISs and water body (WB) are the main types of warming and cooling, respectively, but the warming effect of ISs is greater than the cooling effect of WB. From the average value of the correlation coefficient with LST, NDBI (0.84) > MNDWI (-0.63). (5) Kunming's remote sensing index values do not have simple linear relationships with the LST. NDBaI, NDBI, and LST show significant exponential relationships, and NDVI, MNDWI, and LST show significant quadratic polynomial relationships. (6) The dominant landscape type determines the correlation between the landscape shape index (LSI) and the LST of green spaces (GSs). (7) Adopting a simple and regular landscape layout can effectively reduce the SUHI effect. These research results could provide a scientific decision-making basis for the spatial urban planning and ecological construction of Kunming and could have practical significance for guiding the green, healthy, and sustainable development of the city.

TI  - Extracting built-up areas from spectro-textural information using machine learning
T2  - SOFT COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Extraction of built-up area (BUA) is essential for proper city planning and management. It enables the concerned authorities to formulate better city development policies and manage emergent disasters. However, the traditionally used optical data present spectral confusion where BUAs are mixed with other features adding to management complexities. Therefore, an advanced automated method is required to extract the spectral and textural features from satellite data for the pattern recognition of BUA. Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) has been used in the current study to identify the pattern and extract BUA of Gujranwala, Pakistan. First, eight textural features based on the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) are selected and combined with multispectral data. Then, feature selection methods are applied to select optimal features used to train the proposed support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Finally, the results from SVM classifiers are compared with k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) and backpropagation neural network (BP-NN) to highlight any improvements in results. The comparisons show that the proposed approach increases the overall accuracy of linear-SVM by 8.41%, radial basis function SVM by 8.3%, BP-NN by 7.63%, and k-NN by 6.6%. This can help city managers and planners to extract critical BUA information in otherwise unplanned and rapidly expanding cities to move toward smart and sustainable cities.

TI  - Aerosol optical depth retrieval over land from OCEANSAT-2/OCM-2 data - A simple physics based approach
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The decoupling of aerosol signals from the at-sensor reflectance measured through a space-borne sensor is a complex task due to the involved coupling mechanism of the interaction of light with the Earth's surface and the atmosphere. Specifically, the retrieval becomes more challenging over the land surface due to appreciable reflectance from the target. This paper presents a simplistic physics-based approach to retrieve Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) (at a spatial resolution of 0.01 degrees) over the land surface from the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) signals measured from an Indian space-borne sensor, Ocean Color Monitor-2 (onboard OCEANSAT-2 satellite). The estimated AOD from OCM-2 has been compared with that from Moderate Resolution Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard AQUA satellite (Collection 6.1 Deep Blue/Dark Target product). The comparison is illustrated for two different conditions prevalent over the Indian region, i.e., smoke-dominated (post-monsoonal) and dust-laden (pre-monsoonal) periods. A case study is also illustrated for the pre- and post-COVID-19 lockdown time period for two different zones of the Indian region. The validation (comparison) of OCM-2 AOD is performed with respect to the data from AERONET stations (MODIS), and we found a correlation coefficient (R-2) of 0.84 (0.83) with mot mean square error (RMSE) of 0.14 (0.20). Also, similar to 87% (70%) of the retrieved OCM-2 (MODIS) AOD values were observed within the expected error (EE) envelope. The sensitivity of the retrieval algorithm with respect to the input parameters is also presented.

TI  - Reconstructing the historical expansion of industrial swine production from Landsat imagery
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the USA, historical data on the period over which industrial swine farms have operated are usually only available at the county scale and released every 5 years via the USDA Census of Agriculture, leaving the history of the swine industry and its potential legacy effects on the environment poorly understood. We developed a changepoint-based workflow that recreates the construction timelines of swine farms, specifically by identifying the construction years of swine manure lagoons from historical Landsat 5 imagery for the period of 1984 to 2012. The study focused on the Coastal Plain of North Carolina, a major pork-producing state in the USA. The algorithm successfully predicted the year of swine waste lagoon construction (+ /- 1 year) with an accuracy of approximately 94% when applied to the study area. By estimating the year of construction of 3405 swine waste lagoons in NC, we increased the resolution of available information on the expansion of swine production from the county scale to spatially-explicit locations. We further analyzed how the locations of swine waste lagoons changed in proximity to water resources over time, and found a significant increase in swine waste lagoon distances to the nearest water feature across the period of record.

TI  - Evaluating ICESat-2 for monitoring, modeling, and update of large area forest canopy height products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests represent the world's largest terrestrial ecosystem and their monitoring is therefore critical from scientific, ecological, and management perspectives. Present day sustainable forest management practices go beyond forest inventory and increasingly include aspects such as carbon accounting and regeneration assessments. Such monitoring requires often unavailable, spatially exhaustive and up-to-date information on forest attributes over broad areas. Recent developments in the acquisition of broad-scale forest attribute information from remotely sensed data has included the use of multiple technologies that take advantage of globally available data products to derive forest attribute layers. However, less is known about the applicability and performance of such products when used to produce broad-scale, accurate, and up-to-date forest information products. This study aimed to evaluate the agreement between two broad-scale forest canopy height products - Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite 2 (ICESat-2) and the National Terrestrial Ecosystem Monitoring System (NTEMS) imputed canopy height layers for Canada - across a variety of ecological gradients. Overall, the two datasets showed high correspondence, with a root-mean-square difference of 4.87 m, and 85% of ICESat-2 canopy heights falling within the 95% confidence interval of the NTEMS height estimate. Across ecozones, canopy heights in the Taiga Shield West and Boreal Shield West had stronger agreement (91% of ICESat-2 segments within the 95% confidence interval of NTEMS), while the Taiga Cordillera and Taiga Shield East had lower agreement (< 75% of ICESat-2 segments within the 95% confidence interval of NTEMS). Interestingly, we found that the modeled heights based upon optical satellite data had a less generalized distribution than heights from ICESat-2 as well as achieving a greater representation for the taller (overall and by ecozone) height classes. An increase in absolute difference between data products was also found as a function of increasing slope. Finally, the correspondence between products was evaluated across disturbed areas (35 to 10 years since disturbance) to assess the agreement of the two products in areas of regenerating forest. In general, the analysis found that burned areas, which tend to be more structurally heterogeneous, had lower agreement between products then harvested areas. The high overall correspondence between the data products demonstrate the potential for integration of ICESat-2 to inform (via calibration / validation) or update height products based upon optical satellite data.

TI  - Feasibility of mapping radioactive minerals in high background radiation areas using remote sensing techniques
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the utility of using remote sensing and geographic information system techniques to accurately infer the presence of radioactive minerals in a typical high background radiation area (HBRA) by analyzing spectral signatures of associated soil, rocks and vegetation. To accomplish this, both unsupervised (K-Means Clustering) and supervised classification techniques based on a maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) were applied to Landsat-8 Imager data from Mrima Hill on Kenya's south coast. The hill is surrounded by dense tropical forest and deeply weathered soils which are rich in Nb, Th, and rare earth elements. Due to high activity concentrations of 232Th (>8 times higher than the world average value for soil), the hill has been designated as a geogenic HBRA. Based on the underlying geological formations, four classifications of vegetation and two classifications of soil/rocks were established and used to indicate the presence of radioactive minerals in the area. Measurements of air-absorbed gamma dose-rates in the area were successfully used to validate these findings. The application of the MLC method on Landsat satellite data shows that this method can be used as a powerful tool to explore and improve radioactive minerals mapping in HBRAs, the overall classification accuracy of Landsat8 OLI data using botanical technique is 80% and the Kappa Coefficient is 0.6. The overall classification accuracy using soil/rocks spectral signatures is 91% and the Kappa Coefficient is 0.7. Finally, the study demonstrated the general utility of remote sensing techniques in radioactive mineral surveys as well as envi-ronmental radiological assessments, particularly in resource-constrained settings.

TI  - Delayed Antarctic sea-ice decline in high-resolution climate change simulations
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Delayed Antarctic sea-ice decline is linked to Southern Ocean eddies - and their explicit treatment in models is crucial. New multi-resolution climate change projections give a possible reason for low confidence in IPCC's current 21st-century Antarctic sea-ice projections.Despite global warming and Arctic sea-ice loss, on average the Antarctic sea-ice extent has not declined since 1979 when satellite data became available. In contrast, climate model simulations tend to exhibit strong negative sea-ice trends for the same period. This Antarctic sea-ice paradox leads to low confidence in 21st-century sea-ice projections. Here we present multi-resolution climate change projections that account for Southern Ocean mesoscale eddies. The high-resolution configuration simulates stable September Antarctic sea-ice extent that is not projected to decline until the mid-21st century. We argue that one reason for this finding is a more realistic ocean circulation that increases the equatorward heat transport response to global warming. As a result, the ocean becomes more efficient at moderating the anthropogenic warming around Antarctica and hence at delaying sea-ice decline. Our study suggests that explicitly simulating Southern Ocean eddies is necessary for providing Antarctic sea-ice projections with higher confidence.

TI  - Convolutional Neural Network of Multiparametric MRI Accurately Detects Axillary Lymph Node Metastasis in Breast Cancer Patients With Pre Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy and axillary dissection have significant postoperative comorbidities. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and MRI have the potential to interrogate multiple nodes non-invasively. Artificial intelligence has become increasingly popular for analyzing diagnostic images. The model using combined T1- and T2-W MRI performed best compared to all other models and better than radiologists in detecting nodal metastasis.Background: Accurate assessment of the axillary lymph nodes (aLNs) in breast cancer patients is essential for prognosis and treatment planning. Current radiological staging of nodal metastasis has poor accuracy. This study aimed to investigate the machine learning convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on multiparametric MRI to detect nodal metastasis with 18FDG-PET as ground truths. Materials and Methods: Data were obtained via a retrospective search. Inclusion criteria were patients with bilateral breast MRI and 18FDG-PETand/or CT scans obtained before neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In total, 238 aLNs were obtained from 56 breast cancer patients with 18FDG-PET and/or CT and breast MRI data. Radiologists scored each node based on all MRI as diseased and non-diseased nodes. Five models were built using T1-W MRI, T2-W MRI, DCE MRI, T1-W + T2-W MRI, and DCE + T2-W MRI model. Performance was evaluated using receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis, including area under the curve (AUC). Results: All CNN models yielded similar performance with an accuracy ranging from 86.08% to 88.50% and AUC ranging from 0.804 to 0.882. The CNN model using T1-W MRI performed better than that using T2-W MRI in detecting nodal metastasis. CNN model using combined T1- and T2-W MRI performed the best compared to all other models (accuracy = 88.50%, AUC = 0.882), but similar in AUC to the DCE + T2-W MRI model (accuracy = 88.02%, AUC = 0.880). All CNN models performed better than radiologists in detecting nodal metastasis (accuracy = 65.8%). Conclusion: xxxxxx (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Anatomical distribution of sentinel lymph nodes in patients with endometrial cancer: a multicenter study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping represents the standard approach in uterine confined endometrial cancer patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anatomical distribution of SLNs and the most frequent locations of nodal metastasis. Methods This was an observational retrospective multicenter study involving eight high volume gynecologic cancer centers in Italy. We reviewed 1576 patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of endometrial cancer from September 2015 to June 2020. All patients underwent total hysterectomy with salpingo-ophorectomy and SLN mapping. Results A total of 3105 SLNs were mapped and removed, 2809 (90.5%) of these were bilateral and 296 (9.5%) unilateral. The overall detection rate was 93.4% (77.9% bilateral and 15.5% unilateral). The majority of SLNs (80%) and positive SLNs (77.8%) were found at the external iliac and obturator level in both endometrioid and non-endometrioid endometrial cancer. Negative SLNs were more frequent in patients with endometrioid compared with non-endometrioid cancer (91.9% vs 86.1%, p<0.0001). Older patients, a higher body mass index, and non-endometrioid histology were more likely to have 'no mapping' (p<0.0001). Univariate and multivariate analysis showed that higher body mass index and age at surgery were independent predictive factors of empty node packet and fat tissue (p=0.029 and p<0.01, respectively). Conclusion The most frequent sites of SLNs and metastases were located in the pelvic area below the iliac vessel bifurcation. Our findings showed that older age, a higher body mass index, and non-endometrioid histology had a negative impact on mapping.

TI  - Satellite observations for monitoring atmospheric NO<sub>2</sub> in correlation with the existing pollution sources under arid environment
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring of air pollutants using satellite data has been largely improved over the past few decades, which can provide deeper insights into the effects of anthropogenic activities on the air quality. The observations and measurements of atmospheric NO2 are poorly investigated in North Africa, therefore, the current study applied a multi-proxy approach to better understand of the ambient environment. This approach is based on satellite observations, chemical and biological analyses, and investigative information during fieldworks. The Aura satellite provides the basic data for the current study with fine resolution of atmospheric NO2 and O-3 concentrations. The obtained results reveal noticeable increases of atmospheric NO2 values since the 2011, where its emission reaches the peak during summer season that is characterized by high anthropogenic activities. The study area has many sources for NO2 emissions, such as the urban region, traffic, as well as the NH3 emission that is in turn converted to NO2. Although the discharged and spreading wastewater (80,000 m(3)/day in summer) has a limited role in NO2 emissions, it represents an indicator of the anthropogenic activities. The wastewater analyses confirm the occurrence of nitrate (NO3-), nitrite (NO2-), and ammonia (NH4+), which provide an appropriate condition for NO2 release. The analyses of multi-climate datasets (previous records and the expected scenarios) reveal an increase of temperature accompanied by decrease of precipitation which confirmed the existence of climate change. Therefore, the study presents a set of suggestions to mitigate the release of NOx gases and achieve Net-Zero emissions.

TI  - Regional Nodal Irradiation for Clinically Node-Positive Breast Cancer Patients With Pathologic Negative Nodes After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Management of patients with breast cancer, who are initially node positive but convert to pathologically node negative after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, especially after sentinel node biopsy only, is challenging due to concerns regarding residual axillary disease. The role of regional nodal irradiation (RNI) is controversial. This retrospective study of 1963 patients found no survival benefit with the addition of RNI in these patients. Introduction: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is increasingly used for operable breast cancer (BC). Appropriate radiation therapy (RT) fields (ie, whole breast [WB] +/- regional nodal irradiation [RNI]) in patients who were clinically node positive (cN1) but convert to pathologically node negative (ypN0) after NAC are unknown and the subject of the accruing NSABP B-51 trial. We sought to compare outcomes between WB RT with or without RNI following breast conservation and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) alone in cN1, ypN0 women following NAC. Patients and Methods: We identified all BC patients with cN1, ypN0 who underwent NAC followed by lumpectomy and SLNB between 2006 and 2015 in the National Cancer Database. RNI utilization was evaluated using Cochran-Armitage test. Overall survival between WB RT alone versus WB + RNI was compared using Kaplan-Meier with and without propensity score-based weighted adjustment and multivariable (MVA) Cox proportional hazards. Results: From 2006 to 2015, RNI use increased from 48.13% to 62.13% (Pfor trend < .001). The 10-year survival for WB alone versus WB + RNI was 83.6% and 79.5%, respectively (P=.14). On MVA analysis, the addition of RNI compared to WB alone was not associated with a survival benefit (WB vs. WB + RNI: hazard ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval, 0.58-1.11, P=.19). Results were unchanged after propensity score-based adjustment. Conclusion: For women with cN1 BC who convert to ypN0 following NAC and breast conserving surgery with SLNB alone, more extensive RNI may not provide a long-term survival benefit. Prospective validation via the NSABP B-51 trial will be essential.

TI  - Assessing the Potentials of Multi-temporal Sentinel-1 SAR Data for Paddy Yield Forecasting Using Artificial Neural Network
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate yield estimation of paddy crop plays an important role in forecasting paddy productivity for ensuring regional or national food security of the country. Although the crop growth models provide accurate yield forecasting, these models are difficult to implement in developing countries like India due to inhomogeneous or/and lack of required information about crop, soil, weather, etc. On the contrary, remotely sensed imagery available homogeneously provides valuable inputs for this purpose. Particularly, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data proved to have great potential for paddy growth monitoring and biophysical parameters retrieval over optical data. Moreover, the effective use of artificial neural network (ANN) may enable us to understand the complex relation between parameters as well as improve the forecasting performance than using empirical-/semiempirical-based approaches. Thus, the study aims to analyze multi-temporal dual-polarization C-band Sentinel-1 SAR data for paddy yield forecasting using ANN model. In this study, smart sampling based on the normalized difference vegetation (NDVI) and normalized difference water index has been considered to obtain in situ yield measurements in the study area. The peak stage signature of backscattering coefficients is considered to estimate yield due to the maximum possibility of signal to interact with crop cover characteristics. It is observed that the VH-polarization-based ANN model provides better accuracy with coefficient of determination (R-2) and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.72 and 600.11 kg/ha, respectively, in comparison with VV polarization which has shown 0.26 and 948.46 kg/ha, respectively. Overall, the study demonstrates that the effective use of ANN model may provide reliable yield estimation accuracy from remotely sensed imagery alone.

TI  - Modeling bulk surface resistance and evaluation of evapotranspiration using remote sensing and MATLAB
T2  - WATER SUPPLY
M3  - Article
AB  - In developing countries, computation of Actual Evapotranspiration (AET) is challenging due to the lack of ground-based flux measurement data. The estimation of AET is crucial for water resources management involving the allocation of water for different land cover (LULC) classes. The study's novelty was mapping pixel-by-pixel spatial variations of bulk surface resistance and evaluating the derived actual evapotranspiration in a sub-humid tropical river basin where flux tower data was lacking for validation. This study aimed to map bulk surface resistance and evaluate the estimated AET by global evapotranspiration data product (MOD16A2). MODIS data products, including Land Surface Reflectance (LSR), Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Leaf Area Index (LAI) data, were used as input in the MATLAB for mapping pixel-wise variations to analyze the seasonal variations in bulk surface resistance (r(s)) and actual evapotranspiration in pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons during the years 2019 and 2012. The years 2019 and 2012 were selected because 2019 experienced a relatively wet pre-monsoon and post-monsoon, whereas 2012 experienced the opposite conditions, which proved useful when interpreting variations that are influenced by wetness conditions. Overall the results indicated significant variability in the r(s) and AET for different LULC classes. MOD16A2 AET was determined to be slightly higher than the LULC classes estimated AET. This study's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data products provided information on surface characteristics at a reasonable resolution. This permitted the identification of differences in LULC classes and changes in surface characteristics by season and wetness conditions, which are helpful when estimating AET.

TI  - Using soil library hyperspectral reflectance and machine learning to predict soil organic carbon: Assessing potential of airborne and spaceborne optical soil sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a key variable to determine soil functioning, ecosystem services, and global carbon cycles. Spectroscopy, particularly optical hyperspectral reflectance coupled with machine learning, can provide rapid, efficient, and cost-effective quantification of SOC. However, how to exploit soil hyperspectral reflectance to predict SOC concentration, and the potential performance of airborne and satellite data for predicting surface SOC at large scales remain relatively underknown. This study utilized a continental-scale soil laboratory spectral library (37,540 full-pedon 350-2500 nm reflectance spectra with SOC concentration of 0-780 g.kg(-1) across the US) to thoroughly evaluate seven machine learning algorithms including Partial-Least Squares Regression (PLSR), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Ridge, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) along with four preprocessed spectra, i.e. original, vector normalization, continuum removal, and first-order derivative, to quantify SOC concentration. Furthermore, by using the coupled soil-vegetation-atmosphere radiative transfer model, we simulated twelve airborne and spaceborne hyper/multi-spectral remote sensing data from surface bare soil laboratory spectra to evaluate their potential for estimating SOC concentration of surface bare soils. Results show that LSTM achieved best predictive performance of quantifying SOC concentration for the whole data sets (R-2 = 0.96, RMSE = 30.81 g.kg(-1)), mineral soils (SOC <= 120 g.kg(-1), R-2 = 0.71, RMSE = 10.60 g.kg(-1)), and organic soils (SOC > 120 g.kg(-1), R-2 = 0.78, RMSE = 62.31 g.kg(-1)). Spectral data preprocessing, particularly the first-order derivative, improved the performance of PLSR, RF, Ridge, KNN, and ANN, but not LSTM or CNN. We found that the SOC models of mineral and organic soils should be distinguished given their distinct spectral signatures. Finally, we identified that the shortwave infrared is vital for airborne and spaceborne hyperspectral sensors to monitor surface SOC. This study highlights the high accuracy of LSTM with hyperspectral/multispectral data to mitigate a certain level of noise (soil moisture <0.4 m(3).m(-3), green leaf area < 0.3 m(2).m(-2), plant residue <0.4 m(2).m(-2)) for quantifying surface SOC concentration. Forthcoming satellite hyperspectral missions like Surface Biology and Geology (SBG) have a high potential for future global soil carbon monitoring, while high-resolution satellite multispectral fusion data can be an alternative.

TI  - Notes on misconceptions in the application of geographical names of the tepuis on the borderlands of Guyana and Venezuela and a clarification of the location of Waukauyengtipu and Cerro Venamo
T2  - MISCELLANEA GEOGRAPHICA
M3  - Article
AB  - A review of recent publications concerning the South American Pantepui biogeographic region revealed recurring mistakes in the naming of several table mountains (known locally as 'tepui', 'tipu' or 'tepuy') located around the Guyana-Venezuela border, close to the transection of the so-called Schomburgk Line and the course of Rio Venamo. The mistakes are believed to have arisen and have been repeated as a result of a noticeable scarcity of detailed maps of the region, its short history of exploration and ongoing inaccessibility.An extensive analysis of modem satellite data and records of past research expeditions, supplemented by first-hand observations and assessment made during an expedition to Waukauyengtipu in the Cuyuni-Mazaruni Region in Guyana in January 2019, are used to clarify the nomenclatural confusion regarding the tepuis of the area. We determine that the tepuis known as Cerro Venamo and Waukauyengtipu should be treated as separate and distinct geographic formations.

TI  - The impacts of landscape patterns spatio-temporal changes on land surface temperature from a multi-scale perspective: A case study of the Yangtze River Delta
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Unordered and speedy urbanization is the foremost cause of land surface temperature (LST) rise in an urban area. Understanding the effects of landscape changes on LST is crucial for the urban sustainable development. In this study, we retrieved the LSTs of 26 cities in the Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration with the Landsat images during the summer time (from June to August) of 2000 and 2019. From a multi-scale perspective, i.e. grids of 10 km and 20 km, county and city level, the partial correlation analysis, geographically weighted correlation analysis and local bivariate Moran's I were conducted to explore the influence of the landscape pattern changes of the built-ups on LST change. Our results have shown that, the scale change impacts the relationships between the landscape metric changes of built-ups and the LST change. As the scale upscales, the correlation between different landscape metric changes of built-ups and the LST change continues to increase. Among them, the area-related metrics (percentage and largest patch index) have the most significant impact on LST change, showing a positive correlation. Moreover, there are obvious spatial autocorrelation and spatial spillover effects between the landscape metric changes of built-ups and the LST change. These findings are helpful for understanding regional ecology as well as land use/land cover planning to minimize the negative environmental impacts of urbanization.

TI  - Burned Area Detection Using Multi-Sensor SAR, Optical, and Thermal Data in Mediterranean Pine Forest
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Burned area (BA) mapping of a forest after a fire is required for its management and the determination of the impacts on ecosystems. Different remote sensing sensors and their combinations have been used due to their individual limitations for accurate BA mapping. This study analyzes the contribution of different features derived from optical, thermal, and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images to extract BA information from the Turkish red pine (Pinus brutia Ten.) forest in a Mediterranean ecosystem. In addition to reflectance values of the optical images, Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) and Land Surface Temperature (LST) data are produced from both Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 data. The backscatter of C-band Sentinel-1 and L-band ALOS-2 SAR images and the coherence feature derived from the Interferometric SAR technique were also used. The pixel-based random forest image classification method is applied to classify the BA detection in 24 scenarios created using these features. The results show that the L-band data provided a better contribution than C-band data and the combination of features created from Landsat LST, NBR, and coherence of L-band ALOS-2 achieved the highest accuracy, with an overall accuracy of 96% and a Kappa coefficient of 92.62%.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this letter, we propose a new methodology for Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) land cover mapping, named Two Branches Convolutional Neural Network (TwoBCNN). The main objective of the proposed methodology is to combine pixel- and object-level multi-variate time-series information in the classification process. Experiments were carried out on a study site located in the south-west of France, namely, Dordogne leveraging Sentinel-2 SITS data. Results are compared to those obtained by several standard used approaches to deal with SITS-based land cover mapping. Results demonstrate that TwoBCNN, based on a combination of pixel- and object-based information, achieved the highest classification performance with respect to the competing approaches.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the accuracy and false negative rate of axillary ultrasound compared to sentinel node biopsy.METHODS: The retrospective study was conducted at the Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, from February 1 to March 31, 2021, and comprised data of breast cancer patients who had undergone neo-adjuvant chemotherapy followed by axillary lymph node dissection or axillary disease diagnosed using lymph node biopsy or sentinel lymph node biopsy between January 1, 2016, and December 30, 2020. After receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy, axillary ultrasound findings were compared with histopathology of lymph nodes. Data was analysed using SPSS 22.RESULTS: Of the 155 patients evaluated, 104(67.1%) were diagnosed with negative axillary lymph nodes and 51(32.9%) were diagnosed with positive axillary lymph nodes post-chemotherapy. The overall mean age was 51.13±1.3 years. When histopathology results were compared with those of axillary ultrasound, 36(23.2%) cases turned out to be true positive, while 23(14,8%) were false negative, yielding a positive predictive value of 75% and negative predictive value of 65%. Axillary ultrasound had 75% accuracy, false negative rate 30%, sensitivity 61% and specificity 84.4%.CONCLUSIONS: Axillary ultrasound was found to be fairly useful, but not completely reliable, in identifying positive lymph nodes.

TI  - Stacking-Based Ensemble Learning Method for Multi-Spectral Image Classification
T2  - TECHNOLOGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Higher dimensionality, Hughes phenomenon, spatial resolution of image data, and presence of mixed pixels are the main challenges in a multi-spectral image classification process. Most of the classical machine learning algorithms suffer from scoring optimal classification performance over multi-spectral image data. In this study, we propose stack-based ensemble-based learning approach to optimize image classification performance. In addition, we integrate the proposed ensemble learning with XGBoost method to further improve its classification accuracy. To conduct the experiment, the Landsat image data has been acquired from Bishoftu town located in the Oromia region of Ethiopia. The current study's main objective was to assess the performance of land cover and land use analysis using multi-spectral image data. Results from our experiment indicate that, the proposed ensemble learning method outperforms any strong base classifiers with 99.96% classification performance accuracy.

TI  - Comparison of Random Forest and Support Vector Machine Classifiers for Regional Land Cover Mapping Using Coarse Resolution FY-3C Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The type of algorithm employed to classify remote sensing imageries plays a great role in affecting the accuracy. In recent decades, machine learning (ML) has received great attention due to its robustness in remote sensing image classification. In this regard, random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) are two of the most widely used ML algorithms to generate land cover (LC) maps from satellite imageries. Although several comparisons have been conducted between these two algorithms, the findings are contradicting. Moreover, the comparisons were made on local-scale LC map generation either from high or medium resolution images using various software, but not Python. In this paper, we compared the performance of these two algorithms for large area LC mapping of parts of Africa using coarse resolution imageries in the Python platform by the employing Scikit-Learn (sklearn) library. We employed a big dataset, 297 metrics, comprised of systematically selected 9-month composite FegnYun-3C (FY-3C) satellite images with 1 km resolution. Several experiments were performed using a range of values to determine the best values for the two most important parameters of each classifier, the number of trees and the number of variables, for RF, and penalty value and gamma for SVM, and to obtain the best model of each algorithm. Our results showed that RF outperformed SVM yielding 0.86 (OA) and 0.83 (k), which are 1-2% and 3% higher than the best SVM model, respectively. In addition, RF performed better in mixed class classification; however, it performed almost the same when classifying relatively pure classes with distinct spectral variation, i.e., consisting of less mixed pixels. Furthermore, RF is more efficient in handling large input datasets where the SVM fails. Hence, RF is a more robust ML algorithm especially for heterogeneous large area mapping using coarse resolution images. Finally, default parameter values in the sklearn library work well for satellite image classification with minor/or no adjustment for these algorithms.

AB  - The study focused on determining the Diurnal temperature range trend as an index of climate change in Lafia, Nasarawa State, Nigeria. The study relied on remote sensing data-the ERA5 ??? Temperature, which is the fifth generation reanalysis from ECMWF. The data for the period of forty (40) years was extracted and used to analyze the annual range, diurnal temperature, trend analysis and daily maximum and minimum temperatures. The results shows a decrease in the trend analysis for the decadal and pentad which means that the difference between the daily maximum temperature and daily minimum temperature is no longer wide. However, the trend analysis carried out for the annual DTR shows a positive trend which shows that the Maximum daily temperature is higher than the daily minimum range in the study area. The study recommended for more intense study of DTR in order to stop over generalizing the index of climate change over a macro area..

TI  - Prognostic factors of <i>Candida</i> spp. bloodstream infection in adults: A nine-year retrospective cohort study across tertiary hospitals in Brazil and Spain
T2  - LANCET REGIONAL HEALTH-AMERICAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Mortality rates among adults with candidemia vary widely in different geographical settings. Studies directly comparing epidemiology and clinical practices between countries are scarce and could bring insights into improving clinical outcomes.Methods Retrospective cohort including adults with candidemia diagnosed in five tertiary hospitals from Brazil and Spain between 2010-2018. Adequate therapeutic management included appropriate antifungal therapy and central-venous-catheter (CVC) removal within 48 h of fungemia. Primary endpoints were mortality rates at 14 and 30 days. Secondary endpoints were prognostic factors associated with 30-day mortality.Findings Overall, 720 patients were included, being 323 from Spain. Spanish patients received echinocandins more often (52 center dot 5% vs. 39 center dot 3%, p = 0.001), initiated antifungals earlier [2 (0-7) vs. 2 days (0-16), p<0.001], and had faster CVC-removal [1 (0-42) vs. 2 days (0-38), p = 0.012]. Mortality was higher among Brazilians at 14 days (35 center dot 8% vs. 20 center dot 1%, p< 0.001), and at 30 days (51 center dot 9% vs. 31 center dot 6%, p < 0.001). Factors associated with mortality included: age [OR 1 center dot 02, 95%CI (1 center dot 008-1 center dot 032), p = 0 center dot 001], neutropenia [OR 3 center dot 24, 95%CI (1 center dot 594-6 center dot 585), p = 0 center dot 001], chronic pulmonary disease [OR 2 center dot 26, 95%CI (1 center dot 495-3 center dot 436), p < 0 center dot 001], corticosteroids [OR 1 center dot 45, 95%CI (1 center dot 018-2 center dot 079), p = 0 center dot 039], PittScore>1 [OR 2 center dot 56, 95%CI (1 center dot 776-3 center dot 690), p < 0 center dot 001], and inadequate therapeutic management [OR 2 center dot 84, 95%CI (1 center dot 685-4 center dot 800), p < 0 center dot 001]. Being from Spain [OR 0 center dot 51, 95%CI (0 center dot 359-0 center dot 726), p < 0 center dot 001] and C. parapsilosis [OR 0 center dot 36, 95%CI (0 center dot 233-0 center dot 568), p < 0 center dot 001] were protective.Interpretation Higher mortality rates were observed in Brazil. Factors associated with 30-day mortality included mainly epidemiological characteristics and inadequate therapeutic management. Thus, effective and prompt antifungals combined with CVC-removal still need to be emphasized in order to improve the prognosis of adults with candidemia.Copyright (c) 2021 The Author(s).

M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, Kabul city's rapid urbanization has adversely affected the urban land cover, such as surface water bodies and croplands. Surface water resources are threatened due to overpopulation in the city either qualitatively or quantitatively, also croplands are being lost with the development of urbanization activities through the city. To monitor and assess surface changes accurately, we classified the city area using satellite images of both Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 and compared both of their findings. The Support Vector Machine classifier was applied to multi-senor data to classify four different land categories using the same training sites and samples with the same period. All the procedures were conducted in Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform. The surface reflectance bands of both satellites were used for classification. Confusion matrixes were created using the same reference points for Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 classification to compare the results and determine the best approach for classification of land cover. Results show that overall accuracy was 94.26% for Sentinel-2 while it was 85.04% for Landsat-8, similarly, the Kappa coefficient was calculated 91.7% and 78.3% for Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8, respectively.

TI  - Primary productivity estimation of forest based on in-situ biophysical parameters and sentinel satellite data using vegetation photosynthesis model in an eastern Indian tropical dry deciduous forest
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study deals with the estimation of satellite-based gross and net primary productivity (GPP and NPP) in combination with in-situ observations in Dalma Wildlife Sanctuary, Eastern India using light use efficiency (LUE) models namely vegetation photosynthesis model (VPM) and vegetation photosynthesis and respiration model (VPRM). Several parameters like photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR), environmental scalars, etc. were estimated using the Sentinel 2 and Sentinel 3 satellite datasets to estimate primary productivity of the wildlife sanctuary. The study showed that the higher GPP in the month of June was found, primarily in the core zone of the sanctuary (29.1 to 15.3 g C m(-2) d(-1)), which is dominated by species viz., Terminalia tomentosa, Syzygium cumini, Schleichera oleosa, Holarrhena pubescens, Mallotus philippensis, Terminalia bellirica, Cleistanthus collinus, and Holarrhena floribunda. While the lower GPP was observed in the month of February, in the parts of the core zone of the sanctuary (7.6 to 4.4 g C m(-2) d(-1)). A higher GPP (20.3 g C m(-2) d(-1)) was recorded in the pure patches of Shorea robusta during the month of June. Spatially, the core zone of the sanctuary was highly productive, due to dense forest cover and insignificant anthropogenic influence. The outer margins, especially the western parts of the Dalma wildlife sanctuary, experienced significant degradation because of fuelwood collection, which led to reduced primary productivity. The study demonstrated that productivity had a strong positive correlation with FAPAR (R-2 = 0.91), and with field-measured leaf area index (LAI) (R-2 = 0.79), while it has moderate positive correlation with (Enhanced vegetation index) EVI (R-2 = 0.40), and PAR (R-2 = 0.44) in the Tropical Dry Deciduous Forest of Eastern India. LICOR sensor-based field measured LUE showed high variation from one species to another in the field, suggesting critical assessment of dominant species. High spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 data allowed depiction of the GPP variance effectively in heterogeneous areas along with vital attributes of various environmental variables at finer scales (spatial and temporal) that support temporal assessment of carbon dynamics in the study area for effective forest conservation and management.

AB  - Population growth and human activities have resulted in drastic changes in land use in many areas of the world, including the Hyrcania region in northern Iran. Land-use changes affect the hydrological processes of water basins. This study evaluated the effect of land-use changes on runoff over 15 years in the Haraz River basin located in Hyrcania using remote sensing data and GIS analyses. The annual precipitation of the region is 66.5 cm. Two Landsat images were used to develop land-use maps for 1996 and 2011. Original image features, their principal components, and vegetation indices were used to classify the two Landsat images into different land-use categories. Runoff was predicted from precipitation, land use, and hydrological soil groups, using the SCS-CN model (the "curve number" approach). During the 15 years, 62.4% of the area remained unchanged and 37.6% had undergone a land-use change. The highest average runoffs were obtained for bare land (14.1-14.5 cm/year) and residential land (10.4-11.4 cm/year), and the lowest for dense forest (2.5-2.6 cm/year) and first-grade rangeland (2.8-3.1 cm/year). The volume of annual runoff increased by 9% during 1996-2011 due to land-use changes. Runoff was estimated at 9.4% of precipitation in 1996, and 9.6% of precipitation in 2011. Most of the increase was related to the increased area of bare land and decreased area of rangeland. The study indicated that combined use of the SCS-CN approach, remote sensing data, and GIS tools allow cost-effective runoff estimation, helping watershed management. The results on the effect of land-use change on runoff can be seen as a warning for land-use managers and policymakers, who should aim at stopping and reversing the current land-use trends of the Haraz River basin.

TI  - Multiple-payload fractionated spacecraft for earth observation
T2  - ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a new mission concept and details its system design for Earth observation, utilizing fractionated payloads onboard CubeSats to meet the Sentinel-2 mission specifications at lower costs with enhanced scalability and robustness characteristics. The fractionated spacecraft system consists of twelve CubeSats, each in an eight-unit form factor, which is responsible for taking raw images and sending them to a mothership, while the mothership constructs wide-range images and transmits them to Earth. The pre-Phase-A design of the CubeSats is detailed using available off-the-shelf components with flight heritage. The performance and failure analyses of the proposed fractionated system compared to its Sentinel-2 counterpart, using Monte-Carlo simulations, indicate that the scalability and robustness of the mission can be enhanced while achieving similar specifications. Moreover, the mass and cost analyses show that they can also be reduced notably by fractionating the payload compared to the equivalent Sentinel-2 mission.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Inefficient management of protected areas (PAs) is often due to ignoring their surrounding matrix in the baseline studies, especially in wooded landscapes. In Iran, the application of landscape structure studies in protection policies and PA management is not prevalent. In this study, land cover changes in Dena Rural District (including parts of inside and outside Dena PA) have analyzed using the process of the Landsat images along with field survey two times (1989 and 2018). The landscape structural integrity was quantified based on the situation of oak forest land and its alteration. The composition and the configuration of oak forest land were assessed by metrics based on the moving extent of the Persian squirrel, Sciurus anomalus (which is an endangered focal endemic species completely dependent on the oak forest). Alterations of landscape structural integrity were compared for inside and outside Dena PA and at different altitudes. The results show connectivity loss and increased fragmentation of oak remnant patches, but this deforestation is more severe near areas facing direct human impacts and interventions. These are among attributes that are to be considered for zoning PA (such as controlling zone and training/participation zone). At higher altitudes, physical protection and strict control are more effective, while training local communities for stewardship is more essential at lower altitudes for conserving woodland integrity.

AB  - The Corona pandemic limits human activities at a time when the world is facing challenges in food safety. Wheat is foremost cereal crop grown healthy in Egypt, especially in El Sharkia Governorate. The target of this work is to monitor wheat cultivation in El Sharkia Governorate during COVID-19 pandemic. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) estimates were made by band 4 and band 5 of Landsat-8 images of 2018, 2019 and 2020. At the start of May 2020 a field visit was made to 50 sites cultivated with wheat to find out their yield and collecting soil samples. The Yield with NDVI was shown to have a strong relationship (R-2 = 0.84). The NDVI maps of 2018, 2019 and 2020 were produced using ENVI 5.3 software. The changes in wheat cultivation during 2018-2020 were analyzed and discussed in detail. Decrement in wheat yield was noticed in 2020 due to the lack of production requirements owing to the pandemic.

T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The late Neoproterozoic granitoids of Gebel Um Shager and Gebel Hamadat, Central Eastern Desert of Egypt, in addition to Paleozoic trachytes of both areas were discriminated using Landsat-8, and Sentinel-2 dataset. Band rationing and Principal Component Analysis techniques were applied. The studied granitoids represent the extreme end-members of the subduction-related I-type calc-alkaline granitic magmas (primitive to more evolved varieties) that developed over a long period of time. These granites were extruded by Paleozoic intra-plate trachytes. Petrography and petrogenesis of these rocks were dealt with and discussed. The Um Shager Older Granitoids (calcic tonalite to quartz monzodiorite) represent poorly differentiated metaluminous magma characterized by very low Rb/Sr ratio -0.07. Evolutionary, they follow the calc-alkaline subtype trend and most probably were originated from parent gabbroic magma by fractional crystallization in a volcanic arc setting. On contrary, the Hamadat Younger Granites represent alkali calcic magma which was developed in post-collision setting. They comprise evolved subsolvus metaluminous syenogranite and alkali feldspar granite. Evolutionary, they follow the subalkaline subtype trend. Crystallization courses of both syenogranite and alkali feldspar granite were started by alkali feldspar, followed by cotectic crystallization of alkali feldspar and quartz and ended by eutectic crystallization of all quartzofeldspathic minerals. The trachytes represent intra-plate continental alkaline magmatism. The Um Shager trachytes were developed at local extension zones, while the Hamadat trachytes were originated during global continental rifting system. Syenogranite, alkali feldspar granite and trachytes are important sources of alkali feldspar, which has wide spectrum applications in industry and agriculture.(c) 2022 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science.

TI  - A remote sensing data fusion method for continuous daily evapotranspiration mapping at kilometric scale in Sahelian areas
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing-based ET estimates are very appealing for a wide range of scientific applications in hydrology. However, they are prone to infrequency due to satellite revisit interval and cloud cover. Temporal interpolation techniques or multi-resolution and multi-frequency data fusion approach have thus recently been studied to provide continuous ET estimates. It has been already shown that the interest of temporal interpolation techniques is limited to short return interval that is troublesome in Sahelian regions where mesoscale convective systems linked to the West African Monsoon (WAM) renders unusable most of TIR images during the rainy season. Here we developed a data fusion approach to provide remote sensing-based continuous daily ET estimates at kilometric resolution in Sahelian areas. The proposed algorithm fill gaps in MODIS-based ET estimates from EVASPA S-SEBI Sahel (E3S) using the Global Land Evaporation: the Amsterdam Methodology (GLEAM) product and/or ET estimates from a simple parametric model for typical Sahelian ecosystems as a normalized basis. The fusion algorithm is evaluated at the pixel scale against eddy-covariance measurements and simulations of a locally calibrated and validated land surface model (LSM) on a millet crop and a fallow of shrubby savannah in the southwest of the Republic of Niger. Consistency of the fusion approach is also evaluated at mesoscale by comparing it with a set of 20 regional LSMs. Globally both level of comparison highlight the very good agreement of ET estimates based on the fusion approach with both in situ measurements and LSMs simulations. We also show the benefit of such a fusion approach compared to linear temporal interpolation techniques of the ratio between ET and either incoming solar radiation or reference evapotranspiration. The main benefits are observed during the first months of the rainy season in the depiction of the surface response to rainfall events and consecutive drying up of the surface soil layer. We suggest that such a fusion approach could be later used in disaggregation chain to enhance field scaled ET estimates by the combination of coarse, moderate and high resolution remote sensing-based ET estimates.

TI  - Assessment of Drought Indexes on Different Time Scales: A Case in Semiarid Mediterranean Grasslands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a significant challenge to semiarid Mediterranean grasslands, Increasing the accuracy of monitoring allows improving the conservation and management of these vital ecosystems. Meteorological drought is commonly monitored by the Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) or the Standard Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). On the other hand, agriculture drought is estimated by the Vegetation Health Index (VHI). This work aims to optimise the correlation between both drought types using the best transformation of VHI and the most appropriate time scale. Two drought-vulnerable Mediterranean grasslands were selected to evaluate the performance of the drought indexes. The SPI and the SPEI were calculated using data obtained from nearby weather stations. MODIS data were used to calculate the VHI. This index was standardised, naming it as SVHI. Our results revealed that SPEI was better correlated with VHI compared to SPI. In addition, SVHI obtained better results in the critical vegetation phases than VHI. Overall, SPEI and SVHI were the best correlated indexes. The quarterly scale showed stronger relationships than the monthly scale and the most correlated time frame were Mediterranean spring and autumn. This fact suggests that SPEI and SVHI could provide a plus point for increasing the precision of vegetation monitoring during these periods.

TI  - Evaluating Machine Learning and Remote Sensing in Monitoring NO<sub>2</sub> Emission of Power Plants
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Effective and precise monitoring is a prerequisite to control human emissions and slow disruptive climate change. To obtain the near-real-time status of power plant emissions, we built machine learning models and trained them on satellite observations (Sentinel 5), ground observed data (EPA eGRID), and meteorological observations (MERRA) to directly predict the NO2 emission rate of coal-fired power plants. A novel approach to preprocessing multiple data sources, coupled with multiple neural network models (RNN, LSTM), provided an automated way of predicting the number of emissions (NO2, SO2, CO, and others) produced by a single power plant. There are many challenges on overfitting and generalization to achieve a consistently accurate model simply depending on remote sensing data. This paper addresses the challenges using a combination of techniques, such as data washing, column shifting, feature sensitivity filtering, etc. It presents a groundbreaking case study on remotely monitoring global power plants from space in a cost-wise and timely manner to assist in tackling the worsening global climate.

TI  - Automatic Identification of Forest Disturbance Drivers Based on Their Geometric Pattern in Atlantic Forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring forest disturbances has become essential towards the design and tracking of sustainable forest management. Multiple methodologies have been developed to detect these disturbances. However, few studies have focused on the automatic detection of disturbance drivers, an essential task as each disturbance has different implications for the functioning of the ecosystem and associated management actions. Wildfires and harvesting are two of the major drivers of forest disturbances across different ecosystems. In this study, an automated methodology is presented to automatically distinguish between the two once the disturbance is detected, using the properties of its geometry and shape. A cluster analysis was performed to automatically individualize each disturbance and afterwards calculate its geometric properties. Using these properties, a decision tree was built that allowed for the distinction between wildfires and harvesting with an overall accuracy of 91%. This methodology and further research relating to it could pose an essential aid to national and international agencies for incorporating forest-disturbance-driver-related information into forest-focused reports.

TI  - Quantitative-spatial relationships between air and surface temperature, a proxy for microclimate studies in fine-scale intra-urban areas?
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent studies on fine-scale spatial variations of urban air temperature revealed that urban environments are urban heat "archipelagos", rather than "islands," and there are locations with higher temperatures which suffer more intensive urban heat, and people in these areas are likely to experience greater heat stress and health risks. However, study of this phenomenon is limited because of insufficient air temperature data at the fine scale. This study attempted to quantify the heterogeneity of air and land surface temperature (LST), and their relationship in a fine-scale urban environment using field-measured air temperature and Landsat 8-based LST data. We found: (1) there was a strong thermal heterogeneity at the fine scale even between the measurement points on the edges of a large urban park. The maximum temperature difference reached 4.2 degrees C for air temperature and 8 degrees C for LST in the study area. (2) Air and surface temperatures were positively correlated. However, their cool and hot spots did not always overlap in space. (3) air temperature is more complex than LST, and more parameters in the urban environment can influence air temperature. (4) Urban landscape and climatological parameters can enhance the applicability of LST as a proxy for air temperature from 39% to 57%. The results have theoretical and practical implications for identifying the locations on a fine scale with extreme heat and attracting the attention of urban planners to take adoption measures.

T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of Agro-Ecological Zones (AEZs) is a vital step in sustainable agricultural development. This study proposes a quantitative method for developing the AEZs and land suitability for Wadi El-Grawla, North-Western Coastal Region (NWCR), Egypt. Hundreds of surface soil samples and twenty soil profiles covering the variations in the study area were collected; then, the inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation technique was utilized to produce representative maps for different soil characteristics. Moreover, a digital elevation model (DEM) was generated from topographic maps to calculate various land surface factors such as slope, curvature, and relief density. In addition to benefiting from Sentinel-2 imagery in the separation process of different landform units with a classification accuracy of about 87%. Two soil orders were identified in the study area, namely, Aridisols and Entisols. Chemical analysis of soil samples revealed that soil pH range from 7.14 to 8.6. Total soluble salt changes widely from one location to another. Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) has a wide range of 3.5-31.5%. Organic matter (OM) ranges between 0.04 and 1.55%. A weighted overlay of obtained thematic maps resulted in three management zones in the Wadi El-Grawla area. Zone-1 represents the best location, with an area of about 2359.3 ha. At the same time, the regions of the area of zone-2 and zone-3 are 2526.4 ha and 1346.8 ha, respectively. Finally, suitability maps were produced for the most strategic crops cultivated in Wadi El-Grawla. The most suitable classes were S2 and S3 for all studied crops. The obtained results will support the decision-makers to put various development plans according to the conditions of the study area.(c) 2022 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science.

TI  - Spatial Dispersion and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization of SAR Backscattering as Tools for Monitoring Snow Depth Evolution in Mountain Areas: A Case Study at Central Pyrenees (Spain)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate knowledge of snow cover extent, depth (SD), and water equivalent is essential for studying the global water cycle, climate, and energy-mass exchange in the Earth-atmosphere system, as well as for water resources management. Ratio between SAR cross- and co-polarization backscattering (sigma(VH)/sigma(VV)) was used to monitor SD during snowy months in mountain areas; however, published results refer to short periods and show lack of correlation during non-snowy months. We analyze Sentinel-1A images from a study area in Central Pyrenees to generate and investigate (i) time series of sigma(VH)/sigma(VV) spatial dispersion, (ii) spatial distribution of pixelwise sigma(VH)/sigma(VV) temporal standard deviation, and (iii) fundamental modes of sigma(VH)/sigma(VV )evolution by non-negative matrix factorization. The spatial dispersion evolution and the first mode are highly correlated (correlation coefficients larger than 0.9) to SD evolution during the whole seven-year-long period, including snowy and non-snowy months. The local incidence angle strongly affects how accurately sigma(VH)/sigma(VV) locally follows the first mode; thus, areas where it predominates are orbit-dependent. When combining ascending- and descending-orbit images in a single data matrix, the first mode becomes predominant almost everywhere snow pack persists during winter. Capability of our approach to reproduce SD evolution makes it a very effective tool.

TI  - Transcendental idealism as formal idealism
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Transcendental idealism is the basic worldview shaping Kant's critical philosophy, but its proper interpretation is enormously contested. I identify five constraints on an adequate interpretation, which collectively stand in apparent tension. These serve to highlight internal difficulties of the view itself, and also to reveal serious challenges for both the more standard phenomenalist and deflationary interpretations, and newer "moderate metaphysical" approaches. Difficulty centers on how to reconcile Kant's widespread claims that things in themselves are identical to appearances, in some sense, with his equally widespread insistence that they are (and must be) non-identical. I suggest that Kant's view must have been that the objects of knowledge are (strictly) partially mind-dependent, and that the Kantian hylomorphic idea of formal idealism can explain this partial mind-dependence. The result points toward an anti-metaphysical interpretation of Kantian idealism, according to which the metaphysical question of identity between things in themselves and appearances should be rejected as illegitimate, rather than answered.

US examination demonstrated a low echoic area with irregular margin and many high echoic spots within the left breast. We diagnosed mastitis. Therefore, we administered an antibiotic. One week later, her pain was improved. However, the low echoic area did not improve. Thus, we performed an aspiration cytology. Pus was aspirated. Cytology revealed a carcinoma. Enhanced CT demonstrated an irregular mass with ring enhancement in the left breast. A mastectomy with sentinel lymph- node biopsy and reconstruction with the latissimus dorsi muscle flap was performed. Post-operative course was uneventful. The pathological finding was of spindle cell carcinoma. After operation, she underwent chemotherapy(AC). Ten years later, she is alive with no recurrence.

AB  - The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) framework aims to end poverty, improve health and education, reduce inequality, design sustainable cities, support economic growth, tackle climate change and leave no one behind. To monitor and report the progress on the 231 unique SDGs indicators in all signatory countries, data play a key role. Here, we reviewed the data challenges and costs associated with obtaining traditional data and satellite data (particularly for developing countries), emphasizing the benefits of using satellite data, alongside their portal and platforms in data access. We then assessed, under the maturity matrix framework (MMF 2.0), the current potential of satellite data applications on the SDG indicators that were classified into the sustainability pillars. Despite the SDG framework having more focus on socio-economic aspects of sustainability, there has been a rapidly growing literature in the last few years giving practical examples in using earth observation (EO) to monitor both environmental and socio-economic SDG indicators; there is a potential to populate 108 indicators by using EO data. EO also has a wider potential to support the SDGs beyond the existing indicators.

TI  - Time Series Analysis of Landsat Data for Investigating the Relationship between Land Surface Temperature and Forest Changes in Paphos Forest, Cyprus
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to investigate how alternations of the land surface temperature (LST) affects the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in Paphos forest, Cyprus, using Landsat-5 and Landsat-8 imagery for the time periods 1993-2000 and 2013-2018, respectively. A total of 262 Landsat images were processed to compute the mean monthly NDVI and LST values and create a time series. Using the Cook's distance, the effect of missing values in the analysis of the time series were examined. Results from the cross-correlation and cross-variograms, decomposition model, and the BFAST algorithm were compared to produce reliable conclusions on forest changes and satellite, meteorological, and environmental data were combined to interpret the changes that occurred inside the forest. The decomposition analysis showed a decrease of 2.7% in the LST for the period 1993-2000 and an increase of 4.6% in the LST during the period 2013-2018. The NDVI trend is negatively correlated to the LST trend for both time periods. An increase in the LST trend was identified in November 1998 as well as in the NDVI trend in October 1994 and May 2014 that was caused by favorable climatic conditions. An increase in the NDVI trend from May 2014 to December 2015 may be related to reduced pityocampa attacks. An abrupt decrease was detected in December 2015 that was probably caused by the locust invasion that occurred in the island earlier that year. A positive correlation appears for LST and NDVI variables for time lags 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 months. Overall, it was shown that LST and NDVI analysis is very promising for identifying potential forest decline.

TI  - Copernicus User Uptake: From Data to Applications
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The European Programme Copernicus, one of the principal sources of free and open Earth Observation (EO) data, intends to sustain social and economic advancements to the European Union. To this end, User Uptake initiatives have been undertaken to increase Copernicus awareness, dissemination, and competencies, thus supporting the development of downstream applications. As part of the activities performed in the EO-UPTAKE project, we illustrate a set of application scenario workflows exemplifying usage practices of the data and tools available in the Copernicus ecosystem. Through the know-how gained in the design and development of the application scenarios and the bibliographic analysis on downstream applications, we discuss a series of practical recommendations to promote the use of Copernicus resources towards a wider audience of end-users boosting the development of new EO applications along with some advice to data providers to improve their publication practices.

TI  - Characterizing terranes and a Neoproterozoic suture zone in Central Hoggar (Tuareg Shield, Algeria) with airborne geophysics and Landsat 8 OLI data
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Integration of multisource data into a geographic information system has been a powerful tool to characterize contrasting terranes and their boundaries, such as suture zones with oceanic rocks juxtaposed to continental blocks. We present an integration study of geological, Landsat 8 OLI, and airborne geophysical data for the Wadi Takalous region (Central Hoggar, Algeria), covering the SAA (Serouenout, Aghefsa, Aguendis) domain, rich in juvenile oceanic rocks, flanked by two continental domains, LATEA (Laouni, Aouilene, Tefedest, Egere-Aleksod and Azrou N'Fad) to the West, and TAI (Tazat and Assode-Issalane) to the East. The Serouenout terrane, comprising tectonic slices of metamafic-ultramafic rocks (including eclogites) enveloped by metapelites and covered by Eopaleozoic sandstones, stands out for its low magnetic intensities and low radiometric responses. To the East, granitic rocks with abnormally high radiometric responses and high magnetic intensities highlight the TAI domain, a basement block rich in Pan-African collisional and post-collisional intrusions. To the West of Serouenout terrane, a heterogeneous magnetic and radiometric pattern characterizes the eastern LATEA that has been interpreted as a Neoproterozoic passive margin. Our integrated data also suggests that the Afara terrane is more likely correlated with LATEA (instead of TAI). Deep magnetic lineaments outline major shear zones marking terrane boundaries, such as the crustal-scale (hundreds-km long and dozens-km thick) 7 degrees 30'E thrust zone limiting the SAA and TAI domains. Structures and kinematic indicators related to collisional deformation point to an overall NE-SW to E-W crustal shortening which induced thrusting and tight folding, followed by strike-slip shear zones related to transpressional deformation in late orogenic stage. In this scenario, the SAA domain may represent an accretionary complex associated to a Pan-African suture zone and thrust onto the LATEA passive margin.

TI  - Remote Analysis of the Chlorophyll-a Concentration Using Sentinel-2 MSI Images in a Semiarid Environment in Northeastern Brazil
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, the authors use remote-sensing images to monitor the water quality of reservoirs located in the semiarid region of Northeast Brazil. Sentinel-2 MSI TOA Level 1C reflectance images were used to remotely estimate the concentration of chlorophyll-a (chl-a), the main indicator of the trophic state of aquatic environments, in five reservoirs in the state of Ceara, Brazil. A three-spectral band retrieval model was calibrated using 171 water samples, collected from November 2015 through July 2018 in 5 reservoirs. For validation, 71 additional samples, collected from August 2018 through December 2019, were used to ensure a robust accuracy assessment. The TOA Level 1C products performed very well, achieving a relative RMSE of 28% and R-2 = 0.80. Data on wind direction and speed, solar radiation and reservoir volume were used to generate a conceptual model to analyze the behavior of chl-a in the surface waters of the Castanhao reservoir. During 2019, the reservoir water quality showed strong variation, with concentration fluctuating from 30 to 95 mu g/L We showed that the end of the dry season is marked by strong eutrophic conditions corresponding to very low water inflows into the reservoir. During the rainy season there is a large decrease in the chl-a concentration following the increase of the lake water storage. During the following dry season, satellite data show a progressive improvement of the trophic state controlled by wind intensity that promotes a better mixing of the reservoir waters and inhibiting the development of most phytoplankton.

TI  - Measuring Sustainable Intensification Using Satellite Remote Sensing Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Farm-level sustainable intensification metrics are needed to evaluate farm performance and support policy-making processes aimed at enhancing sustainable production. Farm-level sustainable intensification metrics require environmental impacts associated with agricultural production to be accounted for. However, it is common that such indicators are not available. We show how satellite-based remote sensing information can be used in combination with farm efficiency analysis to obtain a sustainable intensification (SI) indicator, which can serve as a sustainability benchmarking tool for farmers and policy makers. We obtained an SI indicator for 114 maize farms in Yangxin County, located in the Shandong Province in China, by combining information on maize output and inputs with satellite information on the leaf area index (from which a nitrogen environmental damage indicator is derived) into a farm technical efficiency analysis using a stochastic frontier approach. We compare farm-level efficiency scores between models that incorporate environmental damage indicators based on satellite-based remote sensing information and models that do not account for environmental impact. The results demonstrate that (a) satellite-based information can be used to account for environmental impacts associated with agriculture production and (b) how the environmental impact metrics derived from satellite-based information combined with farm efficiency analysis can be used to obtain a farm-level sustainable intensification indicator. The approach can be used to obtain tools for farmers and policy makers aiming at improving SI.

TI  - Quantifying the contribution of diminishing green spaces and urban sprawl to urban heat island effect in a rapidly urbanizing metropolitan city of Pakistan
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable urban land-use development and management practices are imperative to ensure the quality of the living environment. Unplanned expansion and densification of the urban area tend to imbalance the ratio of impervious surface to green spaces, resulting in the Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) effect. Land Use Land Cover changes, anthropogenic activity, and a sustainable future environment are all intertwined. This study aims to analyze urban policies impacts by quantifying built-up land, green spaces and their associated SUHI effects in the Lahore district of Pakistan. We used a tri-temporal medium resolution remote sensing imagery (2003, 2010 and 2019) and a long-term low resolution (1 km) Land Surface Temperature (LST) time series (2001-2020) to evaluate the impacts of the LULC changes on SUHI. We found rapid urban development in the study area over the last two decades (2003 -2019) that resulted in the losses (36%) and gains (16%) in urban vegetation at the Union Council (UC) level. Spatial patterns showed the inconsistent distribution of green spaces across the study area. Large green spaces exhibit 1 to 4 degrees C lower LST compared to their surrounding built-up land. The overall green spaces were reduced from 15215 ha in 2003 to 10528 ha in 2010 and a total loss of similar to 19% was recorded in agricultural land and open spaces during 2003-2019. Nonetheless, it showed a recovery during the last decade with a current extent of 12316 ha in 2019. This increase in green space areas is due to the rising awareness about the significance of urban green spaces and nationwide plantation drives programs which help to mitigate SUHI effect. On the other hand, transition zones under development phase consisting of sand/vacant and barren land exhibit a mean 3-4 degrees C higher LST while the old city areas, including the walled city, continuously exhibit 1-2 degrees C higher LST from the average LST of the district which triggered the SUHI pockets formation. These results of the study highlight the importance of devising effective policies to monitor unprecedented urban sprawl and the reduction in the cooling effect because of disappearing vegetation particularly in old city areas and transition zones. However, the effective implementation of the urban land use policies should be ensured through institutional strengthening, adequate resource allocation, efficient procedures, and continuous geospatial monitoring for a better living environment and to combat climate change.

TI  - Estimation of air temperature using the temperature/vegetation index approach over Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the critical variables characterizing the energy and water cycle at the earth's surface is near-surface air temperature. This has massive significance in agrometeorological applications aimed at achieving sustainable agriculture. Remote sensing data can solve this problem both globally and regionally, particularly with non-weather station areas. This study investigated the temperature vegetation index (TVX) approach's applicability to estimate air temperature at a satellite overpass in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. Land surface temperature (LST) and surface reflectance products on an 8-day composite basis from MODIS were used for selected days in 2008. The TVX method used for a 9 x 9 moving window and the respective intercept and slope relation between the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the LST were obtained. Thus, the relation was extrapolated to the maximum NDVI (NDVImax) received for this window to calculate the air temperature. Validation was performed over observations from four automatic weather stations (AWS). The overall results for the mapping of instantaneous air temperature were satisfactory for the Julian days corresponding to three months, i.e., February, September, and October, due to adequate vegetation cover. An overall comparison of observed and calculated values identified a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.1 degrees C.
