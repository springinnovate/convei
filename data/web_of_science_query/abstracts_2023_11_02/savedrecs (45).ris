TI  - Performance analysis of inverting optical properties based on quasi-analytical algorithms
T2  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The inherent optical parameters play a very important role in determining the concentration of seawater components. One such inherent parameter, the absorption coefficient (a), is greatly significant when calculating each component's content in water and simulating the water's biological, physical and chemical properties. Quasi-analytical algorithm (QAA) is one of current inherent optical parameters inversion algorithms. In this study, we compared three versions of QAA, including QAA_V4, QAA_V5 and more recently QAA_V6, using IOCCG data set. The results showed that QAA_V4 model performs best for the inversion of the absorption coefficient at 443 nm, with MRE, RMSE and R-2 values of 11.82%, 0.1995 and 0.9099, respectively, while QAA_V6 has the highest accuracy when inverting a at 555 nm and 670 nm wavelengths. Next, we tested the three models using MODIS product data, including data from case I and case II waters. The data is extracted from image, after position matching, then was imported into the three QAA models to calculate their RMSE, MRE and R-2 values. The QAA model showed a high accuracy and robust applicability for absorption coefficient inversion at shorter wavelengths, such as 443 nm. Future research should include verification with more complicated water bodies, solidifying the foundation for implementing QAA into ocean color remote sensing research.

TI  - Estimations of Water Use Efficiency in Winter Wheat Based on Multi-Angle Remote Sensing
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Real-time non-destructive monitoring of water use efficiency (WUE) is important for screening high-yielding high-efficiency varieties and determining the rational allocation of water resources in winter wheat production. Compared with vertical observation angles, multi-angle remote sensing provides more information on mid to lower parts of the wheat canopy, thereby improving estimates of physical and chemical indicators of the entire canopy. In this study, multi-angle spectral reflectance and the WUE of the wheat canopy were obtained at different growth stages based on field experiments carried out across 4 years using three wheat varieties under different water and nitrogen fertilizer regimes. Using appropriate spectral parameters and sensitive observation angles, the quantitative relationships with wheat WUE were determined. The results revealed that backward observation angles were better than forward angles, while the common spectral parameters Lo and NDDAig were found to be closely related to WUE, although with increasing WUE, both parameters tended to become saturated. Using this data, we constructed a double-ratio vegetation index (NDDAig/FWBI), which we named the water efficiency index (WEI), reducing the impact of different test factors on the WUE monitoring model. As a result, we were able to create a unified monitoring model within an angle range of -20-10 degrees. The equation fitting determination coefficient (R-2) and root mean square error (RMSE) of the model were 0.623 and 0.406, respectively, while an independent experiment carried out to test the monitoring models confirmed that the model based on the new index was optimal, with R-2, RMSE, and relative error (RE) values of 0.685, 0.473, and 11.847%, respectively. These findings suggest that the WEI is more sensitive to WUE changes than common spectral parameters, while also allowing wide-angle adaptation, which has important implications in parameter design and the configuration of satellite remote sensing and UAV sensors.

TI  - A detailed mangrove map of China for 2019 derived from Sentinel-1 and-2 images and Google Earth images
T2  - GEOSCIENCE DATA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves straddle terrestrial and marine ecosystems, thus are relevant to many United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), especially to SDG-13 and SDG-14, as they are linked to blue carbon strategies and fisheries. To better achieve SDGs, China has been restoring mangroves for their ecological and societal values through strict protection and afforestation, even in areas beyond their natural northern limits. However, small fragmented mangrove patches, especially those in marginal climates, have been historically neglected by existing mangrove maps, which, because they were derived from 30-m-resolution Landsat data, are too coarse to resolve them. To overcome this problem, we applied a classification to 10-m-resolution Sentinel-1 and -2 images for 2019 and then an enhanced post-processing to identify missing mangrove patches by utilizing Google Earth images. Thus, we produced the first publicly accessible detailed mangrove map supplementing the main 10-m-resolution results with submetre data from Google Earth images. According to general quantitative evaluations, the produced map achieved an overall accuracy of 96.4 +/- 0.3% based on validation data sets, an accuracy of 96.2% based on a total of 1,096 field sample plots. By evaluations in marginal climates, the produced map identified six areas with a total of seven mangrove planting areas, which is twice the number of identified areas by current publicly accessible mangrove maps. The produced map also outperformed the competitors in the identification of small mangrove patches in suitable climates, and in the determination of neat and tidy boundaries of large mangrove patches. The map paid attention to these small mangrove patches because they can provide substantial ecosystem services, such as increasing the community diversity and providing habitats for local species. The map does not only serve as a basis for mangrove species mapping, leaf area index estimation and carbon stock assessment, but also improves other mangrove maps by mutual corrections.

TI  - Two decades of distributed global radiation time series across a mountainous semiarid area (Sierra Nevada, Spain)
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - The main drawback of the reconstruction of high-resolution distributed global radiation (R-g) time series in mountainous semiarid environments is the common lack of station-based solar radiation registers. This work presents 19 years (2000-2018) of high-spatial-resolution (30 m) daily, monthly, and annual global radiation maps derived using the GIS-based model proposed by Aguilar et al. (2010) in a mountainous area in southern Europe: Sierra Nevada (SN) mountain range (Spain). The model was driven by in situ daily global radiation measurements, from 16 weather stations with historical records in the area; a 30m digital elevation model; and 240 cloud-free Landsat images. The applicability of the modeling scheme was validated against daily global radiation records at the weather stations. Mean RMSE values of 2.63 MJ m(-2) d(-1) and best estimations on clearsky days were obtained. Daily R-g at weather stations revealed greater variations in the maximum values but no clear trends with altitude in any of the statistics. However, at the monthly and annual scales, there is an increase in the high extreme statistics with the altitude of the weather station, especially above 1500 ma.s.l. Monthly R-g maps showed significant spatial differences of up to 200 MJ m(-2) per month that clearly followed the terrain configuration. July and December were clearly the months with the highest and lowest values of R-g received, and the highest scatter in the monthly R-g values was found in the spring and fall months. The monthly Rg distribution was highly variable along the study period (2000-2018). Such variability, especially in the wet season (October-May), determined the interannual differences of up to 800 MJ m(-2) yr(-1) in the incoming global radiation in SN. The time series of the surface global radiation datasets here provided can be used to analyze interannual and seasonal variation characteristics of the global radiation received in SN with high spatial detail (30 m). They can also be used as cross-validation reference data for other global radiation distributed datasets generated in SN with different spatiotemporal interpolation techniques.

TI  - Impact of Shave Biopsy on Diagnosis and Management of Cutaneous Melanoma: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background Melanoma is the most lethal skin cancer. Excision biopsy is generally recommended for clinically suspicious pigmented lesions; however, a proportion of cutaneous melanomas are diagnosed by shave biopsy. A systematic review was undertaken to investigate the impact of shave biopsy on tumor staging, treatment recommendations, and prognosis. Methodology The MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for relevant articles. Data on deep margin status on shave biopsy, tumor upstaging, and additional treatments on wide local excision (WLE), disease recurrence, and survival effect were analyzed across studies. Results Fourteen articles from 2010 to 2020 were included. In total, 3713 patients had melanoma diagnosed on shave biopsy. Meta-analysis revealed a positive deep margin in 42.9% of shave biopsies. Following WLE, change in tumor stage was reported in 7.7% of patients. Additional treatment was recommended for 2.3% of patients in the form of either further WLE and/or sentinel lymph node biopsy. There was high heterogeneity across studies in all outcomes. Four studies reported survival, while no studies found any significant difference in disease-free or overall survival between shave biopsy and other biopsy modalities. Conclusions Just over 40% of melanomas diagnosed on shave biopsy report a positive deep margin; however, this translated into a change in tumor stage or treatment recommendations in relatively few patients (7.7% and 2.3%, respectively), with no impact on local recurrence or survival among the studies analyzed.

TI  - Soil erosion and sediment transport modelling using hydrological models and remote sensing techniques in Wadi Billi, Egypt
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Modelling soil erosion and sediment transport are vital to assess the impact of the flash floods. However, limited research works have studied sediment transport, especially in Egypt. This paper employs the HEC-HMS lumped hydrological model to predict the sediment load due to the flood event of 9th March 2014 in Wadi Billi, Egypt. The Modified USLE model has been used to calculate the total upland erosion, while Laursen-Copeland has been used to simulate load streams' sediment transport potential. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) has been applied over Landsat 8 image captured on 20th February 2014 using ArcMap 10.5 to determine the vegetation cover based on its spectral footprint. The resulted sedigraph showed accumulation of more than five thousand tons of sediments at the Wadi's outlet. The results are crucial to design a suitable stormwater management system to protect the downstream urban area and to use flood water for groundwater recharge.

AB  - BackgroundIn the last decade, two research groups, the French group by Clough et al. (Br J Surg. 97:1659-65, 2010) and the Chinese one by Li et al. (ISRN Oncol 2013:279013, 2013), proposed two types of classification of axillary lymph nodes in breast cancer, identifying novel anatomic landmarks for dividing the axillary space in lymph node dissection.Main bodyKnowledge of the exact location of the sentinel node helps to focus the surgical dissection and to reduce the morbidity of sentinel lymph node biopsy procedures, in particular the risk of arm lymphedema, without compromising sensitivity.ConclusionIn this article, we aimed at focusing on the clinical impact that the most recent classifications of axillary lymph nodes have obtained in literature, highlighting the importance of defining new demarcations to preserve the axillary lymph nodes as much as possible in breast surgery.

T2  - EXPERIMENTAL AND APPLIED ACAROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rondonia is the only state in the North Region of Brazil to have registered confirmed cases of Brazilian Spotted Fever (BSF). The present study investigated the epidemiological cycle of Rickettsia spp. by surveying free-living ixodofauna and tick parasitism of dogs in the municipality of Porto Velho, Rondonia State. Ticks and dogs were tested for the presence of Rickettsia spp. DNA and dog serum was tested for reactivity to anti-Rickettsia spp. antibodies. Tick collection and dog blood sampling were performed in peri-urban and rural environments at 11 locations. Eight free-living Amblyomma species and one Haemaphysalis species were collected: A. scalpturatum, A. naponense, A. oblongoguttatum, A. coelebs, A. latepunctatum, A. pacae, A. ovale, Amblyomma sp., and H. juxtakochi. Three tick species were found parasitizing dogs: Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato, A. oblongoguttatum and A. ovale. Molecular analysis did not identify the presence of the gltA gene fragment in any tick specimen. Results from an indirect immunofluorescent assay (IFA) showed that 20.8% of peri-urban and 15.4% of rural dog sera exhibited reactivity to Rickettsia rhipicephali, Rickettsia amblyommatis, Rickettsia bellii and Rickettsia parkeri antigens. Antibody prevalence in dogs was 16.4%. This study is the first to describe the prevalence of Rickettsia spp. infection in dogs from Porto Velho municipality. Our findings enhance current knowledge of Rickettsia spp. circulation in the Western Amazon.

TI  - Performance evaluation on multi-scenario urban ventilation corridors based on least cost path
T2  - JOURNAL OF URBAN MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Ventilation Corridor is an important technique to mitigate local climate problems. Evaluating the benefits of ventilation corridors has gradually become the standard of its construction in cities. Previous studies have often analyzed the volume of ventilation from the perspective of geometric morphology, while there is a lack of discussion on its performance. Therefore, this study innovatively combined the roughness length (Z(0)), 3-dimensional aerodynamics parameter, with NDVI and M-NDWI, 2-dimensional indices of land cover through the combination of remote sensing inversion and urban morphology analysis. Compared with the traditional ventilation method, the composite indicator could not only guarantee ventilation volume, but also consider the cooling benefits brought by waters and vegetated areas. In detail, this study was contextualized in four districts in the city core of Hefei, Anhui Province, China. Based on the method of least cost path, we set up four different schemes for comparison, including roughness, roughness + vegetated areas, roughness + waters, and roughness + vegetated areas + waters. Comparative results were effectively verified through land surface temperature retrieved from the Landsat Thematic Mapper. Results were as follows: (1) Different scenarios exerted different impacts on urban ventilation. Of the four regions, the ventilation corridor that only considers Z(0) presented the highest average land surface temperature. (2) The general temperature of ventilation corridors along the path of Z(0) + NDVI + M-NDWI was respectively 34.11 degrees C, 31.73 degrees C, 34.80 degrees C, and 34.93 degrees C, presenting a lowest temperature compared with other scenarios of the same region. (3) Among the four regions, ventilation corridors constructed based on the path of Z(0) + M-NDWI presented a slightly lower temperature that those based on Z(0)+NDVI, with respective data of 34.22 degrees C < 34.55 degrees C, 31.85 degrees C < 31.91 degrees C, 34.81 degrees C < 34.82 degrees C, and 35.21 degrees C < 35.38 degrees C. The results provided methods and evidence for performance evaluation on urban land surface ventilation corridors.

TI  - Mapping the deforestation footprint of nations reveals growing threat to tropical forests
T2  - NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation, a significant threat to biodiversity, is accelerated by global demand for commodities. Although prior literature has linked deforestation to global supply chains, here we provide a fine-scale representation of spatial patterns of deforestation associated with international trade. Using remote sensing data and a multi-region input-output model, we quantify and map the spatiotemporal changes in global deforestation footprints over 15 years (2001-2015) at a 30-m resolution. We find that, while many developed countries, China and India have obtained net forest gains domestically, they have also increased the deforestation embodied in their imports, of which tropical forests are the most threatened biome. Consumption patterns of G7 countries drive an average loss of 3.9 trees per person per year. Some of the hotspots of deforestation embodied in international trade are also biodiversity hotspots, such as in Southeast Asia, Madagascar, Liberia, Central America and the Amazonian rainforest. Our results emphasize the need to reform zero-deforestation policies through strong transnational efforts and by improving supply chain transparency, public-private engagement and financial support for the tropics.The authors use economic input-output modelling to reveal how consumption patterns contribute to deforestation domestically and internationally across nations.

TI  - Detecting urban landscape factors controlling seasonal land surface temperature: from the perspective of urban function zones
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the impact on the thermal effect by urbanization is of great significance for urban thermal regulation and is essential for determining the relationship between the urban heat island (UHI) effect and the complexities of urban function and landscape structure. For this purpose, we conducted case research in the metropolitan region of Beijing, China, and nearly 5000 urban blocks assigned different urban function zones (UFZs) were identified as the basic spatial analysis units. The seasonal land surface temperature (LST) retrieved from remote sensing data was used to represent the UHI characteristics of the study area, and the surface biophysical parameters, building forms, and filtered landscape pattern metrics were selected as the urban landscape factors. Then, the effects of urban function and landscape structure on the UHI effect were examined based on the optimal results of the ordinary least squares and geographically weighted regression models. The results indicated that (1) Significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the LST was found in the study area, and there was an obvious temperature gradient with "working-living-resting" UFZs. (2) All types of urban landscape factors showed a significant contribution to the seasonal LST, in the order of surface biophysical factors > building forms > landscape factors; however, their contributions varied in different seasons. (3) The major contributing factors showed a certain difference due to the variation of urban function and landscape complexity. This study expands the understanding on the complex relationship among urban landscape, function, and thermal environment, which could benefit urban landscape planning for UHI alleviation.

TI  - Fields from Afar: Evidence of Heterogeneity in United States Corn Rotational Response from Remote Sensing DataJEL codes
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We construct estimates of own- and cross-price corn rotation elasticities using a field-level dataset that accounts for over 83% of the US corn-producing area. We allow rotational response to vary by estimating separate models across 115 subsamples that we delineate using Major Land Resource Areas (MLRAs) and soil characteristics. The results show a high degree of rotational response heterogeneity. Across the country, we find that rotational response is elastic in some areas and near zero in others. After aggregating the results to the national level, we find that modeling rotational response without allowing for heterogeneity produces a short-run own-price elasticity of corn planting of around 0.50, which conforms to the latest estimates in the literature. When allowing heterogeneous price sensitivity, our preferred estimate of the rotation elasticity is 0.69. This is evidence that imposing a uniform rotation response could seriously bias aggregate elasticity estimates.

TI  - "Listening to the Sounds of the Water": Bringing Together Local Knowledge and Biophysical Data to Understand Climate-Related Hazard Dynamics
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Integrating local knowledge and scientific information can aid in co-developing locally relevant approaches for climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction. Communities along the Mekong River have adapted to variability in temperature, rainfall, and flooding patterns over time. Rapid environmental change in the Mekong Basin presents a new set of challenges related to drought, altered seasonal rainfall, more frequent high-flow flood events, and water withdrawals for hydropower and irrigation. We present a multi-method approach to understand how local knowledge of the spatial and temporal patterns of floods, droughts, and rainfall can be integrated with scientific information along a flood-prone section of the lower Mekong River in Kratie Province, Cambodia. Participatory hazard mapping of community members' knowledge of the movement of floodwaters through the landscape enabled interpretation of flood extent mapping using Synthetic Aperture Radar images from the Sentinel-1A satellite. Seasonal calendars of weather patterns and livelihood activities, together with local indicators of flooding, rainfall, and drought were compared with trends in 35 years of rainfall data, and highlighted "pressure points" at the beginning and end of the rainy season where agriculture may be particularly impacted by climate change. We discuss potential applications of our findings for adaptation and hazard planning.

This paper proposes the use of spatial analysis approaches (i.e., ordinary least squares [OLS] and the Hurst exponent) combined with time-series analysis using enhanced vegetation index (EVI) data, derived from LANDSAT via the Google Earth Engine, to estimate the trends and sustainability of vegetation dynamics in the Tra Vinh Province in the Mekong River Delta. We also assessed the EVI changes connected to land change issues to examine the influence of land use conversion on vegetation dynamics. Results show that a large portion of the study area was covered by abundant vegetation (over 50% of the total area), and the increased EVI area was about 5.5-times greater than the area of EVI reduction. Additionally, vegetation sustainability was being seriously compromised (e.g., a decrease in the total area of 8,275 ha) due to several land conversion drivers such as shrimp farming, urbanisation, and industrialisation. Furthermore, results obtained from this research provide insight into the spatiotemporal dynamics of vegetation coverage and reveal the consistency of future vegetation trends. Moreover, the study also quantitatively assessed the positive impacts of Buddhist doctrines on reducing the negative trend of vegetation change in the study area. These findings can lay the ground to formulate sustainable land and environmental plans that meet the 11th, 13th and 15th Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (i.e., the sustainable cities and communities, the climate actions, and the life on land). Besides, the analytical procedure adopted in this study can also be applicable to any other coastal areas that require the accurate assessment of vegetation status over time.

TI  - Four-decade dynamics of the water color in 61 large lakes on the Yangtze Plain and the impacts of reclaimed aquaculture zones
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The lakes on the Yangtze Plain, a critical source of freshwater and fisheries for hundreds of millions of people in China, have lost a considerable portion of their surface area due to reclamation since the 1950s. Landsat satellites can provide long-term collections of high-resolution images and thus offer great potential for hindcasting the lake reclamations of aquaculture zones and their long-term impacts on the lacustrine water color. Using Landsat observations from 1984 to 2018 and a Forel-Ule index (FUI) model, we studied the water color dynamics of 61 lakes on the Yangtze Plain. Three distinct change patterns were found among the 61 examined lakes, and 25 of the 61 lakes showed statistically significant changes in the annual hue angle values (P < 0.05). We further collected environmental parameter datasets (runoff, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and wind speed) and a lacustrine reclamation dataset, and measured the concentrations of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from two field trips. We investigated their correlations with water color change from different facets. The results showed that the long-term water color in 33 of the 61 lakes exhibited significant correlations with environmental factors. The reclaimed aquaculture zones in this region have caused differences in the water color between the reclaimed area and that in adjacent natural waters. The Chl-a and DOC levels derived from field surveys further confirmed that reclaimed aquaculture zones increased light-absorbing materials in the water and may deteriorate water quality. This study is an important step forward in understanding the water quality changes in lake ecosystems affected by human impacts and natural variability. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study incorporates European Space Agency (ESA) C-band Sentinel-1a data to evaluate and identify land deformation in natural and reclaimed land of coastal city Karachi, Pakistan on a multi-temporal scale (2014-2018) using Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) analysis. Average displacement in LOS was between -78.81-42.97 mm, whereas, the average vertical displacement was 179.74 to -85.05 mm. Few areas have shown an alarming annual subsidence of -21.26 mm/year. Korangi industrial area (-34.34 mm), Liaquatabad (-1.88 mm) and SITE (-2.93 mm) area has shown significant land subsidence that resulted in collapse of few buildings. Maximum subsidence was observed in industrial cum residential areas (-85.05 mm) compared to reclaimed areas (-33.69 mm). Major uplifting was observed along the Kirthar range due to various tectonic activities Rapid urbanization and excessive groundwater abstraction are identified as main reasons for land deformation leading which requires in-depth attention of policy makers to insure sustainable urban development.

TI  - Where Are Global Vegetation Greening and Browning Trends Significant?
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Global greening trends have been widely reported based on long-term remote sensing data of terrestrial ecosystems. Typically, a hypothesis test is performed for each grid cell; this leads to multiple hypothesis testing and false positive trend detection. We reanalyze global greening and account for this issue with a novel statistical method that allows robust inference on greening regions. Based on leaf area index (LAI) data, our methods reduce the detected greening from 35.2% to 15.3% of the terrestrial land surface; this reduction is most notable in nonwoody vegetation. Our results confirm several greening regions (China, India, Europe, Sahel, North America, Brazil, and Siberia), that are also supported by independent data products. We also report evidence for an increasing seasonal amplitude in LAI north of 35 degrees N. Considering the widespread use of spatially replicated trend tests in global change research, we recommend adopting the proposed multiple testing procedure to control false positive outcomes.

TI  - Urbanization imprint on land surface phenology: The urban-rural gradient analysis for Chinese cities
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rising temperature shifts plant phenology. Chinese cities, experiencing extensive expansion and intensive warming, spanning a wide latitudinal range, might provide ideal experimental opportunities for observing and predicting phenological responses to warming temperature. Using the urban-rural gradient approach, we explored urbanization imprint on land surface phenology across the entire urbanization intensity (UI) gradient ranging from 0% to 100% in 343 Chinese cities using the VIIRS Land Surface Phenology along with MODIS Land Surface Temperature (LST) products. We found prevalent advancing and delaying trends for the start of the growing season (SOS) and the end of the growing season (EOS) with increasing UI across 343 Chinese cities, respectively. Overall, the phenology shifted earlier by 8.6 +/- 0.54 days for SOS, later by 1.3 +/- 0.51 days for EOS, and lengthened by 9.9 +/- 0.77 days for the growing season length (GSL) in urban core areas (UI above 50%) relative to their rural counterparts (UI lower than 1%). The temperature sensitivity of SOS and EOS was 10.5 +/- 0.25 days earlier and 2.9 +/- 0.16 days later per 1 degrees C LST increase in spring and autumn, respectively. Moreover, the northern cities witnessed higher temperature sensitivity for SOS and EOS than the southern ones. Both spring and autumn temperature sensitivity across these 343 cities would likely decrease with future urban warming, suggesting any projections of future phenological responses to continued warming must be approached with caution.

TI  - Record-Low Cloud Temperatures Associated With a Tropical Deep Convective Event
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth-orbiting satellites have long been used to examine meteorological processes. In the context of severe weather, brightness temperatures (BTs) at infrared wavelengths allow the determination of convective cloud properties. The anvils of cumulonimbus clouds, for example, typically produce BTs close to the tropopause temperature. Particularly severe storms generate overshoots that penetrate the stratosphere and are cooler than the anvil. In this study, we describe clustered storm overshoots in the tropical West Pacific on December 29, 2018 that resulted in the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) aboard NOAA-20 measuring a temperature of 161.96K (-111.2 degrees C), which is, to our knowledge, the coldest on record. We describe the local meteorological conditions, examine the VIIRS overpass that produced the cold temperature, compare VIIRS with other sensors that observed the region and, finally, analyze the historical context provided by two other satellite instruments to show that such cold temperatures may be becoming more common.

TI  - Space-Borne Cloud-Native Satellite-Derived Bathymetry (SDB) Models Using ICESat-2 And Sentinel-2
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Shallow nearshore coastal waters provide a wealth of societal, economic, and ecosystem services, yet their topographic structure is poorly mapped due to a reliance upon expensive and time intensive methods. Space-borne bathymetric mapping has helped address these issues, but has remained largely dependent upon in situ measurements. Here we fuse ICESat-2 lidar data with Sentinel-2 optical imagery, within the Google Earth Engine cloud platform, to create openly available spatially continuous high-resolution bathymetric maps at regional-to-national scales in Florida, Crete and Bermuda. ICESat-2 bathymetric classified photons are used to train three Satellite Derived Bathymetry (SDB) methods, including Lyzenga, Stumpf, and Support Vector Regression algorithms. For each study site the Lyzenga algorithm yielded the lowest RMSE (approx. 10%-15%) when compared with validation data. We demonstrate a means of using ICESat-2 for both model calibration and validation, thus cementing a pathway for fully space-borne estimates of nearshore bathymetry in shallow, clear water environments.

TI  - A Large-Scale Analysis of Pockets of Open Cells and Their Radiative Impact
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Pockets of open cells sometimes form within closed-cell stratocumulus cloud decks but little is known about their statistical properties or prevalence. A convolutional neural network was used to detect occurrences of pockets of open cells (POCs). Trained on a small hand-logged data set and applied to 13 years of satellite imagery the neural network is able to classify 8,491 POCs. This extensive database allows the first robust analysis of the spatial and temporal prevalence of these phenomena, as well as a detailed analysis of their micro-physical properties. We find a large (30%) increase in cloud effective radius inside POCs as compared to their surroundings and similarly large (20%) decrease in cloud fraction. This also allows their global radiative effect to be determined. Using simple radiative approximations we find that the instantaneous global annual mean top-of-atmosphere perturbation by all POCs is only 0.01 W/m(2).Plain Language Summary The amount of sunlight that reaches, and warms, the surface of the earth is heavily influenced by clouds, in particular marine stratocumulus clouds, a type of low-lying cloud that forms above cold-upwelling regions of the ocean. Marine stratocumulus clouds form in two distinct regimes; open-cells and closed-cells. Closed-cell clouds have a higher cloud cover and reflectivity than open-cell clouds. Small pockets of open cell clouds sometimes form within larger regions of closed-cell clouds; these are referred to as "pockets of open cells." Here we use machine learning to detect occurrences of this phenomenon and characterize them in a long-term satellite data set. This allows their effect on the climate to be determined for the first time. Despite substantial local-scale changes in cloud properties, we find that their effect on the climate is small.

TI  - Exploring influence factors in mapping soil organic carbon on low-relief agricultural lands using time series of remote sensing data
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) content is of critical importance in managing agricultural fields and understanding carbon fluxes at various scales. At regional and global scales, digital mapping of SOC has been successful using environmental variables such as climatic, land use and terrain factors. However, such a mapping for agricultural lands in low-relief areas cannot be resolved due to weak spatial variations of the environmental variables. An alternative approach, based on time series of remote sensing images, has recently been emphasized in estimating SOC since crop growth status clearly revealed by satellite images is strongly related to SOC. However, there is still a lack of full understanding of impacts of factors such as data source, regression techniques, and spatial resolution on the accuracy of SOC mapping using time series of satellite images. In this study, prediction variables including four spectral bands (i.e., blue, green, red, and near-infrared bands) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from Sentinel 2, Gaofen (GF) 1, and Landsat 8 data, acquired between November 2017 to March 2018, were individually used to estimate SOC by stepwise regression (STR), partial least squares regression (PLSR), and extreme learning machine (ELM). Besides, we further explored the influence of satellite parameters, such as scanning time, spectral bands and vegetation indices on predicting SOC using Sentinel 2 time series images. Results showed that: (1) the time series of remote sensing images can be used to map SOC in smalland large-extent low-relief areas with low evaluated root mean square errors (0.199 % and 0.249 %) and high R2 (0.555 and 0.528), (2) SOC estimations from the Sentinel-2 time series images, compared to those from Landsat 8 and GF 1 datasets, exhibited a better accuracy, and the ELM yielded a better prediction accuracy than PLSR and STR, (3) the satellite parameters of the spatial resolution, the acquisition time and the spectral bands significantly affected the prediction accuracy. This study offers more comprehensive information than terrain factors for revealing the influence of satellite parameters on predicting SOC, and provides great help for constructing one more suitable and higher precision soil mapping strategy for agricultural lands in low-relief areas.

TI  - Multi-Resolution Filters for Massive Spatio-Temporal Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatio-temporal datasets are rapidly growing in size. For example, environmental variables are measured with increasing resolution by increasing numbers of automated sensors mounted on satellites and aircraft. Using such data, which are typically noisy and incomplete, the goal is to obtain complete maps of the spatio-temporal process, together with uncertainty quantification. We focus here on real-time filtering inference in linear Gaussian state-space models. At each time point, the state is a spatial field evaluated on a very large spatial grid, making exact inference using the Kalman filter computationally infeasible. Instead, we propose a multi-resolution filter (MRF), a highly scalable and fully probabilistic filtering method that resolves spatial features at all scales. We prove that the MRF matrices exhibit a particular block-sparse multi-resolution structure that is preserved under filtering operations through time. We describe connections to existing methods, including hierarchical matrices from numerical mathematics. We also discuss inference on time-varying parameters using an approximate Rao-Blackwellized particle filter, in which the integrated likelihood is computed using the MRF. Using a simulation study and a real satellite-data application, we show that the MRF strongly outperforms competing approaches. include Python code for reproducing the simulations, some detailed properties of the MRF and auxiliary theoretical results.

AB  - A recurrent narrative in the recent literature on international student mobility is that overseas study is motivated by a desire for onward international mobility or oriented towards specific goals such as an international career. However, the way in which transnational mobility after graduation is perceived and experienced by international students is largely unexplored. Drawing on in-depth interviews with 55 current and graduated international students from three UK universities, this paper employs Bourdieu's central concepts of habitus and capital to explore differentiated mobility aspirations and experiences. In so doing, this article nuances, and calls for a need to problematise, the meaning and power associated with post-study mobility across borders.

TI  - Fusion of SAR and Optical Image for Sea Ice Extraction
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEAN UNIVERSITY OF CHINA
M3  - Article
AB  - It is difficult to balance local details and global distribution using a single source image in marine target detection of a large scene. To solve this problem, a technique based on the fusion of optical image and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image for the extraction of sea ice is proposed in this paper. The Band 2 (B2) image of Sentinel-2 (S2) in the research area is selected as optical image data. Preprocessing on the optical image, such as resampling, projection transformation and format conversion, are conducted to the S2 dataset before fusion. Imaging characteristics of the sea ice have been analyzed, and a new deep learning (DL) model, OceanTDL5, is built to detect sea ices. The fusion of the Sentinel-1 (S1) and S2 images is realized by solving the optimal pixel values based on deriving Poisson Equation. The experimental results indicate that the use of a fused image improves the accuracy of sea ice detection compared with the use of a single data source. The fused image has richer spatial details and a clearer texture compared with the original optical image, and its material sense and color are more abundant.

TI  - Old-growth forests show low canopy resilience to droughts at the southern edge of the taiga
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest mortality and resilience driven by drought disturbances have attracted tons of attention. However, the acquisition of continuous spatial-temporal data is generally enslaved to the conventional field investigations. In this study, the resilience of semiarid forest was characterized with canopy dynamics from remote sensing observations, combining the variations in canopy greenness and water content. We integrated dense normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference infrared index (NDII) time series from Landsat datasets, intending to assess the canopy resilience in 24 conifer patches along a climatic aridity gradient at the southern edge of the taiga in northern Mongolia and southern Siberia of Russia. The results exhibited four patterns of coordinated NDVI-NDII variation trends, indicating that the canopy water content of coniferous forests may decrease at first during a drought period, and sustained water loss may, in turn, induce an accompanying reduction in canopy greenness. Meanwhile, the patches with canopy recovery growth after initial declines were considered to have resilience to climate change. We further observed the combined effects of aridity degree and tree age on canopy resilience, and all seven patches with no resilience corresponded to the old-tree group (the oldest trees reached or exceeded the age of 90). The observations indicated that the old-growth forests in semiarid regions were less likely to show canopy resilience, which corresponded to a higher risk of sustained decline.

TI  - A unique bacterial and archaeal diversity make mangrove a green production system compared to rice in wetland ecology: A metagenomic approach
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove provides significant ecosystem services, however, 40% of tropical mangrove was lost in last century due to climate change induced sea-level rise and anthropogenic activities. Sundarban-India, the largest contiguous mangrove of the world lost 10.5% of its green during 1930-2013 which primarily converted to rice-based systems. Presently degraded mangrove and adjacent rice ecology in Sundarban-India placed side by side and create typical ecology which is distinct in nature in respect to soil physicochemical properties, carbon dynamics, and microbial diversities. We investigated the structural and functional diversities of bacteria and archaea through Illumina MiSeq metagenomic analysis using V3-V4 region of 16S rRNA gene approach that drives greenhouse gases emission and carbon-pools. Remote sensing-data base were used to select the sites for collecting the soil and gas samples. The methane and nitrous oxide emissions were lower in mangrove (-0.04 mg m(-2) h(-1) and -52.8 mu g m(-2) h(-1)) than rice (0.26 mg m(-2) h(-1) and 44.7 mu g m(-2) h(-1)) due to less availability of carbon-substrates and higher sulphate availability (85.8% more than rice). The soil labile carbon-pools were more in mangrove, but lower microbial activities were noticed due to stress conditions. A unique microbial feature indicated by higher methanotrophs: methanogens (11.2), sulphur reducing bacteria (SRB): methanogens (93.2) ratios and lower functional diversity (7.5%) in mangrove than rice. These could be the key drivers of lower global warming potential (GWP) in mangrove that make it a green production system. Therefore, labile carbon buildup potential (38%) with less GWP (63%) even in degraded-mangrove makes it a clean production system than wetland-rice that has high potential to climate change mitigation. The whole genome metagenomic analysis would be the future research priority to identify the predominant enzymatic pathways which govern the methanogenesis and methanotrophy in this system.

TI  - An Overview of Atmospheric Features Over the Western North Atlantic Ocean and North American East Coast-Part 2: Circulation, Boundary Layer, and Clouds
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Western North Atlantic Ocean (WNAO) is a complex land-ocean-atmosphere system that experiences a broad range of atmospheric phenomena, which in turn drive unique aerosol transport pathways, cloud morphologies, and boundary layer variability. This work, Part 2 of a 2-part paper series, provides an overview of the atmospheric circulation, boundary layer variability, three-dimensional cloud structure, and precipitation over the WNAO; the companion paper (Part 1) focused on chemical characterization of aerosols, gases, and wet deposition. Seasonal changes in atmospheric circulation and sea surface temperature explain a clear transition in cloud morphologies from small shallow cumulus clouds, convective clouds, and tropical storms in summer, to stratus/stratocumulus and multilayer cloud systems associated with winter storms. Synoptic variability in cloud fields is estimated using satellite-based weather states, and the role of postfrontal conditions (cold-air outbreaks) in the development of stratiform clouds is further analyzed. Precipitation is persistent over the ocean, with a regional peak over the Gulf Stream path, where offshore sea surface temperature gradients are large and surface fluxes reach a regional peak. Satellite data show a clear annual cycle in cloud droplet number concentration with maxima (minima) along the coast in winter (summer), suggesting a marked annual cycle in aerosol-cloud interactions. Compared with satellite cloud retrievals, four climate models qualitatively reproduce the annual cycle in cloud cover and liquid water path, but with large discrepancies across models, especially in the extratropics. The paper concludes with a summary of outstanding issues and recommendations for future work.

TI  - Integrated CA model and remote sensing approach for simulating the future development of a city
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Population growth and industrial development have resulted in the physical development of cities and transformation of land use, especially in the areas surrounding the City. Reviewing these changes and predicting urban growth through modelling can help environmental managers in making more informed decisions. The purpose of this research was to simulate the expansion of urbanization and also its prediction in the future using the SLEUTH model in Zanjan. In this study, Landsat and IRS images were used 2001, 2002, and 2003. Then, slope data, land use, exclusion, urban development, transportation, and landing were introduced to the Cygwin using the controlled classification method, to implement the SLEUTH model. The results of model prediction indicated a significant increase will happen in urban areas by 38.1% over the next 22 years. The results also showed that with SLEUTH model calibration, the projected growth has a high scattering coefficient, in which case topography limits the development and expansion of the City. In contrast, the coefficients of spread and slope of play with points of 96 and 94 have considerably grown, respectively. The conversion of these lands into urban areas will slow down from now until the next 22 years, and this further development will be achieved along with the main roads of the province, as well as the actual results of the current situation will be the evidence for that. The results of this study can provide further study opportunities for planners and decision makers to consider preventive and controlling factors into strategic decisions.

TI  - The role of fire in global forest loss dynamics
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Fires, among other forms of natural and anthropogenic disturbance, play a central role in regulating the location, composition and biomass of forests. Understanding the role of fire in global forest loss is crucial in constraining land-use change emissions and the global carbon cycle. We analysed the relationship between forest loss and fire at 500 m resolution based on satellite-derived data for the 2003-2018 period. Satellite fire data included burned area and active fire detections, to best account for large and small fires, respectively. We found that, on average, 38 +/- 9% (+/- range) of global forest loss was associated with fire, and this fraction remained relatively stable throughout the study period. However, the fraction of fire-related forest loss varied substantially on a regional basis, and showed statistically significant trends in key tropical forest areas. Decreases in the fraction of fire-related forest loss were found where deforestation peaked early in our study period, including the Amazon and Indonesia while increases were found for tropical forests in Africa. The inclusion of active fire detections accounted for 41%, on average, of the total fire-related forest loss, with larger contributions in small clearings in interior tropical forests and human-dominated landscapes. Comparison to higher-resolution fire data with resolutions of 375 and 20 m indicated that commission errors due to coarse resolution fire data largely balanced out omission errors due to missed small fire detections for regional to continental-scale estimates of fire-related forest loss. Besides an improved understanding of forest dynamics, these findings may help to refine and separate fire-related and non-fire-related land-use change emissions in forested ecosystems.

TI  - Hemispheric and Seasonal Contrast in Cloud Thermodynamic Phase From A-Train Spaceborne Instruments
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol-cloud interactions are an important source of uncertainty in current climate models. To understand and quantify the influence of ice-nucleating particles in cloud glaciation, it is crucial to have a reliable estimation of the hemispheric and seasonal contrast in cloud top phase, which is believed to result from the higher dust aerosol loading in boreal spring. For this reason, we locate and quantify these contrasts by combining three different A-Train cloud-phase products for the period 2007-2010. These products rely on a spaceborne lidar, a lidar-radar synergy, and a radiometer-polarimeter synergy. We show that the cloud-phase from the product combination is more reliable and that the estimation of the hemispheric and seasonal contrast has a lower error compared to the individual products. To quantify the contrast in cloud-phase, we use the hemispheric difference in ice cloud frequency normalized by the liquid cloud frequency in the southern hemisphere between -42 degrees C and 0 degrees C. In the midlatitudes, from -15 to -30 degrees C, the hemispheric contrasts increase with decreasing temperature. At -30 degrees C, the hemispheric contrast varies from 29% to 39% for the individual cloud-phase products and from 52% to 73% for the product combination. Similarly, in the northern hemisphere, we assess the seasonal contrast between spring and fall normalized by the liquid cloud frequency during fall. At -30 degrees C, the seasonal contrast ranges from 21% to 39% for the individual cloud-phase products and from 54% to 75% for the product combination.

TI  - Forest Greening Increases Land Surface Albedo During the Main Growing Period Between 2002 and 2019 in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study is the first to find the unexpected increases in albedo due to forest greening, which has important implications in research of land-surface energy-balance and the forest-climate feedback. We investigated interannual changes of vegetation and albedo for forests and grassland during the main growing period, May to September, between 2002 and 2019 in China using the MODIS-satellite vegetation index and albedo products. These results indicate significant greening (P-MK < 0.01) in all types of forests as well as grasslands in China. However, forests had an increasing trend of shortwave albedo (P-MK < 0.01) for evergreen forests, deciduous broadleaf forests, and mixed forests. Grasslands showed a decreasing albedo trend (P-MK < 0.01) over the same period. Corroborating statistical analyses revealed a positive correlation (P < 0.01) between Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and albedo for forests on interannual scales. However, EVI and albedo for grasslands had a negative correlation. Forest greening increased the albedo during the main growing period. This contrasts previous results indicating that albedo decreases as annual forest-cover increases. Developing and analyzing a simple vegetation-coverage-based albedo model showed that increasing forest coverage (i.e., forest greening) had increased area of more brightly leafy canopy and decreased area of darker gaps in the forest canopy. In conjunction, these produced the increased overall albedo observed by satellite. Contrastingly, grassland greening and more precipitation produced decreased albedo. Hence, the greening of forests and grasslands, representing dense and scarce vegetation respectively, has contrasting albedo responses.

TI  - Land-use cover change impact on Cranes nesting space in the Lake Tana Biosphere Reserve area, Blue Nile Basin
T2  - WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake Tana is the largest lake in Ethiopia, and it is the origin of the Blue Nile River (Abay). It harbors winter birds and globally threatened bird species. The wetlands in the area are nesting places of Wattled and Black Crowned Cranes. The wetlands are being converted into different land uses; however, how much area of these wetlands is being converted into different land uses is not known yet. This study therefore investigated the land-use change of the main nesting place of cranes in Chimba and Yiganda wetlands, in the Lake Tana Biosphere Reserve area. The land-use cover change was estimated by analyzing satellite images (Landsat images-ETM + from USGS website) from 1986 to 2016. The result showed that in 1986, the Chimba wetland area covered a total of 15,134,974.6 m(2), which is 7.4% of the total area of Chimba watershed (203,312,456.3 m(2)). Other land use land cover types in the study area namely cultivated land covered 31.9%; farm village 2.1%, natural forest 41.3% and grass land 17.3%. However, the land-use land cover change (LULC) in 2016 showed that the wetland coverage declined to 10,708,894 m(2). About 27.6% of the wetland is converted completely into cultivated land. Yiganda watershed covered about 28,075,506 m(2) in 1986 of which 5,351,641.7 m(2) was wetland area; however, the wetland area has shrunk to 4,668,162.9 m(2). When it is compared to the wetland change in 1986 to 2016, Chimba wetland was more affected in which 663.5 ha was changed into another land-use land cover; whereas in Yiganda it was about 137.2 ha changed during the last 30 years. When the exponential trend change of LULC is observed, it could affect crane ecology by reducing the habitat availability for cranes nesting spaces.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - CASSIE is an open-source web tool for automatic shoreline mapping and analysis using satellite imagery (www. cassiengine.com). This tool was built in JavaScript, using Google Earth Engine (GEE) API, and can be applied to any coastal region on Earth where a boundary between water and land exists. CASSIE use the Landsat and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, freely available from GEE, and implements an automatic shoreline detection using the normalized difference water index (NDWI) together with Otsu image segmentation algorithm. The satellitederived shorelines are analysed for a set of user-defined cross-shore transects along which several statistical analyses are performed. Comparisons of the CASSIE-derived shorelines and rate of changes with state-of-the art methods show that the products from this tool have sub-pixel accuracy. The new concept of big-data cloud-based computing and storage platform (GEE), together with a user-friendly interface and high level of automation makes of CASSIE a complete tool to support a wide variety of studies and applications where the knowledge of the shoreline behaviour is fundamental.

TI  - GOFOS, ground optical fog observation system for monitoring the vertical stratocumulus-fog cloud distribution in the coast of the Atacama Desert, Chile
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Studying fog requires a good understanding of both its horizontal and vertical distributions. Among these two, the vertical one is the most challenging to observe. Different methods have been adopted for observing this variable, among which the most commonly used are satellite datasets, together with airborne and meteorological surface observations. Yet, all these techniques present significant limitations as for spatial and temporal resolution when describing the vertical fog structure. In this manuscript, we introduce the Ground Optical Fog Observation System (GOFOS), a new method to describe the advective fog's frequency and vertical distribution. This tool is based on in-situ optical observations, taking advantage of the topography of the Atacama Desert coastal mountains, where advective fog is frequent. During 2017, the GOFOS reported a fog presence <10% during summer and of similar to 50% during winter. Also, the GOFOS shows a diurnal variability of fog presence that decreases around noon and increases again starting from the afternoon. The vertical structure observed by the GOFOS shows a cloud depth of similar to 250 m, subject to diurnal and seasonal variabilities. By analyzing GOFOS results through a comparison with the ones obtained by standard observations, a similar to 93% agreement was found between the fog frequencies detected by the GOFOS and GOES. Also, we found a similar to 80% consistency between GOFOS fog frequency values and marine boundary layer regimes related to fog formation. Moreover, we observed that the cloud base height estimated by the GOFOS is correlated with the Iquique Airport ceilometer measurements (r = +0.6). Finally, the mean cloud top height estimated by the GOFOS differs by 8% from the Antofagasta Airport radio-soundings measurements. These results provide useful information for the selection of optimal sites for fog harvesting and for getting a better understanding of the interactions between fog and its ecosystem. In conclusion, through this study the GOFOS demonstrated its potential as a simple, reliable, and affordable method for systematic fog monitoring that might also be adapted to different topographic conditions.

TI  - Relationships between soil respiration and hyperspectral vegetation indexes and crop characteristics under different warming and straw application modes
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Examining the relationship between seasonal variations in soil respiration and abiotic factors and vegetation indexes is crucial for modeling soil respiration using upscaled remote sensing satellite data. A field experiment including control (CK), warming (WA), straw application (SA), and warming and straw application (WASA) treatments was performed in a winter wheat-soybean rotation cropland on the north shore of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Soil respiration, abiotic factors, crop hyperspectral vegetation indexes, leaf area index (LAI), and chlorophyll content (represented as the SPAD value) were measured during the 2018-2020 rotation growing seasons. The results indicated that the mean annual soil respiration was 2.27 +/- 0.04, 3.08 +/- 0.06, 3.64 +/- 0.08, and 3.95 +/- 0.20 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) in the CK, WA, SA, and WASA plots, respectively, during the 2-year experimental period. Soil respiration was significantly (P < 0.05) correlated with soil temperature, soil moisture, hyperspectral vegetation indexes, LAI, and SPAD value in all plots. Models that included temperature, moisture, hyperspectral vegetation indexes, LAI, and SPAD value explained 50.5-74.7% of the seasonal variation in soil respiration in the CK, WA, SA, and WASA plots during the 2-year experimental period. A model including the seasonal mean NDVI, DVI, EVI, PRI, and LAI explained 72.4% of the interseasonal and intertreatment variations in seasonal mean soil respiration in the different plots across the four different crop-growing seasons. Our study indicated the potential applicability of hyperspectral vegetation indexes, LAI, and SPAD value to the estimation of soil respiration at a regional scale.

TI  - Sensitivity analysis and prediction of shading effect of external Venetian blind for nearly zero-energy buildings in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - External Venetian blind shading (EVBS) is identified as an effective technology for reducing cooling demand in summer. Inappropriate design of the fenestration component may led to low energy efficiency, and there lacks simple methods to guide the application of EVBS in different climate zones of China, especially for nearly zero-energy bu ildings (NZEBs). This study explored sensitivity and regressi on analysis to identify and prioritize the most influencing parameters for cooling demand and shading performance, then used regression models to predict the shading performance. A new method of MC-AHP was proposed and used to quanti fy the se nsitivity of the related factors, which was classified into three categories, on cooling demand and shading performance. The sensitivity analysis identifi ed meteorological para meters are the most significant parameters affecting the cooling demand with a comprehensive weight of 0.82. Followed by building parameters with a weight of 0.11 and shading parameters with a weight of 0.07. The key influential sub-factors of these three types of parameters are outdoor temperature and solar radiation; shape factor (SF) and south window-to-wall ratio (SWWR); shading orientation (SO) and slat angle (SA), respectively.In addition, regression models between the shading performance and the key influential sub-factors were established for NZEB s with EVBS in different climate regions of China. And error anal ysis verified the accuracy of these models, which reveals that these regression models can effectively and accurately predict the shading performance. The regression analysis results indicate that WWR, SF, and SA are linearly related to the shading performance of EVBS, and the shading performance is always linearly related to SA regardless of how the shading orientation, WWR and SF change. This study can help architects determine the priority order of the optimal design of different building parameters in decision-making stages, then guide the efficient application of EVBS in new and retrofitted NZEBs.

TI  - Object-level classification of vegetable crops in 3D LiDAR point cloud using deep learning convolutional neural networks
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop discrimination at the plant or patch level is vital for modern technology-enabled agriculture. Multispectral and hyperspectral remote sensing data have been widely used for crop classification. Even though spectral data are successful in classifying row-crops and orchards, they are limited in discriminating vegetable and cereal crops at plant or patch level. Terrestrial laser scanning is a potential remote sensing approach that offers distinct structural features useful for classification of crops at plant or patch level. The objective of this research is the improvement and application of an advanced deep learning framework for object-based classification of three vegetable crops: cabbage, tomato, and eggplant using high-resolution LiDAR point cloud. Point clouds from a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) were acquired over experimental plots of the University of Agricultural Sciences, Bengaluru, India. As part of the methodology, a deep convolution neural network (CNN) model named CropPointNet is devised for the semantic segmentation of crops from a 3D perspective. The CropPointNet is an adaptation of the PointNet deep CNN model developed for the segmentation of indoor objects in a typical computer vision scenario. Apart from adapting to 3D point cloud segmentation of crops, the significant methodological improvements made in the CropPointNet are a random sampling scheme for training point cloud, and optimization of the network architecture to enable structural attribute-based segmentation of point clouds of unstructured objects such as TLS point clouds crops. The performance of the 3D crop classification has been validated and compared against two popular deep learning architectures: PointNet, and the Dynamic Graph-based Convolutional Neural Network (DGCNN). Results indicate consistent plant level object-based classification of crop point cloud with overall accuracies of 81% or better for all the three crops. The CropPointNet architecture proposed in this research can be generalized for segmentation and classification of other row crops and natural vegetation types.

TI  - Student transformation through service learning in inner-city contexts: An assessment of student experience in the service-learning course Inner-City Families
T2  - COMMUNICATION TEACHER
M3  - Article
AB  - This study provides a thematic analysis of student transformative experience regarding personal and social change in a service learning (SL) course wherein students volunteer in embedded inner-city contexts. Several transformative themes emerged through interpretive analysis of student journals. Especially important to this investigation, we discovered "negative" themes that reflect and may be essential to student transformative experiences. These include task-related negativity, emotional response related to difficult experience, emotional response related to uncertainty, disruptive worldview, and outside pressures/restraint not program related. Positive transformative themes include personal satisfaction, personal development, relationship development, future hope, and worldview consolidation. Pedagogical implications for a transformative perspective of student experience in SL courses are discussed, as well as pedagogical applications for courses designed to generate transformation of self and community.

TI  - Evaluating the effectiveness of emissions reduction measures and ambient air quality variability through ground-based and Sentinel-5P observations under the auspices of COVID pandemic lockdown in Tamil Nadu, India
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - COVID-19 pandemic situation has highly restricted the human movements including public transport, commercial and industrial activities in India since the end of March 2020. With the necessity to demonstrate the effectiveness of local emissions, the study aims in analysing the relative variation of ambient air quality before and during COVID-19 with the aid of in situ measurement and Sentinel 5P space technologies. ESA Sentinel 5P Level 2 data \sets including Carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), Sulphur dioxide (SO2), and Ozone (O-3)were pre-processed in SNAP and QGIS platform for the extraction of air quality parameters. Results concluded that the concentration of air quality parameters CO, NO2, SO2, and O(3)reduced 50.52%, 85.81%, 71.61% and 313.4%, respectively, between March and June 2020. Accuracy of air quality parameters CO, NO2, SO2, and O(3)obtained from Sentinel 5P datasets are found to be 89.5%, 83.54%, 86% and 94%, respectively, when compared with the in situ measurements. As a favourable outcome of the COVID 19 lockdown, better air quality is recorded over the vulnerable locations due to the absence of significant activities and with the improvement in the air quality the study illustrates the importance of temporary pollution source control measures in a suitable time interval. Integration of in situ measurements and satellite datasets will remove the conventional barriers and provide spatially distributed observations that can assist the decision-makers in formulating the best air pollution control strategy.

TI  - Improved machine-learning-based open-water-sea-ice-cloud discrimination over wintertime Antarctic sea ice using MODIS thermal-infrared imagery
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The frequent presence of cloud cover in polar regions limits the use of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and similar instruments for the investigation and monitoring of sea-ice polynyas compared to passive-microwave-based sensors. The very low thermal contrast between present clouds and the sea-ice surface in combination with the lack of available visible and near-infrared channels during polar nighttime results in deficiencies in the MODIS cloud mask and dependent MODIS data products. This leads to frequent misclassifications of (i) present clouds as sea ice or open water (false negative) and (ii) open-water and/or thin-ice areas as clouds (false positive), which results in an underestimation of actual polynya area and subsequently derived information. Here, we present a novel machine-learning-based approach using a deep neural network that is able to reliably discriminate between clouds, sea-ice, and open-water and/or thin-ice areas in a given swath solely from thermal-infrared MODIS channels and derived additional information. Compared to the reference MODIS sea-ice product for the year 2017, our data result in an overall increase of 20% in annual swath-based coverage for the Brunt Ice Shelf polynya, attributed to an improved cloud-cover discrimination and the reduction of false-positive classifications. At the same time, the mean annual polynya area decreases by 44% through the reduction of false-negative classifications of warm clouds as thin ice. Additionally, higher spatial coverage results in an overall better subdaily representation of thin-ice conditions that cannot be reconstructed with current state-of-the-art cloud-cover compensation methods.

TI  - Detecting the annual areal extent of sugarcane crops in Queensland, Australia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Sugarcane is an economically important crop for Queensland, Australia, that is increasingly a focus of environmental management, due to proximity to the Great Barrier Reef. This study responds to the demand for an ongoing, objective, and transparent assessment of the areal extent of sugarcane grown. I have combined Landsat and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery with time-series analysis, image-segmentation, and machine-learning, into a model that detects the annual areal extent of sugarcane in Queensland, since 2004. I then contrasted two variants of the model: one applied at the end of autumn (i.e. May), just before the annual harvest begins, and another applied earlier, in mid-summer (end of January), to help expedite the delivery of information for the current growing season. Both models relied heavily on contemporary land-use mapping, and the behaviour of enhanced vegetation index through summer, to detect accurately. The end-of-autumn model detected sugarcane with a user's accuracy of 93%, and a producer's accuracy of 98%, based on 596 random validation points. In comparison with historical published statistics, the end-of-autumn predictions of areal extent were typically in error by 7.1-10.1% of the observed mean, depending on the spatial scale of interest. The mid-summer model was slightly more volatile, typically in error by 6.8-11.0% of the observed mean. Overall, the results indicate that it is possible to detect-in near-real-time and with reasonable accuracy-the areal extent of sugarcane grown in Queensland in the summer of each year.

TI  - Augmented Normalized Difference Water Index for improved surface water monitoring
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a comprehensive critical review of well-established satellite remote sensing water indices and offer a novel, robust Augmented Normalized Difference Water Index (ANDWI). ANDWI employs an expanded set of spectral bands, RGB, NIR, and SWIR1-2, to maximize the contrast between water and non-water pixels. Further, we implement a dynamic thresholding method, the Otsu algorithm, to enhance ANDWI?s performance. Applied to a variety of environmental conditions, ANDWI with Otsu-thresholding offered the highest overall accuracy (accuracy = 0.98, F1 = 0.98, and Kappa = 0.96) compared to other indices (NDWI, MNDWI, AWEI, WI). We also propose a novel cloud filtering algorithm that substantially increases the number of useable images compared to the conventional cloud-free composites (124% increased observations in the studied area) and resolves inappropriate masking of water bodies and hot sands as clouds by conventional methods. Finally, we develop a Google Earth Engine App to readily delineate 16-day surface water bodies across the globe.

TI  - Leveraging the application of Earth observation data for mapping cropland soils in Brazil
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the natural spatial variability, cropland soils are subject to many interventions that can lead to alterations of soil functioning. As the cropland expansion took place in Brazil the last decades, leading to significant land-use change and environmental impacts, detailed information about soils is fundamental for sustainable development. Thus, considering the lack of spatially explicit information about cropland soils in Brazil, we aimed at performing high-resolution mapping of key topsoil attributes using spectral and terrain features extracted from Earth observation data (EOD). With the resulting information, we also aimed at performing a general examination of the main agricultural regions and estimate the total organic carbon stocks on croplands soils. For this, we obtained environmental predictors from the historical collection of Landsat data and the digital elevation model from Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission at the cloud-based platform of Google Earth Engine. The environmental predictors (30 m spatial resolution) with georeferenced soil samples (n = 5097) were used for predicting the topsoil content (0-20 cm) of clay, sand, silt, cation exchange capacity, pH, soil organic carbon (SOC) and SOC stock. Prediction models of clay, sand, SOC content, and SOC stocks had the best performance metrics, achieving a R2 ranging from 0.44 to 0.74 and ratio of performance to the interquartile range higher than 1.5. The predicted maps revealed the variability of topsoil among the cropped areas, indicating that the agricultural expansion took place on sandy soils. The SOC stock map provided consistent estimates compared to previous datasets but revealed additional information at the local and regional scales. Thus, this study supports the proposition that EOD is a valuable source for extracting environmental features for mapping and monitoring cropland soils at finer resolutions, assisting the evaluation of soil spatial distribution and the historical agriculture expansion over large geographical areas.

TI  - Gridded population mapping for Germany based on building density, height and type from Earth Observation data using census disaggregation and bottom-up estimates
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Gridded population data is widely used to map fine scale population patterns and dynamics to understand associated human-environmental processes for global change research, disaster risk assessment and other domains. This study mapped gridded population across Germany using weighting layers from building density, building height (both from previous studies) and building type datasets, all created from freely available, temporally and globally consistent Copernicus Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. We first produced and validated a nation-wide dataset of predominant residential and non-residential building types. We then examined the impact of different weighting layers from density, type and height on top-down dasymetric mapping quality across scales. We finally performed a nation-wide bottom-up population estimate based on the three datasets. We found that integrating building types into dasymetric mapping is helpful at fine scale, as population is not redistributed to non-residential areas. Building density improved the overall quality of population estimates at all scales compared to using a binary building layer. Most importantly, we found that the combined use of density and height, i.e. volume, considerably increased mapping quality in general and with regard to regional discrepancy by largely eliminating systematic underestimation in dense agglomerations and overestimation in rural areas. We also found that building density, type and volume, together with living floor area per capita, are suitable to produce accurate large-area bottom-up population estimates.

TI  - Greenness, texture, and spatial relationships predict floristic diversity across wetlands of the conterminous United States
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant diversity safeguards wetland ecosystem functions, stability, and resilience, but is threatened by habitat loss and degradation. Remote sensing could support the cost-effective management of biodiversity by providing consistent and frequent data at large scales. While identifying individual species from remote sensing datasets with low spatial and spectral resolution is challenging, studies can focus on factors known to correlate with or promote diversity. We tested the predictive potential of such factors - maximum annual greenness as an indicator of productivity, texture (i.e., spatial arrangement of grey tones) as a proxy for habitat heterogeneity, and spatial autocorrelation - across a dataset of 1115 wetlands in the conterminous United States surveyed by the EPA's National Wetland Condition Assessment. We used multivariate linear regressions to test whether spectral and spatial metrics derived from two open-source datasets - NASA's Landsat 5 TM and 7 ETM+ (30 m, 16-day revisit) and USDA's National Agriculture Inventory Program (1 m, biennial) - can predict wetland plant diversity and richness. Individual texture metrics showed different sensitivity to vegetation evenness, growth form, and spatial distribution and could together predict 35-36% of site variation in richness and diversity. This highlights the impact of habitat heterogeneity on species diversity and spectral variability. While maximum annual greenness and texture metrics had similar predictive capacity, their interactions and combined effects improved the fit of linear models by 11-14%, demonstrating their complementarity. Best results were achieved when including distance-based Moran's Eigenvector Maps (dbMEMs) describing spatial relations among sites at multiple scales and reflecting the role of spatially structured factors (e.g., climate, topography, dispersal) on diversity. Together greenness, texture, and dbMEMs could predict 59% of plant richness and 50% of plant diversity across the entire dataset and up to 71% of the richness of least disturbed sites. These results show the potential of open-source remote sensing datasets to monitor biodiversity resources at a large scale and prioritize the protection and field monitoring of wetlands.

TI  - A machine learning based full-spectrum correlated <i>k</i>-distribution model for nonhomogeneous gas-soot mixtures
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER
M3  - Article
AB  - The machine learning based full-spectrum correlated k-distribution (FSCK) model previously developed by Zhou et al. (2020), provides a compact prediction model with good efficiency and accuracy for the evaluation of radiative spectral calculations in nonhomogeneous gaseous media. However, the model is only for gas mixtures of CO2, CO, H2O, and cannot be used for gas-soot mixtures that are found in most combustion scenarios. In addition, the previous machine learning based-FSCK model was trained in Python and requires several Python packages to run the model for radiative heat transfer calculations, which limits its portability to other computational fluid dynamics (CFD) platforms. In this paper, a new machine learning based-FSCK model is developed for the radiatively participating species CO2, H2O, CO, and soot, by accurately fitting the gas-soot FSCK look-up table. Major improvements include: (1) The Bayesian optimization method is used to select optimal hyperparameters of the machine learning model; (2) The developed machine learning based-FSCK model now includes gas-soot mixtures, but with a smaller model size of 47.1 MB, which is significantly smaller than the original gas-soot FSCK look-up table of Wang et al. (2018), with a size of 12.45 GB; (3) The machine learning based-FSCK model is now in stand-alone Fortran modules, which make it easier to be implemented into other CFD platforms. The new model has been successfully implemented in OpenFOAM and tested with two scaled flames. The machine learning based gas-soot FSCK model is publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/ZY-LHY/Machine_learning_based_FSCK_model_soot. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Distribution and relevance of <i>aufeis</i> (icing) in the Upper Indus Basin
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the semi-arid high mountains of the Upper Indus Basin (UIB), meltwater supply from the cryosphere is vital for irrigated agriculture and hydropower generation. An overlooked cryosphere component that is critical for this is aufeis, which appears as a sheet-like formation of ice layers, created by successive and laminated freezing of flowing water. This study aims to redress the lack of knowledge about this phenomenon by creating an inventory of aufeis fields for the UIB and analysing their spatial distribution, including the role of topographical parameters such as altitude, slope, and aspect. The study is based on a time-series analysis using Landsat imagery from 2010 to 2020, supported and validated by several field campaigns carried out between 2014 and 2020. In total, more than 3700 aufeis fields were detected covering an area of about 298 +/- 38 km(2). The spatial distribution of their occurrence indicates a distinct elevation range between 4000 and 5500 m a.s.l. and is marked by a pronounced longitudinal increase to the east. In contrast to the western part of the UIB (Gilgit-Baltistan), where only some few and small aufeis fields can be detected, 65% of the aufeis covered areas (195 +/- 23 km(2)) exist on the Tibetan Plateau. Our database fills an important research gap and will help in further cryosphere studies in the UIB and beyond. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Digital soil mapping of soil organic carbon stocks in Western Ghats, South India
T2  - GEODERMA REGIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial information of soil carbon storage at national and global level is essential for soil quality and environmental management. Improved knowledge on the amount and spatial distribution of the carbon stock in soils is crucial in estimating changes in the terrestrial carbon dynamics and management options for carbon-storing. A study was conducted to map the soil organic carbon stock (SOC) over 56,763 km(2) area of Western Ghats of south India using a digital soil mapping approach. Landsat data, terrain attributes, and bioclimatic variables were used as covariates. Equal-area quadratic splines were fitted to soil profile datasets to estimate soil organic carbon stock at six standard soil depths (0-5, 5-15, 15-30, 30-60, 60-100 and 100-200 cm) and Quantile Regression Forest (QRF) algorithmwas used to predict the SOC stocks. Prediction of SOC stockwas better for surface layer (R-2 = 31-43%) and the performance was decreasing with depth (R-2 = 7-21%). The modal performance was also compared with SoilGrids products. Although the spatial patterns were similar, the present predicted SOC maps outperformed SoilGrids products in terms of both R-2 and RMSE. The predicted total soil organic stock in the Western Ghats ranged from 7.1 kg m(-2) to 30.9 kg m(-2) and the total estimated SOC was 917 Tg. The present high resolution SOC maps help to assess and monitor the soil health and preparation of proper land use planning. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Identifying economically relevant forest types from global satellite data
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data offer a transformative view of global forest resources but observe a highly restricted set of forest attributes, limiting both theoretical and applied research. In response to this problem, we propose the use of ?economic forests? as analytical units and show how key characteristics of forests that determine human decisionmaking can be retrieved by combining open earth observation datasets. To operationalize the economic forest approach, we draw on classical microeconomic theory (von Th?nen?s land use model) to identify two economically relevant variables (market accessibility and forest productivity) that can be proxied in open earth observation data. We then post-process the Global Forest Change dataset (v1.5) to produce wall-to-wall maps of forest harvest for the period 2000?2015, obtain proxy measures of our two variables for a stratified random sample, and classify the resulting dataset of global forest harvest into categories of economic forest using Gaussian Mixture Models. We map the resulting categories, demonstrating a scalable and low-cost approach to analyzing global forest resources which captures key features that determine economic use. We employ this approach to empirically test Hyde?s tripartite typology of global forest resources, circumventing the data challenge posed by the theoretical importance of spatial value functions, and find evidence that an expanded typology is required. We also produce a first approximation of Earth?s economically inaccessible forests, drawing on previous mapping of Intact Forest Landscapes. To demonstrate the value of our approach for knowledgediscovery, we allocate FAOSTAT-reported timber supply for 23 European countries to the categories of economic forests we identify and employ these data to analyze the Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek relationship in forestry. This exercise reveals plausible and significant relationships between production structure and comparative advantage that are obscured by aggregated data, providing direct evidence of the value of our approach. We conclude by discussing potential applications of the economic forests concept.

TI  - Evaluating plant photosynthetic traits via absorption coefficient in the photosynthetically active radiation region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Absorption of radiation in the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) region is significantly influenced by plant biochemistry, structural properties, and photosynthetic pathway. To understand and quantify the effects of these traits on absorbed PAR it is necessary to develop practical and reliable tools that are sensitive to these traits. Using a semi-analytical modeling framework for deriving the absorption coefficient of plant canopies from reflectance spectra, we quantify the effects of functional, structural and biochemical traits of vegetation on the relationship between the absorption coefficient in the PAR region (?par) with canopy characteristics such as the fraction of PAR absorbed by photosynthetically active vegetation (fAPARgreen) and chlorophyll (Chl) content. The reflectance dataset used in the study included simulated data obtained from a canopy reflectance model (PROSAIL) and empirical data on three diverse crop species with different leaf structures, canopy architectures and photosynthetic pathways (rice, maize and soybean) acquired at proximal (i.e., using field spectroradiometers) and remote (i.e., Landsat TM and ETM+) distances. Results show the usefulness of ?par derived from reflectance data for assessing not only the photosynthetic status of vegetation, but also the effects of different functional, structural and biochemical traits on plant performance. Furthermore, these assessments can be made using data acquired by satellite sensor systems such as the Landsat series, which are available since the 1980s, thus facilitating the analysis of the photosynthetic status of terrestrial ecosystems throughout the world with a high temporal depth.

TI  - Assimilation of Remote Sensing Data into Crop Growth Model for Yield Estimation: A Case Study from India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop yield estimation is important to inform logistics management such as the prescription of nutrient inputs, financing, storage and transport, marketing as well as to inform for crop insurance appraisals due to loss incurred by abiotic and biotic stresses. In this study, we used a suite of methods to assess yields at the village level (< 5 km(2)) using remote sensing technology and crop modeling in Indian states of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha. Remote sensing products were generated using Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 time series data and calibrated with data collected from farmers' fields. We derived maps showing spatial variation in crop extent, crop growth stages and leaf area index (LAI), which are crucial in yield assessment. Crop classification was performed on Sentinel-2 time series data using spectral matching techniques (SMTs) and crop management information collected from field surveys along with ground data. The locations of crop cutting experiments (CCEs) was identified based on crop extent maps. LAI was derived based on the SAVI (soil-adjusted vegetation index) equation were using Landsat 8-time series data. We used the technique of re-parametrization of crop simulation models based on the several iterations using remote sensing leaf area index (LAI). The data assimilation approach helps in fine-tuning the initial parameters of the crop growth model and improving simulation with the help of remotely sensed observations. Results clearly show a good correlation between observed and simulated crop yields (R-2 is greater than 0.7) for all the crops studied. Our study showed that by assimilation of remotely sensed data in to crop models, crop yields at harvest could be successfully predicted.

TI  - Machine learning models based on remote and proximal sensing as potential methods for in-season biomass yields prediction in commercial sorghum fields
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop yield monitoring demonstrated the potential to improve agricultural productivity through improved crop breeding, farm management and commodity planning. Remote and proximal sensing offer the possibility to cut crop monitoring costs traditionally associated with surveys and censuses. Fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR), chlorophyll concentration (CI) and normalized difference vegetation (NDVI) indices were used in crop monitoring, but their comparative performances in sorghum monitoring is lacking. This work aimed therefore at closing this gap by evaluating the performance of machine learning modelling of in-season sorghum biomass yields based on Sentinel-2-derived fAPAR and simpler high-throughput optical handheld meters-derived NDVI and CI calculated from sorghum plants reflectance. Bayesian ridge regression showed good cross-validated performance, and high reliability (R-2 = 35%) and low bias (mean absolute prediction error, MAPE = 0.4%) during the validation step. Hand-held optical meter-derived CI and Sentinel-2-derived fAPAR showed comparable effects on machine learning performance, but CI outperformed NDVI and was therefore considered as a good alternative to Sentinel-2's fAPAR. The best times to sample the vegetation indices were the months of June (second half) and July. The results obtained in this work will serve several purposes including improvements in plant breeding, farming management and sorghum biomass yield forecasting at extension services and policy making levels.

TI  - Mortality Risk for Patients With Stage IV Cancer and Acute Illness Hospitalization
T2  - JOURNAL OF PAIN AND SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Context. Cancer prognosis data often come from clinical trials which exclude patients with acute illness.Objectives. For patients with Stage IV cancer and acute illness hospitalization to 1) describe predictors of 60-day mortality and 2) compare documented decision-making for survivors and decedents.Methods. Investigators studied a consecutive prospective cohort of patients with Stage IV cancer and acute illness hospitalization. Structured health record and obituary reviews provided data on 60-day mortality (outcome), demographics, health status, and treatment; logistic regression models identified mortality predictors.Results. Four hundred ninety-two patients with Stage IV cancer and acute illness hospitalization had median age of 60.2 (51% female, 38% minority race/ethnicity); 156 (32%) died within 60 days, and median survival for decedents was 28 days. Nutritional insufficiency (odds rato [OR] 1.83), serum albumin (OR 2.15 per 1.0 g/dL), and hospital days (OR 1.04) were associated with mortality; age, gender, race, cancer, and acute illness type were not predictive. On admission, 79% of patients had orders indicating Full Code. During 60-day follow-up, 42% of patients discussed goals of care. Documented goals of care discussions were more common for decedents than survivors (70% vs. 28%, P < 0.001), as were orders for do not resuscitate/do not intubate (68% vs. 24%, P < 0.001), stopping cancer-directed therapy (29% vs. 10%, P < 0.001), specialty Palliative Care (79% vs. 44%, P < 0.001), and Hospice (68% vs. 14%, P < 0.001).Conclusion. Acute illness hospitalization is a sentinel event in Stage IV cancer. Short-term mortality is high; nutritional decline increases risk. For patients with Stage IV cancer, acute illness hospitalization should trigger goals of care discussions. (C) 2020 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Effect of rating curve hysteresis on flood extent simulation with a 2D hydrodynamic model: A case study of the Inner Niger Delta, Mali, West Africa
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Inner Niger Delta (IND) is a complex hydraulic system where the flood dynamics and connectivity between water bodies is the main driver for ecosystem services and economic activities. Therefore, it is of pivotal importance that hydraulic models used to assess ecosystem services and socio-economic usages in the IND are capable of capturing both the inundation and connectivity dynamics. A particularity of the IND is that a strong hysteresis effect can be observed in the stage-discharge relationships at all hydrometric stations in the area. However, existing hydrodynamic models of the IND typically use a static stage-discharge relationship as the downstream boundary condition during both the rise and recession of the flood, which leads to potential inaccuracies when trying to predict the flood extent. This paper explores how the simulation results of the flood and connectivity dynamics in the IND can be improved by using a looped rating curve at the downstream model boundary. The looped rating curve is described using the dimensionless discharges and water levels (DLRC) method. The results show that simulation with DLRC improves the accuracy in predicting floodplain extent and connectivity dynamics between the Niger river system and an important lake in the IND. The improvement in water level predictions decreased steadily with the distance from the downstream boundary of the modelled area.

TI  - Geospatially analysing the dynamics of the Khurdopin Glacier surge using multispectral and temporal remote sensing and ground observations
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Karakorum glaciers are well known for the advancement and the formation of new glacial lakes due to accelerated climate warming. Its Shimshal valley is profoundly affected by glacier surges in the last couple of decades. Khurdopin glacier is one of the highly surging glaciers in the Karakorum region. Its continuous surge since the nineteenth century is blocking the Shimshal River and creating new lakes. Our objective is to investigate the Khurdopin glacier surge from 1999 to 2017. With this, we aim to identify possible climate and topographic controls on the glacier surge behaviour. We used Landsat 4-5, 7 and 8 satellite bands and ground observations to estimate the glacier retreat and new land cover types from the glacier surge. Our results show that the Khurdopin glacier surges every 20 years. We observed the first surge of 0.69 Km(2) in 2000 and the second surge of 0.63 Km(2) in 2017. Both events blocked the Shimshal River. We observed an increase of 1-4 degrees C in the glacier minimum and maximum winter temperatures. Moreover, we observed snowfall variations in the accumulation zone in the steep glacier slope with a north slope-aspect. The 64% of the glacier aspect is north that causes an increase in ice mass in the accumulation zone by receiving more snowfall in the winter season. The study output, combined with earlier findings, can further predict a surge event in the future.

TI  - The discontinuity between value and price form: tracking the subtraction of the qualitative
T2  - EVOLUTIONARY AND INSTITUTIONAL ECONOMICS REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Ruptures represent the pertinent cause of scientific progress. On the one hand, such "scientific breaks" demarcate one type of scientific discourse from another, while simultaneously always putting in place some specific ideological aspect of the science in question. They consequently suture a determinate scientific totality, one that always reflects and serves the ruling class-be it a worldview or a concrete research programme. The article will attempt to trace the notion of value in different economic discourses to outline the historical discontinuities between them. The subsequent aim is to explore the genealogy of quantitative and qualitative determinations of value (ranging from Smith and Ricardo, through Marx, all the way to the marginalists). We will do this by highlighting a shift in the methodological approach of the object of knowledge-a parallax shift of object-i.e. between the positivist and dialectical grounding of notions. In the first part, the paper tracks the impasses arising from the move to mathematized economics via a "marginalist revolution". In the second and third part, it proceeds with examining the rupture in "objective" and "subjective" aspects of value, reviewing different positions from Marx's value form (as sensuous-supersensuous thing) and A. Amonn's compromise based on the "social" form to F. A. von Hayek's and mainstream economics' embrace of the price form. The article concludes with a reaffirmation of Marx's critique of the specific structure of the capitalist mode of production, one in which the subtraction of the abstract/general ("Real abstraction") is central to a synchronous structure of economic categories. It remains the only genuine critical assessment of such a rupture within the domain of economic scientific strata.

TI  - Mapping multi-layered mangroves from multispectral, hyperspectral, and LiDAR data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding species distribution and canopy structure of mangrove forests is imperative for flora and fauna conservation in mangrove habitats. However, most mangrove studies focused on the top canopy layer without exploring the vertical structure of mangroves. This paper presents multi-layered mangrove mapping which considered both overstory and understory detection and species classification using multispectral WorldView-3 (WV-3) data, airborne hyperspectral images (HSI), and LiDAR point cloud. First, LiDAR returns were stratified into the overstory and understory by analyzing the profile of return height, which helped understand the vertical structure of the mangrove stands. Second, three classification algorithms Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) were compared by applying WV-3, HSI, LiDAR data, and their combinations to map seven vegetative species. Feature selection was conducted to identify important features and the optimal feature size prior to classification tasks. The measured and estimated understory canopy heights reached a high correlation coefficient of 0.71, which demonstrated the effectiveness of using LiDAR data and the proposed procedure to stratify multi-layered canopies. The combined HSI and LiDAR data produced satisfactory results by the three classifiers with overall accuracy (OA) varying from 0.86 to 0.88. And the species was also accurately mapped by integrating WV-3 and LiDAR data using both RF and SVM algorithms with OA attaining between 0.84 and 0.86. The results of this study highlight that (1) LiDAR data provided superior information to map the vertical structure of multi-layered mangroves, which provided valuable information to classify single-layered and dual-layered Kandelia obovata with understory beneath; (2) the combination of spectral and LiDAR features improved mangrove species classification; (3) and species mapping results derived from combined datasets appeared to be more influential by LiDAR features when using RF and SVM, but spectral features played a more important role in CNN.

TI  - Language: The "Ultimate Artifact" to Build, Develop, and Update Worldviews
T2  - TOPOI-AN INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - What role does language play in the process of building worldviews? To address this question, in the first section of this paper we will clarify what we mean by worldviews and how they differ, in our perspective, from cosmovisions. In a nutshell, we define worldviews as the biological interpretations agents create of the world around them and cosmovision the more general cultural-based reflections on it (which, of course, include also agents' worldviews). After presenting our definition for worldview, we will also present the multi-shaped viewpoint that frames our analysis, adopting three concepts that can help us explain how agents construct and develop their worldviews: saliences, pregnances, and abduction. While the notions of saliences and pregnances will explain how agents recognize anomalies in their worldview, the concept of abduction will help us discuss how they can learn to approach, explain, and use these anomalies to get new skills and abilities. This other point will lead us to discuss the role of language in this process, which will be describe as an artifact that permits the agent to use abduction to "normalize" and exploit anomalies, being now the ultimate artifact (for human agents) to build, develop, and update their worldviews.

TI  - Woodrow Wilson and the Spirit of Liberal Internationalism
T2  - POLITICS RELIGION & IDEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Woodrow Wilson is among most influential presidents in U.S. foreign policy history, and the most pious. The challenge for scholars is joining Wilson's faith and his foreign policies. What was the role of religion in Wilson's worldview? What is the place of religion in Wilsonianism? This article uses original archival sources and a synthesis of historical research to intervene in IR theory, demonstrating that Wilsonianism is a product of Wilson's specifically Southern Presbyterian upbringing, his admiration for other Christian idealists, and the influence of the budding movement of the Social Gospel. This finding raises a historiographic puzzle: why did late twentieth century IR scholars erase religion from theories of liberal internationalism? The article suggests Wilson's religion has been erased as part of the broader project of desacralizing and universalizing liberal internationalism. Wilson's worldview was a mirror for the kind of social and political order he witnessed and propagated in America, a Janus-faced spirit of universalism and exceptionalism, internationalism and parochialism, that continues to motivate the liberal internationalist project. Unearthing the Protestant origins of Wilsonianism helps us to explicate the missionary spirit driving the liberal internationalist project.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural drought in a typical semiarid Mediterranean environment is investigated during the growing seasons of 1997 through 2020 using a combination of optical and thermal sensors onboard Landsat satellites. The combination of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index - Land Surface Temperature (NDVI-LST) space was able to distinguish between drought and non-drought years. A distinct trapezoidal shape was clearly defined during non-drought years, reflecting the strong negative correlation between NDVI and LST. The NDVI-LST space was poorly defined for drought-stricken years with no clear link between the two parameters. The non-universal relationship between LST and NDVI was addressed using the Monin-Obukhov similarity formulation which shows that the widely observed convergence of LST at high NDVI values could be explained by the asymptotic nature of LST against surface roughness length for non-stressed vegetation.The NDVI-LST space was compared with seasonal and annual precipitation and different SPI windows to check the ability of the remote sensing metric to identify drought. A high correlation exists between the NDVI-LST space on the one hand and the 9-month, annual precipitation, the SPI-6, SPI-9 and SPI-12 windows, with correlation coefficients of 0.74, 0.76, 0.76, 0.80, and 0.80, respectively, which are statistically significant.

TI  - Performance of the METRIC model for mapping energy balance components and actual evapotranspiration over a superintensive drip-irrigated olive orchard
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A field experiment was performed to evaluate the Mapping Evapotranspiration at High Resolution using Internalized Calibration (METRIC) model that was used for mapping surface energy balance (SEB) components (net radiation (Rni), soil heat flux (Gi), sensible heat flux (Hi), and latent heat flux (LEi)) at times of Landsat satellite overpasses in conjunction with the actual evapotranspiration (ETa) and crop coefficient (Kc) for a superintensive, drip-irrigated olive (Olea europeae L. cv Arbequina) orchard. The orchard is located in the Pencahue Valley, Maule Region, Chile (35 23? LS; 71 44? LW; 96 m above sea level), and the study was conducted on an experimental plot of 21.1 ha during the 2011/2012 and 2012/2013 growing seasons. Model performance was evaluated using measurements of LEi, ETa and Kc that were obtained from an eddy covariance (EC) system. Olivespecific functions for estimating aerodynamic roughness (zom), leaf area index (LAI), and Gi were employed in the METRIC algorithm. In addition, submodels of Rni and Gi were evaluated via ground-truth measurements from a Fritchen-type net radiometer and soil flux plates, respectively. The results indicated that the errors within the METRIC model for the SEB components were between 2% and 5% of the observed values, while those for ETa and Kc were between 4% and 6% of the EC values. In addition, both the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) for the SEB components were less than 46 W?m? 2 at the times of satellite overpass. The RMSE and MAE values for the 24-h ETa were 0.42 and 0.31 mm?day? 1, respectively, while the corresponding values for Kc were 0.09 and 0.02, respectively. The coefficients of variation (CVs) for the SEB components, ETa and Kc were less than 15%, and the largest intraorchard spatial variability occurred for LEi and, thus, ETa. The errors and uncertainties in the SEB and ETa estimates were small enough to warrant application of the METRIC model with olive-specific functions for zom, LAI and Gi to superintensive drip-irrigated olive orchards.

TI  - Uncertainty Assessment in Soil Erosion Modelling Using RUSLE, Multisource and Multiresolution DEMs
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion is a key concern for the environment and natural resources since it leads to a decline in-field productivity and soil quality, resulting in land degradation. In this study, assessment of uncertainty in soil erosion modelling of the Karso watershed, India, was carried out by employing the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) and geospatial technologies to evaluate the effect of multi-source digital elevation models (DEMs) [Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), Cartosat and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM)] with resampled multi-resolution grids. The rainfall erosivity factor (R) was computed using the mean monthly Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission rainfall estimates for 1998 to 2012. The slope length factor was derived using the ASTER and Cartosat DEMs at grid sizes of 30 m, 50 m, 100 m, 150 m, 200 m, and 250 m, and for the SRTM DEM at 100 m, 150 m, 200 m and 250 m resolutions for the Karso watershed, Jharkhand, India. Significant differences were obtained in the soil loss estimates across the different DEM sources and resampled grid sizes. The Cartosat DEM with a 200 m grid was found to estimate the soil loss the best out of all the DEM combinations considered. The Cartosat DEM proved to be more reliable than the ASTER and SRTM DEMs. The results indicated that the RUSLE is a scale-dependent model since the model estimates were affected not only by the DEM source but also by its resolution. The prediction of erosion potential by employing the multisource, multiresolution DEMs and the RUSLE helped to identify the soil erosion's spatial pattern within the watershed. The study provided an impact analysis of the uncertainties when selecting the multisource, multiresolution DEMs for soil erosion modelling.

TI  - A deep learning model for intra-day forecasting of solar irradiance using satellite-based estimations in the vicinity of a PV power plant
T2  - SOLAR ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This work proposes an intra-day forecasting model, which does not require to be trained or fed with real-time data measurements, for global horizontal irradiance (GHI) at a given location. The proposed model uses a series of time-dependant irradiance estimates near the target location as the main input. These estimates are derived from satellite images and are combined with other secondary inputs in an advanced neural network, which features convolutional and dense layers and is trained using a deep learning approach. For the various input combinations, the performance of the model is validated with a quantitative analysis on the forecast accuracy using different error metrics. Accuracies are compared with a commercial solution for irradiance forecasting made by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and publications with similar approaches and forecasting horizons, showing state-of-the-art performance even without irradiance measurements.

TI  - Fine scale infectious disease modeling using satellite-derived data
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Innovative tools for modeling infectious agents are essential for better understanding disease spread given the inherent complexity of changing and interacting ecological, environmental, and demographic factors. We leveraged fine-scale satellite data on urban areas to build a road-connected geospatial network upon which to model disease spread. This model was tested by simulating the spread of the 2009 pandemic influenza in Rwanda and also used to determine the effects of vaccination regimens on outbreak spread and impact. Our results were comparable to data collected during the actual pandemic in Rwanda, determining the initial places affected after outbreak introduction in Kigali. They also highlighted the effectiveness of preventing outbreaks by targeting mitigation efforts at points of outbreak origin. This modeling approach can be valuable for planning and control purposes in real-time disease situations, providing helpful baseline scenarios during initial phases of outbreaks, and can be applied to other infectious diseases where high population mobility promotes rapid disease propagation.

TI  - Comparison of common acute respiratory infection case definitions for identification of hospitalized influenza cases at a population-based surveillance site in Egypt
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Multiple case definitions are used to identify hospitalized patients with community-acquired acute respiratory infections (ARI). We evaluated several commonly used hospitalized ARI case definitions to identify influenza cases.Methods The study included all patients from a population-based surveillance site in Damanhour, Egypt hospitalized for a broad set of criteria consistent with community acquired ARIs. Naso- and oropharyngeal (NP/OP) swabs were tested for influenza using RT-PCR. Sensitivity, specificity and PPV for influenza identification was compared between the 2014 WHO Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) definition (fever >= 38 degrees C and cough with onset within 10 days), the 2011 WHO SARI definition (fever >= 38 degrees C and cough with onset within 7 days), the 2006 PAHO SARI definition, the International Emerging Infections Program (IEIP) pneumonia case definition, and the International Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) case definitions for moderate and severe pneumonia.Results From June 2009-December 2012, 5768 NP/OP swabs were obtained from 6113 hospitalized ARI patients; 799 (13.9%) were influenza positive. The 2014 WHO SARI case definition captured the greatest number of ARI patients, influenza positive patients and ARI deaths compared to the other case definitions examined. Sensitivity for influenza detection was highest for the 2014 WHO SARI definition with 88.6%, compared to the 2011 WHO SARI (78.2%) the 2006 PAHO SARI (15.8%) the IEIP pneumonia (61.0%) and the IMCI moderate and severe pneumonia (33.8% and 38.9%) case definitions (IMCI applies to <5 only).Conclusions Our results support use of the 2014 WHO SARI definition for identifying influenza positive hospitalized SARI cases as it captures the highest proportion of ARI deaths and influenza positive cases. Routine use of this case definition for hospital-based surveillance will provide a solid, globally comparable foundation on which to build needed response efforts for novel pandemic viruses.

TI  - Not only exotic grasslands: The scattered trees in cultivated pastures of the Brazilian Cerrado
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Cultivated pastures occupy 30% of the Brazilian Cerrado. Most pastures have low productivity, demanding intensification. Pasture intensification, as conventionally proposed, promises conservation by land sparing. However, it does not embrace silvopastoral systems, a type of intensification that enhances carbon balance and in situ biodiversity conservation. In the Cerrado, silvopastoral systems would be easily established because pastures with native trees are commonly found in the landscape. In this study, we estimated the density of scattered trees using RapidEye satellite data in 200 cultivated pastures (48,519 ha). We also identified tree species by establishing 93 field plots distributed along 15 ecoregions in the Cerrado biome. We expected that the density of trees would vary in function of farm size, age of the pasture, intensification of pasture management and biophysical variables. Mean scattered tree density was 3.52 tree ha-1 (? 2.93 SD), and it was higher in ecoregions with lower and more concentrated rainfall. The most frequent tree species were those with high commercial values, such as the Myracrodruon urundeuva timber tree (aroeira) and the Caryocar brasiliense fruit tree (pequi). The average above-ground carbon stock of native Cerrado trees in pastures was estimated in 1.2 Mg ha-1 (? 1.2 SD). Our study shows that there are productive pastures with high tree density and species richness, which could be used as models for sustainable intensification strategies in different ecoregions of the Cerrado.

TI  - Assessment of Soil Erosion Susceptibility Based on Morphometric and Landcover Analysis: A Case Study of Netravati River Basin, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we assess the soil erosion susceptibility at the sub-basins scale using remote sensing data with the integration of the Geographical Information System (GIS) for the Netravati river basin in Western Ghats, India. The Cartosat digital elevation model was used for the calculation of morphometric parameters, and Landsat satellite images were used for land cover classification. The whole river basin was divided into five sub-basins for identifying the spatial variation of morphometric parameters and different land use categories. A weighted sum approach (WSA) was used for the ranking of each morphometric parameter and land use types. Then each sub-basin was assigned as very low, low, medium, high, and very high priority ranking. The final prioritization map based on the combined (morphometric and land cover) analysis showed erosion susceptibility is very high for sub-basin 4, high for sub-basin 2, medium for sub-basin 5, low for sub-basin 1, and very low for sub-basin 3. Further, the soil erosion susceptibility analysis has been done separately for morphometric and land cover at the sub-basins scale. The results of this study will be useful for the water resource manager and policymaker while considering the soil erosion-prone areas in the region, and the methodology can be adapted for other river basins.

TI  - Biomarker responses and metabolism in <i>Lumbricus terrestris</i> exposed to drugs of environmental concern, an <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> approach
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The earthworm Lumbricus terrestris is an anecic species living in natural soils but it is also a sentinel in pollution monitoring. Specimens of L. terrestris were exposed for 48 h though the filter paper contact test at 1 mg/mL of the chemicals: Lamotrigine (LMG), Cocaine (COC), Fipronil (FIP) and the pesticide bis-4-nitrophenyl phosphate (BNPP). After that period, the activities of Acetylcholinesterase, Glutathione S-transferase, Carboxylesterase (CE) using different substrates, and lipid peroxidation levels were evaluated in the exposed whole tissue earthworms. The results revealed differences only in CE activity, with 4-nitrophenyl butyrate (4NPB) and 1-naphthyl butyrate (1NB) the most responsive substrates to COC. The kinetic parameters of CE were characterized, for the first time, in whole tissue of this species. The chemical analysis by LC-MS/MS, confirmed the exposure to the parent compounds, identified metabolites and evidenced biotransformation pathways in earthworms. Metabolic reactions included oxidation (LMG and FIP), hydrolysis (COC and FIP) as well as glycosylation (LMG, COC and FIP). A hitherto unknown metabolite of LMG due to the conjugation with phenylalanine glutamine was formed. The in vivo results on CE activity with the specific inhibitor, BNPP, were confirmed in vitro. Moreover, in the in vitro approach, the inclusion of other contaminants of environmental concern supports the potential of CE as biomarker. This study identifies the main metabolites formed by earthworms for further in vivo exposures under more realistic conditions and the potential use of CE measures as biomarker of emerging contaminants.

TI  - Survey of the clinical practice pattern of using sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with gynecological cancers in Japan: the Japan Society of Gynecologic Oncology study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sentinel lymph node (SN) biopsy is essential for evaluating survival and minimal treatment-related morbidity associated with cervical, endometrial, and vulvar cancer in Japan. As such, our aim in this study was to evaluate the current practice pattern of using SN biopsy for cervical, endometrial, and vulvar cancer in Japan. Methods We deployed a 47-question survey on the use of SN biopsy for gynecological cancers to 216 gynecological oncology training facilities. The survey included information on the use of SN biopsy for uterine (cervical and endometrial) and vulvar cancers; details on the type, timing, and concentration of tracers used; surgical approach used for SN biopsy; method of biopsy and pathological examination; and facilities' experience with clinical research on SN biopsy. Results The response rate was 84% (181/216), with 40 facilities (22%) having experience in SN biopsy for gynecological cancers, 34 (85%) for uterine cancers, and 15 (37%) for vulvar cancers. Radioisotope, indocyanine green (ICG), and blue dyes were available for the detection of uterine cancers in 21 (52%), 25 (62%), and 19 (48%) facilities and for vulvar cancers in 9 (22%), 3 (7%), and 11 (27%) facilities, respectively. Thirty-four facilities (85%) used intraoperative frozen section procedure for diagnosis when possible, with 24 (71%) of these facilities using 2-mm specimen cuts. Diagnosis included pathological examination (85%), immunostaining (57%), and one-step nucleic acid amplification (5%). Conclusion Increasing research evidence, providing insurance coverage for radioisotope tracers, and increasing the availability of training are expected to increase the use of SN biopsy in Japan.

TI  - Dangerous Worldview and Perceived Sociopolitical Control: Two Mechanisms to Understand Trust in Authoritarian Political Leaders in Economically Threatening Contexts
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this research we analyzed the relationship between threatening economic contexts (i.e., undergoing the economic crisis and having low socioeconomic status) and trust in authoritarian ideologies and leaders, regardless of the left-right political axis. Based on two theoretical approaches (i.e., the dual-process model and the compensatory control model), we argue that this relationship is mediated by dangerous worldview and low perceived sociopolitical control. We conducted two correlational studies with samples of the general population. In Study 1 (N = 185), we found that perceived threat from the economic crisis and low socioeconomic status were correlated with a higher dangerous worldview, which resulted in a more authoritarian ideology (i.e., authoritarianism) and finally in greater trust in an authoritarian political leader. In Study 2 (N = 413), we replicated the findings of Study 1 and demonstrated that low perceived sociopolitical control was associated with higher authoritarianism. Moreover, low perceived sociopolitical control partially mediated the relationship between dangerous worldview and authoritarianism. Overall, our results show that two economically threatening contexts (i.e., the economic crisis and low socioeconomic status) promote authoritarianism and trust in authoritarian leaders (with unspecified political orientation) through psychological processes (i.e., perception of the social world and perceived control). These results are useful to understand and combat the rise of authoritarianism in our societies during financially difficult times such as economic crises.

TI  - A joint change detection method on complex-valued polarimetric synthetic aperture radar images based on feature fusion and similarity learning
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Existing deep learning-based change detection methods in the field of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (POLSAR) usually directly deal with intensity images. Methods can be easily transferred from optical image processing to synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image processing. However, the polarization information, which is critical in POLSAR data, has been discarded under normal situations. This paper introduces a novel joint change detection network based on similarity learning for coregistered complex-valued SAR data. A pseudo-siamese network takes both amplitude information and polarization information of POLSAR data as the input. The fusion of low-level, middle-level and high-level features enables the network to keep high-resolution and have strong representation ability during training procedures. Our novel sub-networks, which we term C2-Net and Intensity-Net, deal with the covariance matrix of complex SAR data and amplitude SAR data, respectively. The Intensity-Net works as a typical classification network and detects targets directly. The C2-Net attempts to find the relationship between two SAR data patches. An improved cosine similarity function is used to measure the similarity between two generated feature vectors in C2-Net. Output probability vectors of the two sub-networks are combined for final change detection. The two sub-networks are trained jointly and simultaneously. Control experiments show that proposed improvements are working. Experimental results on dual-polarization complex-valued SAR data from Sentinel-1 demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

T2  - JOURNAL OF URBAN HEALTH-BULLETIN OF THE NEW YORK ACADEMY OF MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of the present study was to examine the effects of a confluence of demographic, socioeconomic, housing, and environmental factors that systematically contribute to heat-related morbidity in Maricopa County, Arizona, from theoretical, empirical, and spatial perspectives. The present study utilized ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) to analyze health data, U.S. census data, and remotely sensed data. The results suggested that the MGWR model showed a significant improvement in goodness of fit over the OLS regression model, which implies that spatial heterogeneity is an essential factor that influences the relationship between these factors. Populations of people aged 65+, Hispanic people, disabled people, people who do not own vehicles, and housing occupancy rate have much stronger local effects than other variables. These findings can be used to inform and educate local residents, communities, stakeholders, city managers, and urban planners in their ongoing and extensive efforts to mitigate the negative impacts of extreme heat on human health in Maricopa County.

TI  - The potential impacts of a water transfer project on the groundwater system in the Sugan Lake Basin of China
T2  - HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The ungauged Sugan Lake Basin represents a candidate area for development of a water transfer scheme to satisfy the water requirement of Dunhuang city in northwestern China. In this work, multisource data, including river runoff, groundwater levels and remote-sensing data, and field investigation records, were collected and analyzed. A three-dimensional groundwater flow model was constructed using FEFLOW software to predict the potential influence of the transfer project on the groundwater system. Results show that infiltration from the Great Harten River is the main driving factor of groundwater-level fluctuation and groundwater recharge. Scenario analysis under four water transfer conditions found that the drawdown of groundwater gradually decreases from east to west. If the water transfer scale reaches 1.2 x 10(8) m(3)/a, after 100 years, the maximum drawdown of groundwater is noted at 68.02 m, and the flow rate of the Middle Spring reduces by 25.7%. In the western wetland, the area over which the groundwater level is lowered by more than 4 m is 10.21 km(2), and natural succession may occur or vegetation cover may decline. The results of this study will aid in water resource planning based on a rational amount of water transfer, and provide further protection of the wetland ecology.

TI  - Dual-Polarized SAR Ship Grained Classification Based on CNN With Hybrid Channel Feature Loss
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This letter proposes a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) method for dual-polarized synthetic aperture radar (SAR) ship grained classification. The network employs hybrid channel feature loss that jointly utilizes the information contained in the polarized channels (VV and VH). It is demonstrated that, by adopting the proposed CNN framework and the novel loss function, the classification performance can be efficiently improved. First, instead of the prevalently used threefold or fourfold division (container ship, oil tanker, bulk carrier, and so on), the proposed method can further divide vessels into eight accurate categories. Second, this method can not only effectively classify targets into eight categories but also its accuracy in terms of fewer category classifications surpasses existing methods. Third, the method can achieve good performance on a small training data set. Experiments conducted on the OpenSARShip data sets indicate that the proposed classification method achieves state-of-the-art results.

TI  - Analyzing the spatiotemporal pattern and driving factors of wetland vegetation changes using 2000-2019 time-series Landsat data
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Probing the long-term spatiotemporal patterns of wetland vegetation changes and their response to climate change and human activities is critical to make informed decisions regarding ecosystem protection. Here, the spatiotemporal patterns and factors that drive vegetation changes in the Dongting Lake wetland from 2000 to 2019 were analyzed using monthly normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data at a 30 m spatial resolution. First, abrupt vegetation changes were identified using the breaks for additive season and trend approach. Moreover, the relative impacts of climatic factors on monthly vegetation changes were quantified using a partial correlation-based approach, and the effects of three specific climatic factors (temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation) and human factors on vegetation recovery and degradation were determined. Our study found that: 1) the study area is becoming greener, with NDVI increases of 0.006 per year; however, there was a pronounced interannual variation in the vegetation types; 2) more than 50% of the vegetation pixels exhibited at least two breakpoints, with similar to 5% of the vegetation pixels exhibiting eight breakpoints; 3) in the past 20 years, human activities have favored wetland vegetation recovery (58.85%), whereas climate change threatens wetland vegetation (59.19%). Regarding climate factors, the influence of solar radiation on vegetation was found to be stronger than that of temperature and precipitation. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Three-dimensional spatiotemporal evolution of wildfire-induced smoke aerosols: A case study from Liangshan, Southwest China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbonaceous aerosols and gaseous pollutants emitted from wildfires play a crucial role in both the global climate system and regional air quality. Here, using multisource satellite and ground-based observations combined with reanalysis data, we investigate the three-dimensional evolution of biomass-burning emissions from a forest wildfire event in Liangshan, Southwest China, which occurred from 29 March to 1 April 2020. The meteorological field analysis showed that the negative anomaly of relative humidity and precipitation, as well as the positive anomaly of near-surface wind speed, created favourable conditions for the occurrence and spread of this wildfire event. During the fire, satellite observations suggested a maximum fire radiation power of over 100 MW. In addition, there were significant short-term effects of fire activity on regional air quality, with downwind surface PM2.5 concentrations at the Xichang site reaching a maximum of approximately 470 mu g.m(-3) on March 31. Driven by a southwesterly airflow, large amounts of smoke aerosols were transported rapidly to downstream areas, significantly deteriorating air quality, with the maximum value of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) exceeding 2. Moreover, the quantitative evaluation based on Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) reanalysis showed that the instantaneous maximum values of the column mass concentration of black carbon (BC) and organic carbon (OC) reached 9.8 g.m(-2) and 1.8 g.m(-2) during the fire respectively. Further analysis suggested that the interaction between the lower and upper atmosphere constrained the smoke aerosols to altitudes below approximately 5 km, which was also supported by the vertical distribution of elevated smoke aerosols observed by the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP).

TI  - Sentinel SAR-optical fusion for crop type mapping using deep learning and Google Earth Engine
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate crop type mapping provides numerous benefits for a deeper understanding of food systems and yield prediction. Ever-increasing big data, easy access to high-resolution imagery, and cloud-based analytics platforms like Google Earth Engine have drastically improved the ability for scientists to advance data-driven agriculture with improved algorithms for crop type mapping using remote sensing, computer vision, and machine learning. Crop type mapping techniques mainly relied on standalone SAR and optical imagery, few studies investigated the potential of SAR-optical data fusion, coupled with virtual constellation, and 3-dimensional (3D) deep learning networks. To this extent, we use a deep learning approach that utilizes the denoised backscatter and texture information from multi-temporal Sentinel-1 SAR data and the spectral information from multi-temporal optical Sentinel-2 data for mapping ten different crop types, as well as water, soil and urban area. Multi-temporal Sentinel-1 data was fused with multi-temporal optical Sentinel-2 data in an effort to improve classification accuracies for crop types. We compared the results of the 3D U-Net to the state-of-the-art deep learning networks, including SegNet and 2D U-Net, as well as commonly used machine learning method such as Random Forest. The results showed (1) fusing multi-temporal SAR and optical data yields higher training overall accuracies (OA) (3D U-Net 0.992, 2D U-Net 0.943, SegNet 0.871) and testing OA (3D U-Net 0.941, 2D U-Net 0.847, SegNet 0.643) for crop type mapping compared to standalone multi-temporal SAR or optical data (2) optical data fused with denoised SAR data via a denoising convolution neural network (OA 0.912) performed better for crop type mapping compared to optical data fused with boxcar (OA 0.880), Lee (OA 0.881), and median (OA 0.887) filtered SAR data and (3) 3D convolutional neural networks perform better than 2D convolutional neural networks for crop type mapping (SAR OA 0.912, optical OA 0.937, fused OA 0.992).

TI  - Water Vapor Tomography of the Lower Atmosphere from Multiparametric Inversion: the Mt. Etna Volcano Test Case
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Space techniques based on GPS and SAR interferometry allow measuring millimetric ground deformations. Achieving such accuracy means removing atmospheric anomalies that frequently affect volcanic areas by modeling the tropospheric delays. Due to the prominent orography and the high spatial and temporal variability of weather conditions, the active volcano Mt. Etna (Italy) is particularly suitable to carry out research aimed at estimating and filtering atmospheric effects on GPS and DInSAR ground deformation measurements. The aim of this work is to improve the accuracy of the ground deformation measurements by modeling the tropospheric delays at Mt. Etna volcano. To this end, data from the monitoring network of 29 GPS permanent stations and MODIS multispectral satellite data series are used to reproduce the tropospheric delays affecting interferograms. A tomography algorithm has been developed to reproduce the wet refractivity field over Mt. Etna in 3D, starting from the slant tropospheric delays calculated by GPS in all the stations of the network. The developed algorithm has been tested on a synthetic atmospheric anomaly. The test confirms the capability of the software to faithfully reconstruct the simulated anomaly. With the aim of applying this algorithm to real cases, we introduce the water vapor content measured by the MODIS instrument on board Terra and Aqua satellites. The use of such data, although limited by cloud cover, provides a two-fold benefit: it improves the tomographic resolution and adds feedback for the GPS wet delay measurements. A cross-comparison between GPS and MODIS water vapor measurements for the first time shows a fair agreement between those indirect measurements on an entire year of data (2015). The tomography algorithm was applied on selected real cases to correct the Sentinel-1 DInSAR interferograms acquired over Mt. Etna during 2015. Indeed, the corrected interferograms show that the differential path delay reaches 0.1 m (i.e. 3 C-band fringes) in ground deformation, demonstrating how the atmospheric anomaly affects precision and reliability of DInSAR space-based techniques. The real cases show that the tomography is often able to capture the atmospheric effect at the large scale and correct interferograms, although in limited areas. Furthermore, the introduction of MODIS data significantly improves by similar to 80% voxel resolution at the critical layer (1,000 m). Further improvements will be suitable for monitoring active volcanoes worldwide.

TI  - Predicting gross primary productivity and PsnNet over a mixed ecosystem under tropical seasonal variability: a comparative study between different machine learning models and correlation-based statistical approaches
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The global interaction of CO2 flux was highly dynamic under seasonal and inter-annual variability. Thus, precise estimation of gross primary productivity (GPP) and net photosynthesis (PsnNet) under seasonal variations was important to understand the global carbon cycle and ecosystem response to climate variability. Considering this significance, in our paper, we have conducted a comparative investigation of correlation (i.e., Pearson product, Spearman rank, and Kendall rank) and supervised machine learning models (i.e., random forest, conditional inference forests, and quantile regression forests) to explore the agreement and prediction of GPP and PsnNet under seasonal variability from spectral indices, tasseled cap transformations, and reflectances over a mixed ecosystem assembling moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer and Landsat data. Associated uncertainties and errors have been also compared. Our study was carried out in a tropical moist ecosystem under pre-monsoon (March) and postmonsoon (October) conditions. Overall outcome revealed that seasonal differentiation does not affect the simple correlations; however, it has a significant impact on the GPP/PsnNet prediction process. Near-infrared (NIR)-based spectral indices have been found with the best agreements and statistically significant (p < 0.001) for GPP/PsnNet during March and October ranging coefficients from 0.85 to 0.44 in all three correlation models. However, Landsat 8 OLI band reflectances in different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum have gained importance as best predictors during March, whereas NIR-based indices have been found as best predictors for GPP/PsnNet during October. We have found that anomalies in environmental and meteorological conditions have a strong impact on plant functional activities that significantly differs prediction process rather than simple correlations.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node mapping for endometrial and cervical cancer in Denmark.
T2  - Danish medical journal
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This was a surgical pilot study to systematically introduce the technique of sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping in women with early-stage stage cervical cancer (CC) and endometrial cancer (EC) in Denmark. The study aimed to facilitate structured surgical training to ensure surgeon proficiency in SLN mapping. The study precedes two national prospective studies on the oncological safety and correct patient selection for SLN mapping in CC and EC.METHODS: The study was conducted at four gynaecological cancer centres at Odense and Aarhus University Hospital, Rigshospitalet and Herlev Hospital, between September 2016 and August 2019. All centres went through a protocolled introduction to the surgical technique, pelvic lymphatic drainage, pathological ultra-staging and data entry. A criterion of a total (uni- and bilateral) SLN detection of > 80%, based on 30 SLN mappings was set.RESULTS: The four centres performed 140 (range: 30-46) procedures. The total SLN detection rate was 91.3% with bilateral SLN detection in 68.8% and unilateral SLN detection in 22.5% of cases. The cumulated total SLN detection rate at three centres was above the pre-set 80% criterion from the beginning of inclusion, whereas one centre reached the criterion after 20 procedures.CONCLUSIONS: In this study, all centres demonstrated international-level SLN detection rates within 30 procedures. Hence, all centres met the study criterion regarding surgeon proficiency and were eligible for the national studies.FUNDING: Eva and Henry Frankels Fond, Frimodt-Heineke Fonden, Kong Christian X Fond.TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency (R. no.15/52037). The SENTIREC studies including this pilot study are registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02825355 and NCT02820506).

TI  - Rainfall Algorithms Using Oceanic Satellite Observations from MWHS-2
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes three algorithms for retrieving precipitation over oceans from brightness temperatures (TBs) of the Micro-Wave Humidity Sounder-2 (MHWS-2) onboard Fengyun-3C (FY-3C). For algorithm development, scattering-induced TB depressions (Delta TBs) of MWHS-2 at channels between 89 and 190 GHz were collocated to rain rates derived from measurements of the Global Precipitation Measurement's Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) for the year 2017. Delta TBs were calculated by subtracting simulated cloud-free TBs from bias-corrected observed TBs for each channel. These Delta TBs were then related to rain rates from DPR using (1) multilinear regression (MLR); the other two algorithms, (2) range searches (RS) and (3) nearest neighbor searches (NNS), are based on k-dimensional trees. While all three algorithms produce instantaneous rain rates, the RS algorithm also provides the probability of precipitation and can be understood in a Bayesian framework. Different combinations of MWHS-2 channels were evaluated using MLR and results suggest that adding 118 GHz improves retrieval performance. The optimal combination of channels excludes high-peaking channels but includes 118 GHz channels peaking in the mid and high troposphere. MWHS-2 observations from another year were used for validation purposes. The annual mean 2.5 degrees x 2.5 degrees gridded rain rates from the three algorithms are consistent with those from the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) and DPR. Their correlation coefficients with GPCP are 0.96 and their biases are less than 5%. The correlation coefficients with DPR are slightly lower and the maximum bias is similar to 8%, partly due to the lower sampling density of DPR compared to that of MWHS-2.

TI  - High-resolution global map of smallholder and industrial closed-canopy oil palm plantations
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Oil seed crops, especially oil palm, are among the most rapidly expanding agricultural land uses, and their expansion is known to cause significant environmental damage. Accordingly, these crops often feature in public and policy debates which are hampered or biased by a lack of accurate information on environmental impacts. In particular, the lack of accurate global crop maps remains a concern. Recent advances in deep-learning and remotely sensed data access make it possible to address this gap. We present a map of closed-canopy oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) plantations by typology (industrial versus smallholder plantations) at the global scale and with unprecedented detail (10m resolution) for the year 2019. The DeepLabv3+ model, a convolutional neural network (CNN) for semantic segmentation, was trained to classify Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images onto an oil palm land cover map. The characteristic backscatter response of closed-canopy oil palm stands in Sentinel-1 and the ability of CNN to learn spatial patterns, such as the harvest road networks, allowed the distinction between industrial and smallholder plantations globally (overall accuracy = 98.52 +/- 0.20%), outperforming the accuracy of existing regional oil palm datasets that used conventional machine-learning algorithms. The user's accuracy, reflecting commission error, in industrial and smallholders was 88.22 +/- 2.73% and 76.56 +/- 4.53%, and the producer's accuracy, reflecting omission error, was 75.78 +/- 3.55% and 86.92 +/- 5.12 %, respectively. The global oil palm layer reveals that closed-canopy oil palm plantations are found in 49 countries, covering a mapped area of 19.60 Mha; the area estimate was 21.00 +/- 0.42 Mha (72.7% industrial and 27.3% smallholder plantations). Southeast Asia ranks as the main producing region with an oil palm area estimate of 18.69 +/- 0.33 Mha or 89% of global closed-canopy plantations. Our analysis confirms significant regional variation in the ratio of industrial versus smallholder growers, but it also confirms that, from a typical land development perspective, large areas of legally defined smallholder oil palm resemble industrial-scale plantings. Since our study identified only closed-canopy oil palm stands, our area estimate was lower than the harvested area reported by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), particularly in West Africa, due to the omission of young and sparse oil palm stands, oil palm in nonhomogeneous settings, and semi-wild oil palm plantations. An accurate global map of planted oil palm can help to shape the ongoing debate about the environmental impacts of oil seed crop expansion, especially if other crops can be mapped to the same level of accuracy. As our model can be regularly rerun as new images become available, it can be used to monitor the expansion of the crop in monocultural settings. The global oil palm layer for the second half of 2019 at a spatial resolution of 10m can be found at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4473715 (Descals et al., 2021).

TI  - A multi-sourced assessment of the spatiotemporal dynamics of soil moisture in the MARINE flash flood model
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The MARINE (Model of Anticipation of Runoff and INundations for Extreme events) hydrological model is a distributed model dedicated to flash flood simulation. Recent developments of the MARINE model are explored in this work. On one hand, transfers of water through the subsurface, formerly relying on water height, now take place in a homogeneous soil column based on the soil saturation degree (SSF model). On the other hand, the soil column is divided into two layers, which represent, respectively, the upper soil layer and the deep weathered rocks (SSF-DWF model). The aim of the present work is to assess the accuracy of these new representations for the simulation of soil moisture during flash flood events. An exploration of the various products available in the literature for soil moisture estimation is performed. The efficiency of the models for soil saturation degree simulation is estimated with respect to several products either at the local scale or spatially distributed: (i) the gridded soil moisture product provided by the operational modeling chain SAFRAN-ISBA-MODCOU; (ii) the gridded soil moisture product provided by the LDAS-Monde assimilation chain, which is based on the ISBA-A-gs land surface model and assimilating satellite derived data; (iii) the upper soil water content hourly measurements taken from the SMOSMANIA observation network; and (iv) the Soil Water Index provided by the Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS), which is derived from Sentinel-1 C-SAR and AS-CAT satellite data. The case study is performed over two French Mediterranean catchments impacted by flash flood events over the 2017-2019 period. The local comparison of the MARINE outputs with the SMOSMANIA measurements, as well as the comparison at the basin scale of the MARINE outputs with the gridded LDAS-Monde and CGLS data, lead to the following conclusion: both the dynamics and the amplitudes of the soil saturation degree simulated with the SSF and SSF-DWF models are better correlated with both the SMOSMANIA measurements and the LDAS-Monde data than the outputs of the base model. Finally, the soil saturation degree simulated by the two-layers model for the deep layer is compared to the soil saturation degree provided by the LDAS-Monde product at corresponding depths. In conclusion, the developments presented for the representation of subsurface flow in the MARINE model enhance the soil saturation degree simulation during flash floods with respect to both gridded data and local soil moisture measurements.

TI  - Rumors of restoration: Joe Biden's foreign policy and what it means for Canada
T2  - CANADIAN FOREIGN POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The election of Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential elections suggests a return to "normal" foreign relations after the dramatic four years of Donald Trump's presidency. This paper asks two questions: what will Biden's foreign policy look like? And what are its implications for Canada. Fundamentally, Biden aims to restore the status quo ante Trump in US foreign policy while also adjusting to a world has irreversibly changed. This paper outlines the parameters of Biden's nascent foreign policy using a seven-point framework focusing on worldview, (2) problem definition, (3) approach to international order; (4) security; (5) economics; (6) values; and (7) personality and decision-making process. For Canada, Biden's election relieves the immediate upheavals of Donald Trump's presidency, but it does not necessarily clarify Canada's foreign policy outlook. Canada still must establish its relative priorities between the continent that is the foundation of its prosperity and security, and the internationalism that is the vehicle of Canada's international identity and influence.

TI  - Monitoring of COVID-19 by extending existing surveillance for acute respiratory infections
T2  - BUNDESGESUNDHEITSBLATT-GESUNDHEITSFORSCHUNG-GESUNDHEITSSCHUTZ
M3  - Article
AB  - As part of the national influenza pandemic preparedness, surveillance systems have been established in Germany in addition to the mandatory notifications according to the Protection Against Infection Act. The aim of these systems is the description, analysis, and evaluation of the epidemiology of acute respiratory infections (ARIs), the identification of the circulating viruses, and the trend. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the systems have been expanded to enable monitoring of infections with SARS-CoV-2. Three systems are presented: GrippeWeb, the primary care sentinel Arbeitsgemeinschaft Influenza with its electronic reporting module SEEDARE, and the ICD-10-based hospital sentinel ICOSARI. With these systems, ARIs can be monitored at the population, outpatient, and inpatient levels. In combination with the monitoring of mortality, these systems provide important information on the frequency of different stages of disease severity in the population. In order to expand the systems to SARS-CoV-2, only a few adjustments were needed. As the case definitions for ARIs were preserved, historical baselines of the systems can still be used for comparison. All systems are structured in such a way that stable and established reference values are available for calculating weekly proportions and rates. This is an important addition to the mandatory reporting system of infectious diseases in Germany, which depends on the particular testing strategy, the number of tests performed, and on specific case definitions, which are adapted as required. The surveillance systems have proven to be feasible and efficient in the COVID-19 pandemic, even when compared internationally.

TI  - Evaluation of the status of land use/land cover change using remote sensing and GIS in Jewha Watershed, Northeastern Ethiopia
T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaluation of land use/land cover (LULC) status of watersheds is vital to environmental management. This study was carried out in Jewha watershed, which is found in the upper Awash River basin of central Ethiopia. The total catchment area is 502 km(2). All climatic zones of Ethiopia, including lowland arid ('Kola'), midland semi-arid ('Woinadega'), humid highland (Dega) and afro alpine ('Wurch') can be found in the watershed. The study focused on LULC classification and change detection using GIS and remote sensing techniques by analyzing satellite images. The data preprocessing and post-process was done using multi-temporal spectral satellite data. The images were used to evaluate the temporal trends of the LULC class by considering the years 1984, 1995, 2005 and 2015. Accuracy assessment and change detection of the classification were undertaken by accounting these four years images. The land use types in the study area were categorized into six classes: natural forest, plantation forest, cultivated land, shrub land, grass land and bare land. The result shows the cover classes which has high environmental role such as forest and shrub has decreased dramatically through time with cultivated land increasing during the same period in the watershed. The forest cover in 1984 was about 6.5% of the total catchment area, and it had decreased to 4.2% in 2015. In contrast, cultivated land increased from 38.7% in 1984 to 51% in 2015. Shrub land decreased from 28 to 18% in the same period. Bare land increased due to high gully formation in the catchment. In 1984, it was 1.8% which turned to 0.6% in 1995 then increased in 2015 to 2.7%. Plantation forest was not detected in 1984. In 1995, it covers 1.5% which turned to be the same in 2015. The study clearly demonstrated that there are significant changes of land use and land cover in the catchment. The findings will allow making informed decision which will allow better land use management and environmental conservation interventions.

AB  - Introduction: Pelvic lymph node dissection has been the standard of care for patients with early cervical cancer. Sentinel node (SN) mapping is safe and feasible and may increase the detection of metastatic disease, but benefits of omitting pelvic lymph node dissection in terms of decreased morbidity have not been demonstrated.Materials and methods: In an open-label study, patients with early cervical carcinoma (FIGO 2009 stage IA2 to IIA1) were randomly assigned to SN resection alone (SN arm) or SN and pelvic lymph node dissection (SN + PLND arm). SN resection was followed by radical surgery of the tumour (radical hysterectomy or radical trachelectomy). The primary end-point was morbidity related to the lymph node dissection; 3-year recurrence-free survival was a secondary end-point.Results: A total of 206 patients were eligible and randomly assigned to the SN arm (105 patients) or SN + PLND arm (101 patients). Most patients had stage IB1 lesion (87.4%). No false-negative case was observed in SN + PLND arm. Lymphatic morbidity was significantly lower in the SN arm (31.4%) than in the SN + PLND arm (51.5%; p = 0.0046), as was the rate of postoperative neurological symptoms (7.8% vs. 20.6%, p = 0.01, respectively). However, there was no significant difference in the proportion of patients with significant lymphoedema between the two groups. During the 6-month postoperative period, the difference in morbidity decreased over time. The 3-year recurrence-free survival was not significantly different (92.0% in SN arm and 94.4% in SN + PLND arm).Conclusion: SN resection alone is associated with early decreased lymphatic morbidity when compared with SN + PLND in early cervical cancer.

TI  - Despeckling Polarimetric SAR Data Using a Multistream Complex-Valued Fully Convolutional Network
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - A polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) sensor is able to collect images in different polarization states, making it a rich source of information for target characterization. PolSAR images are inherently affected by speckle. Therefore, before deriving ad hoc products from the data, the polarimetric covariance matrix needs to be estimated by reducing speckle. In recent years, deep learning-based despeckling methods have started to evolve from single-channel SAR images to PolSAR images. To this aim, deep learning-based approaches separate the real and imaginary components of the complex-valued covariance matrix and use them as independent channels in standard convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, this approach neglects the mathematical relationship that exists between the real and imaginary components, resulting in suboptimal output. Here, we propose a multistream complex-valued fully convolutional network (FCN) (CV-deSpeckNet1) to reduce speckle and effectively estimate the PolSAR covariance matrix. To evaluate the performance of CV-deSpeckNet, we used Sentinel-1 dual polarimetric SAR images to compare against its real-valued counterpart that separates the real and imaginary parts of the complex covariance matrix. CV-deSpeckNet was also compared against the state of the art PolSAR despeckling methods. The results show that CV-deSpeckNet was able to be trained with a fewer number of samples, has a higher generalization capability, and resulted in higher accuracy than its real-valued counterpart and state-of-the-art PolSAR despeckling methods. These results showcase the potential of complex-valued deep learning for PolSAR despeckling.

TI  - Integrated approach for effective debris mapping in glacierized regions of Chandra River Basin, Western Himalayas, India
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The mapping of debris in glacierized terrain is required for managing the water resources, glacier mass-balance studies and the monitoring of glacier health. Two types of debris i.e. Supraglacial debris (SGD) and periglacial debris (PGD) are derived from the same source i.e., surrounding valley rock and have similar reflectance which makes it difficult to differentiate between them. Hence, in this study a novel integrated approach is proposed where spectral information and thermal data from Landsat 8 Satellite image in conjunction with geomorphometric and topographic parameters extracted from SRTM DEM are utilized to classify SGD and PGD along with other dasses in Chandra River Basin (CRB) covering the area of 2422.1 km(2) in western Himalayas. Nearly one fourth of the study area is glacierized region while SGD and PGD cover nearly 7% of the study area. Accuracy of the classified data is assessed through comparison with manually digitized data set and minimal difference in area is observed. Results are validated with high resolution (10 m) Sentinel 2a image and data collected from field observations. The SGD is precisely demarcated with 93% accuracy with an overall 83.50% accuracy of classification. Thus, this work presents an efficient, better and prompt method for classifying glacierized areas more effectively than manual delineation at basin/sub-basin level. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Sugar provisioning for ants enhances biological control of mealybugs in citrus
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - In many agroecosystems, the implementation of an integrated pest management (IPM) program against mealybugs (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae) is undermined by the presence of ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae). In a mutualistic association, ants obtain carbohydrates from the mealybugs in the form of honeydew and, in exchange, protect the mealybugs against their natural enemies. Ants however also need protein in their diet. Thus, they can also prey on the mealybugs, especially when their carbohydrates requirements are met. This study aims to assess whether providing ants with sugar-feeders (representing ad libitum sources of carbohydrates) i) alters their mutualistic relationships with the mealybugs (ant tending), ii) increases the parasitism of mealybugs, iii) increases ant predation rate and iv) alters the protein and carbohydrate profile in ant workers. For this study, we selected a citrus orchard with high infestation levels of the mealybug Planoccocus citri tended by the ant Lasius grandis. Our results showed that sugar provisioning reduced ant activity and ant tending, resulting in an increase of mealybug parasitism rates. Ants showed a tendency to prey more sentinel preys in trees with sugar-feeders, even though the differences were not significant. The gut content in terms of carbohydrates and proteins of ant workers did not differ among trees with and without sugar-feeders. Overall, our results show that sugar provisioning can be used for improving pest management strategies against mealybugs; while further research is necessary to corroborate that predation by ants of honeydew producers increases when sugar-feeders are provided.

TI  - Challenges in predicting Greenland supraglacial lake drainages at the regional scale
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - A leading hypothesis for the mechanism of fast supraglacial lake drainages is that transient extensional stresses briefly allow crevassing in otherwise compressional ice flow regimes. Lake water can then hydrofracture a crevasse to the base of the ice sheet, and river inputs can maintain this connection as a moulin. If future ice sheet models are to accurately represent moulins, we must understand their formation processes, timescales, and locations. Here, we use remote-sensing velocity products to constrain the relationship between strain rates and lake drainages across similar to 1600 km(2) in Pakitsoq, western Greenland, between 2002-2019. We find significantly more extensional background strain rates at moulins associated with fast-draining lakes than at slow-draining or non-draining lake moulins. We test whether moulins in more extensional background settings drain their lakes earlier, but we find insignificant correlation. To investigate the frequency at which strain-rate transients are associated with fast lake drainage, we examined Landsat-derived strain rates over 16 and 32 d periods at moulins associated with 240 fast-lake-drainage events over 18 years. A low signal-to-noise ratio, the presence of water, and the multi-week repeat cycle obscured any resolution of the hypothesized transient strain rates. Our results support the hypothesis that transient strain rates drive fast lake drainages. However, the current generation of ice sheet velocity products, even when stacked across hundreds of fast lake drainages, cannot resolve these transients. Thus, observational progress in understanding lake drainage initiation will rely on field-based tools such as GPS networks and photogrammetry.

TI  - GARP transcription factors repress Arabidopsis nitrogen starvation response via ROS-dependent and -independent pathways
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Plants need to cope with strong variations of nitrogen availability in the soil. Although many molecular players are being discovered concerning how plants perceive NO3- provision, it is less clear how plants recognize a lack of nitrogen. Following nitrogen removal, plants activate their nitrogen starvation response (NSR), which is characterized by the activation of very high-affinity nitrate transport systems (NRT2.4 and NRT2.5) and other sentinel genes involved in N remobilization such as GDH3. Using a combination of functional genomics via transcription factor perturbation and molecular physiology studies, we show that the transcription factors belonging to the HHO subfamily are important regulators of NSR through two potential mechanisms. First, HHOs directly repress the high-affinity nitrate transporters, NRT2.4 and NRT2.5. hho mutants display increased high-affinity nitrate transport activity, opening up promising perspectives for biotechnological applications. Second, we show that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are important to control NSR in wild-type plants and that HRS1 and HHO1 overexpressors and mutants are affected in their ROS content, defining a potential feed-forward branch of the signaling pathway. Taken together, our results define the relationships of two types of molecular players controlling the NSR, namely ROS and the HHO transcription factors. This work (i) up opens perspectives on a poorly understood nutrient-related signaling pathway and (ii) defines targets for molecular breeding of plants with enhanced NO3- uptake.

TI  - CMEMS-Based Coastal Analyses: Conditioning, Coupling and Limits for Applications
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent advances in numerical modeling, satellite data, and coastal processes, together with the rapid evolution of CMEMS products and the increasing pressures on coastal zones, suggest the timeliness of extending such products toward the coast. The CEASELESS EU H2020 project combines Sentinel and in-situ data with high-resolution models to predict coastal hydrodynamics at a variety of scales, according to stakeholder requirements. These predictions explicitly introduce land discharges into coastal oceanography, addressing local conditioning, assimilation memory and anisotropic error metrics taking into account the limited size of coastal domains. This article presents and discusses the advances achieved by CEASELESS in exploring the performance of coastal models, considering model resolution and domain scales, and assessing error generation and propagation. The project has also evaluated how underlying model uncertainties can be treated to comply with stakeholder requirements for a variety of applications, from storm-induced risks to aquaculture, from renewable energy to water quality. This has led to the refinement of a set of demonstrative applications, supported by a software environment able to provide met-ocean data on demand. The article ends with some remarks on the scientific, technical and application limits for CMEMS-based coastal products and how these products may be used to drive the extension of CMEMS toward the coast, promoting a wider uptake of CMEMS-based predictions.

TI  - Mitotic rate in node-positive stage III melanoma: it might be as important a prognostic factor as node number
T2  - JAPANESE JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Stage III melanoma is a heterogenous disease, and the number of tumor-involved lymph nodes is the most significantly unfavorable prognostic indicator for relapse and outcome. The aim of this study is to investigate the possible effects of the various clinicopathological factors on the course of node-positive stage III disease.Methods: A total of 389 node-positive stage III cutaneous melanomas were included in the study and analyzed retrospectively. All underwent pathological nodal staging by sentinel lymph node biopsy or elective lymph node dissection.Results: The group was male-dominant (59%) and the median age was 50 years. The largest group of patients was N1 (n = 221, 56.8%) followed by N2 (n = 105, 27.0%) and N3 (n = 63, 16.2%). N1 melanomas were less frequently associated with relapses than melanomas with multiple lymph node metastases (P = 0.05). The 5-year relapse-free survival rate was 37.9%. The melanomas with multiple lymph nodes metastases (P = 0.01), higher mitotic rate (P = 0.005) and ulceration (P = 0.02) had worse RFS. In the multivariate analysis only the significances of the N2-N3 stage (P = 0.016) and higher mitosis (P = 0.012) persisted. The severe lymph node metastasis (N2-N3) was associated with a higher mortality rate in comparison with the single nodal involvement (P = 0.05). The 5-year overall survival rate was 52.1%. Presence of relapse (P = 0.0001), higher mitotic rate (P = 0.03) and N2-N3 stage (P = 0.04) were inversely correlated with the overall survival. When relapse was included in the multivariate analysis, it was the only significant prognostic factor on survival (P = 0.0001), whereas mitosis became the only significant factor on survival with the exclusion of relapse from the multivariate analysis (P = 0.031).Conclusion: In node-positive stage III melanoma, tumor mitotic rate might be just as significant a prognostic indicator as the metastatic lymph node number.

TI  - The value of ASCAT soil moisture and MODIS snow cover data for calibrating a conceptual hydrologic model
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent advances in soil moisture remote sensing have produced satellite data sets with improved soil moisture mapping under vegetation and with higher spatial and temporal resolutions. In this study, we evaluate the potential of a new, experimental version of the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) soil water index data set for multiple objective calibrations of a conceptual hydrologic model. The analysis is performed in 213 catchments in Austria for the period 2000-2014. An HBV (Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenbalansavdelning)-type hydrologic model is calibrated based on runoff data, ASCAT soil moisture data, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow cover data for various calibration variants. Results show that the inclusion of soil moisture data in the calibration mainly improves the soil moisture simulations, the inclusion of snow data mainly improves the snow simulations, and the inclusion of both of them improves both soil moisture and snow simulations to almost the same extent. The snow data are more efficient at improving snow simulations than the soil moisture data are at improving soil moisture simulations. The improvements of both runoff and soil moisture model efficiencies are larger in low elevation and agricultural catchments than in others. The calibrated snow-related parameters are strongly affected by including snow data and, to a lesser extent, by soil moisture data. In contrast, the soil-related parameters are only affected by the inclusion of soil moisture data. The results indicate that the use of multiple remote sensing products in hydrological modeling can improve the representation of hydrological fluxes and prediction of runoff hydrographs at the catchment scale.

T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose This study aimed to assess the efficacy of the combination of indocyanine green (ICG) and methylene blue (MB) dye in early breast cancer patients undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). Methods Between January 2011 and December 2015, 1061 early breast cancer patients underwent SLNB were included. SLNB was performed for enrolled patients by injection of both ICG and MB. Detection rate, positivity, and number of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) by ICG and MB were analysed. Axillary recurrence and arm lymphedema at 5.6-year follow-up were reported. Results The combination of ICG and MB resulted in a very high detection rate of 99.6%, the median number of sentinel lymph nodes was 3. A total of 374 histologically confirmed positive SLNs were detected in 237 patients, 96.6% of the positive patients and 94.1% of the positive nodes could be identified by the combination of ICG and MB. After a median follow-up of 5.6 (2-9.3) years, 0.64% of patients with negative SLNs had ipsilateral axillary recurrence, and the incidence of arm lymphedema was 2.1%. Conclusions Although the missing isotope control weakens the interpretation of the findings, the dual tracing modality of ICG and MB, without involvement of radioactive isotopes, was an effective method for SLNB in patients with early breast cancer.

TI  - Assessing the soil moisture drought index for agricultural drought monitoring based on green vegetation fraction retrieval methods
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture in root zone soil layers is one of the most important indicators of agricultural drought. Thus, monitoring agricultural drought requires not only knowledge of rainfall anomaly but also quantification of soil moisture. In this study, the effects of various methods of quantifying the green vegetation fraction green vegetation fraction (GVF) on the land-surface-model (LSM)-based soil moisture drought index (SMDI) were assessed using the harvest area data of the World Meteorological Organization together with the widely used vegetation health index and drought severity index. GVF data used in this study include monthly climatological GVF, weekly advanced very high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR)-normalized difference vegetation index-based and 8-daily moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) leaf area index (LAI)-based GVF. The results show that SMDI is optimized when using the near-real-time GVF and that LAI-based GVF increases the accuracy of SMDI when monitoring early agricultural drought. The study shows that we can be confident in the accuracy of signals of emerging drought, particularly during the rapid onset of drought.

TI  - The impact of production network economies on spatially-contiguous conservatione Theoretical model with evidence from the US Prairie Pothole Region
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper examines the impact of production network economies on designing cost-effective conservation targeting strategies. We first develop a theoretical model to study the decision to convert land from an extensive (or biodiversity-friendly) use to an intensive use (e.g., crop agriculture) in the presence of network economies in land use returns. The model supports the possibility of multiple land use equilibria due to network economies and identifies policy outcomes that increase welfare. Bandwagon effects can occur whereby spatial production spillovers from lands under intensive use can prompt further conversions on proximate lands under extensive use. Conversely, conservation sites can be placed strategically to block conversion cascades. Lands that support moderate ecological benefits but have strong intensive use potential are desirable conservation targets when these preempt conversion cascades, which is in contrast with the conservation strategies that aim to maximize ecological benefits per unit cost. When network economies exist in land use returns as well as in ecological benefits, a Pigouvian subsidy is shown to favor extensive land cover while a subsidy payment upon preservation of adjacent lands can tilt incentives in favor of either land use. We illustrate our findings with landscape-level simulations calibrated to the U.S. Prairie Pothole Region (PPR). Finally, we estimate grassland conversion hazard by employing satellite imagery to provide statistical evidence for land use network economies in the PPR. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A1  - Int High Risk Mela
TI  - Surveillance of Sentinel Node-Positive Melanoma Patients with Reasons for Exclusion from MSLT-II: Multi-Institutional Propensity Score Matched Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF SURGEONS
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: In sentinel lymph node (SLN)-positive melanoma, two randomized trials demonstrated equivalent melanoma-specific survival with nodal surveillance vs completion lymph node dissection (CLND). Patients with microsatellites, extranodal extension (ENE) in the SLN, or >3 positive SLNs constitute a high-risk group largely excluded from the randomized trials, for whom appropriate management remains unknown.STUDY DESIGN: SLN-positive patients with any of the three high-risk features were identified from an international cohort. CLND patients were matched 1:1 with surveillance patients using propensity scores. Risk of any-site recurrence, SLN-basin-only recurrence, and melanoma specific mortality were compared.RESULTS: Among 1,154 SLN-positive patients, 166 had ENE, microsatellites, and/or >3 positive SLN. At 18.5 months median follow-up, 49% had recurrence (vs 26% in patients without high-risk features, p < 0.01). Among high-risk patients, 52 (31%) underwent CLND and 114 (69%) received surveillance. Fifty-one CLND patients were matched to 51 surveillance patients. The matched cohort was balanced on tumor, nodal, and adjuvant treatment factors. There were no significant differences in any-site recurrence (CLND 49%, surveillance 45%, p = 0.99), SLN-basin-only recurrence (CLND 6%, surveillance 14%, p = 0.20), or melanoma-specific mortality (CLND 14%, surveillance 12%, p = 0.86).CONCLUSIONS: SLN-positive patients with microsatellites, ENE, or >3 positive SLN constitute a high-risk group with a 2-fold greater recurrence risk. For those managed with nodal surveillance, SLN-basin recurrences were more frequent, but all-site recurrence and melanoma-specific mortality were comparable to patients treated with CLND. Most recurrences were outside the SLN-basin, supporting use of nodal surveillance for SLN-positive patients with microsatellites, ENE, and/or >3 positive SLN.

TI  - Radiomics MRI for lymph node status prediction in breast cancer patients: the state of art
T2  - JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH AND CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Objectives To create a review of the existing literature on the radiomic approach in predicting the lymph node status of the axilla in breast cancer (BC). Materials and methods Two reviewers conducted the literature search on MEDLINE databases independently. Ten articles on the prediction of sentinel lymph node metastasis in breast cancer with a radiomic approach were selected. The study characteristics and results were reported. The quality of the methodology was evaluated according to the Radiomics Quality Score (RQS). Results All studies were retrospective in design and published between 2017 and 2020. The majority of studies used DCE-MRI sequences and two investigated only pre-contrast images. The sample size was lower than 200 patients for 7 studies. The pre-processing used software, feature extraction and selection methods and classifier development are heterogeneous and a standardization of results is not yet possible. The average RQS score was 11.1 (maximum possible value = 36). The criteria with the lowest scores were the type of study, validation, comparison with a gold standard, potential clinical utility, cost-effective analysis and open science data. Conclusion The field of radiomics is a diagnostic approach of relative recent development. The results in predicting axillary lymph node status are encouraging, but there are still weaknesses in the quality of studies that may limit the reproducibility of the results.

TI  - Revisiting Andhi in northern India: A case study of severe dust-storm over the urban megacity of New Delhi
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Pre-monsoon dust storms also known as "Andhi" are one of the common phenomena occurring over the northern part of Indian sub-continent. Using the synergetic information from multiple platforms, the life cycle of an infamous dust storm event has been investigated, which impacted the urban megacity of New Delhi on May 30, 2014. The analysis from the radar revealed that the storm resulted from the merger of the outflow boundaries of two propagating thunderstorms in the mesoscale vicinity of New Delhi region. The leading edge of the outflow of downdraft cold air generated from the storm, ploughs the loose hot soil from the surface, thereby resulting to the severe dust storm over the region. Along with the heavy aerosol loading on that day as found from the satellite data, the evolution of the storm was also associated with sudden change in surface meteorological parameters which are manifested through the increase in near surface humidity (similar to 70%) and pollution levels along with the decrease in surface temperature (-12%). Although the study is centered at one event, the inferences distilled from this study are beneficial for the improvement of the predictive capability of severe weather events particularly for the tropical countries.

TI  - End-to-End Ship Detection in SAR Images for Complex Scenes Based on Deep CNNs
T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ship detection on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery has many valuable applications for both civil and military fields and has received extraordinary attention in recent years. The traditional detection methods are insensitive to multiscale ships and usually time-consuming, results in low detection accuracy and limitation for real-time processing. To balance the accuracy and speed, an end-to-end ship detection method for complex inshore and offshore scenes based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is proposed in this paper. First, the SAR images are divided into different grids, and the anchor boxes are predefined based on the responsible grids for dense ship prediction. Then, Darknet-53 with residual units is adopted as a backbone to extract features, and a top-down pyramid structure is added for multiscale feature fusion with concatenation. By this means, abundant hierarchical features containing both spatial and semantic information are extracted. Meanwhile, the strategies such as soft nonmaximum suppression (Soft-NMS), mix-up and mosaic data augmentation, multiscale training, and hybrid optimization are used for performance enhancement. Besides, the model is trained from scratch to avoid learning objective bias of pretraining. The proposed one-stage method adopts end-to-end inference by a single network, so the detection speed can be guaranteed due to the concise paradigm. Extensive experiments are performed on the public SAR ship detection dataset (SSDD), and the results show that the method can detect both inshore and offshore ships with higher accuracy than other mainstream methods, yielding the accuracy with an average of 95.52%, and the detection speed is quite fast with about 72 frames per second (FPS). The actual Sentinel-1 and Gaofen-3 data are utilized for verification, and the detection results also show the effectiveness and robustness of the method.

TI  - Aerosol impacts on warm-cloud microphysics and drizzle in a moderately polluted environment
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate is critically affected by aerosols, which alter cloud lifecycles and precipitation distribution through radiative and microphysical effects. In this study, aerosol and cloud property datasets from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), onboard the Aqua satellite, and surface observations, including aerosol concentrations, raindrop size distribution, and meteorological parameters, were used to statistically quantify the effects of aerosols on low-level warm-cloud microphysics and drizzle over northern Taiwan during multiple fall seasons (from 15 October to 30 November of 2005-2017). Our results indicated that northwestern Taiwan, which has several densely populated cities, is dominated by low-level clouds (e.g., warm, thin, and broken clouds) during the fall season. The observed effects of aerosols on warm clouds indicated aerosol indirect effects (i.e., increased aerosol loading caused a decrease in cloud effective radius (CER)), an increase in cloud optical thickness, an increase in cloud fraction, and a decrease in cloud-top temperature under a fixed cloud water path. Quantitatively, aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI = partial derivative lnCER/partial derivative ln alpha |(CWP), changes in CER relative to changes in aerosol amounts) were 0.07 for our research domain and varied between 0.09 and 0.06 in the surrounding remote (i.e., ocean) and polluted (i.e., land) areas, respectively, indicating aerosol indirect effects were stronger in the remote area. From the raindrop size distribution analysis, high aerosol loading resulted in a decreased frequency of drizzle events, redistribution of cloud water to more numerous and smaller droplets, and reduced collision-coalescence rates. However, during light rain (<= 1 mm h(-1)), high aerosol concentrations drove raindrops towards smaller droplet sizes and increased the appearance of drizzle drops. This study used long-term surface and satellite data to determine aerosol variations in northern Taiwan, effects on clouds and precipitation, and observational strategies for future research on aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions.

TI  - Sustainable development of water resources in marginalised semi-arid regions of India: Case study of Dahod in Gujarat, India
T2  - NATURAL RESOURCES FORUM
M3  - Article
AB  - Increased water demand and frequency of droughts, due to climate change in India, has led to water scarcity in the domestic and agricultural sectors. In such scenarios, small scale and decentralised water infrastructures, for example, check dams, have reduced water demand extremes and climate change impacts on water resources, especially for marginalised and low income farmers in semi-arid regions. This study aims to quantify the impact of a network of check dams on increasing soil moisture (SM) and crop productivity (CP) in a semi-arid Indian region. As a case study, 52 check dams were mapped, from 1990 to 2017, across the Dahod district of Gujarat state, and increases in SM and CP were quantified using remote sensing data-based indicators, including Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI). Results indicate an overall increase in NDVI from -0.2 to 0.1, and NDWI from 0.03 to 0.3, indicating an increase in vegetation cover and water content, respectively. In addition, spatiotemporal analysis indicates that the locations near the check dam had rapid increase in both indicators, and less dependence on rainfall variability. The study showed that remote sensing based indicators have been useful in documenting the impact of water recharge structures, especially in ungauged basins. However, it is important to use remote sensing data along with observation data for better accuracy of assessments. Results also indicate that the check dams could have been important in increasing water resource availability, as impact of other water resources is yet unknown in the region. Increased water resources, through improved sustainable development of water infrastructure, have increased the vegetation and decreased the vulnerability to climate change extremes, and thereby increased the socio-economic status of marginalised farmers in Dahod.

TI  - When image correlation is needed: Unravelling the complex dynamics of a slow-moving landslide in the tropics with dense radar and optical time series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Slow-moving landslides exhibit persistent but non-uniform motion at low rates which makes them exceptional natural laboratories to study the mechanisms that control the dynamics of unstable hillslopes. Here we leverage 4.5+ years of satellite-based radar and optical remote sensing data to quantify the kinematics of a slow-moving landslide in the tropical rural environment of the Kivu Rift, with unprecedented high spatial and temporal resolution. We measure landslide motion using sub-pixel image correlation methods and invert these data into dense time series that capture weekly to multi-year changes in landslide kinematics. We cross-validate and compare our satellite-based results with very-high-resolution Unoccupied Aircraft System topographic datasets, and explore how rainfall, simulated pore-water pressure, and nearby earthquakes control the overall landslide behaviour. The landslide exhibited seasonal and multi-year velocity variations that varied across the landslide kinematic units. While rainfall-induced changes in pore-water pressure exerts a primary control on the landslide motion, these alone cannot explain the observed variability in landslide behaviour. We suggest instead that the observed landslide kinematics result from internal landslide dynamics, such as extension, compression, material redistribution, and interactions within and between kinematic units. Our study provides, a rare, detailed overview of the deformation pattern of a landslide located in a tropical environment. In addition, our work highlights the viability of sub-pixel image correlation with long time series of radar-amplitude data to quantify surface deformation in tropical environments where optical data is limited by persistent cloud cover and emphasize the importance of exploiting synergies between multiple types of data to capture the complex kinematic pattern of landslides.

TI  - 10-year satellite-constrained fluxes of ammonia improve performance of chemistry transport models
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, ammonia emissions have been continuously increasing, being almost 4 times higher than in the 20th century. Although an important species, as its use as a fertilizer sustains human living, ammonia has major consequences for both humans and the environment because of its reactive gas-phase chemistry that makes it easily convertible to particles. Despite its pronounced importance, ammonia emissions are highly uncertain in most emission inventories. However, the great development of satellite remote sensing nowadays provides the opportunity for more targeted research on constraining ammonia emissions. Here, we used satellite measurements to calculate global ammonia emissions over the period 2008-2017. Then, the calculated ammonia emissions were fed to a chemistry transport model, and ammonia concentrations were simulated for the period 2008-2017.The simulated concentrations of ammonia were compared with ground measurements from Europe, North America and Southeastern Asia, as well as with satellite measurements. The satellite-constrained ammonia emissions represent global concentrations more accurately than state-of-the-art emissions. Calculated fluxes in the North China Plain were seen to be more increased after 2015, which is not due to emission changes but due to changes in sulfate emissions that resulted in less ammonia neutralization and hence in larger atmospheric loads. Emissions over Europe were also twice as much as those in traditional datasets with dominant sources being industrial and agricultural applications. Four hot-spot regions of high ammonia emissions were seen in North America, which are characterized by high agricultural activity, such as animal breeding, animal farms and agricultural practices. South America is dominated by ammonia emissions from biomass burning, which causes a strong seasonality. In Southeastern Asia, ammonia emissions from fertilizer plants in China, Pakistan, India and Indonesia are the most important, while a strong seasonality was observed with a spring and late summer peak due to rice and wheat cultivation. Measurements of ammonia surface concentrations were better reproduced with satellite-constrained emissions, such as measurements from CrIS (Cross-track Infrared Sounder).

TI  - Location of greenspace matters: a new approach to investigating the effect of the greenspace spatial pattern on urban heat environment
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context Although many prior efforts have found that both spatial composition and configuration of greenspaces significantly affect the urban heat environment globally, the spatially heterogeneous effects of greenspace spatial patterns on the urban heat environment remain poorly understood for urban spaces. Objectives We proposed a spatially explicit approach to investigate the spatially heterogeneous cooling effects of greenspaces and map the relative contributions of the greenspace spatial patterns to the characterization of the urban heat environment. Methods The proposed approach integrated the best subsets regression method, geographically weighted regression (GWR), and hierarchical partitioning analysis. Two cities in southeastern China were selected to test our model. Landsat 5 image obtained in the summer was used to estimate the land surface temperature (LST) and greenspace spatial patterns were extracted from 0.5-m aerial images. Results The results revealed that LST of Guangzhou can be well predicted by the percent cover (PER), the number of patches (NP), the area-weighted mean of the patch area (AREA_AM), and the area-weighted mean of the perimeter-area fractal dimension (FRAC_MN), while that of Shenzhen can be predicted by PER, NP, AREA_AM and the mean of the related circumscribing circle (CIRCLE_MN). The inclusion of additional landscape metrics did not yield significantly higher accuracies. The dominant landscape metrics of greenspace that determine the LST varied spatially across the two cities, with the PER accounting for the greatest variation. Conclusion The results of our work demonstrate that the location of greenspace is a significant factor affecting the urban heat environment. The proposed approach provides a new understanding of the interaction between the greenspace spatial patterns and urban heat environments, providing useful information for tailoring greenspace planning policies for specific local sites.

TI  - Versatile fluorinated Pd@Au nanoplates doped with yttrium for tumor theranostics†
T2  - BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the emerging modalities of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), F-19 MRI is highly conducive for the specific detection and imaging of deep-seated tumors, with negligible background. However, most F-19 MRI probe designs are constructed with organic CF3, which contains rich fluorine atoms, and few of the fluorine-containing groups are equipped with therapeutic function. Herein, we designed a versatile F-19 MRI-based theranostic nanoplatform, FY-Pd@Au nano-metallacages (FY-Pd@Au NCs), which not only serve as a F-19 MRI/CT/PAI contrast agent, but also produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) by type I photodynamic therapy (PDT) pathway, as well as heat for photothermal therapy (PTT), under the single NIR laser irradiation. Overall, this work successfully built a theranostics nanoplatform based on F-19 MRI.

TI  - Estimating ultraviolet reflectance from visible bands in ocean colour remote sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, ultraviolet (UV) bands have received increasing attention from the ocean colour remote sensing community, as they may contribute to improving atmospheric correction and inherent optical properties (IOPs) retrieval. However, most ocean colour satellite sensors do not have UV bands, and the accurate retrieval of UV remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) from UV satellite data is still a challenge. In order to address this problem, this study proposes a hybrid approach for estimating UV Rrs from the visible bands. The approach was implemented with two popular ocean colour satellite sensors, i.e. GCOM-C SGLI and Sentinel-3 OLCI. In situ Rrs collected globally and simulated Rrs spectra were used to develop UV Rrs retrieval models, and UV Rrs values at 360, 380 and 400 nm were estimated from visible Rrs spectra. The performances of the established models were evaluated using in situ Rrs and satellite data, and applied to a semi-analytical algorithm for IOPs retrieval. The results showed that: (i) UV Rrs retrieval models had low uncertainties with mean absolute percentage differences (MAPD) less than 5%; (ii) the model assessment with in situ Rrs showed high accuracy (r = 0.92?1.00 and MAPD = 1.11%?10.95%) in both clear open ocean and optically complex waters; (iii) the model assessment with satellite data indicated that model-estimated UV Rrs were more consistent with in situ values than satellite-derived UV Rrs; and (iv) model-estimated UV Rrs may improve the decomposition accuracy of absorption coefficients in semi-analytical IOPs algorithm. Thus, the proposed method has great potentials for reconstructing UV Rrs data and improving IOPs retrieval for historical satellite sensors, and might also be useful for UV-based atmospheric correction algorithms.

TI  - GROUPS OF WORLDVIEW TRANSFORMATIONS IMPLIED BY EINSTEIN'S SPECIAL PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY OVER ARBITRARY ORDERED FIELDS
T2  - REVIEW OF SYMBOLIC LOGIC
M3  - Article
AB  - In 1978, Yu. F. Borisov presented an axiom system using a few basic assumptions and four explicit axioms, the fourth being a formulation of the relativity principle, and he demonstrated that this axiom system had (up to choice of units) only two models: a relativistic one in which worldview transformations are Poincare transformations and a classical one in which they are Galilean. In this paper, we reformulate Borisov's original four axioms within an intuitively simple, but strictly formal, first-order logic framework, and convert his basic background assumptions into explicit axioms. Instead of assuming that the structure of physical quantities is the field of real numbers, we assume only that they form an ordered field. This allows us to investigate how Borisov's theorem depends on the structure of quantities. We demonstrate (as our main contribution) how to construct Euclidean, Galilean, and Poincare models of Borisov's axiom system over every non-Archimedean field. We also demonstrate the existence of an infinite descending chain of models and transformation groups in each of these three cases, something that is not possible over Archimedean fields. As an application, we note that there is a model of Borisov's axioms that satisfies the relativity principle, and in which the worldview transformations are Euclidean isometries. Over the field of reals it is easy to eliminate this model using natural axioms concerning time's arrow and the absence of instantaneous motion. In the case of non-Archimedean fields, however, the Euclidean isometries appear intrinsically as worldview transformations in models of Borisov's axioms, and neither the assumption of time's arrow, nor the rejection of instantaneous motion, can eliminate them.

TI  - A study on the use of UAV images to improve the separation accuracy of agricultural land areas
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Classifying satellite images with medium spatial resolution such as Landsat, it is usually difficult to distinguish between plant species, and it is impossible to determine the area covered with weeds. In this study, a Landsat 8 image along with UAV images utilized to separate pistachio cultivars and separate weed from trees. To use the high spatial resolution of UAV images, image fusion was carried out through the high-pass filter, wavelet, principal component transformation, BROVEY, IHS, and Gram Schmidt methods. ERGAS, RMSE, and correlation criteria were applied to assess their accuracy. The results represented that the wavelet method with R2, RMSE, and ERGAS 0.91, 12.22 cm, and 2.05 respectively had the highest accuracy in combining these images. Then, images obtained by this method were chosen with a spatial resolution of 20 cm for classification. Different classification methods including unsupervised method, maximum likelihood, minimum distance, fuzzy artmap, perceptron, and tree methods were evaluated. Moreover, six soil classes, Ahmad Aghaei, Akbari, Kalleh Ghoochi, Fandoghi, and a mixing class of Kalleh Ghoochi and Fandoghi were applied, and also three classes of soil, pistachio tree and weeds were extracted from the trees. The results demonstrated that the fuzzy artmap method had the highest accuracy in separating weeds from trees, differentiating various pistachio cultivars with Landsat image and also classification with combined image and had 0.87, 0.79, and 0.87 kappa coefficients respectively. The comparison between pistachio cultivars through Landsat image and the combined image showed that the validation accuracy obtained from harvest has raised by 17% because of the combination of images. The results of this study indicated that the combination of UAV and Landsat 8 images affects well to separate pistachio cultivars and determine the area covered with weeds.

TI  - Evaluating the inter-relationship between OCO-2 XCO<sub>2</sub> and MODIS-LST in an Industrial Belt located at Western Bengaluru City of India
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the relationship between the CO2 concentration and land surface temperature in Bengaluru, a recently mega industrialized city located in Southern India. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) was performed to explore the inter-relationship between orbiting carbon observatory-2 (OCO-2) XCO2 and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer MODIS-LST (land surface temperature). The GWR coefficient (R-2 Adjusted), 0.91, confirms the strong correlation between OCO-2 XCO2 and MODIS LST over the study area. This study confirmed the industrial belt is one of the strong reasons for the remarkable increase in carbon concentration since the study area is surrounded by aerospace manufacturing industries and information technology building. The results of this study can be utilized as an important reference for evaluating the correlation between industrial belt and carbon emissions in south-east Asian countries where industrial belt is intensively constructed.

TI  - Spatial modelling of soil salinity: deep or shallow learning models?
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the spatial distribution of soil salinity is required to conserve land against degradation and desertification. Against this background, this study is the first attempt to predict soil salinity in the Jaghin basin, in southern Iran, by applying and comparing the performance of four deep learning (DL) models (deep convolutional neural networks-DCNNs, dense connected deep neural networks-DenseDNNs, recurrent neural networks-long short-term memory-RNN-LSTM and recurrent neural networks-gated recurrent unit-RNN-GRU) and six shallow machine learning (ML) models (bagged classification and regression tree-BCART, cforest, cubist, quantile regression with LASSO penalty-QR-LASSO, ridge regression-RR and support vectore machine-SVM). To do this, 49 environmental landsat8-derived variables including digital elevation model (DEM)-extracted covariates, soil-salinity indices, and other variables (e.g., soil order, lithology, land use) were mapped spatially. For assessing the relationships between soil salinity (EC) and factors controlling EC, we collected 319 surficial (0-5 cm depth) soil samples for measuring soil salinity on the basis of electrical conductivity (EC). We then selected the most important features (covariates) controlling soil salinity by applying a MARS model. The performance of the DL and shallow ML models for generating soil salinity spatial maps (SSSMs) was assessed using a Taylor diagram and the Nash Sutcliff coefficient (NSE). Among all 10 predictive models, DL models with NSE >= 0.9 (DCNNs was the most accurate model with NSE = 0.96) were selected as the four best models, and performed better than the six shallow ML models with NSE <= 0.83 (QR-LASSO was the weakest predictive model with NSE = 0.50). Based on DCNNs-, the values of the EC ranged between 0.67 and 14.73 dS/m, whereas for QR-LASSO the corresponding EC values were 0.37 to 19.6 dS/m. Overall, DL models performed better than shallow ML models for production of the SSSMs and therefore we recommend applying DL models for prediction purposes in environmental sciences.

TI  - Assessment of Land Degradation Vulnerability using Geospatial Technique: A Case Study of Kachchh District of Gujarat, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land degradation is decline in productivity of land in terms of bio-diversity and economy, resulting from various causes including climate and human dominance, leading to loss of ecosystem. It is an issue of global concern and threatens productivity of land, water, biodiversity, ecology, economy, and people. India, with 2.4% of global land area, is homeland for around 18% of global human population and 30.4% livestock population, supporting more than 8% of world's agriculture with more than 69% area falling under drylands. The blend of high population, high agriculture production and diverse agro-climatic conditions results in excessive pressure on resources. This study is an attempt to access land degradation vulnerability considering human-induced factors, biophysical and climate parameters. Hierarchy-based indexing method is used for analysis using geospatial technique. Study reveals that around 67% of the land area falls under high vulnerability, and 27% area falls under moderate vulnerability. The outcome was further compared with MODIS land surface temperature and normalised difference vegetation index data for validation and is observed that more than 85% area under moderate-high vulnerability is related to increase in surface temperature and/or no-change in vegetation index; this area also falls under low NDVI value range (< 0.3), indicating vulnerable to land degradation. The outcome is useful for stakeholders in understanding the issue and for preparing action plans for combating land degradation.

TI  - Environmental Impact of Lockdown Amid COVID-19 Over Agricultural Sites in Himalayan Foothills
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Human life has come to a standstill when the countrywide lockdown was imposed to curb the infection of the highly contagious COVID-19 pandemic. Mass transportation and industrial activities were prohibited, which has proven advantageous for the environmental quality. This study was conducted to investigate the impact of lockdown on the environmental parameters measured over agricultural ecosystems in the Himalayan foothills [Saharanpur Flux Site (SFS) and Palampur Flux Site (PFS)], India. The UV-Aerosol Index obtained from the Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite falls drastically after imposing lockdown particularly in both the agricultural regions. It reached up to -3.082 and -3.522 during the first lockdown in SFS and PFS, respectively. Furthermore, due to the lesser availability of aerosols into the atmosphere, the availability of direct radiant energy increased, thus led to warming the earth's surface. Improvement in direct radiant energy and normalized difference vegetation index positively increases the gross primary productivity in SFS and PFS.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variation in snow cover and its effects on grassland phenology on the Mongolian Plateau
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover is an important water source for vegetation growth in arid and semi-arid areas, and grassland phenology provides valuable information on the response of terrestrial ecosystems to climate change. The Mongolian Plateau features both abundant snow cover resources and typical grassland ecosystems. In recent years, with the intensification of global climate change, the snow cover on the Mongolian Plateau has changed correspondingly, with resulting effects on vegetation growth. In this study, using MOD10A1 snow cover data and MOD13A1 Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data combined with remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) techniques, we analyzed the spatiotemporal changes in snow cover and grassland phenology on the Mongolian Plateau from 2001 to 2018. The correlation analysis and grey relation analysis were used to determine the influence of snow cover parameters (snow cover fraction (SCF), snow cover duration (SCD), snow cover onset date (SCOD), and snow cover end date (SCED)) on different types of grassland vegetation. The results showed wide snow cover areas, an early start time, a late end time, and a long duration of snow cover over the northern Mongolian Plateau. Additionally, a late start, an early end, and a short duration were observed for grassland phenology, but the southern area showed the opposite trend. The SCF decreased at an annual rate of 0.33%. The SCD was shortened at an annual rate of 0.57 d. The SCOD and SCED in more than half of the study area advanced at annual rates of 5.33 and 5.74 DOY (day of year), respectively. For grassland phenology, the start of the growing season (SOS) advanced at an annual rate of 0.03 DOY, the end of the growing season (EOS) was delayed at an annual rate of 0.14 DOY, and the length of the growing season (LOS) was prolonged at an annual rate of 0.17 d. The SCF, SCD, and SCED in the snow season were significantly positively correlated with the SOS and negatively correlated with the EOS and LOS. The SCOD was significantly negatively correlated with the SOS and positively correlated with the EOS and LOS. The SCD and SCF can directly affect the SOS of grassland vegetation, while the EOS and LOS were obviously influenced by the SCOD and SCED. This study provides a scientific basis for exploring the response trends of alpine vegetation to global climate change.

TI  - Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data fusion system for surface water extraction
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detecting and monitoring surface water has received much attention in recent decades. Surface water is one of the most critical water resources for both human and ecological systems. Remote sensing technology has made it possible to have accurate and frequent updates of surface water. We propose a remote sensing multisensor fusion system using optical data including Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 and RADAR data including Sentinel-1 for water body extraction. Using a data fusion approach, the spatial resolution of multispectral images increased from 30 to 10 m, and the spectral information of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 were preserved. Then, all features extracted from the high spatial resolution images, water index maps, and Sentinel-1 dataset were combined as a stacked feature space. The new data were subsequently classified by support vector machine, neural network, and random forest. Finally, all classifiers' outputs were integrated using a weighted majority voting decision fusion strategy, which significantly improved surface water extraction. Our study illustrates the ability of remote sensing multisensory fusion, water indices, and decision fusion for water body extraction.

TI  - Stage IIIa Melanoma and Impact of Multiple Positive Lymph Nodes on Survival
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF SURGEONS
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: For patients with cutaneous melanoma, having >1 positive lymph node (LN) is associated with worse survival. We hypothesized that for stage IIIA patients, N2a disease (2 to 3 positive LN) would be associated with a worse prognosis compared to those with N1a disease (1 positive LN).STUDY DESIGN: Stage IIIA melanoma patients in the NCDB Participant User File from 2010 to 2016 were analyzed. Overall survival (OS) between N1a and N2a patients was compared. Subgroup analyses were made between patients undergoing sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy alone and those undergoing subsequent completion lymph node dissection (CLND). A separate post hoc analysis of T2a patients undergoing SLN biopsy and CLND from a prospective multicenter randomized clinical trial was performed to validate the findings.RESULTS: Records of 2,305 IIIA patients were evaluated. In an adjusted survival model, N2a disease was an independent risk factor for worse OS (hazard ratio [HR] 1.56, p = 0.0052). In the subgroup analysis, there was no difference in OS between N1a and N2a disease for patients who underwent SLN biopsy without CLND (p = 0.59), but there was a significant difference in OS for patients who underwent SLN biopsy plus CLND (p = 0.0009). The separate clinical trial database confirmed that for patients with SLN-only disease, there was no difference in OS between N1a and N2a disease.CONCLUSIONS: For stage IIIA melanoma patients, the distribution of micrometastatic lymph node disease (SLN or non-SLN), rather than the absolute number of SLNs, should be considered when individualizing adjuvant therapy recommendations.

TI  - On-orbit calibration and performance assessments of Terra and Aqua MODIS thermal emissive bands
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Terra and Aqua MODIS have successfully operated for more than 20 and 18 years, respectively, and far exceeded their designed lifetimes of 6 years. MODIS has 36 spectral bands, among which 16 are the thermal emissive bands (TEB) covering a wavelength range from 3.75 to 14.24 mu m. Observations from the MODIS TEB have been used to generate a number of data products, such as surface/cloud/atmospheric temperatures, cloud top altitude, and water vapor properties. To a large extent, the quality of the MODIS L1B radiance product has been maintained through the entirety of each mission via extensive on-orbit calibration and validation efforts. MODIS TEB calibration uses a quadratic algorithm and is referenced to an on-board blackbody with its temperature measurements traceable to the NIST standard. We provide an overview of the MODIS instrument operations, key TEB calibration activities, and algorithms used in the latest L1B data Collection 6.1 (C6.1) and describe the TEB on-orbit performance for both Terra and Aqua MODIS. The TEB gain trends have been stable to within 5% over the Terra mission after 2003 under the same electronic configuration, except for bands 27 to 30, and within 3% over the Aqua mission. The Terra MODIS optical crosstalk correction implemented right after launch has been very effective in removing the ghost images in its photoconductive detector bands 32 to 36. Starting from C6.1, an electronic crosstalk correction algorithm has also been applied to the Terra MODIS photovoltaic detector long-wave infrared bands 27 to 30. The noise characterization performance remains stable with most TEB detectors continuously meeting their design requirements. A gradual loss of the Aqua MODIS radiative cooler margin reached its maximum in 2013 and has been slowly recovering since then. On-orbit changes in TEB response versus scan angle are extremely small based on pitch maneuver observations and assessments using vicarious approaches. The remaining challenges in TEB calibration and proposed improvements for the upcoming data collection with L1B data production and reprocessing are discussed.

TI  - Detection of Coral Reef Bleaching Based on Sentinel-2 Multi-Temporal Imagery: Simulation and Case Study
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-2 mission has been shown to have promising applications in coral reef remote sensing because of its superior properties. It has a 5-day revisit time, spatial resolution of 10 m, free data, etc. In this study, Sentinel-2 imagery was investigated for bleaching detection through simulations and a case study over the Lizard Island, Australia. The spectral and image simulations based on the semianalytical (SA) model and the sensor spectral response function, respectively, confirmed that coral bleaching cannot be detected only using one image, and the change analysis was proposed for detection because there will be a featured change signal for bleached corals. Band 2 of Sentinel-2 is superior to its other bands for the overall consideration of signal attenuation and spatial resolution. However, the detection capability of Sentinel-2 is still limited by the water depth. With rapid signal attenuation due to the water absorption effect, the applicable water depth for bleaching detection was recommended to be less than 10 m. The change analysis was conducted using two methods: one radiometric normalization with pseudo invariant features (PIFs) and the other with multi-temporal depth invariant indices (DII). The former performed better than the latter in terms of classification. The bleached corals maps obtained using the PIFs and DII approaches had an overall accuracy of 88.9 and 57.1%, respectively. Compared with the change analysis based on two dated images, the use of a third image that recorded the spectral signals of recovered corals or corals overgrown by algae after bleaching significantly improved the detection accuracy. All the preliminary results of this article will aid in the future studies on coral bleaching detection based on remote sensing.

TI  - Sustainable development goals and the hotel sector: case examples and implications
T2  - WORLDWIDE HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM THEMES
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeThis study offers insights on the sustainable development goals (SDGs) initiatives of five international hotels, namely, Ibis Getafe, NH Hotels, Occidental Hotels and Resorts, Mariposa Hotel and the Zanzibar Collection. The objective is to show how hoteliers around the world engage in sustainable action. The paper mainly focuses on the Zanzibar Collection, where one of the co-authors served as a hotel general manager.Design/methodology/approachThe paper draws on case studies and the narratives that are based on one of the co-authors' life experiences. Data is derived from a number of case studies which are analysed in an exploratory and descriptive way.FindingsThe findings show that the hotel sector is committed to the SDG, but there are variations in the ways hotels address the SDGs. Based on the findings, it would seem that the hotels studied cover most of the SDGs, as they are seen contributing in the three main spheres of sustainability, namely, the economy, society and the environment.Originality/valueThe five hotels profiled are engaged in responsible action that is sustainable and reduces the ecological impact. These actions have a positive impact on guests, staff and hoteliers. The findings may serve as guidance to hotels which have not yet committed to implementing the SDG goals.

TI  - Dynamics of land-use changes and their future trends using spatial analysis and the CA-Markov model-A case-study with a special emphasis on aquaculture development in India
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land resources utilized for aquaculture development have raised many environmental issues worldwide. But no detailed information is available about the land-use changes due to aquaculture in comparison with other land use modifications. Hence, the land-use changes and predictions have been explored in India's leading aquaculture region using multitemporal satellite images (1986-2016), spatial techniques, and land change modeling. Agriculture was the largest proportionate land use in the study area and consistently used for aquaculture and buildings. There were no aquaculture farms in 1986; however, their area had expanded to 12,575 ha by 1996 and further increased to 38,564 ha (207%) in 2006. It then reduced in area by 36% in 2016. Agricultural lands have been used for 74%, 66%, and 15% of aquaculture development during 1986-1996, 1996-2006, and 2006-2016, respectively. Scrublands and mudflats have been used for aquaculture growth between 6 and 22% and 1-2% at different periods of our study. Salt pans and mangroves were occasionally used (less than 0.5%) for aquaculture. Dynamic land-use changes have been observed between agriculture and scrublands. The reconversion to agriculture occurred from the aquaculture area by 20 and 51% during 1996-2006 and 2006-2016, respectively. It is predicted that the aquaculture area will further reduce, but agriculture is likely to be used for aquaculture and for buildings, despite the existing ban. Land availability is a major limiting factor; thus, it will pose a significant challenge and lead to conflicts in the future if not planned for now.

TI  - Investigation of anxiety and depressive disorders and psychiatric medication use before and after cancer diagnosis
T2  - PSYCHO-ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Data regarding the prevalence of depression and anxiety among cancer patients, especially before cancer diagnosis, remains scarce. This study investigated the prevalence of these conditions and associated drug use among cancer patients pre- and post-diagnosis.Methods This population-based cohort study using data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database recruited patients with a registered cancer diagnosis and matched control between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2011. We compared the prevalence of anxiety and depressive disorders between cancer patients and non-cancer participants during a 2-year period both pre- and post-diagnosis by Pearson's chi-square test. Psychiatric medication use was also examined for the associated mental condition.Results We examined participants diagnosed with liver (N = 17,154), colorectal (N = 30,391), breast (N = 40,036), gynecological (N = 23,218), and lung (N = 15,671) cancer. Before the cancer diagnosis, the prevalence of depression was higher in non-cancer participants than in gynecological cancer patients (p = 0.018) but anxiety is higher in liver, colorectal, and lung cancer patients when compared to non-cancer participants (p < 0.05). After the cancer diagnosis, the prevalence of anxiety and depression became significantly higher in all enrolled cancer patients than non-cancer participants (p < 0.05). Similar results were observed in psychiatric medication use trends.Conclusions This study proposed that patients with liver, colorectal, and lung cancer had an increased risk of developing anxiety, which might be a sentinel diagnosis. The participants had a significantly higher level of anxiety and depressive disorder post-diagnosis, which highlights the importance of the care for both mental and physical conditions in cancer management.

TI  - Etiological and epidemiological characteristics of severe acute respiratory infection caused by multiple viruses and <i>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</i> in adult patients in Jinshan, Shanghai: A pilot hospital-based surveillance study
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundSevere acute respiratory infection (SARI) results in a tremendous disease burden worldwide. Available research on active surveillance among hospitalized adult patients suffering from SARI in China is limited. This pilot study aimed to identify associated etiologies and describe the demographic, epidemiological and clinical profiles of hospitalized SARI patients aged over 16 years in Jinshan, Shanghai.MethodsActive surveillance was conducted at 1 sentinel hospital in Jinshan district, Shanghai, from April 2017 to March 2018. Hospitalized SARI patients aged over 16 years old were enrolled, and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected within 24 hours of admission and tested for multiple respiratory viruses (including 18 common viruses) and Mycoplasma pneumoniae with real-time polymerase chain reaction. Demographic, epidemiological and clinical information was obtained from case report forms.ResultsIn total, 397 SARI patients were enrolled; the median age was 68 years, and 194 (48.9%) patients were male. A total of 278 (70.0%) patients had at least one underlying chronic medical condition. The most frequent symptoms were cough (99.2%) and sputum production (88.4%). The median duration of hospitalization was 10 days. A total of 250 infection patients (63.0%) were positive for at least one pathogen, of whom 198 (49.9%) were positive for a single pathogen and 52 (13.1%) were positive for multiple pathogens. The pathogens identified most frequently were M. pneumoniae (23.9%, 95/397), followed by adenovirus (AdV) (11.6%, 46/397), influenza virus A/H3N2 (Flu A/H3N2) (11.1%, 44/397), human rhinovirus (HRhV) (8.1%, 32/397), influenza virus B/Yamagata (Flu B/Yamagata) (6.3%, 25/397), pandemic influenza virus A/H1N1 (Flu A/pH1N1) (4.0%, 16/397), parainfluenza virus (PIV) type 1 (2.0%, 8/397), human coronavirus (HCoV) type NL63 (2.0%, 8/397), HCoV 229E (1.5%, 6/397), HCoV HKU1 (1.5%, 6/397), PIV 3 (1.5%, 6/397), human metapneumovirus (HMPV) (1.5%, 6/397), PIV 4 (1.3%, 5/397), HCoV OC43 (1.0%, 4/397), influenza virus B/Victoria (Flu B/Victoria) (0.5%, 2/397), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) type B (0.5%, 2/397), and human bocavirus (HBoV) (0.3%, 1/397). The seasonality of pathogen-confirmed SARI patients had a bimodal distribution, with the first peak in the summer and the second peak in the winter. Statistically significant differences were observed with respect to the rates of dyspnea, radiographically diagnosed pneumonia and the presence of at least one comorbidity in patients who were infected with only M. pneumoniae, AdV, HRhV, Flu A/H3N2, Flu A /pH1N1 or Flu B/Yamagata. The differences in the positivity rates of the above 6 pathogens among the different age groups were nonsignificant.ConclusionsM. pneumoniae, AdV and Flu A/H3N2 were the main pathogens detected in hospitalized SARI patients aged over 16 years old in Jinshan district, Shanghai. Our findings highlight the importance of sustained multipathogen surveillance among SARI patients in sentinel hospitals, which can provide useful information on SARI etiologies, epidemiology, and clinical characteristics.

TI  - 2010-2015 North American methane emissions, sectoral contributions, and trends: a high-resolution inversion of GOSAT observations of atmospheric methane
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We use 2010-2015 Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) observations of atmospheric methane columns over North America in a high-resolution inversion of methane emissions, including contributions from different sectors and their trends over the period. The inversion involves an analytical solution to the Bayesian optimization problem for a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) of the emission field with up to 0.5 degrees x 0.625 degrees resolution in concentrated source regions. The analytical solution provides a closedform characterization of the information content from the inversion and facilitates the construction of a large ensemble of solutions exploring the effect of different uncertainties and assumptions in the inverse analysis. Prior estimates for the inversion include a gridded version of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Inventory of US Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks (GHGI) and the WetCHARTs model ensemble for wetlands. Our best estimate for mean 2010-2015 US anthropogenic emissions is 30.6 (range: 29.4-31.3) Tg a(-1), slightly higher than the gridded EPA inventory (28.7 (26.4-36.2) Tg a(-1)). The main discrepancy is for the oil and gas production sectors, where we find higher emissions than the GHGI by 35% and 22 %, respectively. The most recent version of the EPA GHGI revises downward its estimate of emissions from oil production, and we find that these are lower than our estimate by a factor of 2. Our best estimate of US wetland emissions is 10.2 (5.6-11.1) Tg a(-1), on the low end of the prior WetCHARTs inventory uncertainty range (14.2 (3.3-32.4) Tg a(-1)), which calls for better understanding of these emissions. We find an increasing trend in US anthropogenic emissions over 2010-2015 of 0.4% a(-1), lower than previous GOSAT-based estimates but opposite to the decrease reported by the EPA GHGI. Most of this increase appears driven by unconventional oil and gas production in the eastern US. We also find that oil and gas production emissions in Mexico are higher than in the nationally reported inventory, though there is evidence for a 2010-2015 decrease in emissions from offshore oil production.

TI  - Evaluation and Prediction of Topsoil organic carbon using Machine learning and hybrid models at a Field-scale
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital mapping of soil organic carbon (SOC) is crucial to evaluate its spatial variability and also to assess environmental factors controlling it at field scale. The current study was conducted to compare one statistical method include partial least squares regression (PLSR), four individual machine learning(ML) algorithms including random forest (RF), quantile regression forest (QRF), cubist (CB), fuzzy logic (SoLIM) along with two hybrid methods including the random forest-ordinary kriging (RF-OK) and quantile random regression forest-ordinary kriging (QRF-OK) to map SOC. A number of 146 soil samples (0-30 cm) were collected in Khorramabad plain (680 ha). For the quantitative evaluation of SOC spatial variability, two scenarios were considered to use remote sensing data (R) and a combination of geo-morphometric and remote sensing data (GR). The data randomly were split into 80% (117 points) for training and 20% (29 points) for validation. The model performances were evaluated by the statistical indices as the coefficient of determination (R-2), root mean square error (RMSE). According to principal component analysis (PCA), nine covariates including transformed soil adjusted vegetation index (TSAVI), relative vegetation index (RVI), Band 10, Band 11,Digital Elevation Model (DEM), Standard height(Standard_he), Valley_Dep, terrain surface texture (texture), and terrain surface convexity (Convexity) were selected as the environmental predictors. Results showed that the hybrid model RF-OK (RMSE = 0.05and R-2 = 0.93) and SoLIM model (RMSE = 0.47and R-2 = 0.41) with scenario GR had the highest and lowest accurate respectively. TSAVI, DEM, and Band 10 were the most important predictors and explanation more than 50% of SOC spatial variability in the study area. Generally, using hybrid machine learning models in combination with geo-morphometric and remote sensing covariates make it possible to model and predict SOC with acceptable accurate in the field-scale croplands.

TI  - Approaches to Understanding and Aligning With Religious Leaders: A Latent Profile Analysis of Religious Leaders' Worldviews
T2  - SPIRITUALITY IN CLINICAL PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Religious people often seek help for mental health problems from their religious leaders. Yet, some religious leaders may not easily trust the mental health system. In this study, we employed latent profile analysis to explore differences in religious leader's worldviews and how they relate to attitudes toward psychological science (N = 401). We purposefully sampled from Catholic, Evangelical, and Mainline denominations. Results suggested three profiles of leaders: Theologically Conservative, Theologically Progressive, and Theologically Moderate. Sharp differences for these three groups resided in worldviews concerning same-sex marriage, gender roles in leadership, and human origins. We found that Theologically Conservative leaders in the sample were primarily open to drawing on psychology in counseling, but harbored concerns about the misalignment of faith and science. In contrast, the other two groups (Theologically Progressive and Theologically Moderate leaders) seemed much more amenable to drawing on psychology in a number of ministries and were less concerned about misalignment regarding ideology. From these findings, we draw on principles of implementation science to recommend strategies of promoting greater cooperation between religious leaders and psychologists.

TI  - Unlearning as (Japanese) learning
T2  - EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY AND THEORY
M3  - Article
AB  - Unlearning is a recurrent theme in Japan. To further understanding of what this entails, we focus on the view of learning laid out by a revered 13th century Zen-inspired playwright. For Zeami, learning involved a movement from the acquisition to unlearning of skills, punctuated by an experience of mushin, followed by creative reemergence. To deepen understandings of this unlearning model, we turn to draw comparison with recent discussions in the Western literature, focusing on Double-Loop Learning and Learning III, both inspired by Bateson. Learning III, which Bateson utilized several Zen references to explicate, appears to gesture towards the alternative punctuation of learning envisaged by Zeami, although differences remain. We then shift to highlight empirical work on contemporary Japanese schooling, highlighting practices which suggest elements of a Zeami-like worldview continue to live on in Japan's learning culture. Unlearning, when viewed as a living tradition embedded in culture, rather than merely a premodern past or future philosophical possibility, help sets the stage for a transnational, transdisciplinary dialogue on how we learn. We perform our own extended dialogue that led to this piece, a mode of engagement we view as methodological innovation, as we work to unlearn our past parochialisms.

TI  - Early wheat yield estimation at field-level by photosynthetic pigment unmixing using Landsat 8 image series
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a novel approach for estimating wheat yields based on estimated abundances of endmembers attributed to photosynthetic pigments, using Landsat 8 images acquired during maximum greenness. Endmembers within the wheat pixels are found using an unmixing algorithm then they are further optimized to maximize the predictive power of the abundances for the yields. Similarity of the endmembers to photosynthetic pigment's spectral signatures and their predictive power suggests their relevance to the pigments. Although the initial unmixing of the intimate mixture of photosynthetic pigments is linear, interactions of abundances are used in the optimization to handle the non-linearity using bilinear model. Wheat yields are estimated with abundances, their relevant interactions, agrometeorological parameters and vegetation indices using three machine learning algorithms. Harvester records from 142 fields are used as ground truth for performance assessment. The yields are estimated with 82% accuracy (RMSE = 22.51) when Random Forest algorithm is used with important parameters.

TI  - Understanding the effect of fire on vegetation composition and gross primary production in a semi-arid shrubland ecosystem using the Ecosystem Demography (EDv2.2) model
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires in sagebrush (Artemisia spp.)-dominated semi-arid ecosystems in the western United States have increased dramatically in frequency and severity in the last few decades. Severe wildfires often lead to the loss of native sagebrush communities and change the biogeochemical conditions which make it difficult for sagebrush to regenerate. Invasion of cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) accentuates the problem by making the ecosystem more susceptible to frequent burns. Managers have implemented several techniques to cope with the cheatgrass-fire cycle, ranging from controlling undesirable fire effects by removing fuel loads either mechanically or via prescribed burns to seeding the fire-affected areas with shrubs and native perennial forbs. There have been a number of studies at local scales to understand the direct impacts of wildfire on vegetation; however there is a larger gap in understanding these impacts at broad spatial and temporal scales. This need highlights the importance of dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) and remote sensing. In this study, we explored the influence of fire on vegetation composition and gross primary production (GPP) in the sagebrush ecosystem using the Ecosystem Demography (EDv2.2) model, a dynamic global vegetation model. We selected the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed (RCEW) to run our simulation study, an intensively monitored sagebrush-dominated ecosystem in the northern Great Basin. We ran point-based simulations at four existing flux tower sites in the study area for a total of 150 years after turning on the fire module in the 25th year. Results suggest dominance of shrubs in a non-fire scenario; however under the fire scenario we observed contrasting phases of high and low shrub density and C-3 grass growth. Regional model simulations showed a gradual decline in GPP for fire-introduced areas through the initial couple of years instead of killing all the vegetation in the affected area in the first year itself. We also compared the results from EDv2.2 with satellite-derived GPP estimates for the areas in the RCEW burned by a wildfire in 2015 (Soda Fire). We observed moderate pixel-level correlations between maps of post-fire recovery EDv2.2 GPP and MODIS-derived GPP. This study contributes to understanding the application of ecosystem models to investigate temporal dynamics of vegetation under alternative fire regimes and post-fire ecosystem restoration.

TI  - Inequality and Urban Density: Socio-economic Drivers of Uneven Densification in Cape Town
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND URBANIZATION ASIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Global policies promote urban compaction to achieve sustainable development. This article highlights the limits of analysing densification at the city scale and advocates for a more granular approach. The case study of Cape Town shows how overall consolidation has been mainly driven by poor households crowding into already dense neighbourhoods on the urban periphery. This has aggravated historic segregation and intensified urban management challenges. Meanwhile, formal private sector driven densification strengthens the social and economic vibrancy of affluent neighbourhoods. This article argues that uneven residential patterns reflect deep-seated social inequalities that are amplified through labour and property markets. Satellite data also illustrates how Cape Town's built-up area has changed between 1998 and 2019. Based on geo-spatial analyses, the article suggests that taking these drivers seriously is crucial to promoting a denser and more equitable urban form. Aligning housing policies with spatial transformation and economic development objectives offer possibilities for change.

TI  - Eigen vector-based classification of pearl millet crop in presence of other similar structured (sorghum and maize) crops using fully polarimetric Radarsat-2 SAR data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The effect of structure and phenology of dryland crops on SAR scattering mechanisms is under explored and under reported. This study aims to understand the complex scattering mechanisms occurring in similar structured crops and to discriminate pearl-millet crop using single date Radarsat-2 SAR data. The study arrived at few significant findings that the panicle stage isthe critical stage for discriminating pearl-millet from similar structured sorghum and maize crops. Alpha angle extracted from eigen-vector based decomposition was identified as the discriminating factor. Average alpha value almost reached 55 degrees due to dihedral scattering occurring in the prominent panicles which emerge early in pearl millet compared to maize and sorghum. Wishart H-A-alpha technique discriminated pearl millet, maize and sorghum crops with a producer's accuracy of about 87.8%, 71.6% and 71.4%, respectively. Paddy was classified with highest accuracy of 95.8% due to occurrence of dominant double bounce scattering in most of the fields.

TI  - Necessity of sentinel lymph node biopsy in ductal carcinoma in situ patients: a retrospective analysis
T2  - BMC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundSentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is unnecessarily performed too often, owing to the high upstaging rates of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). This study aimed to evaluate the upstaging rates of DCIS to invasive cancer, determine the prevalence of axillary lymph node metastasis, and identify the clinicopathological factors associated with upstaging and lymph node metastasis. We also examined surgical patterns among DCIS patients and determined whether SLNB guidelines were followed.MethodsWe retrospectively analysed 307 consecutive DCIS patients diagnosed by preoperative biopsy in a single centre between 2014 and 2018. Data from clinical records, including imaging studies, axillary and breast surgery types, and pathology results from preoperative and postoperative biopsies, were extracted. Univariate analyses using Chi-square tests and multiple logistic regression analyses were used to analyse the data.ResultsThe rate of upstaging to invasive cancer was 19.2% (59/307). DCIS diagnosed by core-needle biopsy (odds ratio [OR]: 6.861, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.429-19.379), the presence of ultrasonic mass-forming lesions (OR: 2.782, 95% CI: 1.224-6.320), and progesterone receptor-negative status (OR: 3.156, 95% CI: 1.197-8.323) were found to be associated with upstaging. The rate of sentinel lymph node metastasis was only 1.9% (4/202), and all were total mastectomy patients diagnosed by core-needle biopsy. SLNB was performed in 37.2% of 145 breast-conserving surgery patients and 91.4% of 162 total mastectomy patients. Among the 202 patients who underwent SLNB, 145 (71.7%) without invasive cancer on final pathology had redundant SLNB. Two of 59 patients (3.4%) with disease upstaged to invasive cancer had inadequate primary staging of the axilla, as the rate seemed sufficiently small.ConclusionsIn patients with a preoperative diagnosis of DCIS, although an unavoidable possibility of upstaging to invasive cancer exists, axillary metastasis is unlikely. Only 2.7% of patients with DCIS undergoing total mastectomy were found to have sentinel lymph node metastases. SLNB should not be performed in breast-conserving surgery patients and should be reserved only for total mastectomy patients diagnosed by core-needle biopsy.

TI  - The <i>Fengyun</i>-3E/<i>Joint Total Solar Irradiance Absolute Radiometer</i>: Instrument Design, Characterization, and Calibration
T2  - SOLAR PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Joint Total Solar Irradiance Monitor (JTSIM) is due to fly onboard the Fengyun-3E spacecraft and aims to measure the Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) in orbit. The instruments on the Fengyun-3E/JTSIM include the Digital Absolute Radiometer (DARA) from the Physikalisch Meteorologisches Observatorium, Davos and World Radiation Center (PMOD/WRC) and the Solar Irradiance Absolute Radiometer (SIAR) from the Changchun Institute of Optics, Fine Mechanics and Physics Chinese Academy of Sciences (CIOMP/CAS). Radiometers from Switzerland and China will monitor the TSI variability on the same pointing system for eight years. The scientific data from JTSIM will support the analysis of potential long-term trends in the Sun's variability. In this article, we describe the sensor box and the electronics box of JTSIM, the measurement principle, and the operation mode of SIAR. Before launch, we accomplished some primary calibrations of SIAR in the CIOMP laboratory, including the aperture area, cavity absorption, non-equivalence, diffraction, etc. Other parameters will be calibrated on orbit. The combined uncertainty of SIAR for characterization is 231 - 233 ppm depending on the measurement channel. The characterization of SIAR is an International System of Units (SI)-native scale calibration. An end-to-end calibration against the World Radiometric Reference (WRR) standard or the Total Irradiance Radiometer Facility (TRF) is a procedure where SIAR is directly calibrated with the WRR reference radiometers. The WRR factor for SIAR is 0.99939 - 1.00092 and the combined measurement uncertainty is 0.074% - 0.099%, depending on the measurement channel.

TI  - Land Cover Changes and Urban Expansion in Chongqing, China: A Study Based on Remote Sensing Images
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND URBANIZATION ASIA
M3  - Article
AB  - China has experienced an unprecedented rate of urbanization in recent decades. As a city with strong political and economic influences in the southwest of China, Chongqing is a typical example of rapidurban development in this period of time. To study the land cover changes and urban expansion of Chongqing, Landsat images from 1999 to 2018 were selected, processed, and quantitatively analysed The results showed that the built-up area of the city had increased tremendously during these years, yet vegetation still accounted for the vast majority of the city's land area. Restricted by the local topography including mountains and hills and infrastructure constructions, the urbanization process that occurred in central Chongqing actually showed a dominant expansion direction, an obvious spatial clustering tendency, and significant spatio-temporal differences among various regions.

TI  - A revised mineral dust emission scheme in GEOS-Chem: improvements in dust simulations over China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mineral dust plays a significant role in climate change and air quality, but large uncertainties remain in terms of dust emission prediction. In this study, we improved treatment of the dust emission process in a global 3-D chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem v12.6.0), by incorporating the geographical variation of aerodynamic roughness length (Z(0)), smooth roughness length (Z(0)s) and soil texture and by introducing the Owen effect and the formulation of the sand-blasting efficiency alpha by Lu and Shao (1999). To investigate the impact of the modifications incorporated in the model, several sensitivity simulations were performed for a severe dust storm during 27 March to 2 April 2015 over northern China. Results show that simulated threshold friction velocity is very sensitive to the updated Z(0) and Z(0)s field, with the relative difference ranging from 10% to 60% compared to the original model with a uniform value. The inclusion of the Owen effect leads to an increase in surface friction velocity, which mainly occurs in the arid and semi-arid regions of northwest China. The substitution of a fixed value of alpha assumed in the original scheme with one varying with friction velocity and soil texture based on observations reduces alpha by 50% on average, especially over regions with sand texture. Comparisons of sensitivity simulations and measurements show that the revised scheme with the implementation of updates provides more realistic threshold friction velocities and PM10 mass concentrations. The performance of the improved model has been evaluated against surface PM10 observations as well as MODIS aerosol optical depth (AOD) values, showing that the spatial and temporal variation of mineral dust are better captured by the revised scheme. Due to the inclusion of the improvement, average PM10 concentrations at observational sites are more comparable to the observations, and the average mean bias (MB) and normalized mean bias (NMB) values are reduced from -196.29 mu gm(-3) and -52.79% to -47.72 mu gm(-3) and 22.46% respectively. Our study suggests that the erodibility factor, sandblasting efficiency and soil-related properties which are simply assumed in the empirical scheme may lack a physical mechanism and spatial-temporal representativeness. Further study and measurements should be conducted to obtain a more realistic and detailed map of these parameters in order to improve dust representation in the model.

TI  - Sentinel node mapping vs. sentinel node mapping plus back-up lymphadenectomy in high-risk endometrial cancer patients: Results from a multi-institutional study
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. Sentinel node mapping (SLN) has replaced lymphadenectomy for staging surgery in apparent early-stage low and intermediate risk endometrial cancer (EC). Only limited data about the adoption of SNM in high risk EC is still available. Here, we evaluate the outcomes of high-risk EC undergoing SNM (with or without back-up lymphadenectomy).Methods. This is a multi-institutional international retrospective study, evaluating data of high-risk (FIGO grade 3 endometrioid EC with myometrial invasion >50% and non-endometrioid histology) EC patients undergoing SNM followed by back-up lymphadenectomy and SNM alone.Results. Chart of consecutive 196 patients were evaluated. The study population included 83 and 113 patients with endometrioid and non-endometrioid EC, respectively. SNM alone and SNM followed by back-up lymphadenectomy were performed in 50 and 146 patients, respectively. Among patients having SNM alone, 14 (28%) were diagnosed with nodal disease. In the group of patients undergoing SNM plus back-up lymphadenectomy 34 (23.2%) were diagnosed with nodal disease via SNM. Back-up lymphadenectomy identified 2 (1%) additional patients with nodal disease (in the para-aortic area). Back-up lymphadenectomy allowed to remove adjunctivepositive nodes in 16 (11%) patients. After the adoption of propensity-matched algorithm, we observed that patients undergoing SNM plus back-up lymphadenectomy experienced similar disease-free survival (p = 0.416, log-rank test) and overall survival (p = 0.940, log-rank test) than patients undergoing SLN alone. Conclusions. Although the small sample size, and the retrospective study design this study highlighted that type of nodal assessment did not impact survival outcomes in high-risk EC. Theoretically, back-up lymphadenectomy would be useful in improving the removal of positive nodes, but its therapeutic value remains controversial.Objective.

TI  - <i>Prenatal</i> exposure to maternal stressful life events and earlier age at menarche: the Raine Study
T2  - HUMAN REPRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - STUDY QUESTION: Is there an association between prenatal exposure to stressful life events and age at menarche, and does childhood BMI mediate this association?SUMMARY ANSWER: Girls exposed to prenatal stress had a slightly earlier age at menarche, but this association did not show a dose-response effect and was not mediated by childhood offspring BMI.WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN: Prenatal stress may impact on reproductive function in females including age at menarche, but human data are very limited. High childhood BMI is known to be associated with earlier age at menarche. Only one small study has measured the association between maternal stress and age at menarche and reported that childhood BMI mediated the association between maternal stress and earlier age at menarche. However, neither maternal stress nor age at menarche was prospectively recorded and the study was limited to 31 mother-daughter pairs.STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: The Raine Study is a large prospective population-based pregnancy cohort study (n = 1414 mother-daughter pairs) continuously followed from prenatal life through to adolescence. In the present study, we examined the association between exposure to maternal stressful life events during early, late and total gestation and age at menarche in offspring using 753 mother-daughter pairs with complete case information.PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Mothers prospectively reported stressful life events during pregnancy at 18 and 34 weeks using a standardized 10-point questionnaire. Exact date of menarche was assessed using a purpose-designed questionnaire at 8, 10, 14 and 17 years of age. Complete information on exposure, outcome and confounding variables was obtained from 753 mothers-daughter pairs. Multivariate linear regression complete case analysis was used to examine associations between maternal stressful life event exposure and age at menarche. Potential selection bias was evaluated using multiple imputations (50 datasets). The mediating effects of offspring childhood BMI (ages 5, 8, or 10 years) on these associations were measured in separate sub-analyses.MAIN RESULTS AND ROLE OF CHANCE: Most (580/753, 77%) daughters were exposed to at least one prenatal stressful life event. Exposure to maternal stressful life events during the entire pregnancy was associated with a non-linear earlier age at menarche. Exposure to one event and two or more psychological stressful events was associated with a 3.5 and 1.7-month earlier onset of puberty, respectively when compared to the reference group with no exposure maternal stressful life events. The estimates from multiple imputation with 50 datasets were comparable with complete case analysis confirming the existence of an underlying effect. No separate significant effects were observed for exposure during early or late gestation. The association between prenatal stressful events and age at menarche was not mediated by childhood BMI in the offspring.LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Stressful life events may have affected pregnant women in different ways and selfperceived maternal stress severity may have provided a more precise estimate of gestational psychological stress. The observed non-linear U-shape of the association between maternal psychological stress and age at menarche did not reflect a dose-response. This suggests that the first exposure to prenatal stress exerts a greater effect on fetal reproductive development. A potential mechanism is via dramatic initial activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis following the first stressful life event which is greater than that observed following subsequent exposure to two or more maternal stressful life events. Whilst we adjusted for a priori chosen confounders, we cannot exclude residual confounding or confounding by factors we did not include. Maternal age at menarche was not available so the effects of familial history/genetics could not be assessed. There was a large loss due to the number of girls with no information on date of menarche and missing confounder information implying risk of selection bias and multiple imputation analyses did not fully exclude this risk (similar direction but slightly weaker estimate magnitude).WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Menarche is a sentinel reproductive event and earlier age at menarche carries implications for psychological, social and reproductive health and for long-term risk of common non-communicable diseases. Understanding the factors regulating age at menarche has extensive health implications. This is the first population-based cohort study in humans to demonstrate that prenatal psychological stress might directly modify age at menarche.

TI  - A cost-effectiveness analysis of three approaches for lymph node assessment in patients with low- and intermediate-risk endometrial cancer
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. To assess the cost-effectiveness of sentinel lymph node mapping compared to risk factor assessment and routine full lymph node dissection for the assessment of lymph nodes in patients with low-and intermediate-risk endometrioid endometrial cancer.Methods. A decision-analytic model was designed to compare three lymph node assessment strategies in terms of costs and effects: 1) sentinel lymph node mapping; 2) post-operative risk factor assessment (adjuvant therapy based on clinical and histological risk factors); 3) full lymph node dissection. Input data were derived from systematic literature searches and expert opinion. QALYs were used as measure of effectiveness. The model was built from a healthcare perspective and the impact of uncertainty was assessed with sensitivity analyses.Results. Base-case analysis showed that sentinel lymph node mapping was the most effective strategy for lymph node assessment in patients with low-and intermediate-risk endometrial cancer. Compared to risk factor assessment it was more costly, but the incremental cost effectiveness ratio stayed below a willingness-to-pay threshold of epsilon 20,000 with a maximum of epsilon 9637/QALY. Sentinel lymph node mapping was dominant compared to lymph node dissection since it was more effective and less costly. Sensitivity analyses showed that the outcome of the model was robust to changes in input values. With a willingness-to-pay threshold of epsilon 20,000 sentinel lymph node mapping remained cost-effective in at least 74.3% of the iterations.Conclusion. Sentinel lymph node mapping is the most cost-effective strategy to guide the need for adjuvant therapy in patients with low and intermediate risk endometrioid endometrial cancer.(c) 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Human and climate drivers of global biomass burning variability
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Biomass burning is one of the most critical factors impacting vegetation and atmospheric trends, with important societal implications, particularly when extreme weather conditions occur. Trends and factors of burned area (BA) have been analysed at regional and global scales, but little effort has been dedicated to study the interannual variability. This paper aimed to better understand factors explaining this variation, under the assumption that the more human control of fires the more frequently they occur, as burnings will be less dependent of weather cycles. Interannual variability of BA was estimated from the coefficient of variation of the annual BA (BA_CV) estimated from satellite data at 250 m, covering the period from 2001 to 2018. These data and the explanatory variables were resampled at 0.25-degree resolution for global analysis. Relations between this variable and explanatory factors, including human and climate drivers, were estimated using Random Forest (RF) and generalized additive models (GAM). BA_CV was negatively related to BA_Mean, implying that areas with higher average BA have lower variability as well. Interannual BA variability decreased when maximum temperature (TMAX) and actual and potential evapotranspiration (AET, PET) increased, cropland and livestock density increased and the human development index (HDI) values decreased. GAM models indicated interesting links with AET, PET and precipi-tation, with negative relation with BA_CV for the lower ranges and positive for the higher ones, the former indi-cating fuel limitations of fire activity, and the latter climate constrains. For the global RF model, TMAX, AET and HDI were the main drivers of interannual variability. As originally hypothesised, BA_CV was more dependent on human factors (HDI) in those areas with medium to large BA occurrence, particularly in tropical Africa and Central Asia, while climatic factors were more important in boreal regions, but also in the tropical regions of Australia and South America.(c) 2021 The Author(s).

TI  - Generation of spatio-temporally continuous evapotranspiration and its components by coupling a two-source energy balance model and a deep neural network over the Heihe River Basin
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) and its components of soil evaporation (E) and vegetation transpiration (T), as key variables for the water-energy exchange between the land surface and the atmosphere, are widely used in hydrological and agricultural applications. The land surface temperature based two-source energy balance (TSEB) model can provide high accuracy E, T and ET, which are spatio-temporally discontinuous, whereas the spatio-temporally continuous daily ET is more helpful in water resources management. In this study, to improve the continuity of estimates from the TSEB model, we developed a new combined model coupling the TSEB model and deep neural network (DNN) (TSEB_DNN). First, spatio-temporally continuous reference data was prepared based on the remote sensing and meteorological data as input, and E from soil and T from vegetation were obtained from the TSEB model under clear-sky condition as outputs. Then, the DNN was trained under clear-sky condition to obtain the relationship between E and T estimates from TSEB and reference data. Finally, the trained DNN was driven by the spatio-temporally continuous reference data to obtain spatio-temporally continuous E, T and ET. Compared with the ET estimates from the original TSEB model, the continuity was significantly improved for the TSEB_DNN model. The TSEB_DNN model was well consistent with the in situ measurements and had the overall correlation coefficient (R), root-mean-square-error (RMSE), and bias values of 0.88, 0.88 mm d(-1), and 0.37 mm d(-1), respectively. The ratio of T/ET estimates from the TSEB_DNN model had high accuracy against in situ measurements with RMSE and bias values of 7.49% and -2.22%, respectively. The combined model and the maps of E, T and ET will help improve water resource management.

TI  - Mapping crop types in complex farming areas using SAR imagery with dynamic time warping
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop type information is essential for many practical applications, yet its mapping is often constrained by inherent characteristics of most farming areas, such as fragmentation and small farm plots, changes in crop morphology across the season, and cloud cover. This study investigated whether these limitations could be overcome by using time-series of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and crop phenological information combined with different Dynamic Time Warping implementation strategies. Focusing on a fragmented landscape with small farm plots in the Netherlands, we used Sentinel-1 dual polarimetry (VV + VH) and TerraSAR-X single polarimetry (HH) images and the Dutch Basic Registration of Crop Plots (BRP) dataset for training and validation. Image pre-processing was followed by the generation of radar vegetation indices and polarimetric decomposition. Crop-specific responses to incident radar signal were analyzed, as well as the accuracy of the crop classification by Time-Weighted Dynamic Time Warping (twDTW) using either backscatter bands only or backscatter bands in combination with derived indices and polarimetric decomposition features. In addition, two further modified Dynamic Time Warping strategies, namely Variable Time Weight Dynamic Time Warping (vtwDTW) and Angular Metric for Shape Similarity (AMSS), were tested for their performance. Furthermore, we investigated the accuracy performance of a decision level fusion of TerraSAR-X and Sentinel-1 classification outputs. Results show that even in a fragmented landscape with relatively small plots (around 0.08 ha), crop types can be successfully mapped by using decision level fusion of the twDTW results of both sensors, reaching an accuracy of 77.1%. When using twDTW on Sentinel-1 (VV + VH) only, including Ratio, MRVI, and DPSVI indices, overall accuracy reached 69.5%; without those indices, accuracy was slightly lower (67.5%). Merging six different grain crops with similar leaf geometry into winter grains and summer grains improved classification accuracy to 80.6%. Our findings demonstrate that twDTW on SAR imagery allows to map crop types in fragmented landscapes with relatively small farm plots, offering potential for crop type mapping in areas with smallholder farming.

TI  - Development of remote sensing-based yield prediction models at the maturity stage of boro rice using parametric and nonparametric approaches
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This research aims to develop rice yield prediction models using satellite remote sensing-based vegetation indices at the optimum harvesting time before flash flooding. Five relevant vegetation indices, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), rice growth vegetation index (RGVI), moisture stress index (MSI), and leaf area index (LAI), were used to develop several empirical yield prediction models for rice production. For this research, Sentinel-2 images with 10 m spatial resolution was used for the haor area of Bangladesh. To calibrate and validate the remote sensing images at such large spatial and temporal scales, ground reference data of the vegetation indices were used. The generated models were validated using both parametric (simple and multiple) and nonparametric (artificial neural network, ANN) regression analyses. The crop yield models that were developed using regression analyses showed very significant agreement with the ground reference yield information. The best estimated performances for the RGVI (R-2 = 0.44), NDVI (R-2 = 0.63), NDVI (R-2 = 0.55), and NDVI (R-2 = 0.67) in the simple regression analyses were observed for 2017, 2018, and 2019 and the average of seasons from 2017 to 2019. On the other hand, the composite NDVI-RGVI (R-2 = 0.65), NDVI-NDWI (R-2 = 0.56), and NDVI-MSI (R-2 = 0.69) indices were the best-performing vegetation indices for developing boro rice yield prediction models using multiple regression. Nevertheless, in the ANN-based machine-learning results, NDVI exhibited higher accuracy for the average boro rice season (2017-2019) by using a simple regression approach (R-2 = 0.84) and multiple regression analysis (R-2 = 0.91) of the average NDV-IMSI composite index. Validation between the actual and predicted yields showed that more than 70% of the study area can be accurately predicted using vegetation indices with ground reference mean yield data. Moreover, in 2018, the predicted yields by using simple and multiple linear regression were 4.25 and 4.23 MT/ha, respectively. The developed models are applicable 118-132 days after planting (DAT) in any similar environment for agricultural practices. Therefore, the yield prediction models of boro rice at the maturity stage can be useful for farm risk management, insurance premium determinations, and relevant stakeholder decision-making to mitigate the effects of extreme flash flood events.

AB  - Introduction: Analytical Music Therapy (AMT) is an international model of music therapy that is an integral part of advanced training for music therapists. AMT training entails the study of music psychotherapy, techniques and strategies, individual and group supervision, as well as personal AMT therapy, by exploring music therapists' inner life. AMT training prepares aspiring music therapists to meet the challenges of the profession. Music therapists from all over the world have received AMT training and have applied their knowledge in various settings. Moreover, they have an opportunity to examine their worldview, values, personality, musical self, and interactions with clients.Method: To provide a better understanding of the historical perspectives, interviews with experienced educators and significant historical figures and literature review were performed. The significant information was contextualized, and verbatim statements from the interviewees were included.Results: Mary Priestley created AMT, Johannes Eschen and Inge Pedersen integrated the experiential component of AMT training into music therapy programs in Europe, and Benedikte Scheiby was instrumental in developing a postgraduate training program in New York from 1997 to 2018. She was an integral part of the new AMT training initiative at Molloy College, the first university-based AMT training program.Discussion: This paper identifies historical perspectives, its current state, and the benefits and challenges of AMT training. Various viewpoints of AMT training are discussed. This analysis can help music therapists to honor the pioneers' legacy and to contribute to the further development of AMT.

TI  - Analysis of inbreeding depression in the tea plant (<i>Camellia sinensis</i>) based on the self-compatible cultivar 'Ziyan'
T2  - SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE
M3  - Article
AB  - Most tea plants (Camellia sinensis) are considered self-incompatible (SI). It is difficult to identify self-compatible (SC) tea mutants through controlled hand-pollination. 'Ziyan' (ZY), a purple tea cultivar, was previously found to be SC by pedigree relationship reconstruction of its offspring using DNA markers. To assess the inbreeding depression in C. sinensis, in this study we identified 29 selfing progeny plants (SP) of ZY and compared their fitness traits and contents of secondary metabolites with the out-crossing progeny (OP, n = 38 plants) and the clonal mother ZY (n = 3 plants). The results showed that fitness traits, including root-collar diameter, matured leaf area, and fruit number of SP, were significantly lower than those of OP and ZY. Notably, the average fruit number of SP was only 9.0 % of ZY and 7.3 % of OP. The spring bud flush time of SP was also significantly later than the OP as indicated by the sprouting index on March 30th, 2020. However, the average content of anthocyanin of SP was 3.67 times that of OP. The total catechin and caffeine contents in SP were lower than those in OP and ZY, but less significantly. Together, the results indicated a strong inbreeding depression of fitness traits in the first selfing generation of ZY, while the impacts on secondary metabolites were not consistent. In addition, a possible homozygous lethal allele was found on LG03. The findings of this study have useful implications for inbred line-based breeding and researches in C. sinensis.

TI  - Identification of impact factors for differentiated patterns of NDVI change in the headwater source region of Brahmaputra and Indus, Southwestern Tibetan Plateau
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying the driving forces and mechanisms underlying vegetation change is critical to globally adapting to future climate change. However, this topic remains unclear for ecosystems within the Headwater Source Region of Brahmaputra and Indus (HSRBI), southwestern Tibetan Plateau. In this study, vegetation changes, in terms of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), were detected for breakpoints for the period of 2000-2017 by segment regression analysis. The effects of 14 potential environmental variables on vegetation dynamics were estimated and quantified via random forest modelling. Our results showed that monotonic increases (MI) and abrupt increases (AI) in NDVI accounted for 39.87% and 22.55% of vegetation change, respectively. In contrast, monotonic decreases (MD) and abrupt decreases (AD) only accounted for 19.38% and 7.65% of vegetation change, respectively. Our findings also confirmed that climate change was the most crucial driver of vegetation change in the HSRBI, and human disturbance was responsible for abrupt changes in vegetation. The primary MI pattern was affected by distance to the replenishment water source, which contributed to 21.36% of vegetation change. The distance to lakes was an essential factor associated with vegetation greening. AI was mainly affected by the interaction between human disturbance and climate change, which contributed to 27.12% and 26.89% of vegetation changes, respectively. Distance to residential areas was the most significant factor that linked the human disturbance to abrupt vegetation changes. AD and MD were inclined to be affected by the variation in climate variables. Finally, this study will help to identify multidimensional mechanisms of vegetation change and aid ecosystem stability in the headwater zones.

TI  - Improving the resolution of UAV-based remote sensing data of water quality of Lake Hachiroko, Japan by neural networks
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing techniques for periodically collecting global data have been widely used for water quality monitoring. Satellites with a ground resolution of 10 to 30 m obtain information over broad areas, making it difficult to use them to evaluate local water quality. Methods for improving satellite data resolution allow for water quality monitoring over both wide and local areas. However, previous studies have failed to target water bodies that undergo drastic changes; moreover, they have not sufficiently examined features contributing to resolution improvement. This study proposes a resolution improvement method using a neural network, which performs learning so that the output matches the high-resolution data when the target pixel and its surrounding pixels in the low-resolution data are input. Moreover, the band ratio of data obtained from an unmanned aerial vehicle was used in the learning process as an input feature. We investigated the (i) band ratio providing highly accurate resolution improvement and (ii) application of a new resolution improvement method to the estimation of suspended solid conditions for water quality parameters. Finally, the proposed method was compared with the bicubic method for validation. The results indicate that the estimated map at the band ratio B/R in the resolution improvement data created via the proposed method can be used to greatly improve the resolution in areas with high levels of suspended solids, compared to the water quality estimation maps created using the bicubic method.

TI  - Brain-implantable multifunctional probe for simultaneous detection of glutamate and GABA neurotransmitters
T2  - SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Glutamate (GLU) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) are neurotransmitters (NTs) with an essential role in signal transmission in the brain. Brain disorders, such as epilepsy, Alzheimer?s and Parkinson?s diseases, and traumatic brain injury can be linked to imbalances in the GLU-GABA homeostasis that occurs in sub-second to seconds time frames. Current measurement techniques can detect these two NT concentrations simultaneously only in vitro. The present work reports on the fabrication of a silicon multifunctional biosensor microarray probe for sub-second simultaneous GLU-GABA detection in real-time, with excellent analyte sensitivity and selectivity and in vivo capabilities. The novel Si probes feature four surface-functionalized platinum ultramicroelectrodes (UMEs) for simultaneous amperometric detection of GLU and GABA with a sentinel, and a built-in microfluidic channel for the introduction of neurochemicals in the proximity of the UMEs. The microchannel also allows functioning of an On-Demand In-situ Calibrator that runs in-situ biosensor calibration. The probe exhibited excellent robustness at insertion in agarose-gel brain-tissue-mimicking test, and remarkably high hydrogen peroxide sensitivity (a by-product of GLU-GABA enzyme biosensor) with values on the order of 5000 nA ?M -1 cm -2 and maximum sensitivities of 204 ? 15 nA ?M -1 cm -2 and 37 ? 7 nA ?M -1 cm -2 for GLU and GABA, respectively. Furthermore, the limit of detection of the biosensors reached as low as 7 nM, 165 nM and 750 nM for H 2 O 2, GLU and GABA, respectively and a temporal resolution of hundreds of milliseconds during in vivo studies using freely moving rats.

TI  - Spatio-temporal pattern of urban eco-environmental quality of Indian megacities using geo-spatial techniques
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization is often responsible for the degradation of urban eco-environmental quality (UEQ), which is comprised of ecological, environmental and anthropogenic components. Hence, frequently monitoring and tracking UEQ for sustainable cities and communities is recommendable. This study, attempted to compare UEQ of three rapidly growing Indian metros/megacities - Ahmedabad, Hyderabad and Bangalore. A remote sensing-based composite index, namely 'urban eco-environmental quality index' (UEQI), was constructed by utilizing Landsat 5 (TM), 8 (OLI-TIRS) satellite imageries and MODIS LST products of 1999/2000-2001 and 2018. Five vegetation indices (i.e. NDVI, SAVI, GVI, NDMI and TcWet) and four urban indices (i.e. BI, NDBI, UI and DTR) were categorized as per pressure-state-response (PSR) framework and integrated through spatial principal component analysis (SPCA) to construct the UEQI. The sensitivity and elasticity of UEQI had been tested with respect to population density (PD) and the percentage of impervious surface (IS). Subsequently, the spatio-temporal pattern (i.e. (non)sequential transition - from excellent to very poor) and spatial heterogeneity of UEQ were investigated using Moran's I, and local indicator of spatial auto-correlation (LISA). Result indicated overall UEQI value for selected cities during studied periods ranged from 0.20 to 2.20, where lower and higher value referred very poor and excellent UEQ, respectively. The most degraded UEQ was found in Bangalore (average UEQI values were 1.08 and 0.80 in 2001 and 2019, respectively); and the degradation rate was also quite inflated than other cities (i.e. UEQI 1.64 per year). Additionally, the spatio-temporal pattern of UEQI demonstrated that very poor and poor UEQ were primarily clustered in the city's centre and spilling out towards the outskirts of all cities during the studied periods. Overall, the proportional area under very poor UEQ category was increased i.e., 7.94%, 7.03% and 5.24% for Bangalore, Ahmedabad and Hyderabad, respectively. The non-sequential transition (i.e. excellent to poor or very poor) was prominent in Bangalore, which implied that rapid and abrupt degradation of UEQ. Whereas, Ahmedabad and Hyderabad followed mostly sequential transition. Besides, significant global (Moran's I = > 0.80) and LISA confirmed the non-randomness pattern of UEQ for three cities. The analysis of sensitivity ensured both PD and IS were strongly influenced poor UEQI (as R (2) >= 0.50). Elasticity of UEQI revealed 1% increase of IS would lead to declining of 0.64%, 0.46% and 0.21% of UEQI in Ahmedabad, Hyderabad and Bangalore, respectively. Moreover, the study's observation and findings could also be used for possible area intervention for 'area-based development' (ADB) and 'greenfield development' (GFD) plan, as recommended by 'climate-resilient smart city mission'.

TI  - Significant impact of nationwide SARS-CoV-2 lockdown measures on the circulation of other respiratory virus infections in Austria
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL VIROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Since the worldwide spread of SARS-CoV-2, different European countries reacted with temporary national lockdowns with the aim to limit the virus transmission in the population. Also Austria started a lockdown of public life in March 2020. Objectives: In this study we investigated whether the circulation of different respiratory virus infections in Austria, as assessed by the established respiratory virus surveillance system, is affected by these measures as well and may reflect the success of the lockdown in limiting respiratory virus transmission. Study design: Sentinel data obtained for influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus and rhinovirus cases were analyzed and compared between the season 2019/2020 and the five previous seasons. Results: We observed a rapid and statistically significant reduction of cumulative cases for all these viruses within short time after the lockdown in March 2020, compared to previous seasons (each p < 0.001). Also, sentinel screening for SARS-CoV-2 infections was performed and a decrease of SARS-CoV-2 was seen after the lockdown. While for the seasonally occurring viruses as influenza, respiratory syncytial virus or human metapneumovirus the lockdown led to the end of the annual epidemics, a re-increase of rhinovirus infections was observed after liberalization of numerous lockdown measures. Conclusions: Our data provide evidence that occurrence of different respiratory virus infections reflect not only the efficiency of lockdown measures taken against SARS-CoV-2 but it shows also the effects of lockdown releases on the transmission of respiratory viruses.

TI  - A new attention-based CNN approach for crop mapping using time series Sentinel-2 images
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate crop mapping is of great importance for agricultural applications, and deep learning methods have been applied on multi-temporal remotely sensed images to classify crops. However, due to the geographic heterogeneity, the spectral profiles of the same crop can vary spatially, and thus using the spectral features alone can limit the model performance in mapping crops in large scales. Moreover, it is a challenge for traditional deep learning models to accurately capture the important information from a large number of features. To address these issues, in this study, we developed a novel attention-based convolutional neural network (CNN) approach (Geo-CBAM-CNN) for crop classification using time series Sentinel-2 images. Specifically, geographic information of crops was first integrated into an advanced attention module, Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) to form a Geo-CBAM module which can help mitigate the impacts of geographic heterogeneity and restrain unnecessary information. Then, the developed Geo-CBAM module was embedded into a CNN model to boost the model?s attention both spectrally and spatially. The proposed Geo-CBAM-CNN model was validated on four main crops over six counties with different geographic environments in the U.S. Also, it was compared to three other state-of-the-art machine learning approaches, including CBAM-CNN, CNN and Random Forest (RF). The results showed that the proposed model achieved the best performance, reaching 97.82% overall accuracy, 96.82% Kappa coefficient and 96.96% Macro-average F1 score. Moreover, the developed Geo-CBAM-CNN model showed strong spatial adaptability, indicating its superior performance in large scale applications. Furthermore, by visualizing the structure of the Geo-CBAM-CNN, we found that the model automatically allocated different weights to the features, and generally, the red-edge features in the middle of the year obtained more attention.

T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF RANGE & FORAGE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Selecting the appropriate vegetation index for accurate biomass estimation is a prerequisite before and during the ecosystem management project. This study, aims to compare Vegetation Indices (VIs) that are combining both Visible and Near Infrared OLI bands (VNIR-VIs), Visible and Short Wave Infrared OLI bands and also NIR and Short Wave Infrared OLI bands (SWIR-VIs) in order to accurately model the Aboveground Biomass (AGB) of three widely-located study sites over the arid steppe lands in Algeria. The Simple Linear Model (SLM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were utilised as statistical learning techniques on data; firstly, from each study site separately, and secondly, from all study sites (pooled data). In all study sites, SVM improves R-2 with a mean of 4.5% and decreases the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Percentage of Error (PE), respectively, with 15.50 (kg DM ha(-1)) and 1.33% on average. In all cases, the SWIR-VIs outperforms the VNIR-VIs with an improvement rate of 40% of R-2 and an average reduction of 362.36 kg DM ha(-1) and 25% of RMSE and PE, respectively. The principal main improvement was found to involve the pooled data-based model utilising normalised difference VI form, which combines OLI2(0.452-0.512 mu m) with OLI7(2.107-2.294 mu m), (R-2 = 0.840, p < 0.0005).

TI  - Combined use of satellite image analysis, land-use statistics, and land-use-specific export coefficients to predict nutrients in drained peatland catchment
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Maintaining and improving surface water quality requires knowledge of nutrient and sediment loads due to past and future land-use practices, but historical data on land cover and its changes are often lacking. In this study, we tested whether land-use-specific export coefficients can be used together with satellite images (Landsat) and/or regional land-use statistics to estimate riverine nutrient loads and concentrations of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and suspended solids (SS). The study area, Simojoki (3160 km(2)) in northern Finland, has been intensively drained for peatland forestry since the 1960s. We used different approaches at multiple sub catchment scales to simulate TN, TP, and SS export in the Simojoki catchment. The uncertainty in estimates based on specific export coefficients was quantified based on historical land-use changes (derived from Landsat data), and an uncertainty boundary was established for each land-use. The uncertainty boundary captured at least 60% of measured values of TN, TP, and SS loads or concentrations. However, the uncertainty in estimates compared with measured values ranged from 7% to 20% for TN, 0% to 18% for TP, and 13% to 43% for SS for different catchments. Some discrepancy between predicted and measured loads and concentrations was expected, as the method did not account for inter-annual variability in hydrological conditions or river processes. However, combining historical land-use change estimates with simple export coefficients can be a practical approach for evaluating the influence on water quality of historical land-use changes such as peatland drainage for forest establishment.

TI  - How the interplay between management and interannual climatic variability influences the NDVI variation in a sub-Mediterranean pastoral system: Insight into sustainable grassland use under climate change
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The modification of precipitation regimes and the increase in summer aridity under the predicted climate change scenarios are hypothesized to have repercussions on the semi-extensive pastoral systems of Mediterranean grasslands, leading to change in forage quantity/quality, increased interannual variability in phytomass production, reduction of the carrying capacity of rangelands, and worsening of animal welfare. The research aims were to find what climatic features affect changes in the annual peak of Aboveground Net Primary Production (ANPP), and how topographic variables and management conditions influence these variations in a pastoral system of central Apennines (Italy). We monitored Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) variations at the peak of phytomass production using Landsat satellite images, used as a proxy for ANPP changes in the most productive phase of the growing season, when herds are carried to pastures and hay-meadows are mown, on a dataset of 10,000 randomly sampled pixels (30 ? 30 m), in the years 2003, 2007, 2009, 2010, and 2013-2015. We investigated the relation between NDVI and climatic variables, topographic parameters, vegetation physiognomy, and management type, using generalized linear mixed-effects modeling, variation partitioning, and correlation analysis. We observed an increase in average yearly temperatures and high variability in the rainfall seasonal distribution pattern, particularly of spring precipitation. Climatic fluctuations influenced the overall amount of forage production more than management and topographic conditions. The spring variation of climatic variables (precipitation in March, drought stress in April and May), the drought and cold stress intensities in the previous year and the cold stress in the preceding winter were the main drivers of NDVI change. The landform factors interacted with climate variability in determining the amplitude of NDVI changes, which were the widest in semi-flat mountain tops and flat valley bottoms and the smallest in south-facing slopes. The effect of the climatic variables on NDVI was different depending on the management condition, suggesting that grassland management partially filters the climatic drivers of changes in forage production. Based on our results, the most productive grassland communities and the areas used for grazing by domestic herbivores could be the most impacted by the predicted climate changes for the Mediterranean basin, potentially reducing the economic sustainability of semi-extensive farming in the Apennine mountains.

TI  - Increasing bamboo dominance in southwestern Amazon forests following intensification of drought-mediated fires
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the late 1980s the Amazon rainforest has been affected by major forest fires every 3?5 years, mainly in the southwestern portion of the region. Besides the reduction of forest biomass and changes in structure and floristic composition, these forest fires favor the expansion of bamboo in forests in the southwestern Amazon. However, we know little about the impact of fire on bamboo expansion and changes in forest structure. The goal of this study is to quantify forest degradation by fire in areas with bamboo in the eastern portion of the state of Acre, Brazil, based upon a combination of forest-inventory and satellite remote-sensing data. The forest fires were defined by remote sensing as those in which the crowns of the trees were directly or indirectly affected by fire to the point that they cause a detectable impact on the optical satellite images in the 1984?2016 period. We measured trees and bamboo in 6 ha distributed in twelve 0.5-ha plots (100 m ? 50 m) in unburned forest, forest burned in 2005, burned forest in 2010 and forest burned in both 2005 and 2010. Our results show change in the structure of the forest with a reduction in the number of live trees as the number of bamboo culms increases after the forest fires. The amount of breakage and damage to the trees by the bamboo culms can double or triple with the expansion of the bamboo after fire impact. Bamboo expansion was identified based on an increase of the proportion of pixels with near-infrared channel reflectance values > 3500. The impact of forest fires resulted in incursion and dominance of bamboo culms over an area of 120,000 ha, changing the forest type of this area to ?bamboo-dominated forest.? Our results clearly show that drought-induced forest fires with anthropogenic sources are capable of shifting the structure of forest in southwestern Amazonia towards bamboo-dominated forest. With future climate scenarios indicating more frequent and extensive droughts due to global warming, which, together with the use of fire for new deforestation and for managing pasture and agricultural fields, can be expected to cause more forests in southwestern Amazonia to be exposed to extensive fires and potential increase in bamboo density.

TI  - Land system transformations govern the trophic status of an urban wetland ecosystem: Perspectives from remote sensing and water quality analysis
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, urban wetlands are facing immense pressure from land use land cover changes (LULCCs) and associated water quality degradation that is severely affecting the trophic status of these ecosystems. This study analyzed water quality degradation resulting from land system changes in the vicinity of Khushalsar, an urban Wetland, in Srinagar City from 1980 to 2017. The analysis of satellite data indicated that this Wetland lost -18.1 ha from 1980 to 2017. During the same period, the urban area within the Wetland increased from 0.2% to 16.5%. The land cover changes assessed in the vicinity of Wetland indicated an increase of 119% and 62.8% in builtup and roads respectively. The analysis of surface water quality of the Wetland showed widespread degradation. The Trophic state index ranged from 73.4 to 84.6 indicating hyper-eutrophic waters. A snapshot of comparative water quality data from 2002 to 2018 revealed that the mean concentration of NO3--N increased from 219 to 433 pg L-1 and that of total phosphorus increased from 135.4 to 1,236 pg L-1 indicative of continuous nutrient enrichment. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) grouped eight sampling sites into four clusters based on likeliness of water quality characteristics. Similarly, discriminant analysis showed the formation of similar patterns of dusters, corroborating the HCA. Principal component analysis suggested three principal components accounting for a cumulative variance of 90.61%. The unplanned land system changes vis-a-vis human-induced water quality degradation together with the lack of a monitoring mechanism have brought the Khushalsar Wetland to its current hyper-eutrophic state.

TI  - The Copernicus Sentinel-6 mission: Enhanced continuity of satellite sea level measurements from space
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Given the considerable range of applications within the European Union Copernicus system, sustained satellite altimetry missions are required to address operational, science and societal needs. This article describes the Copernicus Sentinel-6 mission that is designed to provide precision sea level, sea surface height, significant wave height, inland water heights and other products tailored to operational services in the ocean, climate, atmospheric and land Copernicus Services. Sentinel-6 provides enhanced continuity to the very stable time series of mean sea level measurements and ocean sea state started in 1992 by the TOPEX/Poseidon mission and follow-on Jason-1, Jason-2 and Jason-3 satellite missions. The mission is implemented through a unique international partnership with contributions from NASA, NOAA, ESA, EUMETSAT, and the European Union (EU). It includes two satellites that will fly sequentially (separated in time by 5 years). The first satellite, named Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich, launched from Vandenburg Air Force Base, USA on 21st November 2020. The satellite and payload elements are explained including required performance and their operation. The main payload is the Poseidon-4 dual frequency (C/Ku-band) nadir-pointing radar altimeter that uses an innovative interleaved mode. This enables radar data processing on two parallel chains the first provides synthetic aperture radar (SAR) processing in Ku-band to improve the received altimeter echoes through better along-track sampling and reduced measurement noise; the second provides a Low Resolution Mode that is fully backward-compatible with the historical reference altimetry measurements, allowing a complete inter-calibration between the state-of-the-art data and the historical record. A three-channel Advanced Microwave Radiometer for Climate (AMR-C) provides measurements of atmospheric water vapour to mitigate degradation of the radar altimeter measurements. The main data products are explained and preliminary in-orbit Poseidon-4 altimeter data performance data are presented that demonstrate the altimeter to be performing within expectations.Y

TI  - Predicting Nonsentinel Lymph Node Metastasis in Breast Cancer: A Multicenter Retrospective Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy has been the standard modality for breast cancer patients with clinically node negative disease. In patients who undergo axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) due to SLN metastasis, the harvested nodes (non-SLNs) often contain no metastasis. Here, we evaluated the predictive factors associated with nonSLN metastasis in breast cancer patients.Materials and methods: This was a retrospective study of patients with operable cT1-3, cN0 invasive breast cancer who underwent SLN biopsy followed by ALND due to SLN metastasis. The clinicopathologic factors and predictive factors of non-SLN metastasis were analyzed. The optimal cutoff for the Ki67 index and the number of positive and negative SLNs that were predictive of non-SLN metastasis were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curves.Results: The median number of SLN and non-SLN was 3 and 11, respectively. Of the 150 patients, 52 (35.0%) had metastases in non-SLNs. The optimal cutoffs for the Ki67 index and the number of positive and negative SLNs were of 12%, 2, and 1, respectively. In the univariate analysis, the Ki67 index and the number of positive SLNs >= 2 and negative SLNs <= 1 were higher in the non-SLN thorn group than that in the non-SLN e group. The number of negative SLNs was as a predictive factor for non-SLNs metastasis in the multivariate analysis.Conclusions: The number of negative SLNs predicts the risk of non-SLN metastasis in breast cancer. When deciding on whether to omit ALND, the number of positive and negative SLNs should be considered. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Comparing different space-borne sensors and methods for the retrieval of land surface temperature
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The importance of land surface temperature (LST) is increasingly recognized, and various methodologies have been proposed for the retrieval of LST using space-borne thermal infrared data. However, the selection of LST retrieval from Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) of Landsat-8 based on different methods and the readily available MODIS LST products is still a challenging topic for local and global environmental studies. In this study, the potential of three different methods for retrieving LST using Landsat-8 TIRS data, including Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE), Single Channel (SC), and Split Window (SW) method in comparison with MODIS MOD11A1 LST product was evaluated. For accuracy assessment, 0 cm ground surface temperature (LSTGST) data was used. Our results almost showed same accuracy for RTEB10 with RMSE = 0.35 degrees C, followed by MODIS with RMSE = 0.36 degrees C, and SCB10 with RMSE = 0.38 degrees C. Secondly, SCmean (Mean of B-10 and B-11), and RTEmean (Mean of B-10 and B-11) generate nearly the same accuracy with RMSE = 0.53 degrees C, and RMSE = 0.54 degrees C, respectively. The other methods viz., SCB11, RTEB11, and SW method slightly showed lower accuracy with RMSE = 0.87 degrees C, RMSE = 0.88 degrees C, and RMSE = 0.91 degrees C, respectively. We found all the methods highly accurate and can be used successfully by climatologists, environmentalists, hydrologists, and urban planners concerning planning, and monitoring of the ever-increasing LST at local and global scale studies.

TI  - Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in Swedish household dust and exposure of pet cats
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are used in a wide range of products and have been found ubiquitously in our indoor environment, and there is evidence that exposure to PFAS can lead to adverse endocrine effects, such as thyroid hormone disruption. Pet cats have a high dust intake due to their grooming behavior and have been shown to be a suitable sentinel species for assessment of toddler's exposure. Here we used paired household dust (n=46) and cat serum (n=27) samples to establish whether dust is a relevant exposure pathway to PFASs. An analytical method for PFAS analysis was optimized using a low volume of cat serum samples, combining solid-phase extraction and online sample cleanup. Dust was extracted with methanol by sonication and cleaned up by addition of active carbon. In total, 27 PFASs were analyzed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis. The correlation between PFAS levels in dust and serum, serum lipids and thyroid hormone levels, and PFAS levels in dust between different rooms were statistically evaluated. PFOS and PFDA could be quantified in all cat serum samples (median 2300 pg/mL and 430 pg/mL, respectively), followed by PFOA (median 1100 pg/mL), quantified in 96% of the samples. The levels of 6:2 and 8:2 diPAPs were determined in 65% and 92% of the serum samples, respectively, and were an order of magnitude lower (1.4-160 pg/mL). Household dust on the other hand was dominated by 6:2 and 8:2 diPAPs, with a median of 65 ng/g dust and 49 ng/g dust, respectively. PFOS (median 13 ng/g dust) and PFOA (median 9 ng/g dust) were quantified in 93% of the dust samples. Only eight PFASs were detected (>LOD) in at least 50% of the samples of both matrices and could be paired. Significant correlations between cat serum and dust were found for PFOA (r(S)=0.32, p<0.049) and PFUnDA (r(S)=0.55, p<0.001). Significant positive correlations were found between serum total thyroxine (r(S)=0.11, p<0.05) and PFNA and between serum cholesterol and PFHpA (r(S)=0.46, p<0.01), PFUnDA (r(S)=0.40, p<0.05), PFDoDA (r(S)=0.44, p<0.01), and sum PFAS (r(S)=0.48, p<0.01). In conclusion, this study confirmed that dust is a relevant exposure pathway for the ingestion of some PFASs for cats, and the serum levels of PFASs could be of relevance for the cat's health.

TI  - Comparative assessment of drought monitoring index susceptibility using geospatial techniques
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - There are two main categories of dryness monitoring indices based on spectral feature space. One category uses the vertical distance from any point to a line passing through the coordinate origin, which is perpendicular to a soil line, to monitor the dryness conditions. The most popular indices are the Perpendicular Dryness Index (PDI) and the modified perpendicular dryness index (MPDI). The other category uses the distance from any point in feature space to the coordinate origin to represent the dryness status, for instance, the soil moisture (SM) monitoring index (SMMI) and the modified soil moisture monitoring index (MSMMI). In this study, the performances and differences of these four indicators were evaluated using field-measured SM (FSM) data based on Gaofen-1 (GF-1) wide field of view (WFV), Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), and Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) sensors. Performance evaluations were conducted in two study areas, namely an arid and semi-arid region of northwest China and a humid agricultural region of southwest Canada. We employed gradient-based structural similarity (GSSIM) to quantitatively assess the similarity of the structural information and structural characteristics among these four indicators. Monitoring SM in bare soil or low vegetation-covered areas in the semi-arid region, the SMMI, PDI, MSMMI, and MPDI from Near-Infrared (NIR)-Red had significantly negative linear correlations with the FSM at 0-5-cm depth (P < 0.01). However, SMMI was better than PDI in estimating SM in bare soil, which was better than MSMMI and MPDI for GF-1. Moreover, the PDI and SMMI had similar SM evaluation abilities, which were better than those of MPDI and MSMMI for Landsat-8. The GSSIM map of the SMMI/PDI and the MSMMI/MPDI showed that the low change areas accounted for 99.89% and 98.89% for GF-1, respectively, and 95.78% and 94.45% for Landsat-8, respectively. This result indicated that the SMMI, PDI, MSMMI, and MPDI values from NIR-Red in low vegetation cover were similar. In monitoring SM in agricultural vegetation areas, the accuracy of the four indices from Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR) feature space was higher than that from NIR-Red feature space for Sentinel-2. The SM monitoring effect of MSMMI and MPDI was better than that of SMMI and PDI. Due to the lack of SWIR band, GF-1 was limited in monitoring SM in vegetation-covered areas. The SMMI and MSMMI, which do not rely on the soil line, were more suitable than PDI and MPDI for retrieving SM in the complex surface environment depending on the soil line and the number of parameters. GF-1 with 16-m resolution had higher accuracy in SM assessment than Landsat-8 with 30-m resolution and had almost the same accuracy as Sentinel-2 with 20 m.

TI  - Evaluating the accuracy of spectral indices from Sentinel-2 data for estimating forest biomass in urban areas of the tropical savanna
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past decades, there has been significant challenges in the detection and quantification of urban forest biomass due to limitation of traditional methods (e.g. Field survey) which are not only costly but also impractical to monitor large and inaccessible areas. The application of accurate remote sensing data has greatly improved urban biomass estimation and modelling approaches due to development in new satellite sensors to address urban climate dynamics. For example, the launch of Sentinel-2 by the Copernicus programme of the European Union, which provides data down to 10 m, has been quite remarkable. In this study, four vegetation indices (VIs) were derived from the Sentinel-2 data for 2016 (the red and near-infrared bands (10 m)) which were atmospherically corrected by using the "Sen2Cor" tool. The sensitivities of the four VIs to biomass (normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), difference vegetation index (DVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI2) were assessed through a predictive modelling approach using thirty sixty (36) plots belonging to eleven (11) different tree species sampled at different locations along the major streets in the study area. All VIs significantly correlate with the field estimated biomass (p < 0.0001) using Pearson's correlation. Based on the correlation between the VIs and field measured biomass, we established a simple linear model using the 64% of the field data for model estimation while retaining the remaining 36% for evaluating the model accuracy. The assessments of model performance using the mean absolute error (NDVI = 8.91%, SAVI = 8.92%, EVI2 = 8.94%) indicated that the DVI (9.43%) had the largest error. Urban biomass maps are required for urban vegetation monitoring, urban cool/heat island modelling, climate change mitigation and adaptation research and model parameterization and validation.

TI  - Hierarchical Object-Based Mapping of Urban Land Cover Using Sentinel-2 Data: A Case Study of Six Cities in Central Europe
T2  - PFG-JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY REMOTE SENSING AND GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping and monitoring of urban land cover are becoming increasingly important in the face of ongoing climate change. The recently launched pair of Sentinel-2 satellites regularly delivers images with the highest spectral and spatial resolution among the freely available images. Based on these data, we proposed an object-based classification method for urban land-cover mapping at two basic scale levels. The proposed set of classification rules is transferable to different urban areas without the need to collect training samples. The inevitable problem of different spectral characteristics of vegetation in individual areas is solved by computing the area-specific thresholds using the central values of forest stands and grasslands read out of the histogram. Special features summarising the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) time-series using the Google Earth Engine platform were designed to distinguish cropland from other classes. The transferability of the rule sets was verified in six Central European cities with different climatic conditions-Bratislava, Nitra, and Zilina (Slovakia), Zakopane (Poland), and Kaposvar and Oroshaza (Hungary). The overall classification accuracy reached 78-90% in each tested area at the first hierarchical level, and 76-89% on the second level, respectively. The performance of the methodology was compared with the random forest (RF) machine learning method with training samples collected in Bratislava. The results confirmed that without area-specific training samples, the accuracy of the RF method is 5-35 percentage point (p.p.) lower than the accuracy of the proposed rule-based method. In addition, without the NDVI summary indices, the accuracy of the RF classifier decreased by another 10-30 p.p.

TI  - CrocO_v1.0: a particle filter to assimilate snowpack observations in a spatialised framework
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the evolution of snowpack properties in mountainous areas is crucial for avalanche hazard forecasting and water resources management. In situ and remotely sensed observations provide precious information on the state of the snowpack but usually offer limited spatiotemporal coverage of bulk or surface variables only. In particular, visible-near-infrared (Vis-NIR) reflectance observations can provide information about the snowpack surface properties but are limited by terrain shading and clouds. Snowpack modelling enables the estimation of any physical variable virtually anywhere, but it is affected by large errors and uncertainties. Data assimilation offers a way to combine both sources of information and to propagate information from observed areas to non-observed areas. Here, we present CrocO (Crocus-Observations), an ensemble data assimilation system able to ingest any snowpack observation (applied as a first step to the height of snow (HS) and Vis-NIR reflectances) in a spatialised geometry. CrocO uses an ensemble of snowpack simulations to represent modelling uncertainties and a particle filter (PF) to reduce them. The PF is prone to collapse when assimilating too many observations. Two variants of the PF were specifically implemented to ensure that observational information is propagated in space while tackling this issue. The global algorithm ingests all available observations with an iterative inflation of observation errors, while the klocal algorithm is a localised approach performing a selection of the observations to assimilate based on background correlation patterns. Feasibility testing experiments are carried out in an identical twin experiment setup, with synthetic observations of HS and Vis-NIR reflectances available in only one-sixth of the simulation domain. Results show that compared against runs without assimilation, analyses exhibit an average improvement of the snow water equivalent continuous rank probability score (CRPS) of 60 % when assimilating HS with a 40-member ensemble and an average 20 % CRPS improvement when assimilating reflectance with a 160-member ensemble. Significant improvements are also obtained outside the observation domain. These promising results open a possibility for the assimilation of real observations of reflectance or of any snowpack observations in a spatialised context.

TI  - LUCAS Copernicus 2018: Earth-observation-relevant in situ data on land cover and use throughout the European Union
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - The Land Use/Cover Area frame Survey (LUCAS) is an evenly spaced in situ land cover and land use ground survey exercise that extends over the whole of the European Union. LUCAS was carried out in 2006, 2009, 2012, 2015, and 2018. A new LUCAS module specifically tailored to Earth observation (EO) was introduced in 2018: the LUCAS Copernicus module. The module surveys the land cover extent up to 51m in four cardinal directions around a point of observation, offering in situ data compatible with the spatial resolution of high-resolution sensors. However, the use of the Copernicus module being marginal, the goal of the paper is to facilitate its uptake by the EO community. First, the paper summarizes the LUCAS Copernicus protocol to collect homogeneous land cover on a surface area of up to 0.52 ha. Secondly, it proposes a methodology to create a ready-to-use dataset for Earth observation land cover and land use applications with high-resolution satellite imagery. As a result, a total of 63 364 LUCAS points distributed over 26 level-2 land cover classes were surveyed on the ground. Using homogeneous extent information in the four cardinal directions, a polygon was delineated for each of these points. Through geospatial analysis and by semantically linking the LUCAS core and Copernicus module land cover observations, 58 426 polygons are provided with level-3 land cover (66 specific classes including crop type) and land use (38 classes) information as inherited from the LUCAS core observation. The open-access dataset supplied with this paper (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9. figshare.12382667.v4 d'Andrimont, 2020) provides a unique opportunity to train and validate decametric sensor-based products such as those obtained from the Copernicus Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites. A follow-up of the LUCAS Copernicus module is already planned for 2022. In 2022, a simplified version of the LUCAS Copernicus module will be carried out on 150 000 LUCAS points for which in situ surveying is planned. This guarantees a continuity in the effort to find synergies between statistical in situ surveying and the need to collect in situ data relevant for Earth observation in the European Union.

TI  - A systematic review of seroma formation following drain-free mastectomy
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Seroma is a common complication after mastectomy. The aim of this review is to elucidate whether closed suction drainage can safely be omitted in patients undergoing mastectomy when assessing seroma formation and its complications. The second aim is to assess the influence of flap fixation on seroma related complications, as there is existing evidence showing that combining mastectomy with flap fixation may make the use of drainage systems obsolete.Search & selection: A review of the literature was performed and articles that compared mastectomy with drainage and mastectomy without drainage were selected. Due to the small number of eligible studies, no selection based on whether flap fixation was performed was possible. If outcome was described in terms of seroma formation or seroma related complications, papers were eligible for inclusion. Studies older than 20 years, animal studies, studies not written in English and studies with male patients were excluded.Results: A total of eight articles were eligible for inclusion. Four prospective studies and four retrospective studies were included. In four studies, flap fixation was performed. Frequency of seroma formation as well as seroma that required intervention was reported. The included studies demonstrated that omitting closed suction drainage does not lead to a higher incidence of seroma formation in patients undergoing mastectomy.Conclusion: Despite substantial heterogeneity, there is evidence that drainage can safely be omitted without exacerbating seroma formation and its complications. A well-powered, randomized controlled trial evaluating the effect of drainage omission on seroma formation, with or without flap fixation, is needed.

TI  - Testing the use of single- and multi-mission satellite altimetry for the calibration of hydraulic models
T2  - ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite altimetry is increasingly considered as a valuable source of information in many hydrological and hydraulic applications. However, the accuracy of different sensors adopted for monitoring the water level from satellite and the limited temporal resolution that characterizes each sensor (i.e. revisit time most of time varying from 10 to 35 days; 369 days in case of CryoSat mission) still hamper their common use. Recently introduced multi-mission (MM) densified time series might represent a possible alternative to ensure higher spatial and temporal coverage. Though, a comparison of the potential of different altimetry products, including MM series, for hydrodynamic model calibration is still missing. This study attempts to fill this gap investigating how available altimetry series perform over a stretch of the Po River (nearly 140 km across Northern Italy) in calibrating a quasi-2D model built with detailed topographic information. Specifically, objectives are manifold: i) to provide a comparison of satellite altimetry products available to the research community and commonly used in hydraulic modelling (Envisat, Envisat extended mission, ERS-2, TOPEX/Poseidon, SARAL/AltiKa, Jason-2, Jason-3, Sentinel 3A, Sentinel 3B and CryoSat); ii) to evaluate the performance of MM satellite series in calibrating a hydraulic model relative to single-mission series; and iii) to investigate the importance of the number of observations (series length) for each mission.Results of the model calibration depict a general improvement of satellite performance over time, moving from the oldest to more recent missions, with the exception of Envisat extended series. In general, Jason-2, Sentinel 3A and Sentinel 3B outperform other series both in terms of calibration error and number of measurements required to achieve a reliable calibration. MM series provide errors larger than those obtained from original single-mission time series considered with their overall length, but they provide more reliable calibrations than altimetric time series with low sampling rate (i.e., Envisat, Envisat extended, and SARAL/AltiKa) or those that cover very short periods (e.g. altimetry series limited to 20-40 months in length). The analysis offers additional insights into the possible use of altimetry series in hydrodynamic applications, providing a comparison of different original products and showing the potential, as well as limitations, offered by MM series.

TI  - Wet and dry spells in Senegal: comparison of detection based on satellite products, reanalysis, and in situ estimates
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the detection and characteristics of dry/wet spells (defined as episodes when precipitation is abnormally low or high compared to usual climatology) drawn from several datasets are compared for Senegal. Here, four datasets are based on satellite data (TRMM-3B42 V7, CMORPH V1.0, TAMSAT V3, and CHIRPS V2. 0), two on reanalysis products (NCEP-CFSR and ERAS), and three on rain gauge observations (CPC Unified V1.0/RT and a 65-rain-gauge network regridded by using two kriging methods, namely ordinary kriging, OK, and block kriging, BK). All datasets were converted to the same spatio-temporal resolution: daily cumulative rainfall on a regular 0.25 degrees grid. The BK dataset was used as a reference. Despite strong agreement between the datasets on the spatial variability in cumulative seasonal rainfall (correlations ranging from 0.94 to 0.99), there were significant disparities in dry/wet spells. The occurrence of dry spells is less in products using infrared measurement techniques than in products coupling infrared and microwave, pointing to more frequent dry spell events. All datasets show that dry spells appear to be more frequent at the start and end of rainy seasons. Thus, dry spell occurrences have a major influence on the duration of the rainy season, in particular through the "false onset" or "early cessation" of seasons. The amplitude of wet spells shows the greatest variation between datasets. Indeed, these major wet spells appear more intense in the OK and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) datasets than in the others. Lastly, the products indicate a similar wet spell frequency occurring at the height of the West African monsoon. Our findings provide guidance in choosing the most suitable datasets for implementing early warning systems (EWSs) using a multi-risk approach and integrating effective dry/wet spell indicators for monitoring and detecting extreme events.

T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Today, satellite altimetry is capable of observing the instantaneous sea level and is regarded as a standard tool in the study of waters level variations on both regional and global scales. In this research, we have introduced a software package under MATLAB called ATSAT, which is used to process the satellite altimetry data. ATSAT is able to process the observations of five satellites, namely Jason-1, Jason-2, Jason-3, Saral and Sentinel-3. This software program has certain capabilities: 1) Reading the observations related to the five satellites in the NetCDF format 2) Producing the time series obtained from the observations of each satellite at any desired point 3) Analyzing the outlier detection in the time series 4) Estimating the weight matrix pertinent to each time series using the Least Square Variance Components Estimation (LS-VCE) method 5) Considering the two noise models of White and White + Flicker for the variance components estimation and formation of the weight matrix for each time series 6) Estimating the average water level, as well as the amplitude of 22 main tide components at any desired point 7) Extracting the available frequencies in each time series using the Least Square Harmonic Estimation (LS-HE) method in the two modes of univariate and multivariate, and finally 8) Calculating the radial orbital error using the crossover adjustment.

TI  - Assessment of the Efficacy of Frozen Section Examination as an Intraoperative Tool in Detecting Metastasis of Axillary Lymph Node in Early Breast Cancer: A Tertiary Centre Experience
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy is the gold standard for axillary assessment in patients with clinically node negative breast cancer. Further management depends upon the histologic status of the retrieved sentinel nodes. Therefore, authors have been developing and searching for an accurate intraoperative method to detect or exclude metastasis in these nodes. Internationally accepted intraoperative assessment tools include frozen section, imprint cytology and molecular analysis. However, variable results derived from these studies led to a debate about which is the most reliable test. Therefore, we planned our study to assess the sensitivity and specificity of frozen section examination as it is still the most common practice in many centres especially in developing countries including Egypt. All were subjected to sentinel lymph node biopsy using both 1% patent blue dye and radioactive nanocolloid (combination technique). The retrieved sentinel nodes were sent for intraoperative frozen section evaluation which was later confirmed by the permanent paraffin section. The resultant sentinel node identification rate was 93.4%. Our case series analysis involved 458 patients with clinically negative early breast cancer. The study revealed that intraoperative frozen section had a specificity of 100% (0% false positive cases). However, it failed to detect micrometastasis in 7 of these patients (0.9% false negative) producing a 95.6% sensitivity (P value < 0.001). Based on the forementioned results and the previous studies' reports, we believe that the frozen section examination is a reliable assessment tool in intraoperative axillary staging with a high accuracy rate.

TI  - Deriving water level and discharge estimation using satellite altimetry for Krishna River, Karnataka
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Radar altimetry is the most commonly used approach for monitoring ocean's water level or inland water bodies over ungauged or poorly gauged regions. In this study, a network of three altimetry missions (i.e., Jason 3, Sentinel 3A, and Sentinel 3B) was traced in the Krishna river, Karnataka, India, for 2018 and 2019. The network consists of 13 virtual stations, of which two are of Jason 3, five are of Sentinel 3A, and six are of Sentinel 3B. This paper proposes a method to find river discharge solely using remote sensing derived data. The river depth is calculated using satellite altimetry, and other hydraulic parameters (river width and river bed slope) are used in modified Manning's equation for calculation of discharge. To estimate river width, Google Earth Engine is used to process Sentinel 1 and Sentinel 2 images. All three missions showed excellent results with an average RMSE of 1.43 m, and the best correlation is showed by Sentinel 3B (>0.97). The discharge calculated using this method also provides adequate results, with NS value for station 1 is 0.53, and for station 2 is 0.63. These results show the potential of the proposed approach for monitoring water level and estimation of discharge solely using satellite-derived products.

TI  - Large carbon sink potential of secondary forests in the Brazilian Amazon to mitigate climate change
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical secondary forests sequester carbon up to 20 times faster than old-growth forests. This rate does not capture spatial regrowth patterns due to environmental and disturbance drivers. Here we quantify the influence of such drivers on the rate and spatial patterns of regrowth in the Brazilian Amazon using satellite data. Carbon sequestration rates of young secondary forests (<20 years) in the west are similar to 60% higher (3.0 +/- 1.0 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)) compared to those in the east (1.3 +/- 0.3 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)). Disturbances reduce regrowth rates by 8-55%. The 2017 secondary forest carbon stock, of 294 Tg C, could be 8% higher by avoiding fires and repeated deforestation. Maintaining the 2017 secondary forest area has the potential to accumulate similar to 19.0 Tg C yr(-1) until 2030, contributing similar to 5.5% to Brazil's 2030 net emissions reduction target. Implementing legal mechanisms to protect and expand secondary forests whilst supporting old-growth conservation is, therefore, key to realising their potential as a nature-based climate solution.

TI  - Long-term standard sentinel node biopsy after neoadjuvant treatment in breast cancer: a single institution ten-year follow-up
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: In patients with positive lymph nodes (cN+) prior to neoadjuvant treatment (NAT), which convert to a clinically negative axilla (cN0) after treatment, the use of sentinel node biopsy (SNB) is still debatable, since the false-negative rate (FNR) is significantly high (12.6-14.2%). The objective of this retrospective mono-institutional study, with a long follow-up, aimed to evaluate the outcome in patients undergoing NAT who remained or converted to cN0 and received SNB independent of target axillary dissection (TAD) or the removal of at least 3 sentinel nodes (SNs).Methods: This study analyzed 688 consecutive cT1-3, cN0/1/2 patients, operated at the European Institute of Oncology, Milan, from 2000 to 2015 who became or remained cN0 after NAT and underwent SNB with a least one SN found. Axillary dissection (AD) was not performed if the SN was negative. Nodal radiotherapy (RT) was not mandatory.Results: Axillary failure occurred in 1.8% of the initially cN1/2 patients and in 1.5% of the initially cN0 patients. After a median follow-up of 9.2 years (IQR 5.3-12.3), the 5-and 10-year overall survival (OS) were 91.3% (95% CI, 88.8-93.2) and 81.0% (95% CI, 77.2-84.2) in the whole cohort, 92.0% (95% CI, 89.0-94.2) and 81.5% (95% CI, 76.9-85.2) in those initially cN0, 89.8% (95% CI, 85.0-93.2) and 80.1% (95% CI, 72.8-85.7) in those initially cN1/2.Conclusion: The 10-year follow-up confirmed our preliminary data that the use of standard SNB is acceptable in cN1/2 patients who become cN0 after NAT and will not translate into a worse outcome.(c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd, BASO -The Association for Cancer Surgery, and the European Society of Surgical Oncology.

TI  - Examining phenological variation of on-year and off-year bamboo forests based on the vegetation and environment monitoring on a New Micro-Satellite (VENμS) time-series data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Moso bamboo is an evergreen plant that extensively distributes in subtropical regions. Comparing to other forest types, Moso bamboo forest has some unique characteristics: high growth rate, short harvesting rotation, and on/off-year phenomenon. Plant phenology plays an important role in regulating carbon sequestration of the bamboo forest ecosystem. However, it is a challenge task to capture the phenological features of Moso bamboo forests on a regional scale due to frequent change of canopy structures and lack of high spatiotemporal remotely sensed data. The Vegetation and Environment monitoring on a New Micro-Satellite (VEN mu S) data with high spatiotemporal resolution provide the potential to examine the seasonal change of Moso bamboo forests. This research employs the VEN mu S time-series data (from January 2018 to December 2019) to analyse the spectral characteristics of on-year/off-year Moso bamboo forests and other two evergreen forest types (i.e., broadleaf forest and coniferous forest). The optimal spectral ranges for examining the seasonal variation of bamboo forests were determined. Three red-edge-based vegetation indices were reconstructed using the Harmonic analysis of time series (Hants) and compared. Red-edge position index (REPI) was selected to identify different phenological periods of Moso bamboo forests and other evergreen forest types. The results show that the spectral range of 730-920 nm in the VEN mu S data is sensitive to seasonal variation of Moso bamboo forests. The REPI can more effectively identify the two-year growing cycle of the bamboo forests than other vegetation indices, especially the bamboo shoots period. The start of the growing season of the off-year bamboo forest is approximately 50 to 60 days earlier than on-year bamboo forest. The results provided time-series phenological datasets of on-year and off-year Moso bamboo forests, which is valuable for local governments to conduct better ecological management and decision-making.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Fusion of Remote Sensing Images using a Convolutional Neural Network with Attention and Multiscale Mechanisms
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we propose a new spatiotemporal fusion method based on a convolutional neural network to which we added attention and multiscale mechanisms (AMNet). Different from the previous spatiotemporal fusion methods, the residual image obtained by subtracting moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) images at two times is directly used to train the network, and two special structures of multiscale mechanism and attention mechanism are used to increase the accuracy of fusion. Our proposed method uses one pair of images to achieve spatiotemporal fusion. The work is mainly divided into three steps. The first step is to extract feature maps of two types of images at different scales and fuse them separately. The second step is to use the attention mechanism to focus on the important information in the feature maps. And the third step is to reconstruct the image. We used two classical datasets for the experiment, and compared our experimental results with the other three state-of-the-art spatiotemporal fusion methods. The results of our proposed method have richer spatial details and more accurate prediction of temporal changes.

TI  - Mapping plant communities within quasi-circular vegetation patches using tasseled cap brightness, greenness, and topsoil grain size index derived from GF-1 imagery
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying the structure and composition of quasi-circular vegetation patches (QVPs) is key in identifying ecosystem function, which will help create a cost-effective nature-based solution for restoring the degraded wetland ecosystem in the Yellow River Delta (YRD), China. However, research on mapping plant communities of QVPs using remotely sensed data has not been conducted. In this study, we found that the pan-sharpened GF-1 imagery acquired in May was suitable for mapping plant communities of QVPs. Guided by field survey data and finer spatial resolution remotely sensed data, we constructed a simple decision tree classifier using the tasseled cap brightness (TCB), greenness (TCG), and topsoil grain size index (TGSI) of the pan-sharpened GF-1 image acquired in May. The classification results showed that the combination of the TCB and TCG components could efficiently distinguish the vegetation from non-vegetation, and the use of the TGSI was able to capture the variations in plant communities within QVPs in the YRD, China. However, the influence of the acquisition season and mixed pixels of GF-1 imagery (especially small canopy T. chinensis in small QVPs) on classification accuracy still needs further investigation.

TI  - Pixel Based Multitemporal Sentinel-1 SAR Despeckling PIMSAR
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Despeckling of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is a challenge for high-resolution applications. This study presents a new pixel-based multitemporal nonlocal averaging (PIMSAR) approach to apply nonlocal mean filtering to ground range detected high (GRDH) resolution SAR images preserving the smallest details of the spatial resolution (10 m). The similarity of SAR pixels is based on the temporal evolution of nature using a two-step process. The mean and standard deviation of pixelwise intensity from spring to autumn are used as the basis of unsupervised classification of the area of interest. The nonlocal averaging is carried out within each class separately in magnitude order of the temporal averages. The filtered image shows the details that are indistinguishable in the original image. The kurtosis of the filtered image is close to that of a corresponding airborne image. PIMSAR preserves the mean intensity of the image with a relative accuracy better than 0.02%, and yet, the processing is rapid per image and the method is easy to use.

TI  - The prognostic impact of mode of detection of axillary metastases for women with invasive breast cancer: A retrospective observational study
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: To identify the breast cancer specific survival (BCSS) associated with nodal metastasis identified by axillary core biopsy (ACB), and by sentinel node biopsy (SNB) compared with node negative patients. A further aim was to assess the prognostic effects of axillary ultrasound (US) features and amount of tumour in ACB specimens. Methods: Consecutive patients with cancer were identified from a database of US lesions undergoing breast biopsy. The three study groups were: a) those with metastasis identified by ACB, b) those undergoing immediate surgery with positive SNB and c) those undergoing immediate surgery with a negative SNB. US features and the amount of tumour in the ACB specimen were assessed by review of US images and pathological reports. BCSS was assessed using Kaplan Meier survival curves. Results: 967 patients were included, with mean follow-up of 6.0 yrs. There were 90 breast cancer deaths: 26% of those with a positive ACB, 11% with a positive SNB and 4% of those with a negative SNB. BCSS was significantly different between the groups (p < 0.001) with hazard ratio, compared with the negative SNB group, of 7.8 (95% CI 4.4-13.7) for patients with positive ACB and 2.5 (95% CI 1.3-4.6) for positive SNB. Axillary US findings and assessment of the amount of tumour in the ACB did not influence survival. Conclusion: This study suggests that women with a positive ACB have a worse BCSS compared to those with a positive SNB. This should be borne in mind when systemic therapy is being considered.Aim: To identify the breast cancer specific survival (BCSS) associated with nodal metastasis identified by axillary core biopsy (ACB), and by sentinel node biopsy (SNB) compared with node negative patients.

TI  - Efficacy and emergence of parasitic wasps that attack herbivorous insects on maize and its relatives in their region of origin
T2  - ARTHROPOD-PLANT INTERACTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Maize (Zea mays subsp. mays), an important cereal crop worldwide, was domesticated directly from the annual teosinte (Zea mays subsp. parviglumis), and teosintes originated from gamagrass (Tripsacum) plants. Some herbivorous insects of maize began their association on Tripsacum; however, little is known about the interaction between these herbivores and their parasitoids in this ancestral Tripsacum habitat. A field experiment was conducted in the Mesoamerican region of origin of maize, using sentinel eggs of the hopper Dalbulus quinquenotatus on Tripsacum dactyloides, and eggs of the insect pest Dalbulus maidis on annual teosinte, landrace maize, and modern maize. A community of egg parasitoids formed by Anagrus naulti (Mymaridae), Paracentrobia sp., and Pseudoligosita sp. (Trichogrammatidae) was found attacking eggs of both species of hoppers on the tested host plants. The largest abundance of parasitoids adult emergence and rate of parasitism was found in D. quinquenotatus eggs laid on T. dactyloides. The rate of parasitism was similar for the other three treatments: D. maidis on teosinte, landrace maize, and modern maize. In the D. quinquenotatus-Tripsacum treatment, D. maidis-annual teosinte treatment, and D. maidis-hybrid maize treatment more Paracentrobia sp. adults emerged than A. naulti adults. These results suggest that the interaction between hoppers and their egg parasitoids occurs on Tripsacum plants, and probably has been in place since before maize domestication.

TI  - Three Decades of Indian Remote Sensing in Coastal Research
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - The launch of the first Indian Remote Sensing Satellite in 1988 ushered in a new era of utilization of satellite data and technology in natural resources monitoring, coastal area management, disaster mitigation, weather and climate change studies. India with its very long coast line, areal extent, resources and population would have been a huge challenge to the coastal researchers and administrators if not for the Indian Remote Sensing satellite data that provided the much needed temporal, thematic information for effective mapping, monitoring and management of the coastal areas. The country's large and diverse coastal regions are economically important and ecologically rich but also extremely vulnerable and highly prone to natural and anthropogenic hazards. Through the last three decades, the Indian remote sensing programme has contributed immensely to our understanding of the coast and ocean processes, coastal ecosystems, habitats, marine pollution and the vulnerability of the coast to natural hazards. IRS-1C with its improved spatial resolutions, additional spectral band, improved repetitively ushered in a new era of research specifically in the management of coastal areas and resources. Availability of spatial data at various resolutions, low cost, advances in technology resulted in new applications for management coastal areas. IRS-1C also can be aptly termed as the precursor for thematic satellite series such as OCEANSAT, RESOURCESAT and CARTOSAT, thereby setting the environs for thematic research in coastal areas. Integrated utilization of remote sensing data, numerical models, GIS and GPS has paved the way for the development of operation systems for management of coastal areas, thereby realizing the vision of Dr. Vikram Sarabhai, the father of Indian Space Programme, of building a self-reliant and indigenous Space Programme for the betterment of quality of life of the common people.

TI  - Predicting paddy yield at spatial scale using optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) based satellite data in conjunction with field-based Crop Cutting Experiment (CCE) data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate, reliable, and robust information on crop yield has great importance in food security measures. In this study, both optical (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI)) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) (Sentinel-1A) satellite datasets were used for predicting paddy yield at a spatial scale in conjunction with Crop Cutting Experiment (CCE) data in Sahibganj district of the Jharkhand state (India) during the monsoon season 2017. The yield prediction models were developed from linear (LR) and multiple regression (MR) analysis. The AquaCrop model was also employed to simulate the paddy yield. The key findings showed that the MR-based yield model developed from SAR (Vertical transmission and Vertical reception (VV) + Vertical transmission and Horizontal reception (VH) polarizations) data was more accurate, reasonable, and reliable as compared to the optical-based (NDVI + EVI) MR yield model. The SAR-based MR yield model showed better accuracy between predicted and observed yield (CCE) as evaluated using Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE = 0.68). However, the optical-based MR yield model showed relatively lower accuracy (NSE = 0.62). The relative deviation (RD) of the predicted yield from the SAR and optical-based MR model was nearly 3% and 4%, respectively. Using the AquaCrop model, the simulated yield was underestimated by approximately 4%. We conclude that the SAR-based MR-yield model outperformed the optical-based model to predict paddy yield at a spatial scale, and the adopted methodology can beneficial for decision-makers withing agriculture monitoring. Hence, satellite imagery has always been a reliable source for yield forecasting and crop assessment at a regional and national scale.

TI  - Calibration of Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca in coastal marine ostracods as a proxy for temperature
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios of marine shells have been widely used in environmental paleoreconstructions to understand past marine conditions. Temperature calibrations to ostracod Mg/Ca ratios are known to be species-specific but only available for a few species, despite the large number of known ostracod species. Here, we develop temperature calibrations for two shallow marine ostracods, Sinocytheridea impressa and Neomonoceratina delicata, using modern sediment samples. Our results show that adult specimens of these two species might be useful as a paleothermometer. We observed significant correlations using the Mg/Ca ratios of both species to the annual (Mg/Ca-S. impressa =3.7 . T - 62.7; Mg/Ca-N. delicata = 1.6 . T - 16.8) and April (Mg/Ca-S. impressa =2.8 . T - 39.2; Mg/Ca-N. delicata =1.6 . T - 15.7) temperatures. The correlation of temperature to the Mg/Ca ratio of S. impressa is more significant and therefore should be preferred for paleorecon-structions. Re-analysis from satellite data allows us to validate our temperature calibration to an extended area around the Pearl River estuary. Our results show that Mg/Ca of S. impressa and N. delicata ostracods can be used to reconstruct water temperature at a regional scale, which provides information on the oceanic circulation in coastal areas of the South China Sea. Sr/Ca ratios of both species do not correlate with any of the 24 water parameters recorded by the Environmental Protection Department of Hong Kong, including temperature (21.7-24.1 degrees C), salinity (23.8-33.7 PSU), dissolved oxygen (4.3-7.1 mg L-1), suspended solids (1.9-35.4 mg L-1) and pH (7.7-8.2).

T2  - JOURNAL OF RELIGIOUS EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Exemplary religious education (RE) teachers were identified by school based RE leaders and interviewed as part of an ongoing study of the implementation of a new senior high school religious education program in Catholic schools in NSW, Australia. Contextualisation was provided by examining dominant social influences utilising Dobbelaere's concept of multi layered secularisation and Pollefeyt's notion of teachers as witness, specialist and moderator (WSM). The worldview of teachers in this study was not closely aligned with a secularised personal religious identity. They displayed a high level of religious salience. Participants did, however, display characteristics that were in keeping with a framework of skilled RE as WSM. A range of implications of this study were discussed including the need for; a closer examination of the pedagogical strategies used by exemplary RE teachers, a better understanding of teacher formation, further examination of the life journey of exemplary RE teachers in Catholic education.

TI  - Clinical effect of the pathological axillary assessment method in breast cancer without clinical nodal metastasis
T2  - BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background This study aimed to assess the clinical effect of the pathological axillary assessment method in breast cancer without clinical lymph node metastasis. Methods Data of patients with clinically node-negative breast cancer were retrospectively reviewed. The study period was divided into early (January 2000-July 2007) and late (August 2007-December 2014) periods based on the pathological assessment method used (single-sectional and detailed multi-sectional lymph node processing). In the late period, lymph nodes were evaluated at six levels including immunohistochemistry on each 1.5-2 mm interval section. The axillary diagnostic accuracy and role of chemotherapy were assessed. Results In 1698 patients, 27 isolated tumor cells (ITCs), 39 micrometastases, and 205 macrometastases were noted. The sensitivity for pathological N0 diagnosis was dependent on clinical T stage, Tis (97.8%), T1 (83.0%), T2 (74.2%), T3 (54.5%), and T4 (63.6%). ITCs and micrometastases were detected only in the late period, and 84.7% and 91.6% of cases in the early and late period, respectively, did not have macrometastases. The 5-year disease-free interval (DFI) rates were 95.2% in node-negative cases, 98.4% in ITCs/micrometastases, and 91.4% in macrometastases (P < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, the predictor for DFI was estrogen receptor negativity (P = 0.013). Chemotherapy did not improve DFI in patients with node-positive breast cancer. Conclusions The detailed multi-sectional pathological assessment of axillary lymph nodes detected ITCs and micrometastases. Implementation of chemotherapy should not be based on the minimal nodal metastasis and this type of serially nodal sectioned processing had little clinical significance.

TI  - Diffusion prophylactic axillary irradiation in breast cancer - Literature review
T2  - CANCER RADIOTHERAPIE
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose. - In breast cancer, radiotherapy is an essential component of the treatment. However, indications of irradiation of the internal mammary chain and axillary area are debatables. Axillary recurrence in patients with invasive breast carcinoma remains an issue. Currently, the substitution of axillary lymph node dissection by sentinel node biopsy leads to revisit the role of axillary irradiation. Breast irradiation including level I, II and III might decrease the risk of axillary recurrence.Material and methods. - A literature search was performed in PubMed and the Cochrane library to identify articles publishing data regarding dose-volume analysis of axillary levels in breast irradiation aiming to determine the potential therapeutic implications.Results. - Eleven articles were retained. A total of 375 treatment plans were analyzed. The results concerning the irradiation technique, initial dose prescribed to breast, delineated volumes and dose received at axillary levels were heterogeneous. The average dose delivered to axilla levels I-III with 3D-conformal radiotherapy using standard fields were between 24 Gy and 43.5 Gy, 3 Gy and 32.5 Gy and between 1.0 Gy and 20.5 Gy respectively. The average doses delivered to axilla levels I-III with 3D-conformal radiotherapy using high tangential fields were between 38 Gy and 49.7 Gy, 11 Gy and 47.1 Gy and 5 Gy 38.7 Gy, 32.1 Gy and 5 Gy (result available for only one study) respectively. Finally, the average doses delivered to axilla levels I-III with intensity modulated radiation therapy were between 14.5 Gy and 42.6 Gy, 3.4 Gy and 35 Gy and between 1.2 Gy and 25.5 Gy respectively.Conclusions. - Incidental axillary dose seems insufficient to be therapeutic regardless of the irradiation technique. There are meaningful differences between intensity modulated radiation therapy and 3D-conformal radiotherapy.

TI  - Landsat-derived bathymetry of lakes on the Arctic Coastal Plain of northern Alaska
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - The Pleistocene sand sea on the Arctic Coastal Plain (ACP) of northern Alaska is underlain by an ancient sand dune field, a geological feature that affects regional lake characteristics. Many of these lakes, which cover approximately 20% of the Pleistocene sand sea, are relatively deep (up to 25 m). In addition to the natural importance of ACP sand sea lakes for water storage, energy balance, and ecological habitat, the need for winter water for industrial development and exploration activities makes lakes in this region a valuable resource. However, ACP sand sea lakes have received little prior study. Here, we collect in situ bathymetric data to test 12 model variants for predicting sand sea lake depth based on analysis of Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images. Lake depth gradients were measured at 17 lakes in midsummer 2017 using a Humminbird 798ci HD SI Combo automatic sonar system. The field-measured data points were compared to red-green-blue (RGB) bands of a Landsat-8 OLI image acquired on 8 August 2016 to select and calibrate the most accurate spectral-depth model for each study lake and map bathymetry. Exponential functions using a simple band ratio (with bands selected based on lake turbidity and bed substrate) yielded the most successful model variants. For each lake, the most accurate model explained 81.8% of the variation in depth, on average. Modeled lake bathymetries were integrated with remotely sensed lake surface area to quantify lake water storage volumes, which ranged from 1.056 x 10(-3) to 57.416 x 10(-3) km(3). Due to variations in depth maxima, substrate, and turbidity between lakes, a regional model is currently infeasible, rendering necessary the acquisition of additional in situ data with which to develop a regional model solution. Estimating lake water volumes using remote sensing will facilitate better management of expanding development activities and serve as a baseline by which to evaluate future responses to ongoing and rapid climate change in the Arctic. All sonar depth data and modeled lake bathymetry rasters can be freely accessed at https://doi.org/10.18739/A2SN01440 (Simpson and Arp, 2018) and https://doi.org/10.18739/A2HT2GC6G (Simpson, 2019), respectively.

TI  - Quality analysis and improvement of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images from the GaoFen-3 satellite using the Amazon rainforest as an example
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As China's first civil synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite, the data quality of the GaoFen-3 (GF-3) satellite has been widely studied. This study analyzes the data quality of this satellite from a polarimetric perspective and recalibrates the GF-3 images using the Amazon rainforest. Four calibration approaches, including the Ainsworth method, the Quegan method, a method based on rotation symmetry (referred to as the rotation method), and a newly proposed polarimetric calibration method using only the rainforest (referred to as the PCMRF method), are used to improve the SAR image quality. For the channel imbalance correction, the four methods demonstrate similar performances. For cross-talk correction, the proposed method exhibits a better performance than the other three calibration methods. These four methods provide complementary assessments with respect to the evaluation and the calibration performance. The test results using the rainforest data indicate that the channel imbalances are reduced from 0.48 dB to 0.1 dB in amplitude, from 16 degrees to 4 degrees in phase, and from -36 dB to -46 dB in cross-talk. The calibration effects are further validated using several points and distributed targets in different scenes, and the suggested calibration parameters are given in this study to increase calibration viability.

TI  - Improving the monitoring of deciduous broadleaf phenology using the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) 16 and 17
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring leaf phenology tracks the progression of climate change and seasonal variations in a variety of organismal and ecosystem processes. Networks of finite-scale remote sensing, such as the PhenoCam network, provide valuable information on phenological state at high temporal resolution, but they have limited coverage. Satellite-based data with lower temporal resolution have primarily been used to more broadly measure phenology (e.g., 16 d MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) product). Recent versions of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES-16 and GOES-17) can monitor NDVI at temporal scales comparable to that of PhenoCam throughout most of the western hemisphere. Here we begin to examine the current capacity of these new data to measure the phenology of deciduous broadleaf forests for the first 2 full calendar years of data (2018 and 2019) by fitting double-logistic Bayesian models and comparing the transition dates of the start, middle, and end of the season to those obtained from PhenoCam and MODIS 16 d NDVI and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) products. Compared to these MODIS products, GOES was more correlated with PhenoCam at the start and middle of spring but had a larger bias (3.35 +/- 0.03 d later than PhenoCam) at the end of spring. Satellite-based autumn transition dates were mostly uncorrelated with those of PhenoCam. PhenoCam data produced significantly more certain (all p values <= 0.013) estimates of all transition dates than any of the satellite sources did. GOES transition date uncertainties were significantly smaller than those of MODIS EVI for all transition dates (all p values <= 0.026), but they were only smaller (based on p value <0.05) than those from MODIS NDVI for the estimates of the beginning and middle of spring. GOES will improve the monitoring of phenology at large spatial coverages and provides real-time indicators of phenological change even when the entire spring transition period occurs within the 16 d resolution of these MODIS products.

TI  - Evaluation of nine precipitation products with ground-based measurements during 2001 to 2013 in alpine Upper Reach of Shule River Basin, northeastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The distribution of precipitation in alpine regions with cold climates, such as Upper Reach of Shule River Basin (URSRB), northeastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau, is notoriously difficult to estimate from conventional measurements. Nine precipitation products, including CMFD, CMORPH, ERA-Interim, GPCC, GPCP V2.3, JRA-55, TRMM 3B43, HAR, and CAPD, were evaluated by six alpine ground-based measurement stations from 2001 to 2013 on yearly, seasonal, and monthly scales, respectively. The precipitation gradients of the nine precipitation products in rainy period were calculated by linear regression and then compared with recently observations during 2013-2016 from numerous total precipitation gauges. CMFD has the best overall performance in both yearly, seasonal, and monthly precipitation because it is primarily based on the merged precipitation product from surface measurements and satellite remote sensing data, followed by GPCC and TRMM 3B43. It is also found that CMORPH shows the worst overall performance due to only derived from remote sensing data. Nine precipitation products all showed obvious precipitation gradients. The absolute precipitation gradient of GPCC exhibited the greatest similarity to observations, followed by JRA-55 and CAPD. Although HAR obviously overestimated precipitation, it had an accurate pattern of monthly distribution and relative precipitation gradients in alpine areas, indicating that it has some advantages for applying on Tibetan Plateau. The evaluation suggested that the uncertainty in estimated alpine precipitation has largely decreased in some precipitation products, which will help to comprehensive understanding the climate change and its impact on hydrology of northeastern basins of the Tibetan Plateau.

TI  - Cloud/shadow segmentation based on global attention feature fusion residual network for remote sensing imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud and cloud shadow segmentation of satellite imageries is a prerequisite for many remote sensing applications. Due to the limited number of available spectral bands and the complexity of background information, the traditional detection methods have some problems such as false detection, missing detection and inaccurate boundary information in segmentation. To solve these problems, a global attention fusion residual network method is proposed to segment cloud and cloud shadow of satellite imageries. The proposed model adopts Residual Network (ResNet) as backbone to extract semantic information at different feature levels. In order to improve the ability of the network to deal with the boundary information, an improved atrous spatial pyramid pooling method is introduced to extract the multi-scale deep semantic information. Then, the deep semantic information is fused with the shallow spatial information through the Global Attention up-sample mechanism in different scales, which improves the network's ability to utilize the global and local features. Finally, a boundary refinement module is utilized to predict the boundary of cloud and shadow, consequently the boundary information is refined. The experimental results on Sentinel-2 satellite and Land Remote-Sensing Satellite (Landsat) imageries show that the segmentation accuracy and speed of proposed method are superior to the existing methods, it is of great significance for realizing practical cloud and shadow segmentation.

TI  - R-loop resolution promotes co-transcriptional chromatin silencing
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - RNA-mediated chromatin silencing is central to genome regulation in many organisms. However, how nascent non-coding transcripts regulate chromatin is poorly understood. Here, through analysis of Arabidopsis FLC, we show that resolution of a nascent-transcript-induced R-loop promotes chromatin silencing. Stabilization of an antisense-induced R-loop at the 3 end of FLC enables an RNA binding protein FCA, with its direct partner FY/WDR33 and other 3 ' -end processing factors, to polyadenylate the nascent antisense transcript. This clears the R-loop and recruits the chromatin modifiers demethylating H3K4me1. FCA immunoprecipitates with components of the m(6)A writer complex, and m(6)A modification affects dynamics of FCA nuclear condensates, and promotes FLC chromatin silencing. This mechanism also targets other loci in the Arabidopsis genome, and consistent with this fca and fy are hypersensitive to a DNA damage-inducing drug. These results show how modulation of R-loop stability by co-transcriptional RNA processing can trigger chromatin silencing. Nascent non-coding RNA can mediate chromatin silencing, however mechanistically this process is poorly understood. Here the authors show that resolution of an R-loop during 3'-end processing of a plant antisense transcript recruits chromatin modifiers to promote chromatin silencing.

TI  - Hybrid modelling of random forests and kriging with sentinel-2A multispectral imagery to determine urban brightness temperatures with high resolution
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Herein, a random-forest-based Kriging downscaling method (RFRKriging) was tested to increase the spatial resolution of Landsat 8 thermal-infrared remote sensing (TIRS) brightness temperature (T (b)) over the central areas of Guangzhou, China. The 240-m Landsat 8 T (b) was upscaled from the resampled 30-m Landsat 8 T (b) by using the spatial averaging method. T (b) was downscaled based on its relationship to spectral reflectance in visible/near-infrared and shortwave infrared bands, spectral indices, including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference building index (NDBI), and modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI), digital elevation model (DEM), longitude, latitude, impervious surface, vegetation, and soil fractions. The linear regression Kriging (LRKriging) and NDVI-based thermal sharpening algorithm (TsHARP) regression Kriging (TsHARPKriging) were also implemented. Relative to the reference data from the resampled Landsat 8 T (b), the RFRKriging produced satisfactory downscaling results with respect to the maximum coefficient of determination (R (2)), the minimum root-mean-square error (RMSE), and the minimum ratio between RMSE and the correspondent Landsat 8 T (b) standard deviation (RSD). RFRKriging captured T (b) differences over roads, forests, water bodies, and buildings and enhanced the spatial details of downscaled T (b) in all urban areas. Furthermore, integrating the multi-type predictor variables from 10-m Sentinel-2A and 30-m Landsat 8 image sets, RFRKriging was further applied to downscale 30-m Landsat 8 T (b) to 10 m. Then, it was upscaled to 30 m and assessed with the original 30-m Landsat 8 T (b). RFRKriging was an effective and practical method for increasing the spatial resolution, with a low RSD of 0.254, a low RMSE of 0.525 K and a high R (2) of 0.935. The RSD of less than 0.5 indicates that RFRKriging could achieve an acceptable downscaling accuracy. Furthermore, RFRKriging enhances the spatial details of a 10-m T (b) in complex urban environments while maintaining the intrinsic information and spatial patterns of a downscaled T (b). Due to the unavailability of the 30-m and 10-m T (b) truth, this study may only provide a quantitative assessment from some theoretical experiments. Also, a comparison of the RFRKriging downscaled T (b) with the resampled Landsat 8 T (b) was performed. The results suggest that the proposed RFRKriging downscaling method shows better downscaling performance with more spatial details than the cubic convolution method applied by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Centre.

TI  - Monitoring coal seam fires in Xinjiang using comprehensive thermal infrared and time series InSAR detection
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The combustion of underground coal seams has important effects on the national economy and strategic energy security of countries, and damages the environment, ecology, vegetation, and water resources. Xinjiang, China, is one of the most serious areas of coalfield fires in the world, and it is difficult for any single remote sensing detection method to meet the practical requirements for accurate detection of fire areas. In order to detect coalfield areas in Xinjiang more accurately and reliably, a detection method that integrates thermal infrared and radar remote sensing anomaly is proposed: The mono-window algorithm is used to retrieve the Land Surface Temperature (LST) using images from the Land Remote-Sensing Satellite System (Landsat) 8, the Adaptive Edge Threshold Algorithm (AETA) is used to extract the data characterized by LST anomalies, and Small Baseline Subsets Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SBAS-InSAR) is used to obtain the land surface subsidence information from Sentinel-1A images. Through the overlay analysis of the above-mentioned LST and subsidence information, the extraction of possible coal fire areas in the Jiangjun Gobi area of Xinjiang is realized. As well as according to the characteristic that underground coal fires melt snow in winter, areas where coal fires are unlikely to occur are excluded using the natural, true-colour images of Landsat 8. Finally, the proposed method is verified using the characteristics of the time series cumulative subsidence of the land surface in areas where coal fires are likely to occur, and by examining the coupling between subsidence velocity and anomalies in LST data. The results show that the proposed method can overcome the shortcomings of single-factor remote sensing detection to a certain extent, and has the ability to detect fire areas more accurately.

TI  - Minimize the extent and morbidity of axillary dissection for node-positive breast cancer patients: implementation of axillary lymph node dissection based on breast lymphatics level
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundBreast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) is associated with extensive axillary dissection. Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) based on breast lymphatics level (BLL) was proposed to minimize the surgical extent for node-positive breast cancer patients.MethodsA total of 156 consecutive sentinel lymph node-positive (SLN+) or clinically node-positive (cN+) patients underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) with indocyanine green and methylene blue (MB). The SLNs were injected with 0.1mlMB before removal, and a standard ALND was subsequently performed. The nodes adjacent to the blue-stained axillary lymph nodes from the breast (bALNs) were sent for pathological examination separately by resecting serial tissue every 0.5cm away from the marginal blue-stained bALNs. Then, a pilot study comparing ALND based on BLL and standard ALND was performed.ResultsBLL were successfully identified in 20 SLN+ (100%) and 134 cN+ (98.5%) patients. The median number of BLL was four, ranging from three to six. A horizontal line 1.0cm away from the superior blue-stained bALN and a vertical line 1.0cm away from the medial blue-stained bALN formed BLL II, III, and IV. All of the additional positive nodes were within 1.0cm of the blue-stained bALNs. The minimized axillary dissection should resect upwards from the lowest BLL that contains the first confirmed negative blue-stained bALNs. In the pilot study, no patient developed axillary recurrence.ConclusionThe ALND surgical procedure based on BLL could minimize the surgical extent for pathological node-positive breast cancer patients and potentially reduce the BCRL rate.Trial registrationChiCTR1800014247.

TI  - Integrating global land cover products to refine GlobeLand30 forest types: a case study of conterminous United States (CONUS)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Highly accurate and detailed information on land cover products is crucial in studying global climate change and sustainable development. GlobeLand30 is the first global 30 m resolution Land cover (LC) product based on remote sensing data developed by Chinese scientists. GlobeLand30 has 10 first-level classes of products. However, no second-level classification products have been released. This study presents an integration method based on fuzzy theory and combines three 30 m resolution LC products, namely, National Land Cover Database 2011 (NLCD 2011), Fine Resolution Observation and Monitoring of Global Land Cover Segmentation 2010 (FROM-GLC-Seg) and global forest cover data (treecover2010) products, using the European Environment Information and Observation Network Action Group on Land Monitoring in the European (EAGLE) system of semantic translation. The conterminous United States region is adopted as the research area, and the GlobeLand30 (2010) forest class is subdivided into coniferous, broadleaf and mixed forests. Three different weighted voting methods are applied. The difference is whether the user or local accuracy of the source product is considered. The result shows that the respective accuracies of broadleaf, coniferous, and mixed forests are approximately 65.8%, 57.0%, and 40.9% of the weighted voting method without considering any product's accuracy; 79.3%, 65.9%, and 58.4% of the weighted voting method considering the user accuracy; and 79.9%, 69.9%, and 59.3% of the weighted voting method considering the local accuracy of each product, respectively. The proposed method for refining the GlobeLand30 first class forest can be applied to other classes and land cover products.

AB  - Between weeks 40 2020 and 8 2021, the World Health Organization European Region experienced a 99.8% reduction in sentinel influenza virus positive detections (33/25,606 tested; 0.1%) relative to an average of 14,966/39,407 (38.0%; p < 0.001) over the same time in the previous six seasons. COVID-19 pandemic public health and physical distancing measures may have extinguished the 2020/21 European seasonal influenza epidemic with just a few sporadic detections of all viral subtypes. This might possibly continue during the remainder of the influenza season.We study features of influenza epidemiology in the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region from week 40 2020 to week 8 2021, a period when in usual seasons the highest influenza activity (peak of seasonal epidemic) would be expected. Results are compared to those of the previous six seasons (2014/15-2019/20).

TI  - The impact of social and physical distancing measures on COVID-19 activity in England: findings from a multi-tiered surveillance system
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: A multi-tiered surveillance system based on influenza surveillance was adopted in the United Kingdom in the early stages of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic to monitor different stages of the disease. Mandatory social and physical distancing measures (SPDM) were introduced on 23 March 2020 to attempt to limit transmission. Aim: To describe the impact of SPDM on COVID-19 activity as detected through the different surveillance systems. Methods: Data from national population surveys, web-based indicators, syndromic surveillance, sentinel swabbing, respiratory outbreaks, secondary care admissions and mortality indicators from the start of the epidemic to week 18 2020 were used to identify the timing of peaks in surveillance indicators relative to the introduction of SPDM. This timing was compared with median time from symptom onset to different stages of illness and levels of care or interactions with healthcare services. Results: The impact of SPDM was detected within 1 week through population surveys, web search indicators and sentinel swabbing reported by onset date. There were detectable impacts on syndromic surveillance indicators for difficulty breathing, influenza-like illness and COVID-19 coding at 2, 7 and 12 days respectively, hospitalisations and critical care admissions (both 12 days), laboratory positivity (14 days), deaths (17 days) and nursing home outbreaks (4 weeks). Conclusion: The impact of SPDM on COVID-19 activity was detectable within 1 week through community surveillance indicators, highlighting their importance in early detection of changes in activity. Community swabbing surveillance may be increasingly important as a specific indicator, should circulation of seasonal respiratory viruses increase.

TI  - Can a regional-scale reduction of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> during the COVID-19 pandemic be detected from space? A case study for East China using satellite XCO<sub>2</sub> retrievals
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in reduced anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions during 2020 in large parts of the world. To investigate whether a regionalscale reduction of anthropogenic CO2 emissions during the COVID-19 pandemic can be detected using space-based observations of atmospheric CO2, we have analysed a small ensemble of 000-2 and GOSAT satellite retrievals of columnaveraged dry-air mole fractions of CO2, i.e. XCO2. We focus on East China and use a simple data-driven analysis method. We present estimates of the relative change of East China monthly emissions in 2020 relative to previous periods, limiting the analysis to October-to-May periods to minimize the impact of biogenic CO2 fluxes. The ensemble mean indicates an emission reduction by approximately 10 % +/- 10 % in March and April 2020. However, our results show considerable month-to-month variability and significant differences across the ensemble of satellite data products analysed. For example, 000-2 suggests a much smaller reduction (similar to 1 %2 % +/- 2 %). This indicates that it is challenging to reliably detect and to accurately quantify the emission reduction with current satellite data sets. There are several reasons for this, including the sparseness of the satellite data but also the weak signal; the expected regional XCO2 reduction is only on the order of 0.1-0.2 ppm. Inferring COVID-19-related information on regional-scale CO2 emissions using current satellite XCO2 retrievals likely requires, if at all possible, a more sophisticated analysis method including detailed transport modelling and considering a priori information on anthropogenic and natural CO2 surface fluxes.

TI  - Monitoring terrain elevation of intertidal wetlands by utilising the spatial-temporal fusion of multi-source satellite data: A case study in the Yangtze (Changjiang) Estuary
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Intertidal wetlands are dynamic geomorphological areas located at the land-sea interface and perform multiple ecosystem functions. Owing to increased human activities, intertidal wetlands have been subjected to dramatic changes in recent decades; therefore, high-resolution monitoring of wetland topography is critical to its management. However, satellite imagery with high spatial resolution usually demonstrates a low revisit frequency (e.g. several days to greater than ten days) and is frequently obstructed by clouds, limiting its capability to display the high-resolution time-series information of intertidal wetland terrain elevation variations. Conversely, satellite imagery with a high revisit frequency generally demonstrates a lower spatial resolution. In this study, a spatial-temporal data fusion method was utilised to generate hourly time-series images with a spatial resolution of 16 m by combining the satellite GF-1/WFV data (spatial resolution: 16 m; revisit frequency: 4 days) with geostationary satellite GOCI data (spatial resolution: 500 m; revisit frequency: 1 h). In combination with the tidal level information, digital terrain elevation (DTM) data of the intertidal wetland can be derived from fusion images. The DTM was synchronously validated by the terrain elevation data acquired on the same day utilising unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-borne LiDAR in the North Branch intertidal wetland of Chongming Island, Yangtze Estuary, with a root mean square error of 0.16 m. The application in Chongming-Dongtan indicates that this method is effective for monitoring high dynamic changes in intertidal wetland terrain elevations.(c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents the air-borne geophysical Gamma Ray Spectrometry data have been used for detecting the alteration zones related to hydrothermal activity. Areas enriched in potassium may indicate the existence of potassic alteration zone that is often associated with hydrothermal alteration accompanied by economic mineral deposits. The radioelements (K (%), eTh (ppm), and eU (ppm)) concentration distribution and the ratios of (K/eTh and K/eU) over the study area were presented. A Potassium Point anomaly map was obtained from the statistical treatment of the K (%), K/eU, and K/eTh spectrometric data. Anomalously High (X+3 sigma or more) areas were delineated and considered the most preferred areas for potassic alteration. If the maximum values exceed the (X+3 sigma) threshold, then (X+2 sigma) or (X+sigma) is applied instead. Sixteen areas were delineated and suggested for the presence of potassic alteration. The F-Parameter of Efimov (K*(eU/eTh)) was also implemented as proved approach for delineating the most preferred areas for hydrothermal alteration. The result of the Potassium point anomaly mapping was compared to that of the F-Parameter technique that was used as reference for validating the results. The sixteen anomalous areas revealed from the Potassium point anomaly technique showed perfect correlation with the areas of highly anomalous F-parameter.Remote sensing study supported by field data and laboratory spectral analyses was also implemented in this study as another useful powerful cost-effective approach for alteration mapping. A field study was conducted; samples from the different observed alterations were collected. The spectral signatures of these samples were measured using the "ASD TerraSpec Halo mineral identifier" hand-held spectroradiometer. Spectral analyses were performed to obtain the spectral characteristics of the alteration zones of the study are. The end-members were identified through comparing the measured spectra against the United States Geological Survey (USGS) spectral library in ENVI v.5.1. software. The identified end-members include; Kaolinite, Sericite, Montmorillonite, Chlorite, Epidote and iron oxides. Subpixel Mixture Tuned Matched Filtering (MTMF) mapping technique was finally used for mapping the distribution of these end-members on ASTER nine Visible Near Infra-Red (VNIR) and Short Wave Infra-Red (SWIR) bands. The remote sensing data were validated as Semna gold mine and the identified alterations during the field study were successfully mapped by the remote sensing technique. Finally; Most of the delineated areas using the proposed Potassium point anomaly technique were also evidenced by the approached remote sensing technique. Moreover remote sensing suggested more alteration areas than did the gamma ray spectrometry data.

TI  - A spatiotemporal reconstruction of daily ambient temperature using satellite data in the Megalopolis of Central Mexico from 2003 to 2019
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - While weather stations generally capture near-surface ambient air temperature (Ta) at a high temporal resolution to calculate daily values (i.e., daily minimum, mean, and maximum Ta), their fixed locations can limit their spatial coverage and resolution even in densely populated urban areas. As a result, data from weather stations alone may be inadequate for Ta-related epidemiology particularly when the stations are not located in the areas of interest for human exposure assessment. To address this limitation in the Megalopolis of Central Mexico (MCM), we developed the first spatiotemporally resolved hybrid satellite-based land use regression Ta model for the region, home to nearly 30 million people and includes Mexico City and seven more metropolitan areas. Our model predicted daily minimum, mean, and maximum Ta for the years 2003-2019. We used data from 120 weather stations and Land Surface Temperature (LST) data from NASA's MODIS instruments on the Aqua and Terra satellites on a 1 x 1 km grid. We generated a satellite-hybrid mixed-effects model for each year, regressing Ta measurements against land use terms, day-specific random intercepts, and fixed and random LST slopes. We assessed model performance using 10-fold cross-validation at withheld stations. Across all years, the root-mean-square error ranged from 0.92 to 1.92 K and the R-2 ranged from .78 to .95. To demonstrate the utility of our model for health research, we evaluated the total number of days in the year 2010 when residents >= 65 years old were exposed to Ta extremes (above 30 degrees C or below 5 degrees C). Our model provides much needed high-quality Ta estimates for epidemiology studies in the MCM region.

TI  - Applications for CryoSat-2 satellite magnetic data in studies of Earth's core field variations
T2  - EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - We use 20 years of continuous magnetic field measurements from the orsted, CHAMP and Swarm satellite missions, supplemented by calibrated platform magnetometer data from the CryoSat-2 satellite, to study time variations of the Earth's core field at satellite altitude and at the core-mantle boundary (CMB). From the satellite data we derive composite time series of the core field secular variation (SV) with 4-month cadence, at 300 globally distributed Geomagnetic Virtual Observatories (GVO). A previous gap in the GVO series between 2010 and 2014 is successfully filled using CryoSat-2, and sub-decadal variations are identified during this period. Tests showed that similar sub-decadal SV patterns were obtained from the CryoSat-2 data regardless of whether IGRF-13 or CHAOS-6x9 was used in their calibration. Cryosat-2 radial field SV series at non-polar latitudes have a mean standard deviation level compared to smoothing spline fits of 3.5 nT/yr compared to 1.8 nT/yr for CHAMP and 0.9 nT/yr for Swarm. GVO radial SV series display regional fluctuations with 5-10 years duration and amplitudes reaching 20 nT/yr, most notably at low latitudes over Indonesia (2014), over South America and the South Atlantic (2007, 2011 and 2014), and over the central Pacific (2017). Applying the Subtractive Optimally Localized Averages (SOLA) method, we also map the radial SV at the CMB as a collection of locally averaged SV estimates. We demonstrate that using 2-year windows of CryoSat-2 data, it is possible to reliably estimate the SV and its time derivative, the secular acceleration (SA), at the CMB, with a spatial resolution, corresponding to spherical harmonic degree 10. Along the CMB geographic equator, we find strong SA features with amplitude +/- 2.5 mu T/yr(2) under Indonesia from 2011-2014, under central America from 2015 to 2019, and sequences of SA with alternating sign under the Atlantic during 2004-2019. We find that platform magnetometer data from CryoSat-2 make a valuable contribution to the emerging picture of sub-decadal core field variations. Using 1-year windows of data from the Swarm satellites, we show that it is possible to study SA changes at low latitudes on timescales down to 1 year, with spatial resolution corresponding to spherical harmonic degree 10. We find strong positive and negative SA features appearing side-by-side in the Pacific in 2017, and thereafter drift westward.

TI  - Revisiting the Role of Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 Measurement After Surgical Treatment of Acromegaly
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & METABOLISM
M3  - Article
AB  - Context: In the management of growth hormone (GH)-secreting pituitary adenomas, the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) has been the gold standard not only for diagnoses but also for the determination of biochemical remission. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is an essential biomarker, although it should be adjusted for both age and sex.Objective: We evaluated whether IGF-1 levels could serve as a reliable alternative to an OGTT for disease monitoring after the surgical treatment of acromegaly. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 320 patients who underwent surgical resection of their GH-secreting pituitary tumors at the Severance hospital. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analyses were performed to validate the accuracy of IGF-1 levels for the assessment of remission. In addition, regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with discrepancy between OGTT and IGF-1 levels.Results: Except for 1 week after surgery, ROC analyses showed an area under the curve of greater than 0.8 for IGF-1 at all time points. Of 320 patients, 270 achieved endocrine remission after surgery alone. Among these patients, IGF-1 levels were normalized in 250 patients. The mean duration from surgery to IGF-1 normalization was 4.7 months. Regression analyses demonstrated that risk of failed IGF-1 normalization was increased by 3.1-fold when the tumor invaded the cavernous sinus and increased by 9.0-fold in patients with incomplete tumor removal.Conclusion: IGF-1 level is a reliable alternative to OGTT and plays a valuable role in monitoring acromegaly status.

TI  - Urban objects detection from C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite images through simulating filter properties
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based remote sensing has a key role in the monitoring earth features, but due to flaws like cloud penetration capability and selective duration for remote sensing in traditional remote sensing methods, now the attention has shifted towards the use of alternative methods such as microwave or radar sensing technology. Microwave remote sensing utilizes synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technology for remote sensing and it can operate in all weather conditions. Previous researchers have reported about effects of SAR pre-processing for urban objects detection and mapping. Preparing high accuracy urban maps are critical to disaster planning and response efforts, thus result from this study can help to users on the required pre-processing steps and its effects. Owing to the induced errors (such as calibration, geometric, speckle noise) in the radar images, these images are affected by several distortions, therefore these distortions need to be processed before any applications, as it causes issues in image interpretation and these can destroy valuable information about shapes, size, pattern and tone of various desired objects. The present work aims to utilize the sentinel-1 SAR datasets for urban studies (i.e. urban object detection through simulation of filter properties). The work uses C-band SAR datasets acquired from Sentinel-1A/B sensor, and the Google Earth datasets to validate the recognized objects. It was observed that the Refined-Lee filter performed well to provide detailed information about the various urban objects. It was established that the attempted approach cannot be generalised as one suitable method for sensing or identifying accurate urban objects from the C-band SAR images. Hence some more datasets in different polarisation combinations are required to be attempted.

TI  - Outcome of African-American compared to White-American patients with early-stage breast cancer, stratified by phenotype
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Breast cancer mortality rates are 39% higher in the African-American (AA) women compared to White-American (WA) women despite the advances in overall breast cancer screening and treatments. Several studies have undertaken to identify the factors leading to this disparity in United States with possible effects of lower socioeconomic status and underlying aggressive biology.Methods A retrospective analysis was done using a prospectively maintained database of a metropolitan health system. Patients were selected based on diagnosis of early-stage breast cancer between 10/1998 and 02/2017, and included women over age of 18 with clinically node-negative disease. Patients were then stratified by phenotype confirmed by pathology and patient-identified race.Results A total of 2,298 women were identified in the cohort with 39% AA and 61% WA women. The overall mean age at the time of diagnosis for AA women was slightly younger at 60 years compared to 62 years for WA women (p = 0.003). Follow-up time was longer for the WA women at 95 months vs. 86 months in AA women. The overall 5-year survival was analyzed for the entire cohort, with the lowest survival occurring in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Phenotype distribution revealed a higher incidence of TNBC in AA women compared to WA women (AA 16% vs. WA 10%; p < 0.0001). AA women also had higher incidence of HER2 positive cancers (AA 16.8% vs. WA 15.3%; p < 0.0001). WA women had a significantly higher distribution of Non-TNBC/HER2-negative phenotype (AA 55% vs. WA 65%; p < 0.0001). Furthermore, a subgroup analysis was done for a sentinel lymph node (SLN) negative cohort that showed higher rates of grade 3 tumors in AA (AA 35% vs. WA 23%; p < 0.0001); and higher rates of grade 1 and grade 2 tumors in WA (30% vs. 21% and 44% vs. 40%). Despite higher grade tumors in AA women, five-year overall survival outcomes in SLN-negative cohort did not differ between AA and WA women when stratifying based on tumor subtype.Conclusion Breast cancer survival disparities in AA and WA women with SLN-negative breast cancer are diminished when evaluated at early-stage cancers defined by SLN-negative tumors. Our evaluation suggests that when diagnosed early, phenotype does not contribute to racial survival outcomes. The lower survival rate in AA women with breast cancer may be attributed to later stage biology between the two races, or underlying socioeconomic disparities.

TI  - Mapping high resolution national daily NO<sub>2</sub> exposure across mainland China using an ensemble algorithm
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is an important air pollutant and highly related to air quality, short-and long-term health effects, and even climate. A national model was developed using the extreme gradient boosting algorithm with high-resolution tropospheric vertical column NO2 densities from the Sentinel Precursor/Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument and general meteorological variables as input to generate daily mean surface NO2 concentrations across mainland China. Model-derived daily NO2 estimates were high accuracy with sample-based cross-validation coefficient of determination of 0.83, a root-mean square error of 7.58 mg/m(3) , a mean prediction error of 5.56 mg/m(3) , and a mean relative prediction ror of 18.08%. It has good performance in NO2 estimations at both regional and individual site scale. The model also performed well in terms of estimating monthly, seasonal, and annual mean NO2 concentrations across China. The model performance appears to better than or comparable to most previous related studies. The seasonal and annual spatial distributions of surface NO2 across China and several regional NO2 hotspots in 2019 were derived from the model and analyzed. Also evaluated were the population exposure levels of NO2 for cities in and provinces of China. At the national scale, about 12% the population experienced annual mean NO2 concentrations exceeding the Chinese national air quality standard. The nationwide model with conventional predictors developed here can derive high-resolution surface NO2 concentrations across China routinely, benefitting air epidemiological and environmental related studies.

TI  - The effects of four decades of climate change on the breeding ecology of an avian sentinel species across a 1,500-km latitudinal gradient are stronger at high latitudes
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Global warming affects breeding phenology of birds differentially with latitude, but there is contrasting evidence about how the changing climate influences the breeding of migrating songbirds at their northern breeding range. We investigate the effect of climate warming on breeding time and breeding success of European pied flycatchers Ficedula hypoleuca in Sweden during a period of 36 years using nest reports from bird ringing. To account for the latitudinal variation, we divided Sweden into three latitudinal bands (northern, intermediate, and southern). We applied a sliding window approach to find the most influential period and environment characteristics (temperature, vegetation greenness, and precipitation), using linear mixed models and model averaging. Our results show a long-term advancement of breeding time related to increasing spring temperature and vegetation greenness during a period before hatching. Northern breeders revealed a larger advancement over the years (8.3 days) compared with southern breeders (3.6 days). We observed a relatively stronger effect of temperature and greenness on breeding time in the north. Furthermore, northern birds showed an increase in breeding success over time, while birds breeding at southern and intermediate latitudes showed reduced breeding success in years with higher prehatching temperatures. Our findings with stronger environment effects on breeding time advancement in the north suggest that pied flycatchers are more responsive to weather cues at higher latitudes. Breeding time adjustment and, potentially, low competition help explain the higher long-term success observed in the north. Reduced breeding success at more southerly latitudes suggests an inability to match breeding time to very early and warm springs, a fate that with continued climate change could also be expected for pied flycatchers and other long-distance migrants at their very northern breeding range.

TI  - Relationship between type 2 diabetes mellitus and markers of cutaneous melanoma aggressiveness: an observational multicentric study in 443 patients with melanoma
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Some studies have suggested a relationship between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and increased incidence of melanoma. Efforts are under way to identify preventable and treatable factors associated with greater melanoma aggressiveness, but no studies to date have examined the relationship between T2DM and the aggressiveness of cutaneous melanoma at diagnosis.Objectives To explore potential associations between T2DM, glycaemic control and metformin treatment and the aggressiveness of cutaneous melanoma.Methods We conducted a cross-sectional multicentric study in 443 patients diagnosed with cutaneous melanoma. At diagnosis, all patients completed a standardized protocol, and a fasting blood sample was extracted to analyse their glucose levels, glycated haemoglobin concentration and markers of systemic inflammation. Melanoma characteristics and aggressiveness factors [Breslow thickness, ulceration, tumour mitotic rate (TMR), sentinel lymph node (SLN) involvement and tumour stage] were also recorded.Results The mean (SD) age of the patients was 55 center dot 98 (15 center dot 3) years and 50 center dot 6% were male. The median Breslow thickness was 0 center dot 85 mm. In total, 48 (10 center dot 8%) patients were diagnosed with T2DM and this finding was associated with a Breslow thickness > 2 mm [odds ratio (OR) 2 center dot 6, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1 center dot 4-4 center dot 9; P = 0 center dot 004)] and > 4 mm (OR 3 center dot 6, 95% CI 1 center dot 7-7 center dot 9; P = 0 center dot 001), TMR > 5 per mm(2) (OR 4 center dot 5, 95% CI 1 center dot 4-13 center dot 7; P = 0 center dot 009), SLN involvement (OR 2 center dot 3, 95% CI 1-5 center dot 7; P = 0 center dot 038) and tumour stages III-IV (vs. I-II) (OR 3 center dot 4, 95% CI 1 center dot 6-7 center dot 4; P = 0 center dot 002), after adjusting for age, sex, obesity, alcohol intake and smoking habits. No significant associations emerged between glycated haemoglobin levels, metformin treatment and melanoma aggressiveness.Conclusions T2DM, rather than glycaemic control and metformin treatment, is associated with increased cutaneous melanoma aggressiveness at diagnosis.

M3  - Data Paper
AB  - The archive of aerial photographs, dating 1935-1941 and covering parts of north and central of Ethiopia, is one of the few archives with pre-1960 remotely sensed data in Africa. It allows adding 30 years of time depth for geographical studies, in contrast to the commonly known oldest imagery dating to 1964, sometimes 1958. These photographs were originally acquired by the Italian military forces, to obtain raw material for warfare purposes and the production of topographic maps. To make the archive accessible, it has been scanned and georeferenced. Procedures used in georeferencing and digitally archiving are detailed in this paper, as well as our experiences with orthorectification and use of the photosets in scientific research. This data set of aerial photographs of Ethiopia in the 1930s has been availed to the wider scientific community through the Pangaea website (Nyssen et al., 2020, Aerial photographs of Ethiopia 1935-1941) Additionally, a web interface () allows scientists visualizing the location of relocated photographs, and to select and freely order scenes of interest.

TI  - Improved economic and clinical outcomes with oritavancin versus a comparator group for treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections in a community hospital
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundOritavancin is a lipoglycopeptide antibiotic with in vitro bactericidal activity against gram-positive pathogens indicated for use in adults with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI). Its concentration-dependent activity and prolonged half-life provide a convenient single-dose alternative to multi-dose daily therapies for ABSSSI. This retrospective cohort study was conducted to quantify the clinical and economic advantages of using oritavancin compared to other antibiotic agents that have been historically effective for ABSSSI.MethodsSeventy-nine patients received oritavancin who had failed previous outpatient antibiotic therapy (OPAT) for cellulitis or abscess and were subsequently readmitted to the hospital as an inpatient between 2016 and 2018. These patients were compared to a cohort of 28 patients receiving other antibiotics following OPAT failure and subsequent hospitalization for these two infection types. The primary clinical end point was average length of stay (aLOS) and secondary endpoints included readmission rates for the same indication at 30 and 90 days after discharge and the average hospital cost (aHC).ResultsA total of 107 patients were hospitalized for treatment of cellulitis or abscess. Demographic characteristics of both the oritavancin and comparator groups were similar except for the presence of diabetes. The primary clinical endpoint showed a non-significant decrease in aLOS between the oritavancin group versus comparator (2.12 days versus 2.59 days; p = 0.097). The secondary endpoints revealed lower readmission rates associated with oritavancin treatment at 30 and 90 days; the average hospital cost was 5.9% lower for patients that received oritavancin.ConclusionThe results of this study demonstrate that oritavancin provides not only a single-dose alternative to multi-day therapies for skin and skin structure infections, but also a clinical and economic advantage compared to other antibiotic agents.

TI  - Remotely Sensed Phenology Monitoring and Land-cover Classification for the Localization of the Endemic Argan Tree in the Southern-west of Morocco
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Argania spinosa also known as the argan tree is an endemic plant of Morocco. Despite having the ability to subsist in extreme drought conditions, it is threatened by soil land clearing, overexploitation, and absence of natural regeneration, causing a worrying decline in both spatial extent and density. The spatial extent of dryland forests is debated, as estimates of forest areas in drylands are uncertain. The present study aims to map and locate the spatial distribution of the argan trees at Smimou community located in Essaouira province, south-eastern Morocco, using satellite images and a double-classification process to overcome separability problems. The work focuses on the characterization and comparison of the unique phenological patterns of argan with the other present land-cover classes. NDVI products were derived from a Sentinel-2 time-series covering one year (2018 to 2019), then ground samples were used to extract phenological profiles at parcel level then at tree level, to feed representative calibration samples to Support Vector Machine classifier. The outcome was integrated with an elevation model in a Decision Tree to reclassify mixed areas. The results indicated an F1-score and an overall accuracy of 91.27% and 92.60% respectively, a promising technique for updating argan extent at national scale.

TI  - Seascape genomics reveals candidate molecular targets of heat stress adaptation in three coral species
T2  - MOLECULAR ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Anomalous heat waves are causing a major decline of hard corals around the world and threatening the persistence of coral reefs. There are, however, reefs that have been exposed to recurrent thermal stress over the years and whose corals appear to have been tolerant against heat. One of the mechanisms that could explain this phenomenon is local adaptation, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly known. In this work, we applied a seascape genomics approach to study heat stress adaptation in three coral species of New Caledonia (southwestern Pacific) and to uncover the molecular actors potentially involved. We used remote sensing data to characterize the environmental trends across the reef system, and sampled corals living at the most contrasted sites. These samples underwent next generation sequencing to reveal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), frequencies of which were associated with heat stress gradients. As these SNPs might underpin an adaptive role, we characterized the functional roles of the genes located in their genomic region. In each of the studied species, we found heat stress-associated SNPs located in proximity of genes involved in pathways well known to contribute to the cellular responses against heat, such as protein folding, oxidative stress homeostasis, inflammatory and apoptotic pathways, and DNA damage-repair. In some cases, the same candidate molecular targets of heat stress adaptation recurred among species. Together, these results underline the relevance and the power of the seascape genomics approach for the discovery of adaptive traits that could allow corals to persist across wider thermal ranges.

TI  - Artificial neural network and multi-criteria decision-making models for flood simulation in GIS: Mazandaran Province, Iran
T2  - STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood is one of the most destructive natural disasters globally and is a concern due to its high vulnerability. In this study for identification of flood susceptible areas, artificial neural network (ANN) and Multi-Attributive Border Approximation Area Comparison (MABAC) combined with Weights of Evidence (WoE) and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) Models were used in Mazandaran province, Iran. MABAC method was used for the first time to evaluate the flood-prone areas in this study, and Attempts have been made for evaluate the performance of this new method by comparing with ANN model. The output of the neural network was discharge values in hydrometric stations. Using Geographic Information System (GIS) with eight effective factors including rainfall, distance from rivers, slope, soil, geology, elevation, drainage density, and land use, a flood model developed. Three precision parameters containing R-2, RMSE and MAE were applied to show the performance of the ANN model which yielded the values of 0.89, 0.0024 m(3)/s, and 0.0018 m(3)/s, respectively for testing data. The verification results indicated satisfactory agreement between the predicted and the real hydrological records. Also, based on flood inventory map and using the area under receiver operating curve, predictive power of the MABAC-WoE-AHP model was evaluated. The AUC value for prediction rate of this model was 86.1% which indicates the very good accuracy in predicting flood-prone areas. Comparison of flood susceptibility maps for ANN and MABAC-WoE-AHP models showed the good agreement between two models, that clarifies the efficiency of the new proposed method for future preventive measures.

TI  - Evaluating pixel-based vs. object-based image analysis approaches for lithological discrimination using VNIR data of WorldView-3
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The object-based against pixel-based image analysis approaches were assessed for lithological mapping in a geologically complex terrain using Visible Near Infrared (VNIR) bands of WorldView-3 (WV-3) satellite imagery. The study area is Hormuz Island, southern Iran, a salt dome composed of dominant sedimentary and igneous rocks. When performing the object-based image analysis (OBIA) approach, the textural and spectral characteristics of lithological features were analyzed by the use of support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. However, in the pixel-based image analysis (PBIA), the spectra of lithological end-members, extracted from imagery, were used through the spectral angle mapper (SAM) method. Several test samples were used in a confusion matrix to assess the accuracy of classification methods quantitatively. Results showed that OBIA was capable of lithological mapping with an overall accuracy of 86.54% which was 19.33% greater than the accuracy of PBIA. OBIA also reduced the salt-and-pepper artifact pixels and produced a more realistic map with sharper lithological borders. This research showed limitations of pixel-based method due to relying merely on the spectral characteristics of rock types when applied to high-spatial-resolution VNIR bands of WorldView-3 imagery. It is concluded that the application of an object-based image analysis approach obtains a more accurate lithological classification when compared to a pixel-based image analysis algorithm.

TI  - Research on vertical spatial characteristic of satellite infrared hyperspectral atmospheric sounding data
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial characteristic is an important indicator of remote sensor performance, and space-borne infrared hyperspectral sounder is the frontier of atmospheric vertical sounding technology. In this paper, the formation mechanism of the vertical spatial characteristics involved in the space-borne infrared hyperspectral sounding data are analyzed in detail, which shows that the vertical spatial characteristics of sounding data depends not only on the spectral channels and their waveband coverage, but also the specific atmospheric parameter and its specific variation interested. The indicators of vertical spatial characteristics are defined and their mathematical models are established based on the mechanism analyses. These models are applied to the vertical spatial characteristic evaluation of atmospheric temperature sounding for FY-4A GIIRS, which is the first space-borne infrared hyperspectral atmospheric sounder in geostationary orbit. It is concluded that FY-4A GIIRS can sound the vertical temperature distribution in whole troposphere and lower stratosphere with height < 35 km. This study can provide basic information to support the improvement of infrared hyperspectral sounder and the trace of vertical spatial characteristics of atmospheric inversion products.

TI  - Combining survey and remotely sensed environmental data to estimate the habitat associations, abundance and distribution of breeding thin-billed prions <i>Pachyptila belcheri</i> and Wilson's storm-petrels <i>Oceanites oceanicus</i> on a South Atlantic tussac island
T2  - POLAR BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Small petrels are the most abundant seabirds in the Southern Ocean. However, because they breed in burrows on remote and often densely vegetated islands, their colony sizes and conservation status remain poorly known. To estimate the abundance of these species on Bird Island in the Falkland archipelago, we systematically surveyed their breeding burrow density and occupancy across this near-pristine tussac (Poa flabellata)-covered island. By modelling burrow density as functions of topography and Sentinel 2 satellite-derived Normalised Difference Vegetation Index data, we inferred habitat associations and predicted burrow abundance of the commonest species-Thin-billed Prions (Pachyptila belcheri) and Wilson's Storm-petrels (Oceanites oceanicus). We estimate that there are 631,000 Thin-billed Prion burrows on the island (95% CI 496,000-904,000 burrows). Assuming that burrow occupancy lies between 12 and 97%, this equates to around 76,000-612,000 breeding pairs, making Bird Island the second or third largest P. belcheri colony in the world, holding approximately 3-27% of the species' breeding population. We estimate that 8200-9800 (95% CI 5,200-18,300 pairs) pairs of Wilson's Storm-petrels also breed on the island. Notably, the latter burrowed predominantly under and within tussac pedestals, whereas they are usually assumed to breed in rock cavities. Thin-billed Prions are declining in the Kerguelen archipelago, but their population trends in the Falklands are unknown. Given the wide confidence intervals around our own and other population estimates for these cryptic species, we recommend that their populations should be monitored regularly, at multiple sites.

TI  - Use of Ultrasmall Core-Shell Fluorescent Silica Nanoparticles for Image-Guided Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Head and Neck Melanoma A Nonrandomized Clinical Trial
T2  - JAMA NETWORK OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Importance Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping agents approved for current surgical practice lack sufficient brightness and target specificity for high-contrast, sensitive nodal visualization. Objective To evaluate whether an ultrasmall, molecularly targeted core-shell silica nanoparticle (Cornell prime dots) can safely and reliably identify optically avid SLNs in head and neck melanoma during fluorescence-guided biopsy. Design, Setting, and Participants This nonrandomized clinical trial enrolled patients aged 18 years or older with histologically confirmed melanoma in whom SLN mapping was indicated. Exclusion criteria included known pregnancy, breast-feeding, or medical illness unrelated to the tumor. The trial was conducted between February 2015 and March 2018 at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, with postoperative follow-up of 2 years. Data analysis was conducted from February 2015 to March 2018. Interventions Patients received standard-of-care technetium Tc 99m sulfur colloid followed by a microdose administration of integrin-targeting, dye-encapsulated nanoparticles, surface modified with polyethylene glycol chains and cyclic arginine-glycine-aspartic acid-tyrosine peptides (cRGDY-PEG-Cy5.5-nanoparticles) intradermally. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary end points were safety, procedural feasibility, lowest particle dose and volume for maximizing nodal fluorescence signal, and proportion of nodes identified by technetium Tc 99m sulfur colloid that were optically visualized by cRGDY-PEG-Cy5.5-nanoparticles. Secondary end points included proportion of patients in whom the surgical approach or extent of dissection was altered because of nodal visualization. Results Of 24 consecutive patients enrolled (median [interquartile range] age, 64 [51-71] years), 18 (75%) were men. In 24 surgical procedures, 40 SLNs were excised. Preoperative localization of SLNs with technetium Tc 99m sulfur colloid was followed by particle dose-escalation studies, yielding optimized doses and volumes of 2 nmol and 0.4 mL, respectively, and maximum SLN signal-to-background ratios of 40. No adverse events were observed. The concordance rate of evaluable SLNs by technetium Tc 99m sulfur colloid and cRGDY-PEG-Cy5.5-nanoparticles was 90% (95% CI, 74%-98%), 5 of which were metastatic. Ultrabright nanoparticle fluorescence enabled high-sensitivity SLN visualization (including difficult-to-access anatomic sites), deep tissue imaging, and, in some instances, detection through intact skin, thereby facilitating intraoperative identification without extensive dissection of adjacent normal tissue or nerves. Conclusions and Relevance This study found that nanoparticle-based fluorescence-guided SLN biopsy in head and neck melanoma was feasible and safe. This technology holds promise for improving lymphatic mapping and SLN biopsy procedures, while potentially mitigating procedural risks. This study serves as a first step toward developing new multimodal approaches for perioperative care.Question Can the favorable properties of an ultrasmall fluorescent core-shell silica nanoparticle aid real-time image-guided detection, localization, and surgical management of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in patients with head and neck melanoma? Findings In this nonrandomized clinical trial of 24 patients, real-time, particle-based fluorescence imaging of SLNs was feasible and safe at the microdosing level and enabled deep-tissue nodal detection. There was high concordance in identifying nodes between preoperative lymphoscintigraphy and particle-based fluorescence-guided biopsy. Meaning The findings of this study suggest that ultrabright, optical contrast-conferring particles for SLN identification hold promise for overcoming current probe limitations and improving surgical outcomes.This nonrandomized clinical trial evaluates whether an ultrasmall, molecularly targeted core-shell silica nanoparticle can safely and reliably identify optically avid SLNs in head and neck melanoma during fluorescence-guided biopsy.

TI  - Assessing the impact of illumination on UAV pushbroom hyperspectral imagery collected under various cloud cover conditions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent development of small form-factor (<6 kg), full range (400-2500 nm) pushbroom hyperspectral imaging systems (HSI) for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) poses a new range of opportunities for passive remote sensing applications. The flexible deployment of these UAV-HSI systems have the potential to expand the data acquisition window to acceptable (though non-ideal) atmospheric conditions. This is an important consideration for time-sensitive applications (e.g. phenology) in areas with persistent cloud cover. Since the majority of UAV studies have focused on applications with ideal illumination conditions (e.g. minimal or non-cloud cover), little is known to what extent UAV-HSI data are affected by changes in illumination conditions due to variable cloud cover. In this study, we acquired UAV pushbroom HSI (400-2500 nm) over three consecutive days with various illumination conditions (i.e. cloud cover), which were complemented with downwelling irradiance data to characterize illumination conditions and in-situ and laboratory reference panel measurements across a range of reflectivity (i.e. 2%, 10%, 18% and 50%) used to evaluate reflectance products. Using these data we address four fundamental aspects for UAV-HSI acquired under various conditions ranging from high (624.6 - 16.63 W.m(2)) to low (2.5 - 0.9 W.m(2)) direct irradiance: atmospheric compensation, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), spectral vegetation indices and endmembers extraction. For instance, two atmospheric compensation methods were applied, a radiative transfer model suitable for high direct irradiance, and an Empirical Line Model (ELM) for diffuse irradiance conditions. SNR results for two distinctive vegetation classes (i.e. tree canopy vs herbaceous vegetation) reveal wavelength dependent attenuation by cloud cover, with higher SNR under high direct irradiance for canopy vegetation. Spectral vegetation index (SVIs) results revealed high variability and index dependent effects. For example, NDVI had significant differences (p < 0.05) across illumination conditions, while NDWI appeared insensitive at the canopy level. Finally, often neglected diffuse illumination conditions may be beneficial for revealing spectral features in vegetation that are obscured by the predominantly non-Lambertian reflectance encountered under high direct illumination. To our knowledge, our study is the first to use a full range pushbroom UAV sensor (400-2500 nm) for assessing illumination effects on the aforementioned variables. Our findings pave the way for understanding the advantages and limitations of ultra-high spatial resolution full range high fidelity UAV-HSI for ecological and other applications.

TI  - Input/output inconsistencies of daily evapotranspiration conducted empirically using remote sensing data in arid environments
T2  - OPEN GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The reliable quantification of daily evapotranspiration (ET) over vast croplands is a quest in many scholarly works aimed at the precise practice of water resources management. Remote sensing-based empirical and nonempirical models were developed to overcome large-scale quantification issues, which are usually experienced when using conventional approaches for the estimation of ET. The surface energy balance system (SEBS) model was used to quantify the daily ET in the arid/semiarid over Wadi Ad-Dwaser, Saudi. SEBS input variables are parametrically sensitive and climatic dependent, and the model input/output dependencies are of high comprehensibility; therefore, the optimization analysis of SEBS input/ output parameters is the target of the current research. SEBS inputs reciprocal inconsistencies were determined using the artificial neural network analysis, while the output dependencies on the daily ET estimation were mapped. Results demonstrated that the temperature and relative humidity are the most sensitive parameters to be considered in the routine crop monitoring procedure. SEBS output thematic maps showed the robust proportional correlation between the daily ET and the conducted temperature map. Moreover, the estimated daily ET was inversely correlated with the estimated cold sensible heat fluxes. The findings suggest systematic monitoring and forecasting procedures for efficient water-saving management plans in Saudi Arabia.

T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands play a vital role in coastline protection. Coastal landscape of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) has changed drastically. In order to explore the process and law of coastal landscape dynamics in GBA, in this research, multi-temporal Landsat images and proposed hybrid object-based image analysis and multi-level decision tree classification were applied to monitor the changing trends and current status of the coastal landscape in GBA from 1988 to 2018. There were 5818.58 km(2) of natural wetlands in 2018, including mangroves (39.62 km(2)), tidal flats (73.64 km(2)), rivers (161.65 km(2)), and shallow seas (5543.67 km(2)). Due to the influence of anthropogenic activities, natural wetlands showed a decreasing trend, while artificial wetlands and non-wetlands have been increasing. Results indicated that the landscape in the study area showed a trend of fragmentation, the degree of landscape aggregation weakened, the dominant patches were scattered, the shape became more and more complex, and the landscape heterogeneity increased. Then, a future land use simulation model was used to simulate the coastal landscape change trends of GBA in 2028 under four scenarios. The mangrove has the fastest growth rate of 1.47 km(2)/a under wetland protection scenario. The tidal flat and paddy field would increase under scenarios of the wetland protection and farmland protection, respectively. The construction land has the fastest growth rate under the economic development scenario and would be 47.56 km(2)/a. Woodland, dry land, and culture ponds are further transformed into other landscape types, while rivers, shallow seas, and reservoirs/ponds have no obvious change.

TI  - Health outcomes coding trends in the US Food and Drug Administration's Sentinel System during transition to International Classification of Diseases-10 coding system: A brief review
T2  - PHARMACOEPIDEMIOLOGY AND DRUG SAFETY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background and purpose: The transition from International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, clinical modification (ICD-9-CM) to ICD-10-CM poses a challenge to epidemiologic studies that use diagnostic codes to identify health outcomes and covariates. We evaluated coding trends in health outcomes in the US Food and Drug Administration's Sentinel System during the transition.Methods: We reviewed all health outcomes coding trends reports on the Sentinel website through November 30, 2019 and analyzed trends in incidence and prevalence across the ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM eras by visual inspection.Results: We identified 78 unique health outcomes (22 acute, 32 chronic, and 24 acute or chronic) and 140 time-series graphs of incidence and prevalence. The reports also included code lists and code mapping methods used. Of the 140 graphs reviewed, 81 (57.9%) showed consistent trends across the ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM eras, while 51 (36.4%) and 8 (5.7%) graphs showed inconsistent and uncertain trends, respectively. Chronic HOIs and acute/chronic HOIs had higher proportions of consistent trends in prevalence definitions (83.9% and 78.3%, respectively) than acute HOIs (28.6%). For incidence, 55.6% of acute HOIs showed consistent trends, while 41.2% of chronic HOIs and 39.3% of acute/chronic HOIs showed consistency.Conclusions: Researchers using ICD-10-CM algorithms obtained by standardized mappings from ICD-9-CM algorithms should assess the mapping performance before use. The Sentinel reports provide a valuable resource for researchers who need to develop and assess mapping strategies. The reports could benefit from additional information about the algorithm selection process and additional details on monthly incidence and prevalence rates.

TI  - Barriers to Incident Reporting among Nurses: A Qualitative Systematic Review
T2  - WESTERN JOURNAL OF NURSING RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Incident reporting in health care prevents error recurrence, ultimately improving patient safety. A qualitative systematic review was conducted, aiming to identify barriers to incident reporting among nurses. Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for qualitative systematic reviews was followed, with data extracted using JBI QARI tools, and selected studies assessed for methodological quality using Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP). A meta-aggregation synthesis was carried out, and confidence in findings was assessed using GRADE ConQual. A total of 921 records were identified, but only five studies were included. The overall methodological quality of these studies was good and GRADE ConQual assessment score was "moderate." Fear of negative consequences was the most cited barrier to nursing incident reporting. Barriers also included inadequate incident reporting systems and lack of interdisciplinary and interdepartmental cooperation. Lack of nurses' necessary training made it more difficult to understand the importance of incident reporting and the definition of error. Lack of effective feedback and motivation and a pervasive blame culture were also identified.

TI  - African soil properties and nutrients mapped at 30 m spatial resolution using two-scale ensemble machine learning
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil property and class maps for the continent of Africa were so far only available at very generalised scales, with many countries not mapped at all. Thanks to an increasing quantity and availability of soil samples collected at field point locations by various government and/or NGO funded projects, it is now possible to produce detailed pan-African maps of soil nutrients, including micro-nutrients at fine spatial resolutions. In this paper we describe production of a 30 m resolution Soil Information System of the African continent using, to date, the most comprehensive compilation of soil samples (N approximate to 150,000) and Earth Observation data. We produced predictions for soil pH, organic carbon (C) and total nitrogen (N), total carbon, effective Cation Exchange Capacity (eCEC), extractable-phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sulfur (S), sodium (Na), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn)-silt, clay and sand, stone content, bulk density and depth to bedrock, at three depths (0, 20 and 50 cm) and using 2-scale 3D Ensemble Machine Learning framework implemented in the mlr (Machine Learning in R) package. As covariate layers we used 250 m resolution (MODIS, PROBA-V and SM2RAIN products), and 30 m resolution (Sentinel-2, Landsat and DTM derivatives) images. Our fivefold spatial Cross-Validation results showed varying accuracy levels ranging from the best performing soil pH (CCC = 0.900) to more poorly predictable extractable phosphorus (CCC = 0.654) and sulphur (CCC = 0.708) and depth to bedrock. Sentinel-2 bands SWIR (B11, B12), NIR (B09, B8A), Landsat SWIR bands, and vertical depth derived from 30 m resolution DTM, were the overall most important 30 m resolution covariates. Climatic data images-SM2RAIN, bioclimatic variables and MODIS Land Surface Temperature-however, remained as the overall most important variables for predicting soil chemical variables at continental scale. This publicly available 30-m Soil Information System of Africa aims at supporting numerous applications, including soil and fertilizer policies and investments, agronomic advice to close yield gaps, environmental programs, or targeting of nutrition interventions.

TI  - The role of upwellings in the coastal ecosystem of the Southeastern Baltic Sea
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The influence of coastal upwellings on the coastal marine ecosystems of the northern coast of the Sambia Peninsula and the Curonian Spit during the warm period (April-October) of 2014-2015 was studied. An analysis of the sea surface temperature (SST) using moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer data and meteorological conditions revealed 13 coastal upwelling events of various nature. In situ measurements taken in the coastal zone and the open water allowed us to determine the layers from which the water lifts to the surface, making it possible to assess the influence of coastal upwellings on abiotic conditions in the coastal zone. Thus, the spring upwelling led to a decrease or very slight increase in the content of mineral nitrogen, while the summer upwelling introduced nutrients, regardless of its nature. Studies of the autumn upwelling showed that convective processes were predominant. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Countries with delayed COVID-19 introduction - characteristics, drivers, gaps, and opportunities
T2  - GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Three months after the first reported cases, COVID-19 had spread to nearly 90% of World Health Organization (WHO) member states and only 24 countries had not reported cases as of 30 March 2020. This analysis aimed to 1) assess characteristics, capability to detect and monitor COVID-19, and disease control measures in these 24 countries, 2) understand potential factors for the reported delayed COVID-19 introduction, and 3) identify gaps and opportunities for outbreak preparedness, particularly in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). We collected and analyzed publicly available information on country characteristics, COVID-19 testing, influenza surveillance, border measures, and preparedness activities in these countries. We also assessed the association between the temporal spread of COVID-19 in all countries with reported cases with globalization indicator and geographic location. Results Temporal spreading of COVID-19 was strongly associated with countries' globalization indicator and geographic location. Most of the 24 countries with delayed COVID-19 introduction were LMICs; 88% were small island or landlocked developing countries. As of 30 March 2020, only 38% of these countries reported in-country COVID-19 testing capability, and 71% reported conducting influenza surveillance during the past year. All had implemented two or more border measures, (e.g., travel restrictions and border closures) and multiple preparedness activities (e.g., national preparedness plans and school closing). Conclusions Limited testing capacity suggests that most of the 24 delayed countries may have lacked the capability to detect and identify cases early through sentinel and case-based surveillance. Low global connectedness, geographic isolation, and border measures were common among these countries and may have contributed to the delayed introduction of COVID-19 into these countries. This paper contributes to identifying opportunities for pandemic preparedness, such as increasing disease detection, surveillance, and international collaborations. As the global situation continues to evolve, it is essential for countries to improve and prioritize their capacities to rapidly prevent, detect, and respond, not only for COVID-19, but also for future outbreaks.

TI  - Factors of ecosystem service values in a fast-developing region in China: Insights from the joint impacts of human activities and natural conditions
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the spatiotemporal variety and influencing mechanisms of ecosystem service value (ESV) can provide a scientific guide for the regional ecological management and sustainable development. However, the joint effect of factors influencing ESV is ignored, which is an important way for influencing factors to work in the complex and frequently interacting ecosystem. In this study, we used remote sensing data, grid statistics data, and machine learning methods to reveal the spatiotemporal variation of ESV and to explore the combined effects of influencing factors in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) from 2000 to 2015. The specific results were as follows. (1) The total ESV in the GBA decreased by 13.11 billion yuan with the rate of decline slowing over the study period, and the regulating service suffered the most damage. (2) The spatial distribution of ESV has an outer high and inner low circle structure. Compared with that of the west bank of the Pearl River estuary, ESV of the east bank is relatively lower. (3) The three kinds of combination of factors had different impacts on ecosystem services. The effect of land-use integrity on ecosystem services is opposite between natural ecosystem and urban ecosystem. (2)When regional population density is under a certain threshold (669 people/km(2)), social economies and ecosystems may develop together. (3)The mismatched hydrothermal conditions can lead to a decrease in ESV. The findings of our study are conducive to identifying the current situation of ecosystem services and promoting the ecological civilization construction in the GBA, and bring a new insight and perspective on the influencing mechanisms of ESV.

TI  - The effect of various urban design parameter in alleviating urban heat island and improving thermal health-a case study in a built pedestrianized block of China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing urban heat island and global warming have aroused serious thermal environmental problems and even harm people's thermal health. Because of the importance in people's daily life, a commercial pedestrianized block represents a symbol of a city or metropolis; therefore, focusing the attention on the thermal environment in such regions is very necessary. Most of the researches on the urban thermal environment are calculated by remote sensing data; limited by the low spatial resolution of remote sensing image, it may not obviously reflect the true thermal environment of the research site, especially in some microscale regions. Based on this, the new software ENVI-met is developed to research the thermal environment and forecast people's thermal sensation in a microscale region. Therefore, the objective of this study aims at conducting field measurement and numerical simulation to assess the thermal environment of a typical commercial pedestrianized space in southern China and assess the different urban design parameters in ameliorating the urban heat island effect. Our final results demonstrate a quantitative evidence for establishing a comprehensive standard for improving the thermal environment in a microscale region, and this study also can be a supplementary in the research field about improving thermal health.

TI  - Fault motion reversals predating the M<sub>w</sub> 6.3 2009 L'Aquila earthquake: insights from synthetic aperture radar data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The millimetre accuracy of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) measurements and related multi-temporal data analyses provide fundamental information on surface displacements caused by strong earthquakes. The multi-temporal analysis of SAR interferometry data allows for the geometry, kinematics and temporal behaviour of earthquake-generating faults to be better constrained, and is being acknowledged as a promising technique in the field of earthquake precursors. We used SAR data obtained by multi-temporal interferometric techniques such as Permanent Scatterers (PS) interferometry for the investigation of pre- to post-seismic ground displacements in the region struck by the M-w 6.3, 2009 L'Aquila earthquake. We analysed Europen Remote Sensing (ERS) and Envisat PS-datasets from ascending and descending orbits, and COSMO-SkyMed PS-datasets from descending orbit, collectively covering a> 20 year long time span. On a yearly scale, a reversal of motions that affected the hanging-wall and footwall blocks of the earthquake-generating fault is detected. In particular, the hanging-wall block is characterized by pre-seismic uplift - which we document as being independent of any hydrological control - and eastward horizontal motion for about six years, followed by subsidence and westward motion (starting six to eight months prior to the earthquake). We suggest that such a ground displacement pattern may represent an earthquake precursor signal.

TI  - Orbita hyperspectral satellite image for land cover classification using random forest classifier
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Orbita hyperspectral satellite (OHS) is the first commercial hyperspectral satellite in China that completed launching and networking. It can collect world-class hyperspectral data and obtain aerial hyperspectral imagery with 32 bands covering the spectrum range from 400 to 1000 nm at a 10-m resolution, which are of great significance for the quantitative analyses of remote sensing and refined recognitions of land covers. We explore the potentiality of the OHS image in land cover classification (LCC). Taking the Pearl River Delta region as the study area, we selected five feature indices from OHS data, i.e., original bands (OBs), vegetation indices (VIs), water indices (WIs), red edge indices (REIs), and gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) textures for the LCC. Then, data combination schemes were intended to analyze and compare the performance of different feature indices on the accuracies of the LCC. Last, feature optimization was performed on all input variables to determine the optimal variables combination to increase the accuracy and efficiency of the LCC. The random forest classifier was adopted in the above schemes, and the method of mean decrease in accuracy was used to determine the importance of the variables. The results show that (1) refined accuracy of LCC was obtained using only OBs; in addition, REIs can further improve the classification accuracy significantly. (2) The optimal variables combination achieves the highest classification accuracy (OA = 93.21% and kappa coefficient = 0.91), and the user's and producer's accuracies exceeded 90% for most land cover categories. (3) Variable importance analyses show that the importance of both red-edge bands and REIs were greater than those of near-infrared bands and VIs for the LCC. The importance ranking of different indices from high to low was REIs > OBs > GLCM > WIs > VIs. This research demonstrates the potentialities and values of the OHS image for the application of LCC.

TI  - Imaging technology of the lymphatic system
T2  - ADVANCED DRUG DELIVERY REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - The lymphatic system plays critical roles in tissue fluid homeostasis and immunity and has been implicated in the development of many different pathologies, ranging from lymphedema, the spread of cancer to chronic inflam-mation. In this review, we first summarize the state-of-the-art of lymphatic imaging in the clinic and the advantages and disadvantages of these existing techniques. We then detail recent progress on imaging technology, including advancements in tracer design and injection methods, that have allowed visualization of lymphatic vessels with excellent spatial and temporal resolution in preclinical models. Finally, we describe the different approaches to quantifying lymphatic function that are being developed and discuss some emerging topics for lymphatic imaging in the clinic. Continued advancements in lymphatic imaging technology will be critical for the optimization of diagnostic methods for lymphatic disorders and the evaluation of novel therapies targeting the lymphatic system.(c) 2020 The Authors.

TI  - Evaluation of Cartosat-2E Data for Large-Scale Urban Mapping
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale maps are a prerequisite for sustainable management of urban areas for which very high-resolution satellite (VHRS) imagery can be effectively utilized. PAN sharpened (merged) orthorectified product of Cartosat-2E satellite launched by ISRO (0.6 m spatial resolution) has been evaluated for 1:4000 scale mapping in Dehradun and Rishikesh, India. Root mean square error (RMSE) of Cartosat-2E data is found to be 29.03 m in Dehradun and 28.15 m in Rishikesh. However, after the induction of GCPs collected from the Differential GPS (DGPS) survey, RMSE error reduced to less than 1 m, which is acceptable for urban mapping as per atal mission for rejuvenation and urban transformation (AMRUT) design and standards. It is observed that system-level improvements in data acquisition and the use of high accuracy GCPs can assist in harnessing the potential of Cartosat-2E for large-scale urban mapping at 1:4000 scale. It is also found that Cartosat 2E data can be utilized for identification of a large number of subclasses (similar to 39) of urban land use land cover and building footprints as per the AMRUT design standards which have a great potential to reduce project cost and volume of human resources for large-scale urban mapping as compared to conventional ground-based methods.

TI  - Four decadal urban land degradation in Pakistan a case study of capital city islamabad during 1979-2019
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The study of Land Use Land Cover (LULC) changes and their patterns enhance our understanding about various man caused phenomenon on earth surface. The Capital City of Pakistan, Islamabad has expereinced high rate of urbanization and population increase in the last 3-4 decades and as a result, the LULC changes have occurred in an unsustainable way. The accurate and reliable data of LULC changes for the study period is not available. The main aim of this study was to provide compatible data on LULC change during the last 40 years for the functional city Islamabad, Pakistan. LULC statistics were extracted from Landsat Multi-Spectral Scanner (MSS), Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Operational Land Imager (OLI) images. For each of the target years (1979, 1989, 1999, 2009 and 2019) LULC information was obtained through a supervised classification algorithm. The study area was classified into five major landscape categories, namely built-up, agriculture, forest, water bodies and barren land. The results have indicated that the urban expansion has been increasing due to mass migration and uncontrolled urbanization in the city. The urban sprawl analysis revealed that built-up area and agricultural land has expanded by 41.7% and 5.20% respectively, during 1979-2019. On the other hand, the forest and water bodies declined by 9.03% and 1.21% respectively. The land use changes, have forced the planners to revise the original master plan of the city and including the agricultural sector in the housing area during 2019.

TI  - Long-term sustainability of groundwater resources in the central Ganga Alluvial Plain, India: Study from Gomti River Basin
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater is the major primary source of drinking and irrigation water for nearly 500 million inhabitants in both rural and urban areas of the Ganga Alluvial Plain (GAP) in India. Indiscriminate pumping of groundwater primarily from the shallow parts of the alluvial aquifer system is leading to rapid decline in water tables. It is expected that in coming years, the stress on groundwater will only increase due to steadily rising urbanization and additional demands for water and land, as well as by impending weather anomalies and shifts in availability of water during seasons when demands for irrigation and ecological needs are high. In the present study, Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) interpolation method is used using pre- and post-monsoon groundwater levels from 764 observatory wells and peizometers to assess the trends of declining groundwater in the Gomti River Basin (GRB) during 2005 to 2015. Groundwater potential zone maps were composed using water depths data and Cartosat-1 satellite images delineating the area under rising and falling groundwater tables. The loss of shallow groundwater was clearly visible during the 2005-2015 periods. The decline is attributed to intensive irrigation from groundwater as well as peri-urban growth around the state capital. This study can apprise the planners and local administrators of the effects of irrigation and urbanization on the groundwater regime in the fast growing regions of the basin.

TI  - Who is asked about alcohol consumption? A retrospective cohort study using a national repository of Electronic Medical Records
T2  - PREVENTIVE MEDICINE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Documentation of alcohol use in electronic medical record (EMR) informs interventions to reduce alcohol-related morbidity and mortality. This retrospective cohort study explored EMR data from 960 primary care providers participating in the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network to describe documentation of alcohol use (e.g. none, current or past use) in the EMR. Included providers represented 700,620 adult patients from across Canada with an encounter between 2015 and 2018. Bivariate comparisons characterized the patients with, and without, documentation of alcohol use. Multivariate generalized estimating equation models with logit function assessed patient and provider characteristics associated with (1) documentation of alcohol and (2) patients with heightened risk for alcohol-related problems. Forty percent of patients had alcohol use documentation in the EMR. Light alcohol consumption was recorded for 43.6% of these patients. Male patients (OR1.09, CI 1.07-1.12), who were older (OR1.26, CI 1.23-1.30), had more frequent visits to their provider (OR1.11, CI 1.09-1.13) and had hypertension (OR1.07, CI 1.06-1.09) or depression (OR1.07, CI 1.09-1.14) had higher odds of alcohol documentation. There were 4.7% of patients with a record indicating heightened risk for alcohol-related problems. Male patients (OR3.27 CI 3.14-3.4), patients with depression (OR2.01 CI1.93-2.1) and rural residency (OR1.35 CI1.29-1.42) was associated with risk for alcohol-related problems. Heavy alcohol consumption is associated with an increased risk of negative health outcomes, particularly for patients with certain chronic conditions. However, these patients do not have alcohol use consistently documented in the EMR. Strategies should be designed and implemented to support more consistent alcohol-screening among high-risk patients.

AB  - Globalisation, migration, socio-political shifts, and access to the internet are increasing the religious and belief diversity of Irish society. This flux presents challenges for young people who are endeavouring to establish a secure identity. The focus of this research was to understand how the identity development of post-primary students of minority faith or worldview, is impacted by attending a school with a Catholic ethos. The research methodology was qualitative. To provide an opportunity for students to voice their experiences, 18 post-primary students of minority faith or worldview were interviewed. Thematic analysis was used to identify the findings. Reflecting on an interpretivist paradigm, the epistemology which underpinned this research was constructivism. While theories of adolescent moral and identity development alongside theories of othering, conformity, and agency supported the research study. The findings report some students struggled to find a secure identity due to conflicting societal, school, peer, and family beliefs. Perceived negative stereotyping of their beliefs created feelings of otherness with implications for students' self-esteem. Students' sense of belonging and well-being was impacted on by Catholic centric school practices combined with current provision to 'opt-out' from Religious Education classes. However, the research also found human agency resulted in a kaleidoscope of student responses to the inherent challenges of adolescent identity development.

TI  - New framework for natural-artificial transport paths and hydrological connectivity analysis in an agriculture-intensive catchment
T2  - WATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The impacts of human activities on hydrological connectivity disturb the network topology of transport paths, which has gradually evolved from natural terrain features to dual natural-artificial features. In this study, a new framework is proposed to extract information from natural-artificial transport paths and related hydrological connectivity dominated by agricultural practices and ditch networks. Graph theory and connectivity indexes are integrated for the comprehensive classification and the parallel processing of potential flow transport networks and their upstream drainage areas. Based on high-resolution remote sensing data and detailed field investigations, this new framework, which combines graph theory and connectivity indexes, is applied to a typical agriculture-intensive catchment in China. The results show that artificial factors greatly influence the transport paths and the related drainage areas. With the development of ditch construction, the hydrological transport paths become shorter and more fragmented. In addition, key ditch segments are identified by connectivity indexes, and recommendations are given for future planning. This new framework offers an approach for the hydrological connectivity analysis of complex networks and provides effective strategies for agricultural development. ? 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Unsupervised Ship Detection for Single-Channel SAR Images Based on Multiscale Saliency and Complex Signal Kurtosis
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional ship detection methods for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) mainly utilize the amplitude information to distinguish ship targets from sea clutter, including constant false alarm rate (CFAR), visual attention model, and deep learning methods. The CFAR algorithms adopt the dense sliding window strategy, which is very time-consuming and may generate numerous false alarms. The deep learning methods are supervised and difficult to obtain satisfactory performance when the number of labeled samples is insufficient. The visual attention models can quickly focus on the potential target area, and however, it is still difficult to eliminate the strong clutter, such as radio frequency interference and azimuth ambiguity. In fact, as a coherent imaging system, SAR data itself are complex-valued. Compared with the amplitude information, complex information can essentially reflect the difference between ship target and sea clutter. To improve the accuracy and efficiency of ship detection, in this letter, a novel unsupervised ship detection method based on multiscale saliency and complex signal kurtosis (MSS-CSK) for single-channel SAR images is proposed, which contains the proposal extraction stage and the target discrimination stage. The experimental results based on the Radarsat-2 real SAR data show that the proposed method has high detection accuracy and efficiency.

TI  - Remote sensing-based operational modeling of fuel ignitability in Hyrcanian mixed forest, Iran
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - To date, the efficiency and effectiveness of early warning systems of satellite imagery for preventing and mitigating wildfire remain a challenging issue. The heat of pre-ignition (Q(ig)) can be an index of fire likelihood, which is further enhanced with remotely sensed data, active fire data, and fuels information for operational application of satellite imagery in fire early warning systems. Q(ig) is a prerequisite for forest fires by the side of ignition sources and weather. This study analyzed the effect of Q(ig) variation on fire occurrences to develop a remote sensing-based initial fire likelihood index for identifying areas that have a high probability of fire. In this study, Q(ig) of Rothermel's fire spread model daily data is retrieved at 1 km pixels from MODIS data. MODIS active fire products were used to interpret the Q(ig) of fuels for 10 days before the days of fire occurrences in November 2010 to determine the pre-fire conditions. A formula for converting Q(ig) into an initial fire likelihood index (IFLI) was then used by binary logistic regression method. Analyses show that there was a positive association between suggested IFLI and fire occurrences during the study period with a fair diagnostic accuracy of 92%, and 80% for dead and live fuels, respectively. Mann-kendall test suggested that there are significant trends in the fuel moisture content time-series for both live and dead fuels. Further analysis using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test represents that the models showed an acceptable fit. The suggested IFLI is an effective tool for fire management decision-making whenever a near real-time fire likelihood is required.

TI  - Interannual Nearshore Habitat Use of Young of the Year White Sharks Off Southern California
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Young-of-the-year (YOY) and juvenile-stage white sharks may use southern California nearshore beach habitats more extensively than previously known, within meters of some of the most heavily used beaches in the world. Such knowledge forms a critical component of species management and conservation plans, in addition to public safety and risk mitigation planning. We used data derived from a combination of satellite tag locations (13 animals over 3 years) and passive acoustic monitoring (34 animals over 8 years) to examine the occurrence, relative abundance, and residency patterns of YOY white sharks in southern California waters. Our results suggest that southern California contains spatiotemporally dynamic centers of primary nursery habitat. Tagged YOY white sharks formed loose aggregations at "hotspot" locations that were interannually variable, where individuals exhibited temporal fidelity, higher levels of residency, and spatially restricted movements, with multiple YOY individuals simultaneously displaying this behavior. While models of biotic and abiotic variables suggested relative abundance of tagged sharks may be predicted by sea surface temperature, salinity and productivity (chlorophyll-A), these predictors were not consistent across all years of the study. Thus, novel approaches that incorporate technologies to derive high resolution environmental data, paired with more comprehensive telemetry datasets are therefore required to better understand the extrinsic factors that drive habitat selection and residency patterns in juvenile white sharks.

TI  - ICESat-2 Elevation Retrievals in Support of Satellite-Derived Bathymetry for Global Science Applications
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Bathymetry retrievals from 2D, multispectral imagery, referred to as Satellite-Derived Bathymetry (SDB), afford the potential to obtain global, nearshore bathymetric data in optically clear waters. However, accurate SDB depth retrievals are limited in the absence of "seed depths." The Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) space-based altimeter has proven capable of accurate bathymetry, but methods of employing ICESat-2 bathymetry for SDB retrievals over broad spatial extents are immature. This research aims to establish and test a baseline methodology for generating bathymetric surface models using SDB with ICESat-2. The workflow is operationally efficient (17-37 min processing time) and capable of producing bathymetry of sufficient vertical accuracy for many coastal science applications, with RMSEs of 0.96 and 1.54 m when using Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8, respectively. The highest priorities for further automation have also been identified, supporting the long-range goal of global coral reef habitat change analysis using ICESat-2-aided SDB.

TI  - A high-contrast search for variability in HR 8799bc with VLT-SPHERE
T2  - MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The planets HR8799bc display nearly identical colours and spectra as variable young exoplanet analogs such as VHS 1256-1257ABb and PSO J318.5-22, and are likely to be similarly variable. Here we present results from a 5-epoch SPHERE IRDIS broadband-H search for variability in these two planets. HR 8799b aperture photometry and HR 8799bc negative simulated planet photometry share similar trends within uncertainties. Satellite spot lightcurves share the same trends as the planet lightcurves in the August 2018 epochs, but diverge in the October 2017 epochs. We consider Delta(mag)(b) - Delta(mag)(c) to trace non-shared variations between the two planets, and rule out non-shared variability in Delta(mag)(b) - Delta(mag)(c) to the 10-20 level over 4-5 h. To quantify our sensitivity to variability, we simulate variable lightcurves by inserting and retrieving a suite of simulated planets at similar radii from the star as HR 8799bc, but offset in position angle. For HR 8799b, for periods <10 h, we are sensitive to variability with amplitude > 5 per cent. For HR 8799c, our sensitivity is limited to variability > 25 per centfor similar periods.

TI  - Spatio-temporal patterns of optimal Landsat data for burn severity index calculations: Implications for high northern latitudes wildfire research
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing has been widely used for the evaluation of wildfire burn severity in various ecosystems. While a variety of remote sensing-based burn severity indices have been developed, the Landsat-based differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) presents the most widely-used approach to burn severity assessment for fire research and management. Although dNBR-based approaches have been continuously updated, including the development of the relative dNBR (RdNBR) and the Relativized Burn Ratio (RBR), one key obstacle for the reliable applications of the burn severity indices in the high northern latitudes has not been adequately addressed. Specifically, optimal Landsat image pairs are very rarely available for the calculation of the burn severity indices in certain regions of the high northern latitudes (HNL), resulting in the burn severity index outputs calculated for a large number of wildfires being considerably affected by non-fire-related factors. The suboptimal selection of image pairs may have partially contributed to the lack of consistency in the performance of the burn severity indices in the HNL regions. In this paper, we systematically evaluated the impacts of sub-optimal image pairs on signal stability through two sets of analyses conducted at different spatial scales. First, at the regional scale, we examined the burn severity indices calculated for a selection of wildfires in Alaska. Here, we demonstrate the inconsistent performance of the same index calculated based on Landsat data that are typically considered as "optimal". In addition, we show that the calculated indices may be more prone to the negative impacts of these inconsistencies, thus leading to reduced reliability, when there is limited Landsat data availability. Second, at the continental scale, we show that certain areas in the HNL, especially Alaska during the pre-2000 era, are subject to the potentially strong negative impact associated with the limited data availability. Through systematically analyzing this issue, we hope to not only divert more attention to it but also to provide potential solutions, based on which further improvements that may be of particular importance for research on Arctic wildfires could be made.

TI  - Evaluation of alternative two-source remote sensing models in partitioning of land evapotranspiration
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing (RS)-based two-source models have been widely used to separate soil evaporation (E) and vegetation transpiration (T) in ecosystems. Alternative model assumptions and physical mechanisms employed in different two-source models cause the difference in model performance. Understanding of the characteristics and limitations of alternative two-source models is critical to ensure the most effective applications in various climatic zones and underlying surfaces. This study investigated two types of land surface temperature (LST) decomposition based two-source models, namely Two-Source Energy Balance Model (TSEB) and Modified Pixel Component Arranging and Comparing Algorithm (M-PCACA); as well as a meteorological factors-based Penman-Monteith type model (PM-MU) in the partitioning of E and T. The three models were compared at 21 flux stations across China, which included seven types of underlying surfaces and one isotope station. The study demonstrated that all three models were applicable in a large scale study for latent heat flux (LE) estimation. Overall, M-PCACA performed the best with average root-mean-square errors (RMSE) of 38.7 W/m(2), while PM-MU performs the worst with average RMSE of 61.4 W/m(2). For ET partitioning, the two models based on LST decomposition (TSEB and M-PCACA) gave more reliable estimates compared with stable water isotope observations. In addition, verification results for the seven types of underlying surfaces showed that the TSEB gave the best accuracy in the areas with high leaf area index (LAI) and vegetation height (e.g. forest), while the PM-MU had an advantage in the areas without vegetation (e.g. deserts and water bodies). Due to the characteristics of the land surface temperature-vegetation coverage (LST-fc) trapezoidal framework, the M-PCACA model had the most stable model performance for various underlying surfaces and gave the best estimates in grassland, wetland, and farmland areas. Using a thorough discussion, this study identified the sources of discrepancies induced by different physical mechanisms of three remote sensing-based two-source models. This investigation provided insights to better understand the alternative two-source models and provides guidance for model application.

TI  - Validation of the Community Land Model Version 5 Over the Contiguous United States (CONUS) Using In Situ and Remote Sensing Data Sets
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Community Land Model (CLM) is an effective tool to simulate the biophysical and biogeochemical processes and their interactions with the atmosphere. Although CLM version 5 (CLM5) constitutes various updates in these processes, its performance in simulating energy, water and carbon cycles over the contiguous United States (CONUS) at scales which land surface changes and hydrometeorological and hydroclimatological applications are more locally relevant is yet to be assessed. In this study, we conducted three simulations at 0.125 degrees during 1979-2018 over the CONUS using different configurations of CLM, namely CLM5-biogeochemistry (CLM5BGC), CLM4.5BGC, and CLM5-satellite phenology (CLM5SP). We validated and compared their simulations against multiple remote-sensed and in situ data sets. Overall, the parametric and structural updates (e.g., carbon cost for nitrogen uptake, variable soil thickness, dry surface layer) in CLM5 improve its ability in capturing terrestrial biogeochemical dynamics. The low evapotranspiration in CLM5BGC is associated with biases in simulating vegetation phenological characteristics rather than soil water limitations. The mismatch between CLM5BGC-simulated peak leaf area index and reference data can be attributed to CLM5BGC's inability in simulating phenology of trees and grasses. The differences between CLM-simulated irrigation and reference estimates can be attributed to differences between processes represented in models and in reality, and uncertainties in input and validation data sets. Evaluation against observations at small catchments suggest that hydrologic parameters needed to be calibrated to improve simulations of runoff, especially subsurface runoff. Additional efforts are needed to incorporate spatially distributed plant phenology and physiology parameters and regional-specific agricultural management practices (e.g., planting and harvest).

TI  - Geomatics and epidemiology: Associating oxidative stress and greenness in urban areas
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Green spaces may benefit human health mainly by mitigating noise and air pollution, promoting physical or social activities and improving mental health. Based on the influence that green space exposure seems to exert on Public Health and using a multidisciplinary approach, we investigated, the association between oxidative stress (OS) and green exposure in children. Overall, 207 subjects (10-13 yrs) living in Torino (NW- Italy) were involved in this study. Each participant provided a urinary sample, used to quantify a reliable OS biomarker (15-F2t-IsoP), and their residence addresses, used for geocoding. Green exposure was characterised by calculating i) the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) within fixed buffers around each participant's home, using remotely-sensed data; ii) Tree Map accounting for evergreen/broadleaf species; iii) The percentage of green cover (PGC). Significant negative correlation (Pearson's r = -0.758, p < 0.001) between PGC and 15-F2t-IsoP was found. Greater SAVI was associated with lower OS (Pearson's r = -0.717, p < 0.001). Noticeably, evergreens seemed to determine a significant OS reduction compared to broadleaves (slope = -0.12 and -0.02, respectively; Wartontest F = 12.48, p = 0.0011). Finally, a spatial distribution of 15-F2t-IsoP estimates map, overlying with 2011 Census Data on same-aged dwellers of Torino, was generated. Predictive models accounting for green spaces influence on OS can be useful tool derived from geomatic employ in the Public Health field. Future developments of such a multidisciplinary approach should be considered in urban planning and policy-makers decisions to better define priority zones to requalify in urban settings.

TI  - Nursing care and prevalence of adverse events in prone position: Characteristics of mechanically ventilated patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pulmonary infection
T2  - NURSING IN CRITICAL CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Because of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the use of prone positioning has dramatically increased in the intensive care unit (ICU). Because this manoeuvre is related to several complications, it must be performed in a protocolized manner by the appropriate personnel.Aim: To determine the prevalence of adverse events (AEs) in patients admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (C-ARDS) undergoing mechanical ventilation in prone position (PP).Design: Descriptive ambispective study of patients admitted to the ICU diagnosed with C-ARDS undergoing mechanical ventilation who were in the PP at least once. The number of PP manoeuvres and the time spent in the PP were recorded for each subject. AEs proportions and frequencies were calculated, and analysis of variance was used to assess mean differences in the number of manoeuvres and total hours in PP stratified by the number of facial pressure ulcers. IBM SPSS Statistics v.25.0. and EPIDAT 4.1 software were used.Results: Forty-four patients were analysed, and 130 PP manoeuvres were performed. The most frequently observed AEs were facial oedema in 26 patients (80.3%) and facial pressure ulcers in 20 (60.6%). There was a significant positive association between the time spent in PP and the development of facial pressure ulcers (P <.001). Enteral nutrition was well tolerated, and no serious AEs or sentinel events were noted.Conclusion: Despite the stressful, demanding situation during the peak of the pandemic, the large number of PP manoeuvres, and long duration spent in this position, no serious AEs occurred. This study highlights the need to implement preventive measures to avoid the development of pressure ulcers secondary to prone positioning. Relevance to practice: Prone positioning requires a nursing protocol to prevent the occurrence of AEs that may reduce the quality of nursing care.

TI  - Study of the physicochemical properties of drugs suitable for administration using a lymphatic drug delivery system
T2  - CANCER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Lymph node (LN) metastasis is thought to account for 20-30% of deaths from head and neck cancer. The lymphatic drug delivery system (LDDS) is a new technology that enables the injection of drugs into a sentinel LN (SLN) during the early stage of tumor metastasis to treat the SLN and secondary metastatic LNs. However, the optimal physicochemical properties of the solvent used to carry the drug have not been determined. Here, we show that the osmotic pressure and viscosity of the solvent influenced the antitumor effect of cisplatin (CDDP) in a mouse model of LN metastasis. Tumor cells were inoculated into the proper axillary LN (PALN), and the LDDS was used to inject CDDP solution into the subiliac LN (SiLN) to treat the tumor cells in the downstream PALN. CDDP dissolved in saline had no therapeutic effects in the PALN after it was injected into the SiLN using the LDDS or into the tail vein (as a control). However, CDDP solution with an osmotic pressure of similar to 1,900 kPa and a viscosity of similar to 12 mPa.s suppressed tumor growth in the PALN after it was injected into the SiLN using the LDDS. The high osmotic pressure dilated the lymphatic vessels and sinuses to enhance drug flow in the PALN, and the high viscosity increased the retention of CDDP in the PALN. Our results demonstrate that optimizing the osmotic pressure and viscosity of the solvent can enhance the effects of CDDP, and possibly other anticancer drugs, after administration using the LDDS.

M3  - Article
AB  - The 2016-2017 Candlelight Revolution was one of the most significant events in recent South Korean politics, but little attention has been paid to the powerful conservative counter-movement that accompanied and followed the candlelight protests. This counter-movement was symbolized by demonstrations by flag-carriers who found Park Geun-Hye's impeachment and Moon Jae-In's inauguration incomprehensible. They argued that Park was innocent, called for her release from prison, and claimed that Moon's election was illegitimate. An analysis of speeches made during conservative counter-protests between 2016 and 2019 illustrates how these activists reject the values of a new era in South Korean political and economic life. Instead, their speeches conveyed a clear desire to have the legacy of the industrialization generation recognized in contemporary South Korea. These flag-carriers are evidence that a marginalized set of desires and aspirations about South Korean nationalism and identity coexist with the progressive views of the candlelight protesters. The persistence of such an intense and partisan worldview, however, poses a threat to the future of liberal democracy in South Korea.

TI  - A data-driven approach to estimate leaf area index for Landsat images over the contiguous US
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf Area Index (LAI) is a fundamental vegetation biophysical variable serving as an essential input to many land surface and atmospheric models. Long-term LAI maps are typically generated with satellite images at moderate spatial resolution (0.25 to 1 km), such as those from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). While useful for regional-scale land surface modeling, these moderate resolution products often cannot resolve spatial heterogeneity important for many agricultural and hydrological applications. This paper proposes an approach to map LAI at 30-m resolution based on Landsat images for the Contiguous US (CONUS) consistent with the MODIS product, aimed at multi-scale modeling applications. The algorithm was driven by 1.6 million spatially homogeneous samples derived from MODIS LAI and Landsat surface reflectance products from 2006 to 2018. Based on these samples, we trained separate random forest models to estimate LAI from Landsat surface reflectance for eight biomes of the National Land Cover Database (NLCD). A balanced sample design regarding the saturation status of MODIS LAI and a machine-learning-based noise detection technique were introduced to mitigate the trade-off in estimation accuracy between medium LAI (e.g., 3 to 4, unsaturated) and high LAI (e.g., 4-6, saturated).This approach was evaluated using ground measurements from 19 National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) sites and eight independent sites from other sources. These sites comprise a representative sample of forests, grasslands, shrublands, and croplands across the US. For NEON sites, the LAI estimates show an overall Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.8 with r(2) of 0.88. For the eight independent sites, the Landsat LAI algorithm achieves RMSE between 0.52 and 0.91. The uncertainty in Landsat estimated LAI varies across biomes and locations. The proposed algorithm was implemented on the Google Earth Engine platform, allowing for the rapid generation of long-term high-resolution LAI records from the 1980s using Landsat images (code is available at https://github.com/yanghuikang/Landsat-LAI). Our findings also highlight the importance of sample balance on regression-based modeling in remote sensing applications.

TI  - Effects of different management options of Norway spruce on radiative forcing through changes in carbon stocks and albedo
T2  - FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Norway spruce (Picea abies Karst. (L.)) in the boreal zone can be managed as even-aged or uneven-aged stands, or be grown with no management at all. Here, we investigated how these management options affect carbon dynamics, particularly the carbon stocks in the forest ecosystem (trees and soil), and albedo, and their combined effect on radiative forcing compared to a reference case, clear-cut site before planting seedlings. This allowed us to assess the potential of different management regimes to mitigate global warming. We ran long-term simulations under the current climate on a sub-mesic site in central Finland (62 degrees N) using an eco-physiological forest-ecosystem model. Compared to even-aged management, no management (old-growth forest) increased ecosystem carbon stocks by 47 per cent and decreased albedo by 15 per cent, whereas uneven-aged management reduced ecosystem carbon stocks by 16 per cent and increased albedo by 10 per cent. Only the no management option resulted in a significant net cooling effect whereas for even-aged and uneven-aged management, the opposing effects of changes in albedo and carbon stocks largely cancelled each other with little remaining net effect. On the other hand, the latter one even made a small net warming contribution. Overall, maintaining higher ecosystem carbon stocks implied the larger cooling benefits. This was evident even though lower albedo enhanced radiation absorption, and thus warming. Increasing use of the no management option by forest owners may require proper incentives such as compensation for lost harvest incomes.

T2  - CURRENT TROPICAL MEDICINE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose of Review This review is aimed at highlighting recent research and articles on the complicated relationship between virus, vector, and host and how biosurveillance at each level informs disease spread and risk. Recent Findings While human cases of CCHFV and tick identification in non-endemic areas in 2019-2020 were reported to sites such as ProMed, there is a gap in recent published literature on these and broader CCHFV surveillance efforts from the late 2010s. A review of the complex aspects of CCHFV maintenance in the environment coupled with high fatality rate and lack of vaccines and therapeutics warrants the need for a One-Health approach toward detection and increased biosurveillance programs for CCHFV.

TI  - Clay-plug sediment as the locus of arsenic pollution in Holocene alluvial-plain aquifers
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Shallow aquifers in many Holocene alluvial basins around the world have in the last three decades been identified as arsenic pollution hotspots, in which the spatial variation of natural (or: geogenic) arsenic concentration is conditioned by the meandering-river geomorphology and the fluvial lithofacies distribution. Despite the large amount of publications on the specifics of the pollution, still many uncertainties remain as to the provenance and processes that lead to arsenic enrichment in aquifers. In this paper, arsenic in abandoned and sediment-filled meandering-river bends (or: clay-plugs) is highlighted as a primary source of aquifer pollution. The combination of high organic-carbon deposition rates and the presence of chemically-bound natural arsenic in sediment of this specific geomorphological setting creates the potential for microbially-steered reductive dissolution of arsenic in an anoxic environment, and subsequent migration of the desorbed arsenic to, and stratigraphic entrapment in, adjacent sandy point-bar aquifers. To assess the magnitude of the arsenic source in clay-plug, bulk sediment volume calculations were made of twenty clay plugs on the Middle Ganges Plain of Bihar (India), by combining clay-plug surface area analysis of Sentinel-2 satellite data, side-scan sonar depth profiling of oxbow lakes and the Ganges River, and sedimentological data from five cored shallow wells. ICP-MS based elemental analysis of 36 core sub-samples, complemented with published concentration data in a similar geomorphological setting in West Bengal, India, yielded an average arsenic content of 28.75 mg/kg sediment in the 12-m-thick clay plugs, which amounts to a total arsenic volume of 0.07 - 3.13. 10(6) kg per clay plug. A scenario is presented for the release of arsenic from the clay-plug sediment by microbial metabolism, followed by migration of the desorbed arsenic to the bordering point-bar sands.

TI  - Inter-satellite variability of grassland curing maps produced by different satellite sensors - Victoria, Australia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Grassland fires are a serious problem in Victoria, Australia due to large quantity of dry grass. Grassland curing degree (GCD) measures the dryness of the grass and is an important factor for assessing grassland fire danger. Grassland curing maps (GCMs) display the spatial distribution of GCDs, but the quality of GCMs varies depending on the spatial resolution of the observing satellite remote sensing system. The higher the spatial resolution, the finer the GCD details and more spatial variations the GCM can reveal. In this study, GCD calculation algorithm named MapVictoria based on MODIS data is tested for Landsat 8 Sentinel 2; GCMs generated from these three satellites are contrasted by their GCD differences, defined here as inter-satellite variability (ISV). ISV is used to identify areas where higher resolution satellite GCMs should be used. Results show that spatial resolution difference (Delta SR), seasonality and geographical locations affect the magnitude of the ISV. Based on these findings, this paper provides recommendations to decision makers on where and when to use which satellite for grassland observations.

TI  - Study on prediction of internal solitary waves propagation in the southern Andaman Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The prediction of internal solitary waves (ISWs) propagation is a difficult problem in the field of oceanography due to the complexity of its generative mechanism and the lack of in-situ data. In this paper, the simulation data is used to establish a prediction model of ISWs propagation in the southern Andaman Sea by deep learning. The global tidal model TPXO7.2 is used to obtain the semi-diurnal tidal velocity data at the generation source of ISWs. The generation and propagation characteristics of ISWs are obtained by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology General Circulation Model (MITgcm). The generative location, amplitude, and propagation characteristics of the ISWs are calculated based on MITgcm. The database is set up by the extracted data from MITgcm. Then, the prediction model of ISWs propagation is established using long and short-term memory (LSTM) networks. Finally, the accuracy of the model is verified by the ISWs Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images of the southern Andaman Sea and in-situ data. The results demonstrate that, compared with the MODIS images, the average relative error of time predicted by the LSTM model is 17.81%, and the average absolute error is 0.95 h. The average relative error of longitude predicted by the LSTM model is 0.10%, and the average absolute error is 0.10 degrees. The average of the amplitudes predicted by the LSTM model is 56.99 m. The in-situ data of the amplitude of ISWs is 60 m in the previous research. The two amplitudes are relatively close.

TI  - Coastal phytoplankton bloom dynamics in the Tyrrhenian Sea: Advantage of integrating in situ observations, large-scale analysis and forecast systems
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal systems represent the most dynamic natural systems on Earth, making their study particularly challenging. A holistic approach that integrates a set of monitoring tools for data collection (i.e., satellite imagery, numerical models and in situ observations) may provide different information about coastal ecosystems at different spatial and temporal scales. Of course, none of these tools are perfect, being that each is characterized by intrinsic errors and therefore specific uncertainties, which is also an important subject of investigation. Long-term high-resolution in situ observations of the phytoplankton biomass at a coastal site (Civitavecchia, Tyrrhenian Sea), provided by the Civitavecchia Coastal Environment Monitoring System (C-CEMS) observational platform, are presented, discussed and integrated with data from the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Services (CMEMS) for the Mediterranean Sea, which are generated by the MedBFM model system, and satellite observations from the CMEMS Ocean Colour database. The analysis of the time series of phytoplankton provided by in situ, satellite and model data show the typical dynamics of coastal temperate systems, which are characterized by spring and autumn blooms and significant interannual variability. The empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis highlights the consistency among the multiplatform datasets, whereas integrating the local in situ time series with a spatial analysis from model and satellite data provides information about the extent of coastal bloom phenomena and the relevance of the observation location with respect to surroundings. Our study of the dynamics of coastal blooms in the Civitavecchia coastal system allows us to propose a best practice framework that may be of general interest, and potentially applied to any multiplatform monitoring system (MPMS). The MPMS approach allows us to investigate the interannual variability over different horizontal and vertical scales, reflecting the variability in natural drivers (i.e., atmospheric forcings, coastal currents, upwelling, and land inputs), as typically expected in coastal areas.

TI  - Disentangling the Regional Climate Impacts of Competing Vegetation Responses to Elevated Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Biophysical vegetation responses to elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) affect regional hydroclimate through two competing mechanisms. Higher CO2 increases leaf area (LAI), thereby increasing transpiration and water losses. Simultaneously, elevated CO2 reduces stomatal conductance and transpiration, thereby increasing rootzone soil moisture. Which mechanism dominates in the future is highly uncertain, partly because these two processes are difficult to explicitly separate within dynamic vegetation models. We address this challenge by using the GISS ModelE global climate model to conduct a novel set of idealized 2xCO(2) sensitivity experiments to: evaluate the total vegetation biophysical contribution to regional climate change under high CO2; and quantify the separate contributions of enhanced LAI and reduced stomatal conductance to regional hydroclimate responses. We find that increased LAI exacerbates soil moisture deficits across the sub-tropics and more water-limited regions, but also attenuates warming by similar to 0.5-1 degrees C in the US Southwest, Central Asia, Southeast Asia, and northern South America. Reduced stomatal conductance effects contribute similar to 1 degrees C of summertime warming. For some regions, enhanced LAI and reduced stomatal conductance produce nonlinear and either competing or mutually amplifying hydroclimate responses. In northeastern Australia, these effects combine to exacerbate radiation-forced warming and contribute to year-round water limitation. Conversely, at higher latitudes these combined effects result in less warming than would otherwise be predicted due to nonlinear responses. These results highlight substantial regional variation in CO2-driven vegetation responses and the importance of improving model representations of these processes to better quantify regional hydroclimate impacts.

TI  - Towards a Mechanistic Understanding of Precipitation Over the Far Eastern Tropical Pacific and Western Colombia, One of the Rainiest Spots on Earth
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - According to Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) satellite precipitation composites, a broad maritime area over the far eastern tropical Pacific and western Colombia houses one of the rainiest spots on Earth. This study aims to present a suite of mechanistic drivers that help create such a world-record-breaking rainy spot. Previous research has shown that this oceanic and nearly continental precipitation maximum has a strong early morning precipitation peak and a high density of mesoscale convective systems. We examined new and unique observational evidence highlighting the role of both dynamical and thermodynamical drivers in the activation and duration of organized convection. Results showed the existence of a rather large combination of mechanisms, including: (1) dynamics of the Choco (ChocoJet) and Caribbean Low-Level Jets along their confluence zone, including the Panama semi-permanent low; (2) ChocoJet deceleration offshore is favored by land breeze, enhancing the nighttime and early morning low-level convergence; (3) a wind sheared environment that conforms to the long-lived squall line theory; (4) action of mid-level gravity waves, which further support the strong diurnal variability; and (5) mesoscale convective vortices related to subsidence in the stratiform region and top-heavy mass flux profiles. This study emphasizes the multiscale circulation and thermodynamics mechanisms associated with the formation of one of the rainiest spots on Earth and showcases new observations gathered during the Organization of Tropical East Pacific Convection field campaign (OTREC; August-September, 2019) that support the outlined mechanisms.

TI  - Modeled Atmospheric Optical and Thermodynamic Responses to an Exceptional Trans-Atlantic Dust Outbreak
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-range aerosol transport is an important physical mechanism for ecological, biological, and hydrological elements of the earth system. Regarding the latter, regional climate models have no way of assimilating future aerosol concentrations, so dust aerosol emissions must be parameterized using local landscape and meteorological conditions. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of different dust emission settings within the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with chemistry (WRF-Chem) to facilitate future dynamical downscaling work. This study performs nine WRF-Chem hindcasts, each utilizing a different dust emission configuration, from 1 March to 31 May 2015, coinciding with a Saharan air layer (SAL) dust outbreak during the 2015 Caribbean drought. WRF-Chem aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Galvez-Davison Index (GDI), a convective forecasting parameter, are validated against analogous MODIS, AERONET, and ERA5 products. In aggregate, the GOCART dust emission scheme with Air Force Weather Agency modifications (GOCART-AFWA) achieved the best balance between AOD and GDI accuracy when employing the default tuning constant (1.00). As the schemes emitted dust more aggressively, WRF-Chem produced warming at 500 hPa, reducing GDI over the central and eastern Atlantic near the modeled dust trajectory. Though AOD was generally too low over the southwest Atlantic, the eastern Caribbean occupies a transition zone between negative and positive AOD biases where this field was hindcast with relative accuracy. Meanwhile, areas with positive AOD biases were associated with negative GDI biases (and vice versa) indicating the covariability between SAL dust loadings and thermodynamic conditions in the tropical north Atlantic.

TI  - Extending the Spatio-Temporal Applicability of DISPATCH Soil Moisture Downscaling Algorithm: A Study Case Using SMAP, MODIS and Sentinel-3 Data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - DISPATCH is a disaggregation algorithm of the low-resolution soil moisture (SM) estimates derived from passive microwave observations. It provides disaggregated SM data at typically 1 km resolution by using the soil evaporative efficiency (SEE) estimated from optical/thermal data collected around solar noon. DISPATCH is based on the relationship between the evapo-transpiration rate and the surface SM under non-energy-limited conditions and hence is well adapted for semi-arid regions with generally low cloud cover and sparse vegetation. The objective of this paper is to extend the spatio-temporal coverage of DISPATCH data by 1) including more densely vegetated areas and 2) assessing the usefulness of thermal data collected earlier in the morning. Especially, we evaluate the performance of the Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) instead of SEE in the DISPATCH algorithm over vegetated areas (called vegetation-extended DISPATCH) and we quantify the increase in coverage using Sentinel-3 (overpass at around 09:30 am) instead of MODIS (overpass at around 10:30 am and 1:30 pm for Terra and Aqua, respectively) data. In this study, DISPATCH is applied to 36 km resolution Soil Moisture Active and Passive SM data over three 50 km by 50 km areas in Spain and France to assess the effectiveness of the approach over temperate and semi-arid regions. The use of TVDI within DISPATCH increases the coverage of disaggregated images by 9 and 14% over the temperate and semi-arid sites, respectively. Moreover, including the vegetated pixels in the validation areas increases the overall correlation between satellite and in situ SM from 0.36 to 0.43 and from 0.41 to 0.79 for the temperate and semi-arid regions, respectively. The use of Sentinel-3 can increase the spatio-temporal coverage by up to 44% over the considered MODIS tile, while the overlapping disaggregated data sets derived from Sentinel-3 and MODIS land surface temperature data are strongly correlated (around 0.7). Additionally, the correlation between satellite and in situ SM is significantly better for DISPATCH (0.39-0.80) than for the Copernicus Sentinel-1-based (-0.03 to 0.69) and SMAP/S1 (0.37-0.74) product over the three studies (temperate and semi-arid) areas, with an increase in yearly valid retrievals for the vegetation-extended DISPATCH algorithm.

TI  - Quantifying monthly water balance to estimate water deficit in Mayurakshi River basin of Eastern India
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recorded seasonal variation and uneven distribution of rainfall is one of the major issues to the agrarian society and the domestic water users today. For strategic planning of water use, scientific estimation of water balance in different spatio-temporal scale is necessary. For this, the present paper intends to investigate monthly and annual water balance state of Mayurakshi River basin (including 45 sub-basins) using precipitation (P), runoff (Q), evapotranspiration (ET) and recharge/soil moisture. P, Q, ET, respectively, vary from 1625.97 mm to 2037.93 mm, 182.19 mm to 1503.15 mm and 1050 mm to 1500 mm for the entire basin. The monthly pattern shows significant variation attributed to strong seasonality of P and temperature (T). Monsoon months recorded heavy maximum P, Q and actual ET and on the other hand, all these are very poor during pre-monsoon season. Groundwater recharge annually differs spatially, but annual average recharge is 307mmwith main contribution in monsoon months. Water deficit condition prevails in pre-monsoon season; strong groundwater lowering and drying of top soil are some explicit evidences of the same. This seasonal water scarcity withstands against multi-cropping strategies of the agrarian communities. To cope with this emerging situation, pressure on groundwater is mounting but it is the fact that this resource is also highly limited and precious. Quantification of monthly water balance and water deficit will be inputs to the strategy development for sustainable water resource management.

TI  - Sharp-based shoreface sandstones in the Early Carboniferous sediments of the Awaynat Wanin area (western Libya)
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Awaynat Wanin exposure is the closest outcrop analogue for Palaeozoic strata deposited in the subsurface of the Ghadames basin. This study focuses on Lower Carboniferous strata, examined on the edge of the extensive Al Hammadah al Hamra plateau. The desert and rocky conditions of the area provide excellent exposures that are poorly documented. Our new dataset comprises 1500 m of sedimentary logs acquired along an 80 km transect. The results are present as a revised composite section for this exposure, which using integrated GPS and satellite data, re-assesses the maximum thickness of the Marar at 800 m. The excellent exposures also allow evaluation of lateral variability. Detailed facies analysis supports a dominantly marine environment of deposition, characterised by 45 sedimentary cycles that typically record transition from offshore mudstone to sandy shoreface facies and sometimes palaeosols. In the regional context of an inactive tectonic setting at deposition time in the Early Carboniferous, these numerous upward shallowing cycles are interpreted to record relative fluctuations of eustatic sea level. The Awaynat Wanin exposures therefore offers a valuable record to improve understanding of the Early Carboniferous variations of the sea level.

TI  - Exploring the Potential of DSCOVR EPIC Data to Retrieve Clumping Index in Australian Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network Observing Sites
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation foliage clumping significantly alters the radiation environment and affects vegetation growth as well as water, carbon cycles. The clumping index (CI) is useful in ecological and meteorological models because it provides new structural information in addition to the effective leaf area index. Previously generated CI maps using a diverse set of Earth Observation multi-angle datasets across a wide range of scales have all relied on the single approach of using the normalized difference hotspot and darkspot (NDHD) method. We explore an alternative approach to estimate CI from space using the unique observing configuration of the Deep Space Climate Observatory Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (DSCOVR EPIC) and associated products at 10 km resolution. The performance was evaluated with in situ measurements in five sites of the Australian Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network comprising a diverse range of canopy structure from short and sparse to dense and tall forest. The DSCOVR EPIC data can provide meaningful CI retrievals at the given spatial resolution. Independent but comparable CI retrievals obtained with a completely different sensor and new approach were encouraging for the general validity and compatibility of the foliage clumping information retrievals from space. We also assessed the spatial representativeness of the five TERN sites with respect to a particular point in time (field campaigns) for satellite retrieval validation. Our results improve our understanding of product uncertainty both in terms of the representativeness of the field data collected over the TERN sites and its relationship to Earth Observation data at different spatial resolutions.

TI  - Review of petroleum toxicity in marine reptiles
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Worldwide petroleum exploration and transportation continue to impact the health of the marine environment through both catastrophic and chronic spillage. Of the impacted fauna, marine reptiles are often overlooked. While marine reptiles are sensitive to xenobiotics, there is a paucity of petroleum toxicity data for these specialized fauna in peer reviewed literature. Here we review the known impacts of petroleum spillage to marine reptiles, specifically to marine turtles and iguanas with an emphasis on physiology and fitness related toxicological effects. Secondly, we recommend standardized toxicity testing on surrogate species to elucidate the mechanisms by which petroleum related mortalities occur in the field following catastrophic spillage and to better link physiological and fitness related endpoints. Finally, we propose that marine reptiles could serve as sentinel species for marine ecosystem monitoring in the case of petroleum spillage. Comprehensive petroleum toxicity data on marine reptiles is needed in order to serve as a foundation for future research with newer, unconventional crude oils of unknown toxicity such as diluted bitumen.[GRAPHICS].

TI  - Prediction of wetland area and depth using linear regression model and artificial neural network based cellular automata
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are an integral part of the socio-ecological setup of the earth, but their fast transformation beg careful consideration. In this regard, the flood plain wetlands of the Atreyee river basin of India and Bangladesh are not exceptional. The main goal of this study is the mapping of the floodplain wetlands, along with arriving at predictions of their area up to 2039 using the advanced technique of artificial neural network based cellular automata (ANN-CA). Apart from this, prediction of wetland depth using linear regression model is another aim of the present research work. The analysis is executed using 27 Landsat images and Digital Elevation Model (DEM). Results reveal that the present wetland area is 52.92 km2 in pre-monsoon and 518.68 km2 in post-monsoon season, respectively. The composite wetland map from 1987 to 2019 of post-monsoon clearly indicates that 10.48km2 wetlands are identified as hydro-ecologically consistent wetlands. Simulated models reveal that the wetland area from 2009 to 2019 has declined by 66.16km2 and is expected to decrease by 164.62km2 in the next 20 years. Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) depth indicates that water availability also may decline significantly in the next 20 years as per regression model-based simulation. All the simulated models were validated with observed wetland area by kappa coefficient, receiver operating curve. The present study will definitely be useful for decision-makers by aiding them in initiatives that take a significant step toward maintaining the wetland landscape, as well as the environment.

TI  - Improving Surface Soil Moisture Estimates in Humid Regions by an Enhanced Remote Sensing Technique
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Using optical remote sensing data to downscale microwave soil moisture is currently a crucial technique for producing fine-resolution soil moisture data set at large scales. Conventional soil moisture downscaling models are mainly developed and evaluated in arid or semi-arid regions, but have serious limitation in humid regions. To improve soil moisture estimates under a wide range of climate regimes, this study developed a nonlinear enhanced soil moisture downscaling model and evaluated it at a typical microwave resolution over the contiguous China. The enhanced model clearly outperforms the conventional approach in estimating surface soil moisture by reducing the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) from 0.175 vol/vol to 0.075 vol/vol under wet climate. Finally, soil moisture downscaling is conducted by applying such models (built at the 25-km scale) at a finer (1-km) resolution. Validation result of downscaled soil moisture against in situ data set demonstrates the advantage of the enhanced model.

TI  - Convective System Dynamics Viewed in 3D Over the Oceans
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous studies indicated a relationship between deep convection and sea surface wind patterns; however, it remains difficult to remotely observe a deep Convective System (CS) and its dynamics above the ocean due to the lack of data at the mid atmospheric levels. To collect the details of the CS dynamics, some nearly simultaneous data of three CS features, that is, cloud brightness temperature, vertical wind at the midlevels, and horizontal wind at the sea surface, can be now obtained by a combination of sensors from a geostationary (Meteosat) and two polar-orbiting satellites (Sentinel-1 and Aeolus), having corresponding acquisition time and orbit track matching. This work thus illustrates a nearly three-dimensional view of the CS atmospheric dynamics over the sea, including deep convective clouds observed by Meteosat, intense downdrafts measured by Aeolus, and strong surface winds estimated by Sentinel-1.Plain Language Summary Cumulonimbus clouds (anvil-shaped clouds or convective systems) may be associated with some meteorological hazards, including intense precipitation up to 50 mm/hr, surface wind gust exceeding 25 m/s, and strong lightning. For a long time, the analyses and prediction of cumulonimbus clouds and their effects over the surface have been generally complicated due to the lack of observation data, particularly when cumulonimbus clouds occur suddenly. The understanding and forecast of cumulonimbus have been much improved in recent years thanks to the launch of geostationary satellites (Meteosat, GOES, Himawari, Gaofen) that cover the entire earth with a 5-10 min time sampling. Likewise, surface wind patterns associated with cumulonimbus clouds can be observed by the low altitude polar satellites, especially by the high spatial resolution Sentinel-1 SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) satellite. Furthermore, the launch of the Aeolus satellite on August 22, 2018, enables the observations of the section of vertical wind profiles associated with surface wind gust viewed by Sentinel-1. The combination of three satellites (Sentinel-1, Aeolus, and Meteosat) offers an observation of cumulonimbus clouds, their vertical atmospheric movement, and the associated wind gust over the sea surface. The current study indicates that the production of surface wind gust depends on the intensity of the downward air flux from the higher cumulonimbus altitude to the sea surface.

TI  - The costs of delivering emergency care at regional referral hospitals in Uganda: a micro-costing study
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundUganda experiences a high morbidity and mortality burden due to conditions amenable to emergency care, yet few public hospitals have dedicated emergency units. As a result, little is known about the costs and effects of delivering lifesaving emergency care, hindering health systems planning, budgeting and prioritization exercises. To determine healthcare costs of emergency care services at public facilities in Uganda, we estimate the median cost of care for five sentinel conditions and 13 interventions.MethodsA direct, activity-based costing was carried out at five regional referral hospitals over a four-week period from September to October 2019. Hospital costs were determined using bottom-up micro-costing methodology from a provider perspective. Resource use was enumerated via observation and unit costs were derived from National Medical Stores lists. Cost per condition per patient and measures of central tendency for conditions and interventions were calculated. Kruskal-Wallis H-tests and Nemyeni post-hoc tests were conducted to determine significant differences between costs of the conditions.ResultsEight hundred seventy-two patient cases were captured with an overall median cost of care of $15.53 USD ($14.44 to $19.22). The median cost per condition was highest for post-partum haemorrhage at $17.25 ($15.02 to $21.36), followed by road traffic injuries at $15.96 ($14.51 to $20.30), asthma at $15.90 ($14.76 to $19.30), pneumonia at $15.55 ($14.65 to $20.12), and paediatric diarrhoea at $14.61 ($13.74 to $15.57). The median cost per intervention was highest for fracture reduction and splinting at $27.77 ($22.00 to $31.50). Cost values differ between sentinel conditions (p<0.05) with treatments for paediatric diarrhoea having the lowest median cost of all conditions (p<0.05).ConclusionThis study is the first to describe the direct costs of emergency care in hospitals in Uganda by observing the delivery of clinical services, using robust activity-based costing and time motion methodology. We find that emergency care interventions for key drivers of morbidity and mortality can be delivered at considerably lower costs than many priority health interventions. Further research assessing acute care delivery would be useful in planning wider health care delivery systems development.

TI  - Using a land use regression model with machine learning to estimate ground level PM<sub>2.5</sub>
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has been ranked as the sixth leading risk factor globally for death and disability. Modelling methods based on having access to a limited number of monitor stations are required for capturing PM2.5 spatial and temporal continuous variations with a sufficient resolution. This study utilized a land use regression (LUR) model with machine learning to assess the spatial-temporal variability of PM2.5. Daily average PM2.5 data was collected from 73 fixed air quality monitoring stations that belonged to the Taiwan EPA on the main island of Taiwan. Nearly 280,000 observations from 2006 to 2016 were used for the analysis. Several datasets were collected to determine spatial predictor variables, including the EPA environmental resources dataset, a meteorological dataset, a land-use inventory, a landmark dataset, a digital road network map, a digital terrain model, MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) database, and a power plant distribution dataset. First, conventional LUR and Hybrid Kriging-LUR were utilized to identify the important predictor variables. Then, deep neural network, random forest, and XGBoost algorithms were used to fit the prediction model based on the variables selected by the LUR models. Data splitting, 10-fold cross validation, external data verification, and seasonal-based and county-based validation methods were used to verify the robustness of the developed models. The results demonstrated that the proposed conventional LUR and Hybrid Kriging-LUR models captured 58% and 89% of PM2.5 variations, respectively. When XGBoost algorithm was incorporated, the explanatory power of the models increased to 73% and 94%, respectively. The Hybrid Kriging-LUR with XGBoost algorithm outperformed the other integrated methods. This study demonstrates the value of combining Hybrid Kriging-LUR model and an XGBoost algorithm for estimating the spatial-temporal variability of PM2.5 exposures. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Evaluating global ecosystem water use efficiency response to drought based on multi-model analysis
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought has serious consequences on terrestrial ecosystems, particularly for their carbon and water processes. As an important indicator to examine the balance of ecosystem water and carbon cycles, ecosystem water use effi-ciency (WUE) has been widely used to investigate ecosystem responses to drought. However, the response of WUE to drought and the role of different ecosystem processes in controlling the response of WUE to drought are not well studied. In this paper, we used four WUE datasets from different remote sensing-driven (RS-driven) models and three drought indices (Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index, soil moisture anomaly index and water storage anomaly-based drought index) to comprehensively investigate the response of WUE to drought and its dominant ecosystem processes during the period of 2001-2018. The results showed the WUE datasets from four different RS-driven models had discrepancies in WUE temporal trends, particularly in tropical and subtropical forest and semi-arid regions. The Spearman correlation analysis revealed that the positive correlations between WUE and drought accounted for more than half of global vegetated lands, while negative relationship mainly occurred in the high latitude regions. We further explored the dominant ecosystem processes (represented by GPP and ET) in controlling WUE response to drought, and found ET controlled WUE-drought relationship in the high latitude areas and semi-arid/sub-humid regions, while GPP dominated it in tropical forest regions. Additionally, the effects of GPP and ET on controlling WUE response to drought were examined to change with different drought indices, especially in the semi-arid regions. Our study suggests multi-model analysis tend to reduce uncertainties in analyzing WUE response to drought caused by a single WUE data. Moreover, our results highlight the different role of ecosystem processes in controlling WUE response to drought and provide new information for the underlying mechanism of drought impacts on ecosystem water and carbon cycles.(c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Assessing variability of optimum air temperature for photosynthesis across site-years, sites and biomes and their effects on photosynthesis estimation
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Gross primary productivity (GPP) of vegetation is affected by air temperature. Biogeochemical models use the optimum air temperature (T-opt) parameter, which comes from biome-specific look-up tables (Topt-b-LT). Many studies have shown that plants have the capacity to adapt to changes in environmental conditions over time, which suggests that the static Topt-b-LT parameters in the biogeochemical models may poorly represent actual T opt and induce uncertainty in GPP estimates. Here, we estimated biome-specific, site-year-specific, and site-specific optimum air temperature using GPP data from eddy covariance (EC) flux tower sites (GPP(EC)) (Topt-b-EC, Topt-sy-EC, Topt-s-EC), the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from MODIS images (Topt-b-EVI, Topt-s-EVI), and mean daytime air temperature (T-DT). We evaluated the consistency among the four T-opt parameters (Topt-b, Topt-sy, Topt-s and Topt-b-LT), and assessed how they affect satellite-based GPP estimates. We find that T-opt parameters from MODIS EVI agree well with those from GPP(EC), which indicates that EVI can be used as a variable to estimate T(opt )at individual pixels over large spatial domains. Topt-b, Topt-sy, and Topt-s differed significantly from Topt-b-LT. GPP estimates using Topt-b and Topt-sy were more consistent with GPP(EC) than when using Topt-b-LT for all the land cover types. Our use of Topt-sy substantially improved 8-day and annual GPP estimates across biomess (from 1% to 34%), especially for cropland, grassland, and open shrubland. Our simple calculation shows that global GPP estimates differ by up to 10 Pg C/yr when using our suggested Topt-sy-EVI instead of using the static Topt-b-LT. Our new approach on estimating T opt has the potential to improve estimates of GPP from satellite-based models, which could lead to better understanding of carbon-climate interactions.

TI  - Role of surgery in patients with synchronous metastatic breast cancer: Is there a need for axillary lymph node removal?
T2  - JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGY OBSTETRICS AND HUMAN REPRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: About 6% of women with breast cancer present with synchronous metastases. Treatment remains palliative in international recommendations but the impact of loco-regional surgery remains controversial.Objective: We conducted a multicentre, cohort study to evaluate the impact of axillary lymph node (ALN) surgery on overall survival in stage IV breast cancer at diagnosis.Methods: Patients presenting with breast cancer and synchronous metastases between 2005 and 2014 were included. Follow up was conducted up to 1st June 2018. The only exclusion criterion was a history of previous malignancies. Breast surgery was defined as lumpectomy or mastectomy. Axillary surgery included full ALN dissection, and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). If the SLN was invaded on the frozen section, full axillary dissection was performed.Results: 152 patients were included. 71 women had no surgery, 81 had primary site surgery of which 64 (79%) had breast and axillary surgery and 17 (21%) breast surgery only. 5-year overall survival was 59.8% (95% CI=[49.5; 69.5]) for women with breast and axillary surgery, 23.5% (95% CI=[15.6; 33]) for women with breast surgery only and 9.8% (95% CI=[4.7; 17.5]) for women without any surgery, p < 0.001. Combined with breast surgery, axillary surgery significantly added a mean of 33 months to patient overall survival.Conclusion: ALN surgery combined with breast surgery in metastatic breast cancer significantly increased overall survival. Thus surgical indications should not differ from those in women with breast cancer without metastases. (C) 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI  - The Role of Postmastectomy Radiotherapy in Locally Advanced Breast Cancer After Pathological Complete Response to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy.
T2  - Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)
M3  - Case Reports
AB  - The Case A previously healthy woman, aged 32 years, presented to the oncology clinic with a 6-month history of left-breast tumor, mastalgia, and swollen axillary nodes. Physical examination was relevant for a 6-cm palpable mass in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast and an ipsilateral 2-cm, nonfixed axillary lymph node. Mammography showed a 1-cm mass in the upper outer quadrant, a 5.2-cm mass in the lower outer quadrant, and enlarged pathologic lymph nodes (BI-RADS category 5 disease). Breast ultrasound revealed 3 axillary lymph nodes with cortical thickening and loss of normal morphology (the largest with a 2.6-cm length in the long axis) (Figure 1A-B). The breasts core biopsy revealed a grade 3 apocrine invasive carcinoma with lymphovascular invasion; immunohistochemistry testing showed HER2-negative, hormone receptor-negative disease (estrogen receptor, 0%; progesterone receptor, 0%; HER2-negative, Ki67, 50%) (Figure 2A-B). A fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the axillary lymph nodes showed invasive breast carcinoma as well. Bone scintigraphy and a chest/abdomen CT scan ruled out metastatic disease. Upon initial diagnosis, clinical stage was deemed as cT3N1M0 (American Joint Committee on Cancer 8th edition: anatomic stage IIIA, clinical prognostic stage IIIC). After a multidisciplinary tumor board discussion, the patient underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with weekly paclitaxel, followed by 4 cycles of dose-dense doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide. After completing neoadjuvant treatment, clinical examination was relevant for a residual 1-cm palpable left breast mass and no palpable axillary nodes. Mammography and breast ultrasound showed a 77% partial response in the primary tumors, and axillary nodes with normal morphology and size (Figure 1C-D). Due to multicentric tumor disease, breast-conserving surgery would not confer satisfactory cosmetic results on her, and a modified radical mastectomy with intraoperative sentinel lymph node biopsy (and second-stage breast reconstruction) was planned. However, during surgery, the surgeons failed to identify the mapped lymph node, and level I-III axillary lymph node dissection was performed. The pathology report described complete pathological response: Miller and Payne criteria grade 5 response with the absence of malignant cells within the mastectomy specimen and in 24 lymph nodes (Figure 2C-E). Pathological staging after neoadjuvant treatment concluded ypT0N0M0 disease. Subsequent treatment for this patient was discussed in another tumor board.

These factors are dependent on the species, age, and health statuses of trees, as well as the site conditions. Sentinel-2 imagery with the high spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution, has enabled analysis of the relationships between vegetation properties and their spectral responses at large spatial scales. A comprehensive study of these relationships is needed to understand the drivers of vegetation spectral patterns and is essential from the point of view of remote sensing data interpretation. Our study aimed to quantify the site and forest parameters affecting forest stands reflectance. The analysis was conducted for common beech-, silver fir- and Scots pine-dominated stands in a mountainous area of the Polish Carpathians. The effect of stands and site properties on reflectance in different parts of the growing season was captured using the dense time series provided by Sentinel-2 from 2018-2019. The results indicate that the reflectance of common beech stands is mainly influenced by elevation, particularly during spring and autumn. Other factors influencing beech stand reflectance include the share of the broadleaved understory, aspect, and, during summer, the age of stands. The reflectance of coniferous species, i.e., Scots pine and silver fir, is mainly influenced by the age and stand properties, namely the crown closure and stand density. The age is a primary driver for silver fir stands reflectance changes, while the stand properties have a large impact on Scots pine stands reflectance. Also, the understory influences Scots pine stands reflectance, while there appears to be no impact on silver fir stands. The influence of the abovementioned factors is highly diverse, depending on the used band and time of the season.

TI  - Time series monitoring of impervious surfaces and runoff impacts in Metro Vancouver
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban areas are increasing rapidly worldwide, leading to widespread changes in land surfaces over time. Urbanized land cover is heterogeneous, and is characterized by a large areal proportion of manufactured impervious surfaces which are linked to ecological degradation, habitat loss, and increase in precipitation runoff leading to pollution and safety risks. Data from the Landsat series of satellites present an opportunity to characterize urban land cover and impervious surfaces, over a large spatial and temporal scale. In this study, land cover changes from 1990 to 2015 are characterized in the large metropolitan area of Metro Vancouver, Western Canada. An ordinal regression is used to link Landsat spectral data with a detailed land classification containing classes of impervious surface used by municipal planners in the region (Spearman's Rho = 0.76). The regression is then used to classify a time series of imagery where static land classifications are not available, providing a 25-year time-series of change in impervious surface area. A trend in increasing impervious surface was detected across the municipalities in the region, with an overall areal increase of 31.96%. Precipitation events were then simulated at each time step, using precipitation rates adjusted for expected changes in climate by 2050. Both runoff depths and inundated area increased over time, with a 51% increase in area inundated by at least 5 cm. Runoff depths were evaluated for each municipality in the region, and compared to projected populations for 2050 to highlight communities that may face elevated levels of runoff risk. Results show a steady increase in impervious surfaces in the region. Impacts of future extreme precipitation events vary across the region, with flat and low-lying topographies appearing to be more severely affected, along with areas containing extensive impervious development.

TI  - Adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer patients with axillary lymph node micrometastases
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The axillary lymph node status is one of the most important prognostic factors in patients with early breast cancer. However, the impact of axillary lymph node micrometastases on survival remains unclear. There are no consistent recommendations for adjuvant chemotherapy (CHT). In this context, we aimed to investigate the impact of micrometastases on the clinical outcome of breast cancer patients according to the adjuvant CHT performed. Patients and methods We conducted a retrospective population-based registry study of 26,465 patients aged between 24 and 97 years with primary breast cancer diagnosed between 2003 and 2017. Of these patients, 8856 with early breast cancer were eligible for analysis: 8316 (93.9%) were node negative and 540 (6.1%) had lymph node micrometastases. Results The median follow-up was 7.2 years, with a confidence interval (CI) of 7.1-7.3 years. Patients with lymph node micrometastases (pN1mi) without adjuvant CHT have reduced 10-year overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) compared to patients who had axillary lymph node micrometastases and received an adjuvant CHT. However, this effect disappeared after adjustment for age, tumor size and tumor grading. Furthermore, in the group of patients with lymph node micrometastases, the administration of adjuvant CHT did not improve OS or RFS, compared to patients with lymph node micrometastases without adjuvant CHT: hazard ratio for treated patients was 1.51 (95% CI 0.80-2.85, p = 0.208) for OS and 1.12 (95% CI 0.63-1.97, p = 0.705) for RFS. Conclusion Patients with axillary lymph node micrometastases showed a comparable outcome to node negative patients and their outcome was not significantly improved with CHT. Thus, axillary lymph node micrometastases should not be considered in the treatment decision.

TI  - How useful is sentinel lymph node biopsy for the status of lymph node metastasis in cT1N0M0 gastric cancer? A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - UPDATES IN SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is intriguing because it is expected to further expand the indication of endoscopic resection (ER) for cT1N0M0 gastric cancer and as an additional operation for post-ER gastric cancer. The aim of our study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis on the feasibility and diagnostic value of SLNB technique in patients with cT1N0M0 gastric cancer. Eligible studies were systematically searched in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases from inception to April 2020. A random-effect model was used to pool the data, and subgroup analysis was used to explain the heterogeneities. A total of 22 clinical studies (1993 patients with cT1N0M0 gastric cancer) were included. The pooled SLN identification rate, sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals were 0.99 (0.99-1.00), 0.92 (0.88-0.95), 1.00 (1.00-1.00), and 832.8 (395.5-1753.6), respectively. The summary receiver operator characteristic displayed a test accuracy of 99.3%. Subgroup analysis found an improved SLN sensitivity for studies with the mean number of SLNs > 4 and studies stained with a combination of hematoxylin-eosin with immunohistochemistry (HE + IHC). Further, studies using the basin dissection were associated with a higher SLN identification rate. The current meta-analysis provides data that favors the use of SLNB for predicting the status of lymph node metastasis in patients with cT1N0M0 gastric cancer. However, establishing standard procedure and suitable criteria for further application and optimization of SLNB is urgently needed.

TI  - Simulating summer mixing heights in California's San Joaquin Valley using the WRF meteorological model with three land surface modules
T2  - METEOROLOGY AND ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - During the 1990 SARMAP/AUSPEX study a network of rawinsondes was flown at 3- and 6-h intervals to evaluate the meteorological conditions conducive high ozone concentrations in the Central Valley of California. Vertical profiles of air temperature, humidity, and pressure from 9 of the sites were used to determine maximum daily mixing heights in California's San Joaquin Valley (SJV) during the period August 3-6, 1990 and to evaluate their spatial distribution. The analysis showed a general pattern of increasing mixing heights from north to south within the SJV. But, it also showed that mixing heights were lower in areas in proximity to irrigated agriculture. The WRF prognostic meteorological model was used to simulate mixing heights during this period using three land surface modules (LSM): thermal diffusion (TD), Noah, and Pleim-Xiu (PXU). The maximum daily mixing heights simulated using the TD LSM were generally negatively biased; while those simulated using the Noah and PXU LSMs were positively biased. The differences in simulated mixing heights were attributed to differences in how crop land irrigation water is represented within each LSM. The TD LSM effectively assumes a fixed soil water content, but of sufficient magnitude to reflect latent heat fluxes associated with crop land irrigation. The PXU and Noah LSMs include comprehensive descriptions of the soil water budget. However, soil water may be depleted in the arid summer climate and these LSMs provide no direct means of accounting for water added through irrigation. The LSMs were also sensitive to estimates of ground cover in irrigated areas. For all 9 sites, the root mean square error (RMSE) for maximum daily mixing heights for the TD LSM, the Noah LSM, and the PXU LSM was 269, 350, and 366 m, respectively; and the biases for the 9 sites were - 161, 355, and 437 m, respectively. Using the assumption of well-managed irrigation and leaf area index (LAI) estimates from AVHRR remote sensing data sets, adjustments to the WRF input files were made to update soil water contents and ground cover for irrigated crop land use. Using the Noah LSM with the adjusted files, site-specific mixing height biases were reduced up to a factor of 4 and, for all sites, the RMSE for maximum daily mixing heights were reduced from 350 to 260 m; for the PXU LSM RMSEs were reduced from 366 to 238 m; and for the TD LSM from 269 to 231 m. This analysis illustrates the importance of accounting for the effects of applied irrigation water and ground cover in the simulation of mixing heights during the arid summer within the SJV. Irrigation can influence actual mixing heights and their distribution within a domain. It also illustrates that the choice of LSM is of less importance than setting LSM parametrizations to values appropriate for the modeling domain.

TI  - Upscaling evapotranspiration from the instantaneous to the daily time scale: Assessing six methods including an optimized coefficient based on worldwide eddy covariance flux network
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing plays an irreplaceable role in mapping evapotranspiration (ET) at the regional scale. Instantaneous ET can be derived by multiple ET models based on various remotely sensed data at the time of satellite overpass. Therefore, a reliable temporal upscaling method from instantaneous ET to daily ET is of great importance. In this study, six widely used upscaling methods for estimating daily ET from instantaneous ET were compared under different ecosystems and meteorological conditions based on worldwide eddy covariance flux network. In total, 139 flux sites based on eddy ccovariance systems at the global scale were used, and the 9:00-15:00 overpass times of the main growing season (May to September in the Northern Hemisphere and November to March in the Southern Hemisphere) were chosen as the study period. Five assessment metrics (coefficient of determination (R-2), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), index of agreement (d), and relative error (RE)) were selected to evaluate the accuracy and applicability of the six upscaling methods. The results showed that the modified evaporative fraction (MEF) method and the sine method (only at specific times) performed best for most ecosystems, but the optimal instantaneous time was quite different for different ecosystems. The MEF method worked best at 12:00 for forests and shrublands and attained the smallest MAE at 13:00 for grasslands and savannas. For wetlands and croplands, the MEF method performed best at 14:00. More attention should be paid to the selected instantaneous time when using the sine method because of its high sensitivity to time of day. The modified coefficient of the MEF method, which varied with instantaneous time and ecosystem, ranging from 1.04 (grassland) to 1.36 (wetland), was also examined. The comprehensive results of this study could be useful for mapping daily ET from instantaneous ET.

TI  - An updated review of epidemiology, risk factors, and management of male breast cancer
T2  - MEDICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Unlike female breast cancer, male breast cancer (MBC) is rare and not very well understood. Prospective data in the management of MBC are lacking and majority of treatment strategies are adopted from the established guidelines for breast cancer in women. The understanding of biology, clinical presentation, genetics, and management of MBC is evolving but there still remains a large knowledge gap due to the rarity of this disease. Older age, high estradiol levels, klinefelter syndrome, radiation exposure, gynecomastia, family history of breast cancer, BRCA2 and BRCA1 mutation are some of the known risk factors for MBC. Routine screening mammography is not recommended for asymptomatic men. Diagnostic mammogram with or without ultrasound should be considered if there is a suspicion for breast mass. Majority of men with early-stage breast cancer undergo mastectomy whereas breast conserving surgery (BCS) with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) remains an alternative option in selected cases. Since the majority of MBC are hormone receptor positive (HR+), adjuvant hormonal therapy is required. Tamoxifen for a total of 5 to 10 years is the mainstay adjuvant hormonal therapy. The role of neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy for early-stage breast cancer is uncertain and not commonly used. The role of gene recurrence scores like oncotype Dx and mammaprint is evolving and can be used as an aid for adjuvant chemotherapy. Majority of metastatic MBC are treated with hormonal therapy with either tamoxifen, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH) with aromatase inhibitors (AI), or fulvestrant. Chemotherapy is reserved for patients with visceral crisis or rapidly growing tumors.

TI  - Sampling protocols of specific leaf area for improving accuracy of the estimation of forest leaf area index
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Litterfall collection is a non-destructive direct method to estimate forest leaf area index (LAI) and validate indirect LAI products. However, the potential errors associated with the variation in specific leaf area (SLA) are rarely explored. Here, we measured the SLA of leaf litter for each tree species in a temperate deciduous forest using the litterfall collection method from 2012 to 2018, and assessed the spatial and temporal variation in SLA and its consequence on LAI estimates. The results showed that the spatial and temporal variation in SLA for the 10 major species across the seven years ranged from 0.8% to 24.3%, with the variation across the nine permanent plots (20 m x 30 m) being higher than that within plot (five 1-m(2) traps), and interannual higher than seasonal. Across the 63 plot-years, the 10 simplified SLA sampling protocols introduced the errors in LAI by -12.4% to 22.2% relative to the reference protocol (sampling leaves from each trap at each collection date for the major species). Applying the SLA obtained from one trap in each plot, one plot, at the leaf fall peak for each year, or for a single year induced the errors in LAI by -3.7% to 2.9%, -6.4% to 14.7%, -9.2% to 4.7%, and -8.1% to 8.6%, respectively. Considering the trade-off between inter-plot and interannual variation, we recommend sampling from one-trap for each plot at the leaf-fall peak for measuring SLA and quantifying the spatial pattern of LAI, and sampling each species in the typical plot for measuring SLA and monitoring the temporal fluctuation in LAI. The tight relationship between the MODIS and ground reference LAI across the seven years (R-2 = 0.77) validated the use of MODIS LAI to study the long-term change in forest LAI. These findings help to establish a standardized protocol for long-term accurately measuring forest LAI with the litterfall collection.

TI  - Estimation of land surface temperature using different retrieval methods for studying the spatiotemporal variations of surface urban heat and cold islands in Indian Punjab
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial patterns of land surface temperature (LST), surface urban heat island (SUHI), surface urban cold island (SUCI), and their seasonal variations during January (winter) and September (summer) were analyzed over the three cities of Indian Punjab (Balachaur, Ludhiana and Bathinda) using Landsat 5, 7 and 8 satellite data of the years 1991, 2001, 2011, and 2018. Urban hot spots and Urban Thermal Field Variance Index (UTFVI) were used to measure the ecological environment of these cities. Land surface temperature was retrieved from Landsat satellite data using Plank equation, mono-window algorithm (MWA), single-channel algorithm (SCA), and radiative transfer equation. The LST derived using these algorithms was validated with MODIS-LST product. The relationship between LST derived from Landsat 5, 7 and 8 using the four methods and MODIS-LST product was higher with the SCA algorithm (R-2 > 0.75). Land surface temperature was significantly positively correlated with built-up but significantly negatively correlated with vegetation. The surface urban heat intensity was higher during September than January, and it was higher in Ludhiana followed by Bathinda and Balachaur, irrespective of the season. Besides built-up area and population density, soil moisture availability in surrounding rural areas has significant impact on increasing surface urban heat intensity during September than January. The SUCIs were formed in the center of Bathinda city during January 1991, but these were in Ludhiana and Balachaur cities during January 2011. The most critical areas for ecological environment based on UTFVI were identified and the critical UTFVI values (> 0.020) were highest in Bathinda city followed by Balachaur and Ludhiana cities. These results suggest that SUHIs and SUCIs are influenced by seasons and the mitigating plans to counteract the overheating of urban areas should be formulated taking into account soil moisture availability in surrounding rural areas, landscape pattern, seasonal variations, local climatic conditions, urban growth, and development plan etc.

TI  - Identification of potential targets for kimberlite exploration using satellite imagery and map combination approach in the Lesotho Kimberlite Province
T2  - ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents the use of satellite data and map combination approach for kimberlite exploration to identify follow-up exploration targets. The study area falls in the Lesotho Kimberlite Province, which hosts diamondiferous kimberlite pipes such as Letseng and Kao in Lesotho, and Monastery and Jagersfontein in South Africa. This study focusses on processing and integration of evidential map layers (geomorphic features, linear structures and kimberlite indicator minerals) that have known correlation with kimberlite occurrence. The evidential map layers were acquired from satellite platforms such as ASTER and SRTM DEM. These layers were integrated to identify favourable sites for detailed follow-up exploration by subdividing the area into high, moderate and low prospective regions based on the number of controlling evidences operating in each sub-region. A follow-up sampling and ground magnetic survey were carried out at one of the high prospective zones to validate the results of the present approach. Kimberlite indicator minerals such as garnet, diopside, ilmenite and chromite were recovered from the collected sample. Several garnets show adhering materials known as kelyphite rims, which are typical surface features of peridotitic garnets having close relationship with diamondiferous kimberlite. Keating correlation coefficient, which uses a simple pattern recognition to locate magnetic anomalies that resemble the response of modelled kimberlite pipes, was applied to ground magnetic data. We used a series of reference kimberlite models composed of homogeneous vertical cylinders of various radius ranging from 50 to 200 m and depth varying from 50 to 500 m. The correlation coefficients between analytical signal grid of modelled kimberlite pipe and observed magnetic data were computed. Following this approach, kimberlite model with correlation coefficients exceeding 80% was selected. By matching the response of modelled kimberlite pipe with the magnetic anomalies, four pipe-like targets were located. The target(s) may be a potential source of the recovered kimberlite indicator minerals since the morphology of these minerals suggest a proximal kimberlitic source.

TI  - Sustainability Challenges for Sprawling Dhaka
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND URBANIZATION ASIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Dhaka's sprawled area is likely to supersede the total land area of the Dhaka city in the near future.This article combines quantitative and qualitative methods to investigate sustainability concerns that have arisen because of irregular and rapid sprawling in Dhaka. Land cover change detection reveals that since 1991, the city outskirts have seen an addition of 234 square kilometres of built-up area. Spatial metrics show the dynamic process of infill and the fragmented transformation of land covers in Dhaka, which have led to low-density, leapfrog and ribbon sprawling. The city outskirts, especially the economically advantaged regions, have been observing rapid urban densification of neighbourhoods. Field observation and interviews in 19 sprawled areas confirm that the change has been influenced by industrialization, increasing demand for housing, high cost of living in Dhaka city, growing population and lack of development control regulations. The advantage of the sprawling process is that it offers economic opportunities, contributing to poverty reduction and national economic growth. However, the abrupt and sporadic nature of this transformation puts the long term economic and environmental viability of new business activities and habitation into question. Congested housing, poor accessibility, inadequate drainage system and sanitation facilities in sprawled areas have resulted in poor liveability and created social inequality, thus impeding the way for a sustainable urban transformation of peri-urban Dhaka.This article calls for a greater acknowledgement of sustainability concerns in development control regulations and a more inclusive form of governance to deal with existing sustainability challenges for Dhaka city and its rapidly transforming peripheral region.

TI  - Assessment of automated evapotranspiration estimates obtained using the GP-SEBAL algorithm for dry forest vegetation (Caatinga) and agricultural areas in the Brazilian semiarid region
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Real evapotranspiration (ETr) plays a key role in water balance, especially for dry forest vegetation (Caatinga) and irrigated agricultural areas, as is the case in the Petrolina region located in the Brazilian semiarid region (BSAR). Population growth increases the need for food and the use of water resources, which are scarcer in semiarid regions. Thus, knowledge of the energy balance (EB) and radiative balance are indispensable for the management of water resources, especially in irrigated agricultural areas. Currently, one of the biggest challenges in the application of algorithms for estimating ETr based on satellite images is the calibration of the EB. The goal of this study was to evaluate the applicability of Geographic Resources Analysis Support System (GRASS) Python surface EB algorithm for land (GP-SEBAL) to calculate ETr for Caatinga vegetation and agricultural areas in the BSAR. GP-SEBAL was applied to two images from Landsat 8 obtained in 2013 and compared with manual SEBAL and observed data. In this study, kappa coefficient accuracy was used to compare the ground truth data and predicted land use and land cover. The performance of algorithms in determining the EB components, land-surface temperature (LST), net radiation (R-n), soil heat flux (G), latent heat flux (L-E), sensible heat flux (H), and ETr were compared with statistical indices and uncertainty percentages (PUs) were calculated. In addition, a sensitivity analysis using a deviation of 30 W/m(2) with an interval of 5 W/m(2) was used to analyze the sensitivity of ETr. The results showed a strong correlation between GP-SEBAL and manual SEBAL for ETr, LST, R-n, L-H, and H. The values suggest the regularity of estimating the EB in an automated manner. The results indicate a small PU difference in the estimated ETr values calculated using GP-SEBAL and SEBAL for two images of 10.87% and 20.11% for Caatinga vegetation and 15.01% and 35.16% for agriculture, respectively. We conclude that GP-SEBAL is an efficient automated algorithm for estimating ETr that uses a less complex process with a lower incidence of errors and considerably faster execution time than classical applications of SEBAL.

AB  - The satellite's inferred information has been important to distantly get to the temperature of Earth's surface materials. In this exploration, three MODIS satellite statistical downscaling models named (Resolution balanced downscaling (RM), Kriging Regression (KR), and Regression Tree (RT) have been created in mixed and homogeneous materials of Jaipur area, India to downscale MODIS MST information at 100 m spatial scale. The KR demonstrated the least error below and found superior working in mixed regions compared to RM and RT model. The regression-based material surface temperature (MST) downscaling methods has been reliant on the Earth's surface material, especially in the urban scene. The KR strategy would encourage the expectation of MST for various Earth surface materials for land surface-related researches. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Evolution of surface deformation related to salt-extraction-caused sinkholes in Solotvyno (Ukraine) revealed by Sentinel-1 radar interferometry
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Rock salt has remarkable mechanical properties and high economic importance; however, the strength of salt compared to other rocks makes it a rather vulnerable material. Human activities could lead to acceleration of the dissolution of soluble rock salt and collapse of subsurface caverns. Although sinkhole development can be considered a local geological disaster regarding the characteristic size of surface depressions, the deformations can result in catastrophic events. In this study we report the spatiotemporal evolution of surface deformation in the Solotvyno salt mine area in Ukraine based on Sentinel-1 interferometric synthetic aperture radar measurements. Although the mining operations were finished in 2010, several sinkholes have been opened up since then. Our results show that despite the enormous risk management efforts, the sinkholes continue to expand with a maximum line-of-sight deformation rate of 5 cm/yr. The deformation time series show a rather linear feature, and unfortunately no slowdown of the processes can be recognized based on the investigated 4.5-year-long data set. We utilized both ascending and descending satellite passes to discriminate the horizontal and vertical deformations, and our results revealed that vertical deformation is much more pronounced in the area. Analytical source modeling confirmed that the complex deformation pattern observed by Sentinel-1 radar interferometry has a direct connection to the former mining activity and is confined to the mining territory. With the 6 d repetition time of Sentinel-1 observations, the evolution of surface changes can be detected in quasi real time, which can facilitate disaster response and recovery.

TI  - Extrapolation of ACOSOG Z0011 trial results-A survey of breast cancer providers
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - We surveyed breast providers from a national oncology cooperative group to evaluate axillary management recommendations for patients with 1-2 positive sentinel lymph nodes (+SLNs) with scenarios not explicitly included in the Z0011 trial. These scenarios included patients underrepresented (premenopausal, HER2+/triple-negative tumors, and invasive lobular carcinoma) or excluded (treated with mastectomy or neo-adjuvant chemotherapy [NAC]) from the ACOSOG Z0011 trial. Survey response rate was 94/149 (64%). For patients in underrepresented groups, 45-63% of providers recommended no further axillary treatment. For mastectomy patients, 45-55% recommended multi-disciplinary discussion. 83% felt more data are needed to change practice, but 41% believed there would be significant accrual challenges to a clinical trial. For patients treated with NAC, recommendations varied widely. 85% felt more data are needed to change practice, but 26% felt there would be significant accrual challenges. For all scenarios, 86-100% of radiation oncologists recommended axillary radiation, while surgeons more often recommended no further axillary treatment. Traditional randomized trials are likely not feasible to provide answers to these critical management questions, so more pragmatic or big data studies may be needed.

TI  - Long-term multi-source data analysis about the characteristics of aerosol optical properties and types over Australia
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatiotemporal distributions of aerosol optical properties and major aerosol types, along with the vertical distribution of major aerosol types over Australia, are investigated based on multi-year Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) observations at nine sites, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2), Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP), and back-trajectory analysis from the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT). During the observation period from 2001-2020, the annual aerosol optical depth (AOD) at most sites showed increasing trends (0.002-0.029 yr(-1)), except for that at three sites, Canberra, Jabiru, and Lake Argyle, which showed decreasing trends (0.004 to 0.014 yr(-1)). In contrast, the annual Angstrom exponent (AE) showed decreasing tendencies at most sites (0.045 to 0.005 yr(-1)). The results showed strong seasonal variations in AOD, with high values in the austral spring and summer and relatively low values in the austral fall and winter, and weak seasonal variations in AE, with the highest mean values in the austral spring at most sites. Monthly average AOD increases from August to December or the following January and decreases during March-July. Spatially, the MODIS AOD showed obvious spatial heterogeneity, with high values appearing over the Australian tropical savanna regions, Lake Eyre Basin, and southeastern regions of Australia, while low values appeared over the arid regions in western Australia. MERRA-2 showed that carbonaceous aerosol over northern Australia, dust over central Australia, sulfate over densely populated northwestern and southeastern Australia, and sea salt over Australian coastal regions are the major types of atmospheric aerosols. The nine ground-based AERONET sites over Australia showed that the mixed type of aerosols (biomass burning and dust) is dominant in all seasons. Moreover, Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) showed that polluted dust is the dominant aerosol type detected at heights 0.5-5 km over the Australian continent during all seasons. The results suggested that Australian aerosol has similar source characteristics due to the regional transport over Australia, especially for biomass burning and dust aerosols. However, the dust-prone characteristic of aerosol is more prominent over central Australia, while the biomass-burning-prone characteristic of aerosol is more prominent in northern Australia.

TI  - Management of Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma of the Breast: A Single-Institution Study
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveThe purpose of our study was to analyze the clinicopathologic features and surgical and oncological outcomes of adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) of the breast and to provide the basis for a clinical therapeutic schedule.MethodsA total of 14 patients with primary breast adenoid cystic carcinoma treated at Cancer Hospital of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences from January 2000 to December 2017 were included. Data on clinical presentation, treatment strategy, and outcome, as well as the pathological features of ACC, were reviewed and analyzed.ResultsFourteen patients were diagnosed with ACC of the breast, out of 23205 total patients treated for breast cancer (0.06%). All but three patients were postmenopausal, with a median age at diagnosis of 60.5 years (range, 39-73 years). The most common clinical presentation was a palpable mass (85.7%), and the imaging characteristics of all patients on color Doppler ultrasound and mammography were nonspecific. Six patients (42.9%) were suspected of having ACC by fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) and were confirmed by postoperative histology and immunohistochemistry. All 14 patients underwent surgery, and no patient had a positive lymph node status. Median tumor size was 1.75 cm (range, 1-3 cm). Eight/14 (57.1%) patients were hormone receptor negative (HR-) and HER-2/neu (-) (HER2-). The remaining patients were hormone receptor positive (HR+). There was no significant difference in clinicopathological characteristics between the HR+ group and the HR- group (P>0.05). The mean follow-up period was 57 months. Local recurrence occurred in 14.3% of patients, 1.7% of patients had distant metastasis, all patients with local recurrence or distant metastasis were in the HR (-) group, and all patients were alive at the last follow-up.ConclusionACC of the breast cannot be simply summarized as triple-negative breast cancer because it also includes a small number of hormone receptor-positive breast cancers. Establishing a preoperative diagnosis is difficult on the basis of clinical imaging examination, FNAC may be useful tool in the diagnosis. the final diagnosis can only be assessed based on the results of the histopathological and immunohistochemical examination. Breast-conserving surgery may be an alternative treatment strategy, and axillary lymph node dissection or sentinel node biopsy may not be necessary in some cases.

TI  - Fatalism Knowledge and Inquiry in African American Family Stories of Death Premonition
T2  - AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - In stories of unexpected death, rural African Americans investigate signs of premonition and personal destiny in the predeath behavior, biographical attributes, and conversations of deceased relatives. Premonition is clouded in misdirection; stories explore the conundrum that the future is known and actively communicated by those who will die, but the information only becomes accessible to the living after the person's death. Latent predictive powers exist in the universe, but they must be discovered and ratified. Drawing on epistemologies of surprise and the exotic, I argue that premonition is an individual and communal knowledge inquiry process through which the living test fate's edges, respond to its possibilities, and seek to predict its influence. I challenge scholarly interpretations of fatalism as a passive, ultimately defeatist worldview.

TI  - Cerebral metastasis of Merkel cell carcinoma following resection with negative margins and adjuvant external beam radiation: a case report
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare and aggressive neuroendocrine tumor of the skin. It is associated with advanced age, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and Merkel cell polyomavirus. It has a predilection for the lymphatic system, but rarely spreads to the central nervous system. Case presentation A 71-year-old Caucasian man with a history of rheumatoid arthritis and MCC of the right lower eyelid and cheek presented with left-sided hemineglect and word-finding difficulty. Twenty months earlier he had undergone local excision of a 3 cm lesion with negative margins, negative sentinel lymph node biopsy, and external beam radiation. On presentation he was found to have a 6.3 cm mass in the right frontotemporal region. He underwent prompt resection, with pathological analysis consistent with metastatic MCC. He subsequently underwent stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and adjunctive immunotherapy with pembrolizumab. He has since tolerated the therapy well and is currently without neurological symptoms or evidence of recurrence. Conclusions Cerebral metastasis of MCC is a rare event and should be considered when a patient with a history of MCC presents with neurological symptoms. Optimal treatment regimens of these rare cases are unclear; however, prompt resection, stereotactic radiosurgery, and adjunctive immunotherapy have shown an initial positive response in this patient.

TI  - The Impact of Obesity on Surgically Treated Locoregional Melanoma
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The impact of obesity on early-stage melanoma is poorly understood. We examined the impact of overweight and obesity on clinical outcomes in locoregional melanoma. Methods Adults who underwent surgery at Emory University Healthcare between 2010 and 2017 for clinically stage I-II cutaneous melanoma, with known stage, height, and weight at the time of presentation, were identified. The relationship between body mass index (BMI) and clinicopathologic characteristics was assessed. Results Of 1756 patients, 584 were obese (33.2%; BMI >= 30), 658 were overweight (37.5%; BMI >= 25 and < 30), and 514 were normal weight (29.3%; BMI < 25). Demographics associated with obesity included male sex (odds ratio [OR] 2.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.1-3.3; p < 0.001) and lower income (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.2-1.9; p = 0.003). Melanomas in obese patients were thicker (2.0 +/- 0.2 mm) than in overweight (1.7 +/- 0.1 mm) or normal-weight patients (1.4 +/- 0.1 mm; p = 0.002). Ulceration, mitoses, BRAF status, and sentinel lymph node (SLN) status were not affected by obesity. In multivariable analysis, obesity independently predicted increased odds of pathologic stage II melanoma (vs. stage 0 or I; OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.4-2.7, p = 0.001), but not pathologic stage III melanoma (p > 0.05). At 33 months' median follow-up, obesity was not an independent predictor of stage-specific overall survival (p > 0.05). Conclusion Obese patients are nearly twice as likely as their normal-weight peers to present with thicker melanomas, but they have similar stage-specific overall survival and SLN positivity. Obesity may promote more aggressive growth of the primary tumor, and barriers to preventive care in obese patients may exacerbate later-stage presentation.

TI  - Evidence for disseminated tumor cells in lymphatic vessels afferent to sentinel lymph nodes in patients diagnosed with cervical cancer
T2  - CANCER REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background In patients diagnosed with cervical cancer, the purpose of lymphadenectomy is the removal of lymph nodes for diagnosis and potential treatment of metastasized tumor cells. It is unclear if afferent lymphatic vessels harbor tumor cells and, thus, may pose additional risk for recurrence or progression if not removed.Aim In this feasibility study, we analyzed the lymphatic vessels afferent to sentinel lymph node (SLN) using a highly sensitive and specific molecular marker for cervical cancer cells.Methods and Results Twenty patients diagnosed with cervical cancer of FIGO stage IA1 to IIB2 underwent laparoscopic SLN removal. Labeling was done using patent blue and the afferent lymphatic vessels were harvested from the parametric tissue and frozen at -80 degrees C. HPV DNA type was evaluated in the primary tumor. Lymphatic vessels afferent to the sentinel lymph nodes were analyzed for the presence of viral oncogene transcripts of the respective HPV type. In one of 18 patients, all with tumor stage <= IBI and pN0 by conventional histopathology, HPV mRNA could be detected in two of four lymphatic vessels, whereas at least one of the lymphatic vessel biopsies of both patients with tumors >4 cm and pN1 status was HPV mRNA positive. No clinical correlation with recurrence after a median follow-up of 9 years was noticed.Conclusion HPV mRNA indicative of disseminated tumor cells could be detected in lymphatic vessels. The relevance of harvesting lymphatic vessels afferent to SLN in order to increase oncologic safety will have to be investigated in a future prospective study.

TI  - Route study on patterns of poverty alleviation through vocational education under the background of rural vitalization(sic)(sic)(sic)Palabras clave
T2  - POVERTY & PUBLIC POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Chinese Government has proposed the strategy of "targeted poverty alleviation" in its poverty reduction project among the poverty-stricken population while carrying out a forward-looking preparation for "rural vitalization." As is known, the "targeted poverty alleviation" serves the prerequisite of realizing the "rural revitalization strategy." Poverty alleviation through education plays the role of interdicting intergenerational poverty. Vocational education ranks for the highest input-output ratio, accounting for the best way for profit accumulation in poverty alleviation. Based upon the investigation of 1280 poor households in poverty-stricken regions of Longsheng County and Ziyuan County in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, this paper introduces the long-term effect of poverty alleviation through vocational education by comparing the gap of the educational level and income between the poverty-stricken population and the population out of poverty with an analysis on the income structure of the poor. We recommend measures and suggestions for constructing a system of poverty reduction that is oriented towards rural vocational education, based on poor households' demand for vocational education and training.

TI  - Flood hazard mapping of Sangu River basin in Bangladesh using multi-criteria analysis of hydro-geomorphological factors
T2  - JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood havoc during 2019 in the Sangu River basin caused widespread damage to residents, crops, roads, and communications in parts of hills in Bangladesh. Developing flood hazard maps can play an essential step in risks management. For this purpose, this study assessed 12 hydro-geomorphological factors, namely, topographic wetness index, elevation, slope, extreme rainfall, land-use and land-cover, soil type, lithology, curvature, drainage density, aspect, height above the nearest drainage, and distance from streams. Maps prepared by individual application of the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Analytical Network Process (ANP) exhibit validation scores ranging from 0.77 to 0.79. It is found that the ANP-based model under 1-day maximum rainfall denotes a reliable hazard map presenting comparable accuracy to the field results. The hazard map under 100-year return periods shows that a total of 0.71 million population living downstream is prone to "very high" flood because of its lowland morphology, mild slope, and high drainage density. Alarmingly, 39% of roads, 43% of farming lands, and 25% of education buildings are observed to lie in the highest flood-prone area. Details on subdistrict level exposures have the potential to serve the decision-makers and planners in site selection for flood management strategies and setting priorities for remedial measures.

TI  - Machine learning approaches for the prediction of soil aggregate stability
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, many Pedotransfer Functions (PTFs) are being developed to predict certain soil properties worldwide, especially for difficult and time-consuming parameters to measure. However, very few studies have been done to assess the feasibility of using PTFs (regression or machine learning methods) for predicting soil aggregate stability. Also, the Random Forest (RF) method has never been used before to predict this parameter, and no study was found concerning the use of PTFs methods to estimate soil parameters in Morocco. Therefore, the current study was conducted in the three watersheds of Settat- Ben Ahmed Plateau, located in the center of Morocco and covering approximately 1000 km(2). The purpose of this study is to compare the capabilities of the machine learning technique (Random Forest) and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) to predict the Mean Weight Diameter (MWD) as an index of soil aggregate stability using soil properties from two sources data sets and remote sensing data. The performance of the models was evaluated using a 10-fold cross-validation procedure. The results achieved were acceptable in predicting soil aggregate stability and similar for both models. Thus, the addition of remote sensing indices to soil properties does not improve models. Results also show that organic matter is the most relevant variable for predicting soil aggregate stability for both models. The developed models can be used to predict the soil aggregate stability in this region and avoid waste of time and money deployed for analyses. However, we recommend using the largest and most uniform possible data set to achieve more accurate results.

TI  - Validation of baseline and modified Sentinel-2 Level 2 Prototype Processor leaf area index retrievals over the United States
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-2 Level 2 Prototype Processor (SL2P) is made available to users for the retrieval of vegetation biophysical variables including leaf area index (LAI) from Multispectral Instrument (MSI) data within the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP). A limited number of validation exercises have indicated SL2P LAI retrievals frequently meet user requirements over agricultural environments, but perform comparatively poorly over heterogeneous canopies such as forests. Recently, a modified version of SL2P was developed, using the directional area scattering factor (DASF) to constrain retrievals as an alternative to regularisation (SL2P-D). Whilst SL2P makes use of prior information on expected canopy conditions, SL2P-D is trained using uniform distributions of input parameters to define radiative transfer model (RTM) simulations. Using in situ measurements available through the Copernicus Ground Based Observations for Validation (GBOV) service, we performed an extensive validation of SL2P and SL2P-D LAI retrievals over 19 sites throughout the United States. For effective LAI (LAI(e)), SL2P demonstrated good overall performance (RMSD = 0.50, NRMSD = 31%, bias = -0.10), with all LAI retrievals meeting the Sentinels for Science (SEN4SCI) uncertainty requirements over homogeneous canopies (cultivated crops, grasslands, pasture/hay and shrub/scrub), whilst underestimation occurred over heterogeneous canopies (deciduous forest, evergreen forest, mixed forest, and woody wetlands). SL2P-D retrievals demonstrated reduced bias, slightly improving overall performance when compared with SL2P (RMSD = 0.48, NRMSD = 30%, bias = -0.05), indicating its retrieval approach appears to offer some advantages over regularisation using prior information, especially at LAI(e) > 3. Additionally, SL2P-D resulted in 32% more valid retrievals than SL2P, with the largest differences observed at LAI(e) < 1. Validation against in situ measurements of LAI as opposed to LAIe yielded similar patterns but poorer performance (RMSD = 1.08 to 1.13, NRMSD = 49% to 52%, bias = -0.64 to -0.68) because the RTM used by SL2P and SL2P-D does not account for foliage clumping. In addition to the retrievals themselves, we examined the relationship between predicted uncertainties and observed differences in retrieved and in situ LAI. With respect to LAI(e), SL2P's predicted uncertainties were conservative, underestimating observed differences in only 35% of cases, whilst those for LAI were unbiased.

TI  - Capturing copepod dynamics in the Northern California Current using sentinel stations
T2  - PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Review
AB  - Ecosystem indicators track information about states and trends in ocean systems and are a valuable tool for ecosystem assessment and management. To ensure that indicators are used appropriately in both science and management contexts, it is important to understand the extent to which they represent broader spatial patterns. In the Northern California Current (NCC) off the Oregon and Washington state coasts in the USA, copepod metrics derived from data collected at a well-sampled station on the Newport Hydrographic (NH) Line ('NH05', five nmi offshore from Newport, OR, USA) are commonly used as indicators of the region's general ocean conditions. Using correlation analyses, we examined the utility of NH05 as a sentinel station (i.e. representative of a broader region) with respect to the abundance and biomass of warm-water and cold-water copepods in the NCC. Copepod correlations between NH05 and other locations in the NCC were higher for the warm-water copepods than the cold-water group, with correlations being slightly higher for abundance than biomass. Paracalanus parvus had the highest NH05 correlations among the warm-water copepod species, and Acartia longiremis had the highest NH05 correlations among the cold-water copepod species. We also broadened our analysis to evaluate other sampling sites as sentinel stations and found that some sites were equally or more representative of copepod dynamics in the NCC than NH05, though none of these sites tend to be sampled as often as NH05. This analysis emphasized that the warm-water copepods tend to be more similarly distributed in the NCC than the cold-water copepods, and thus their changes through time are better captured by most stations. In contrast, correlations among the cold-water copepods in the NCC vary by location and appear to be strongly related to depth, with the highest correlations at mid-shelf stations.

TI  - Detection of bark beetle infestation in drone imagery via thresholding cellular automata
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Bark beetle outbreaks are a significant cause of loss of vegetation cover, for which accurate monitoring of forest areas is required to detect and control bark beetle outbreaks as early as possible. A tool that processes aerial imagery from an unmanned aerial vehicle to automatically detect levels of damage caused by bark beetle outbreaks is proposed and evaluated. The true-color RGB flight imagery is combined into orthomosaics, enhanced, and then analyzed in reference to manually annotated samples to identify thresholding rules for training classifiers based on a cellular automaton that assigns to each nonbackground pixel in the image a class label corresponding to the estimated stage of infestation at the location-healthy (green), early-stage (yellow), late-stage (red), and dead (leafless). Also samples corresponding to the ground (nontrees) are annotated and processed. The resulting classifications are on average over 89% accurate over five flights and often near flawless; the view from above does not fully substitute a ground-based assessment for intermediate stages of the infestation.

TI  - Quantifying the effect of surface heterogeneity on soil moisture across regions and surface characteristic
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Modeling soil moisture (SM) spatial distribution is important for hydrological forecasting, runoff estimation and catchment management and other applications. The objective of this study was to quantify the effect of surface heterogeneity including vegetation, soil, topography etc. on SM at the regional and surface characteristics classes (SCC) scales. Landsat 8 images, ASTER digital elevation model, land cover map, climatic data, and SM measured at 148 locations in the Balikhli-Chay catchment of Iran were used. Greenness, brightness, wetness, and land surface temperature are the surface biophysical characteristics and the topographical characteristics including elevation, slope, aspect, Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) and solar local incident angle calculated using Tasseled Cap Transformation, Single Channel algorithm used in this study. The Triangular method and the boot-strapping model were used to model SM and mitigate prediction uncertainty. Correlation coefficient (r) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between the modeled and measured SM values were used to evaluate the modeled SM. The mean r and RMSE between the modeled and measured SM for different months were 0.83 and 1.84 (volumetric percentage), respectively. The degree of heterogeneity of the spatial distribution of SM in different classes of surface biophysical and topographical characteristics was different. The impact of surface heterogeneity on SM varied across regional and SCC scales. The mean r values between SM and surface biophysical and topographical characteristics in the regional and SCC strategies for different months were 0.41 and 0.54, respectively. Using the SCC scale instead of the regional scale heterogeneity information can increase the accuracy of SM modeling.

TI  - Investigating on OLI and TIRS data fusion methods in detection and identification of ancient hills (case study: Farahan area)
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, remote sensing and satellite images are used instead of field operations required to identify cultural heritage and antiquities due to the capability of analysis of altitude, temperature, vegetation, moisture content, and soil type. On the other hand, remote sensing requires less cost and time compared to field operations and can provide more accurate results with more certainty. In this study, optical and thermal images of Landsat 8 were used in the winter and summer seasons in Farahan historical area in Iran. The data were fused with different methods of data fusion at the pixel level, and their results were compared with four validation methods. Among the used fusion methods, the Ehlers showed the best performance. All images were then fused with this method, and their results were entered into the next steps of the processes. In order to extract ancient structures and hills, their spectral and geometric properties were studied. Therefore, in order to investigate spectral properties of ancient hills, the effects of old structures on moisture content, clay content, lime content, greenness, and land surface temperature (LST) were studied. This led to the production of five information layers. These five layers were classified with unsupervised classification algorithms in different classes. Then, for distinguishing between ancient hills and other ancient structures, their salient geometric features "altitude anomaly" were studied. To do this, a map of the promising areas of the existence of ancient structures was integrated with the altitude anomalies map which is obtained from applying a range filter on a DEM with a resolution of 10 m. Finally, the ancient hills were extracted into three different categories, using the template matching algorithm, taking into account the correlation coefficient. The best value of the correlation coefficient that was used to detect the ancient hills in the first 10 identified cases of the first group was between 75 and 80%. This value was 40% for the second group of the ancient hills, which caused 80% correct identification of the hills. Also, for third group of the ancient hills, it was between 30 and 35% which caused 70% correct identification of the ancient hills.

TI  - Electronic phenotyping of health outcomes of interest using a linked claims-electronic health record database: Findings from a machine learning pilot project
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Claims-based algorithms are used in the Food and Drug Administration Sentinel Active Risk Identification and Analysis System to identify occurrences of health outcomes of interest (HOIs) for medical product safety assessment. This project aimed to apply machine learning classification techniques to demonstrate the feasibility of developing a claims-based algorithm to predict an HOI in structured electronic health record (EHR) data.Materials and Methods: We used the 2015-2019 IBM MarketScan Explorys Claims-EMR Data Set, linking administrative claims and EHR data at the patient level. We focused on a single HOI, rhabdomyolysis, defined by EHR laboratory test results. Using claims-based predictors, we applied machine learning techniques to predict the HOI: logistic regression, LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator), random forests, support vector machines, artificial neural nets, and an ensemble method (Super Learner).Results: The study cohort included 32 956 patients and 39 499 encounters. Model performance (positive predictive value [PPV], sensitivity, specificity, area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve) varied considerably across techniques. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve exceeded 0.80 in most model variations.Discussion: For the main Food and Drug Administration use case of assessing risk of rhabdomyolysis after drug use, a model with a high PPV is typically preferred. The Super Learner ensemble model without adjustment for class imbalance achieved a PPV of 75.6%, substantially better than a previously used human expert-developed model (PPV = 44.0%).Conclusions: It is feasible to use machine learning methods to predict an EHR-derived HOI with claims-based predictors. Modeling strategies can be adapted for intended uses, including surveillance, identification of cases for chart review, and outcomes research.

TI  - How do urban spatial patterns influence the river cooling effect? A case study of the Huangpu Riverfront in Shanghai, China
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban rivers play an important role in mitigating the surrounding temperatures, but the contributions of the influencing factors are still unclear. Using remote sensing data captured on summer, this study evaluates the river cooling effect (RCE) of the Huangpu River in the central area of Shanghai, China, and examines the influence of urban spatial patterns on it. We found: (1) the average river cooling intensity (RCI) ranged from 1.72 ?C to 9.10 ?C, with the mean value being 4.47 ?C, and the average river cooling distance (RCD) ranged from 72.57 m to 465.42 m with the mean value being 197.35 m; (2) areas with intensive, irregular-shaped, connected and aggregated buildings tend to receive higher RCE, while areas with greenspace of the same characteristics are likely to weaken this effect; (3) areas with low-rise buildings embrace higher RCI, while high-density roads oriented perpendicular to the river bank contribute to a higher RCD; (4) when controlling other variables, the downwind area could obtain a higher RCI of 1.5 ?C and a larger RCD of 1.2 m than the upwind area. These findings provide insights for the practice of climate adaptive planning and design on the urban riverfronts of Shanghai and places with similar environments.

TI  - Quantification of chlorophyll-a in typical lakes across China using Sentinel-2 MSI imagery with machine learning algorithm
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake eutrophication has attracted the attention of the government and general public. Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) is a key indicator of algal biomass and eutrophication. Many efforts have been devoted to establishing accurate algorithms for estimating Chl-a concentrations. In this study, a total of 273 samples were collected from 45 typical lakes across China during 2017-2019. Here, we proposed applicable machine learning algorithms (i.e., linear regression model (LR), support vector machine model (SVM) and Catboost model (CB)), which integrate a broad scale dataset of lake biogeochemical characteristics using Multispectral Imager (MSI) product to seamlessly retrieve the Chl-a concentration. A K-means clustering approach was used to cluster the 273 normalized water leaving reflectance spectra [Rrs (lambda)] extracted from MSI imagery with Case 2 Regional Coast Colour (CR2CC) processor into three groups. The pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total suspended matter (TSM) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from three clustering groups had significant differences (p < 0.05**), indicating that water quality parameters have an integrated impact on Rrs(lambda)-spectra. The results of machine learning algorithms integrating demonstrated that SVM obtained a better degree of measured- and derived- fitting (calibration: slope = 0.81, R2 = 0.91; validation: slope = 1.21, R2 = 0.88). On the contrary, the documented nine Chl-a algorithms gave poor results (fitting 1:1 linear slope < 0.4 and R2 < 0.70) with synchronous train and test datasets. It demonstrated that machine learning provides a robust model for quantifying Chl-a concentration. Further, considering three Rrs(lambda) clustering groups by k-means, Chl-a SVM model indicated that cluster 1 group gave a better retrieving performance (slope = 0.71, R2 = 0.78), followed by cluster 3 group (slope = 0.77, R2 = 0.64) and cluster 2 group (slope = 0.67, R2 = 0.50). These are related to the low TSM and high DOC levels for cluster-1 and cluster-3 Rrs(lambda) spectra, which reduce the influence of particle in red bands for Rrs(lambda) signal. Our results highlighted the quantification of lake Chl-a concentrations using MSI imagery and SVM, which can realize the large-scale monitoring and more appropriate for medium/low Chl-a level. The remote estimation of Chl-a based on artificial intelligence can provide an effective and robust way to monitor the lake eutrophication on a macro-scale; and offer a better approach to elucidate the response of lake ecosystems to global change.(c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Mapping urban building fossil fuel CO<sub>2</sub> emissions with a high spatial and temporal resolution
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Buildings contribute about 40% of greenhouse gas emissions in the USA. The estimation of urban building fossil fuel CO2 emissions with the fine spatial and temporal resolution is critical for climate change studies and developing optimal plans for reaching emission reduction goals. This study proposed a new method to map fossil fuel CO2 emissions at the building level and hourly scale. Specifically, a building energy use model was developed and used for modeling building energy consumption at the hourly scale through integrating building prototypes from the accessor's data, the number of floors from remote sensing data, floor area from footprint data, and energy use intensity from the Energy Plus model. Furthermore, the greenhouse gas equivalencies calculator was applied to convert calculated building energy consumption to greenhouse gas emissions at the building level and hourly scale. Research results indicate that the spatial distribution pattern of fossil fuel CO2 emissions is largely decided by building type, building height, and building density. In particular, the largest fossil fuel CO2 emissions are located in the center of Manhattan which is composed of large offices and hotels. In terms of temporal pattern, stable and similar monthly greenhouse gas emissions could be detected throughout four seasons, and two small emission peaks could be found in around July and December which are caused by high cooling electricity use and high gas heating consumption. The hourly emissions patterns also indicate the active relationship between fossil fuel CO2 emissions and daily human activities.

TI  - Comparison of multi-source satellite images for classifying marsh vegetation using DeepLabV3 Plus deep learning algorithm
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate classification of wetland vegetation is essential for rapid assessment and management. The Honghe National Nature Reserve (HNNR), located in Northeast China, was studied. The multi-scale remote sensing data of a new generation of Chinese high-spatial-resolution earth observation satellites Gaofen-1 (GF-1), Gaofen-2 (GF-2), Ziyuan-3 (ZY-3), and international earth observation satellites Sentinel-2A and Landsat 8 OLI were selected as sources. Based on the DeepLabV3 Plus deep learning model, 12 intelligent marsh vegetation classification models were constructed. We quantitatively analyzed the applicability and identification ability of DeepLabV3 Plus for classifying complex marsh vegetation. We discuss the differences in accuracy of marsh vegetation classification with different remote sensing data sets. The spatial resolution of remote sensing data sets ranges from 30 m to 0.8 m, and spectral bands range from blue bands (450 nm) to shortwave infrared bands (2280 nm). The specific conclusions of this study are as follows: (1) The DeepLabV3 Plus model better identified marsh vegetation, but there were significant differences in the classification accuracy of 12 DeepLabV3 Plus intelligent identification models. (2) Under the same conditions of the spectral bands (four Blue similar to NIR bands), the accuracy of deep-water marsh vegetation classification gradually increased as spatial resolution improved. For shallow-water marsh vegetation, when the accuracy of vegetation classification increased to a certain level, the classification accuracy decreased with the improvement of spatial resolution, which indicated that high-resolution images reduced pixel mixing to a certain extent, but for some vegetation types, the internal spectral difference increased, which made classification more difficult. (3) The increase of spectral bands improved the classification of marsh vegetation, while the classification accuracy of models with spectral indices was better than that of models only including spectral bands. (4) The accuracy of marsh vegetation classification was greatly improved by combining spectral bands and spectral indices. (5) The classification of the five sensor satellite images had statistical differences between models with different spatial resolutions and models with different spectral ranges.

TI  - Multi-parameter optimization for load balancing with effective task scheduling and resource sharing
T2  - JOURNAL OF AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE AND HUMANIZED COMPUTING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Cloud Computing is turning into an undeniably appreciated worldview that conveys superior figuring assets over the Internet to take care of the complex logical issues, yet at the same time, it has different moves that should be routed to execute logical work processes. The current research primarily centered around limiting completing time (makespan) or minimization of expense while meeting the nature of organization prerequisites. Be that as it may, a large portion of them do not think about fundamental normal for cloud and serious issues, for example, virtual machines (VMs) execution variety and procurement delay. Task scheduling for load balancing is one of the basic systems in the distributed computing condition. It is required for dispensing undertakings to be the best possible assets and streamlining the general framework execution. In recent research, the most popular scheduling algorithms named particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is utilized to maximize resource utilization. In any case, the PSO scheduling algorithm performance gets degraded when the task number is critical. In this paper, we propose a meta-heuristic practical, multi-objective scheduling based particle swarm optimization (MOSPSO) that limits the execution cost of the work process while complying with the time constraint in cloud computing condition. Multi-objective scheduling based on particle swarm optimization (MOSPSO) is proposed under this research to give optimal allocation for a large number of tasks. This is accomplished by part of the submitted tasks into groups in a dynamic manner. The assets use state is considered in every creation for groups. In the wake of getting an imperfect answer for each group, the proposed method annexes all the problematic answers for clumps into the last assignment map. At last, MOSPSO attempts to adjust the loads over the last assignment map. The proposed calculation is contrasted and distinctive booking calculations in particular particle swarm optimization (PSO) and improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO). The results of analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm as in terms of makespan, degree of load balance, and total execution time.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of cloud-cleared radiances, without utilizing any supplementary sensors for INSAT-3D Sounder InfraRed window observations is presented here. This method utilizes simulated clear sky radiances by radiative transfer for TOVS (RTTOV) tool, with the help of global numerical weather prediction (NWP) models analysis and forecast fields, unlike the previously reported approaches where observations from auxiliary/collocated sensors are used. The validation of these derived cloud-cleared radiances is carried out with the already existing operational Level 2 (L2) cloud-cleared radiances of Atmospheric Infra-Red Sounder (AIRS) and Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI), where the retrieval is carried out utilizing auxiliary Microwave Sounders. Also, a comparative study with the optimal cloud-clearing technique has been carried out here, where the retrieval is done by utilizing the clear sky radiances by means of collocated high-resolution InfraRed observations with the help of auxiliary sensors. The results indicate the scope and promising potential of this technique towards the future operational endeavor of deriving the cloud-cleared radiances without any assistance of co-existing auxiliary hardware system.

T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING

AB  - Satellite-based methods have been widely used to identify the critical phenophases of terrestrial vegetation and detect responses of phenophases to climate change. However, few studies have been conducted to evaluate the performance of satellite-based methods for identifying the spatial and temporal changes of phenophases based on site-based phenophase observations. This study used the ground observations of leaf unfolding date (LUD) of woody and herbaceous plants over 31 sites in China to evaluate the accuracy of LUDs modeled by eight satellite-based methods using Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) vegetation index product. Our results showed an observed 2.62 and 2.45 days advance of LUD over the spatial scale with an increased mean annual temperature of 1 degrees C over the forest and grassland ecosystems respectively, but almost all eight methods underestimated the advance rates. In addition, the trends for the observed LUD varied from site to site, and the eight methods showed the poor performance in capturing the long-term trends, mostly because low temporal resolution of satellite data. Most methods tended to overestimate the trend of LUD over more than 40% forest sites. Our results highlight that there is a need for further improvements in the methods and satellite datasets used for identifying LUD.

TI  - High-resolution prediction of the spatial distribution of PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations in China using a long short-term memory model
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has a significant impact on the environment and human health. However, strong spatial heterogeneity and spatiotemporal dependence increases the difficulty of prediction. Moreover, due to the lag of the update of auxiliary variables at national scale in the prediction application, it is still difficult to achieve the timely nationwide PM2.5 prediction at present. To better model and predict real time concentrations and spatial distributions of PM2.5, this study developed a workflow of future PM2.5 concentrations prediction based on long short-term memory (LSTM) model. Using ground-based station PM2.5 data in 2014-2018, the 1 km Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) aerosol optical depth (AOD) product and other auxiliary data to predict PM2.5 concentrations in the next year and generate a high-resolution national PM2.5 concentration spatial distribution map. The LSTM model outperformed random forest (RF) and Cubist approaches for prediction PM2.5 because of its recurrent neural network structure that can capture time dependence and nonlinear relationships among PM2.5 concentrations and other independent variables, and exhibited a stable accuracy with an R-2 of 0.83, by applying the annual time series, with an improvement of 0.04-0.09, compared to daily and monthly data. The results indicated that PM2.5 pollution had gradually decreased in 2019 after application of pollution controls, with annual mean PM2.5 concentrations of 27.33 +/- 15.56 mu g m(-3), although there were still some areas with severe pollution, including the North China Plain, parts of the Loess Plateau, and the Taklimakan Desert. The LSTM model makes it possible to predict fine-scale PM2.5 spatial distributions nationwide in the future and may thus be useful for sustainable management and control of air pollution at a national scale.

TI  - Assessment of surface roughness and fractional vegetation coverage in the CoLM for modeling regional land surface temperature
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The application of Land surface models (LSMs) at regional scales still faces challenges and large uncertainties exist in simulating regional energy fluxes and land surface temperature (LST). This is possibly caused by their poor representations of surface parameter properties (e.g., fractional vegetation coverage (FVC) and surface roughness length (z0m)) to effectively capture vegetation dynamics. In this study, satellite-based FVC and z0m schemes were incorporated into the Common Land Model (CoLM) and their impacts on modeling energy fluxes and associated LST were further assessed over grassland and forest areas in China. Our results show that the annual mean LST was obviously overestimated by the original CoLM for both grassland and forest. The over-estimation was reduced by the revised CoLM when compared with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST products. Concerning the seasonal patterns, the revised model performed evidently better in simulating LST in summer than in winter. Additionally, the decreased simulation of LST was dominated by a reduction of the surface absorbed short-wave radiation when applying the revised FVC scheme over both grassland and forest, while the increased sensible/latent heat fluxes contributed most to the reduction of LST for the revised z(0m) scheme in grassland/forest, respectively, indicating that land surface energy partitioning is sensitive to the FVC and z(0m) parameterizations. Results from this study suggest that the use of satellite-based dynamics of FVC and z(0m) parameterizations in the CoLM provides a valuable improvement in regional applications.

TI  - Hybrid modeling and prediction of oyster norovirus outbreaks
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a hybrid model for predicting oyster norovirus outbreaks by combining the Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) methods and using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite remote-sensing data. Specifically, 10 years (2007-2016) of cloud-free MODIS Aqua data for water leaving reflectance and environmental data were extracted from the center of each oyster harvest area. Then, the PCA was utilized to compress the size of the MODIS Aqua data. An ANN model was trained using the first 4 years of the data from 2007 to 2010 and validated using the additional 6 years of independent datasets collected from 2011 to 2016. Results indicated that the hybrid PCA-ANN model was capable of reproducing the 10 years of historical oyster norovirus outbreaks along the Northern Gulf of Mexico coast with a sensitivity of 72.7% and specificity of 99.9%, respectively, demonstrating the efficacy of the hybrid model.

TI  - Religious Exiting and Social Networks: Computer Simulations of Religious/Secular Pluralism
T2  - SECULARISM & NONRELIGION
M3  - Article
AB  - Statistical models attempting to predict who will disaffiliate from religions have typically accounted for less than 15% of the variation in religious affiliations, suggesting that we have only a partial understanding of this vital social process. Using agent-based simulations in three "artificial societies" (one predominantly religious; one predominantly secular; and one in between), we demonstrate that worldview pluralism within one's neighborhood and family social networks can be a significant predictor of religious (dis)affiliation but in pluralistic societies worldview diversity is less important and, instead, people move toward worldview neutrality. Our results suggest that there may be two phases in religious disaffiliation: (1) the early adopters initially disaffiliate regardless of social support, and subsequently (2) disaffiliation spreads as support for it within local social networks widens and it appears more acceptable. An important next step is for sociologists to confirm or correct the theoretical findings of this model using real-world social-network data, which will require overcoming the measurement difficulties involved in estimating each individual's degree of local network pluralism.

TI  - Synergetic interaction between spatial land cover dynamics and expanding urban heat islands
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Inherent statistics of the surface temperature pattern were used to categorize urban heat islands (UHIs) for a tropical mega city and its satellite towns. Application of flexible threshold values for UHI zoning made this procedure independent of seasonal or locational influences. UHI zones for the years 1999, 2009, and 2019 were mapped from Landsat thermal bands by applying the mono-window algorithm. The parameters affecting the UHI intensity were rigorously investigated. Dynamics of land use land cover patterns provided in-depth insight into the spatiotemporal variability of UHI. The abrupt rises in localized surface temperature for every decade were recognized and thoroughly explained with the fall in fractional vegetation cover index and increase in normalized difference impervious surface index. The temporal nature of urban agglomeration and fragmentation of vegetation cover was quantified through landscape metric algorithms. The vegetation pattern and associated surface temperature fall were further used to evaluate the weakening of UHI intensity around major recreational zones. Substantial cooling by 0.938 degrees C was noted on daytime, from urban built-up at a 50-m distance to the green parks. Differential rates of urbanization and associated magnification of UHIs were looked into separately for central urban and satellite town areas. The characteristics of built-up density and proximity to green areas were employed to strategize mitigatory measures for the constantly growing UHI problem. Urgent needs for sustainable policies and green landscaping were highlighted through multi-criterion analysis.

TI  - An automated deep learning convolutional neural network algorithm applied for soil salinity distribution mapping in Lake Urmia, Iran
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional soil salinity studies are time-consuming and expensive, especially over large areas. This study proposed an innovative deep learning convolutional neural network (DL-CNN) data-driven approach for SSD mapping. Multi-spectral remote sensing data encompassing Landsat series images provide the possibility for frequent assessment of SSD in various regions of the world. Therefore, Landsat 7 ETM+ and 8 OLI images were acquired for years 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2019. Totally, 704 sample points collected from the top 20 cm of the soil surface, which 70% was used to train the network and the remains (30%) were utilized to validate the network. Accordingly, DL-CNN model trained using remote sensing (RS)-derived variables (land surface temperature (LST), Soil moisture (SM) and evapotranspiration) and geospatial data such as NDVI and landuse. To train the CNN, ReLu, Cross-entropy and ADAM were employed respectively as activation, loss/cost functions and optimizer. The results indicated the high confidence of OA 0.94.02, 0.93.99, 0.94.87 and 0.95.0 respectively for years 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2019. These accuracies demonstrated the best performance of automated DL-CNN for SSD mapping compared to RS soil salinity indexes. Furthermore, the FR and WOE models applied in order to generate a geospatial assessment of the DL-CNN classification results. According to the FR model, landuse, LST, LST and NDVI with the frequency ratio of 0.98.25, 0.94.03, 0.97.23 and 0.96.36 selected respectively as more effective factors for SSD in the study area for years 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2019. Also based on the WOE model, landuse, LST, landuse and NDVI with the WOE of 0.88.25, 0.91.88, 0.87.43 and 0.89.02 were ranked respectively for years 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2019 as efficient variables for SSD. In sum, our introduced method can be recommended for SDD spatial modelling in other favored areas with similar environmental conditions.(c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Eastward Expansion of Round Goby in New York: Assessment of Detection Methods and Current Range
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Round Goby Neogobius melanostomus has spread rapidly around the Great Lakes region since its introduction to North America in 1990. In 2014, a specimen was captured in the New York State Canal System west of Utica, prompting concerns that Round Goby would soon reach the ecologically and economically valuable watersheds of Lake Champlain and the Hudson River estuary. The establishment of Round Goby populations elsewhere has been linked to a number of negative ecological consequences, yet methods for monitoring the invasion front of this species remain limited. The objectives of this study were to assess the current distribution of Round Goby in central New York and to determine the most effective methods for monitoring the invasion front. This was achieved by concurrently using benthic trawling, seining, minnow traps, and environmental DNA (eDNA) twice annually from 2016 to 2019 at 12 sites on the canal system between Oneida Lake and the Hudson River. Of the three traditional gear types, benthic trawling was the most effective method and captured Round Goby as far east as Utica by 2019. This finding suggests only minimal eastward expansion of Round Goby occurred between 2014 and 2019. Round Goby DNA was detected in water samples during all surveys in which individuals were captured with trawling, and the estimated concentration of DNA explained 69% of the variability in trawl catch. At multiple study sites, Round Goby DNA was identified during consecutive surveys before Round Goby were first captured with trawling. This suggests that in lotic waters, eDNA has the potential to forecast or serve as a sentinel for the expansion of Round Goby to new locations. Our results demonstrate the importance of using eDNA in a repeated sampling framework and supplementing eDNA sampling with some level of effort with traditional sampling methods.

TI  - Integrating coarse-resolution images and agricultural statistics to generate sub-pixel crop type maps and reconciled area estimates
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable crop type maps are vital for agricultural monitoring, ensuring food security, and environmental sustainability assessments. Coarse-resolution imagery such as MODIS are widely used for crop type mapping due to their short revisit cycles, which is advantageous for detecting the seasonal dynamics of different crop types. However, the inherently low spatial resolution may restrict their utility for mapping crop types in regions with heterogeneous agricultural landscapes. Agricultural statistics, which provide crop acreage information at different spatial and temporal scales, have the potential to improve crop type mapping from remote sensing. Yet, previous studies have often used agricultural statistics as reference data to evaluate the accuracy of satellitederived crop type maps but have rarely utilized them to improve crop type distribution mapping. The utility of integrating agricultural statistics with satellite images to produce high-accuracy crop type maps is rarely explored. This study presents a methodology for mapping sub-pixel crop type distributions via the integration of MODIS time series and agricultural statistics. We tested our approach in Heilongjiang Province, which has the highest agricultural production in China. First, we used an optimized random forest regression (RF-r) model with training samples derived from high spatial resolution images (i.e. SPOT and Landsat) to predict the sub-pixel crop type distributions from MODIS time series. To optimize the RF-r model, an 8-day MODIS time series of five vegetation indices in 2011 were used as the candidate independent variables, and a backward feature elimination strategy was implemented to select the best variables for model prediction. Second, we developed an Iterative Area Gap Spatial Allocation (IAGSA) method to spatially reconcile the discrepancies between the crop acreage estimated from MODIS-based maps and the agricultural statistics. We found that the MODIS-derived crop fractions agreed with those derived from the high-resolution images, with R2 > 0.75 for all crop types, yet there was a clear discrepancy between the crop acreage estimated from MODIS and agricultural statistics. The subpixel crop type maps adjusted by IAGSA were not only consistent with the agricultural statistics for crop acreage, but also retained the spatial distribution patterns of the original MODIS-derived crop fraction. Our results suggest the advantages of integrating coarse-resolution images and agricultural statistics to map sub-pixel crop type distributions, and to provide consistent estimation of crop acreage. The presented methodology has the potential to map large-scale crop type extent across regions in a cost-effective way.

TI  - Burst Overlap Coregistration for Sentinel-1 TOPS DInSAR Ice Velocity Measurements
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The application of Sentinel-1 interferometry to ice velocity measurements has until recently been limited by the significant horizontal scene motion associated with ice flow, which causes phase discontinuities (and associated unwrapping problems) at burst boundaries in Terrain Observation by Progressive Scans (TOPS) interferograms. Coregistering with a multiyear averaged external velocity mosaic based on offset-tracking can account for the bulk of the ice motion, but residual discontinuities sometimes remain, for example, due to seasonal variations in the ice velocity, or due to error sources such as azimuth shifts caused by ionospheric propagation. The presented method extends the external velocity coregistration with a local, spatially varying, coregistration in the burst overlap regions. This is based on the extended spectral diversity principle, which can only be applied in the overlap regions, but offers superior accuracy and resolution compared with traditional coregistration methods. The method considerably reduces phase discontinuities at burst boundaries, and potential new phase discontinuities at the overlap region edges are suppressed by an azimuth tapering of the applied coregistration shifts. An example scene is presented, and the phase discontinuities before and after application of the method are evaluated. The method is seen to remove phase discontinuities, with no adverse effects.

TI  - Optimal sampling strategy of water quality monitoring at high dynamic lakes: A remote sensing and spatial simulated annealing integrated approach
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - An efficient and precise spatial sampling design is critical to capture spatial and temporal water quality variations under cost and labor constraints. Therefore, it is practically essential to optimize the sampling locations using limited sampling numbers to obtain the most comprehensive water quality monitoring results considering both the spatial and temporal dynamics. Existing sampling methods were restricted due to lacking pre-information and specific sampling objective function. This paper proposed an optimal sampling strategy using remote sensing (RS) big data and spatial sampling annealing (SSA) integrated approach for sampling design. The proposed method involved spatial-temporal clustering of the total suspended sediment (TSS) using long-term remote sensing data (Terra/Aqua MODIS, 2000-2014), determining the required sampling numbers using geostatistical analysis, and SSA simulation following the objective function of minimization of the spatial-temporal mean estimation error using remote sensing data as references. Taking total suspended sediment (TSS) observations at Poyang Lake, China, as the case study and application region. Results showed that the RS + SSA sampling approach is superior to conventional sampling methods such as systematic, stratified, and expert sampling, concerning spatial and temporal sampling accuracy. TSS estimation errors of the whole lake were reduced by 18.11% and 29.34% on average when compared to systematic and stratified sampling under the same sample size. The annual TSS estimation errors were dropped by approximately 50%. The sampling accuracy was affected by the synthetic effects of sampling strategy (station numbers and spatial distributions) and water quality variations (coefficient of variation, CV). Sampling optimization is more efficient to improve the sampling accuracy than increasing sampling size, which requires more cost and human resources. Remote sensing showed great potential as ideal means to provide spatially contiguous and comprehensive data as prior-knowledge for efficient sampling design. This paper provides solutions and recommendations for evaluating existing monitoring stations in their representation of water quality or optimizing a new sampling network for future implications of more efficient and precise water quality sampling and routine monitoring.

TI  - Role of vitamin D serum levels in prevention of primary and recurrent melanoma
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Patients afflicted with melanoma show lower vitamin D serum levels (VDSL) than the healthy population. This hypothesis agrees with its well-known antiproliferative features. An observational study was carried out to collect VDSL in patients suffering from melanoma. Our aim was to identify a potential connection between low VDSL and the risk to incur melanoma. Furthermore, we studied the association between VDSL at the diagnosis of melanoma and other germane prognostic factors. The population held in regard was composed of 154 patients with a diagnosis of melanoma between 2016 and 2019. These patients were retrospectively collected from our follow-up storage. We compared VDSL to clinical and pathological parameters (age, sex, tumour location, Breslow's depth, Clark's level, histological subtype, ulceration, et a liqua). Moreover, we recruited a control group with negative melanoma history. Mean and median of VDSL were significantly lower in the melanoma group. Instead, we found a negative association between melanoma and VDSL > 30 ng/L (OR 0.11; p< 0.0001). No correlation between VDSL and both Breslow's depth and Clark's level was discovered, but the VDSL comparison between thin (depth <= 1 mm) and thick tumours (depth > 1 mm) revealed a statistically significant difference (21.1 +/- 8.2 ng/L vs 17.8 +/- 8.1; p = 0.01). Moreover, VDSL were significantly lower in melanomas with mitotic rate >= 1/mm(2) (22.1 +/- 8.3 ng/L; p < 0007). Nevertheless, no connection was found between VDSL and both ulceration and positive sentinel nodes (p= 0.76; p= 0.74). Besides, our study revealed no association between VDSL and histological subtype (p= 0.161). Lower VDSL correlate with thick and high mitotic rate tumours. Future prospective studies would investigate if appropriate upkeep of suitable VDSL can decrease the risk of primary and recurrent melanoma diagnosis.

TI  - The value of contrast-enhanced ultrasound in determining the location of sentinel lymph nodes in breast cancer
T2  - CANCER IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThis study aimed to explore the sentinel lymph node (SLN) identification rate in breast cancer by subcutaneous and intradermal injection of ultrasound contrast agent in the mammary areola region, compared to the results achieved with methylene blue (MB).MethodsA total of 390 breast cancer patients with planned sentinel lymph node biopsy from our breast surgery department from July 2017 to February 2019 were enrolled. All patients were subjected to preoperative contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), that involved an intracutaneous injection of 1 mL ultrasonic contrast agent (UCA) at 3 and 6 o 'clock, as well as a subcutaneous injection of 1 mL UCA at 9 and 12 o'clock. The enhanced lymph nodes along the enhanced lymphatic vessels from the mammary areola were traced. The number of enhanced lymph nodes were recorded, and an ultrasound-guided injection of 1:10 diluted carbon nanoparticles were used to mark all first site enhanced lymph nodes (i.e., SLNs). An intraoperative dye method (MB) was used to track the SLNs and the results were compared with the CEUS findings.ResultsAmong the 390 cases of breast cancer, enhanced SLNs were observed in 373 patients after an injection of UCA with an identification rate of 95.64% (373/390), compared to the identification rate of 92.05% (359/390) using the intraoperative MB. The difference between the two methods was statistically significant (P=0.016). And among the 390 patients, a total of 808 enhanced lymph nodes were traced by preoperative CEUS, with a median of 2 (1,3). A total of 971 blue-stained lymph nodes were traced using the intraoperative MB, with a median of 2 (2,3), indicating a statistically significant difference (p<0.001).ConclusionsIntradermal and subcutaneous injections of UCA in the mammary areola region may have clinical application value for the identification and localization of SLNs in breast cancer patients. The identification rate is higher than that of blue dye method, which can be used as a new tracer of sentinel lymph node biopsy and complement other staining methods to improve the success rate.

TI  - Integrating remote sensing and machine learning into environmental monitoring and assessment of land use change
T2  - SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Addressing the increasing burden on land use requires effective policy for sustainable land use along with economic development. Analysis of local and global indicators based on land use maps could reveal information on the progress of sustainable development. This study proposes a method that reduces the time and cost of creating land use maps applicable for many purposes of environmental protection. Freely accessible existing data, Sentinel-2 satellite images, together with a machine learning algorithm, Random Forest, are integrated to generate an annual map, sufficient to meet the intended needs. The method is illustrated by a case study of Phuket in Thailand. An annual map for Phuket created using the proposed method was compared to the official map released by the Thai government for the year 2018. The two maps did not differ significantly, validating the efficacy of the proposed method. Annual maps were then produced for several years to assess the effect of land use change in the past 19 years on the environmental and sustainable management in Phuket. Although there was evidence of the efforts to develop Phuket island as a sustainable province such as the government policy to conserve green areas, land use change based analytical results indicated Phuket's urban development was not going in an environmentally sustainable direction.

TI  - A review of the AJCC melanoma staging system in the TNM classification (eighth edition)
T2  - JAPANESE JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - In the eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Manual, several modifications were made for melanoma. These modifications were aimed at improving the prognosis prediction accuracy of the staging system. The main modifications are as follows: the cutoff value of the T1 category has been changed, and there are new classifications of stage IIID and of M1d (metastasis of the central nervous system). These changes will allow for more accurate stratification of melanoma prognosis. However, it is necessary to validate the new modifications through future clinical research.

TI  - China's Chang'e-5 landing site: Geology, stratigraphy, and provenance of materials
T2  - EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - China's Chang'e-5 (CE-5) mission, the first lunar sample return mission since 1976, landed at 43.06 degrees N, 51.92 degrees W on Dec. 1, 2020, in Northern Oceanus Procellarum. CE-5 targeted a mare plain (Em4/P58) composed of distinctive young (similar to 1.6-1.7 Ga) moderate-Ti mare basalts, with elevated Th abundance (inherent or extraneous). Thus, the regolith and rock fragments sampled by CE-5 come from some of the youngest mare basalts on the Moon, near Rima Sharp, and from the center of the globally anomalous Procellarum KREEP Terrane (PKT), hypothesized to be responsible for the generation of the young volcanism. To provide context for the analysis and interpretation of the returned samples and in-situ measurements of the regolith substructure with penetrating radar, we constructed a detailed geologic map and stratigraphic assessment of the site. The stratigraphy consists of ancient highland materials (PKT crust and ejecta from Iridum and Imbrium basins), local silica-rich volcanism, overlain by a sequence of mare basalts, capped with Em4/P58. A similar to 4-7 m thick regolith layer developed by post-mare bombardment overlies the Em4/P58 protolith and contains admixed impact ejecta from distant sources, mainly from Harpalus (similar to 6 wt.%), followed by Copernicus (similar to 2 wt.%) and Aristarchus (similar to 1 wt.%). New crater size-frequency measurements of Em4/P58 provide the necessary crater spatial density reference for calibration of the lunar cratering chronology with radiometric ages of the returned samples. The geological map and assessment of regolith provenance indicate that samples returned by CE-5 will address fundamental questions in lunar chronology, thermal evolution, basalt petrogenesis, and the nature of PKT, as well as provide key calibration for lunar and planetary chronologies and remote sensing data.

TI  - Examining the status of improved air quality in world cities due to COVID-19 led temporary reduction in anthropogenic emissions
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Clean air is a fundamental necessity for human health and well-being. Anthropogenic emissions that are harmful to human health have been reduced substantially under COVID-19 lockdown. Satellite remote sensing for air pollution assessments can be highly effective in public health research because of the possibility of estimating air pollution levels over large scales. In this study, we utilized both satellite and surface measurements to estimate air pollution levels in 20 cities across the world. Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Sentinel-5 Precursor TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) application were used for both spatial and time-series assessment of tropospheric Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) and Carbon Monoxide (CO) statuses during the study period (1 February to May 11, 2019 and the corresponding period in 2020). We also measured Population-Weighted Average Concentration (PWAC) of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) and NO2 using gridded population data and in-situ air pollution estimates. We estimated the economic benefit of reduced anthropogenic emissions using two valuation approaches: (1) the median externality value coefficient approach, applied for satellite data, and (2) the public health burden approach, applied for in-situ data. Satellite data have shown that -28 tons (sum of 20 cities) of NO2 and -184 tons (sum of 20 cities) of CO have been reduced during the study period. PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 are reduced by -37 (?g/m3), 62 (?g/m3), and 145 (?g/m3), respectively. A total of -1310, -401, and -430 premature cause-specific deaths were estimated to be avoided with the reduction of NO2, PM2.5, and PM10. The total economic benefits (Billion US$) (sum of 20 cities) of the avoided mortality are measured as -10, -3.1, and -3.3 for NO2, PM2.5, and PM10, respectively. In many cases, ground monitored data was found inadequate for detailed spatial assessment. This problem can be better addressed by incorporating satellite data into the evaluation if proper quality assurance is achieved, and the data processing burden can be alleviated or even removed. Both satellite and ground-based estimates suggest the positive effect of the limited human interference on the natural environments. Further research in this direction is needed to explore this synergistic association more explicitly.

TI  - Analyzing Spatio-temporal Land Cover Dynamics in an Atlantic Forest Portion Using Unsupervised Change Detection Techniques
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELING & ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past decades, the Southeast Atlantic Forest in Paraiba do Sul River Valley has suffered intense deforestation and human disturbances. Due to the Atlantic Forest biodiversity and the economic relevance of such a region in Brazil, spatial-temporal analyses are of crucial importance to protect the forest, as well as to support economic decision-making of public and private agents. In this context, the use of change detection techniques applied to remote sensing imagery arises as a powerful tool to track and map the Earth's surface transformations. Therefore, this work investigates the effectiveness and practical feasibility of distinct unsupervised change detection approaches when they are applied to reveal the spatial-temporal dynamics in Paraiba do Sul River Valley across the last four decades. Different change detection approaches such as Change Vector Analysis (CVA), a K-Means and Principal Component Analysis (PCA-KM) framework, and a Alternating Sequential Filtering (ASF) based process were taken and properly tuned to cope with Landsat image series. The analysis of the results revealed a permanent land cover change rate over the last decades. Moreover, these changes do not necessary occur in the same locations, as it was confirmed the existence of successive modifications in original coverage of the study area. Another observed aspect is that the simplest technique for detecting changes, CVA, turned out to be the best approach to map the changes in the examined region.

TI  - Low-grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) arising in a fibroadenoma of the breast during 5 years follow-up A case report
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rationale: Fibroadenoma (FA) is a common type of benign breast tumors but ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) rarely arises within this tumor type. Patient concerns: This case report presents a non-symptomatic 61-year-old woman with FA that was coincidentally found during a breast cancer screening program performed 5 years ago by her city of residence. She had subsequently been followed-up with mammography and breast ultrasound (US). US showed a slightly enlarged tumor and dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated malignancy within the FA. Diagnosis: The pathological examination revealed low-grade DCIS within the FA. Interventions: The patient underwent a core needle biopsy followed by breast-conserving therapy with sentinel lymph node biopsy and then postoperative radiation therapy. Outcomes: Currently, she has been followed-up for 2 years without no signs of recurrence. Lessons: Careful observation with US followed by dynamic MRI is essential in the early diagnosis of DCIS originating in a FA.

TI  - Juvenile survival of a burned forest specialist in response to variation in fire characteristics
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Pyrodiversity, defined as variation in fire history and characteristics, has been shown to catalyse post-fire biodiversity in a variety of systems. However, the demographic and behavioural mechanisms driving the responses of individual species to pyrodiversity remain largely unexplored.We used a model post-fire specialist, the black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), to examine the relationship between fire characteristics and juvenile survival while controlling for confounding factors.We radio-tracked fledgling black-backed woodpeckers in burned forests of California and Washington, USA, and derived information on habitat characteristics using ground surveys and satellite data. We used hierarchical Bayesian mixed-effects models to determine the factors that influence both fledgling and annual juvenile survival, and we tested for effects of fledgling age on movement rates.Burn severity strongly affected fledgling survival, with lower survival in patches created by high-severity fire compared to patches burned at medium to low severity or left unburned. Time since leaving the nest was also a strong predictor of fledgling survival, annual juvenile survival and fledgling movement rates.Our results support the role of habitat complementation in generating species-specific benefits from variation in spatial fire characteristics-one axis of pyrodiversity-and highlight the importance of this variation under shifting fire regimes. High-severity fire provides foraging and nesting sites that support the needs of adult black-backed woodpeckers, but fledgling survival is greater in areas burned at lower severity. By linking breeding and foraging habitat with neighbouring areas of reduced predation risk, pyrodiversity may enhance the survival and persistence of animals that thrive in post-fire habitat.

TI  - Accounting for land cover changes and degradation in the Katse and Mohale Dam catchments of the Lesotho highlands
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF RANGE & FORAGE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rangeland conditions in the Lesotho highland dam catchment areas is important for local livelihoods and regional water supply. We investigated changes in land cover and condition from 1991 (before construction) to 2013, using Landsat imagery. The Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) decreased in the catchment areas, while increasing within two protected areas. NDVI decreases were greatest close to the dams and in the high altitude summer grazing areas. Land cover maps were generated for 1993, 2005 and 2013, using structural vegetation classes, as well as categories of grassland based on NDVI. High altitude areas were characterised by grasslands changing to lower NDVI categories, indicating overgrazing in climax sourveld grasslands. Mid-altitude areas were characterised by grasslands changing to higher NDVI categories and increases in woody vegetation, indicating overgrazing in Sweetveld. At lower altitudes, the increase in cultivated areas suggested disproportionately high population growth in the catchment areas. The results suggest that there has been widespread degradation that appears to be more as a result of overgrazing than climate change. The study demonstrates the importance of using a combination of land cover, NDVI and field data in assessing degradation. Natural capital accounting methods provide a useful framework for documenting, monitoring and understanding changes in ecosystem condition.

TI  - Identifying the effects of chronic saltwater intrusion in coastal floodplain swamps using remote sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal floodplain swamps (CFS) are an important part of the coastal wetland mosaic, however they are threatened due to accelerated rates of sea level rise and saltwater intrusion (SWI). While remote sensing-based detection of wholesale coastal ecosystem shifts (i.e., from forest to marsh) are relatively straightforward, assessments of chronic, low-level SWI into CFS using remote sensing have yet to be developed and can provide a critical early-warning signal of ecosystem deterioration. In this study, we developed nine ecologically-based hypotheses to test whether remote sensing data could be used to reliably detect the presence of CFS experiencing SWI. Hypotheses were motivated by field- and literature-based understanding of the phenological and vegetative dynamics of CFS experiencing SWI relative to unimpacted, control systems. Hypotheses were organized into two primary groups: those that analyzed differences in summary measures (e.g., median and distribution) between SWI-impacted and unimpacted control sites and those that examined timeseries trends (e.g., sign and magnitude of slope). The enhanced vegetation index (EVI) was used as a proxy for production/biomass and was generated using MODIS surface reflectance data spanning 2000 to 2018. Experimental sites (n = 8) were selected from an existing network of long-term monitoring sites and included 4 pairs of impacted/non-impacted CFS across the northern Gulf of Mexico from Texas to Florida. The four best-supported hypotheses (81% across all sties) all used summary statistics, indicating that there were significant differences in the EVI of CFS experiencing chronic, low-level SWI compared to controls. These hypotheses were tested using data across a large and diverse region, supporting their implementation by researchers and managers seeking to identify CFS undergoing the first phases of SWI. In contrast, hypotheses that assessed CFS change over time were poorly supported, likely due to the slow and variable pace of ecological change, relatively short remote sensing data record, and/or specific site histories. Overall, these results show that remote sensing data can be used to identify differences in CFS vegetation associated with long-term, low-level SWI, but further methodological advancements are needed to reliably detect the temporal transition process.

TI  - The association of prenatal exposure to particulate matter with infant growth: A birth cohort study in Beijing, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Limited studies examined the associations of prenatal exposure to particulate matter (PM) and children's growth with inconsistent results, and no study focused on PM1. We matched a birth cohort (10,547 children) with daily PM1 and PM2.5 concentrations by maternal home addresses. Air pollution concentrations were predicted by satellite remote sensing data, meteorological factors, and land use information. The weight and length of children in the birth cohort were measured at approximately one year old. We calculated the Z-score of weight for length (WFL) and body mass index (BMI) and then defined overweight and obesity (OWOB) based on WHO Standards. Generalized linear regression and modified Poisson regression were used to identify the association of prenatal exposure to PM1 or PM2.5 with anthropometric measurements and risk of OWOB. We also determined the mediation effect of preterm birth on the associations. Results showed that a 10 mu g/m(3) increase in prenatal exposure to PM1 and PM2.5 was significantly associated with a 0.105 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.067, 0.144] and 0.063 (95% CI: 0.029, 0.097) increase in WFL Z-score for one-year-old children. Similar associations were found for BMI Z-score. A 10 mu g/m(3) increase in prenatal PM1 and PM2.5 exposure was significantly associated with 1.012 (95%CI: 1.003, 1.021) and 1.010 (95%CI: 1.002, 1.018) times higher risk of OWOB.. Preterm birth mediated 7.5% [direct effect (DE) = 0.106, P < 0.001; indirect effect (IE) = 0.009, P < 0.001)] and 9.9% (DE = 0.064, P < 0.001; IE = 0.007, P < 0.001) of the association between prenatal PM1 and PM2.5 exposure and WFL Z-score of the children. The association of prenatal PM1 and PM2.5 exposure with BMI Z-score of children was also mediated by preterm birth by 6.6% (DE = 0.111, P < 0.001; IE = 0.008, P < 0.001) and 9.1% (DE = 0.064, P < 0.001; IE = 0.006, P < 0.001). These results remained robust in the sensitivity analyses. In conclusion, prenatal exposure to PM1 and PM2.5 increased WFL, BMI Z-scores and higher risk of OWOB for one-year-old children. The associations were partially mediated by preterm birth. These findings call for the urgent action on air pollution regulation to protect early-life health among children. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Event-based dynamic optimization for food thermal processing: High-quality food production under raw material variability
T2  - FOOD AND BIOPRODUCTS PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Industrial canneries are subject to perturbations that may compromise food safety requirements. In such cases, plant operators typically increase the processing time, leading to undesirable large processing cycles and excessive quality degradation. In addition, differences among the items in a batch lead to variability in terms of quality and safety which, if not explicitly considered in the processing strategy, forces the use of conservative operation policies.In this work, we present an event-based dynamic optimization approach that combines available plant measurements and mathematical model predictions to anticipate the effect of plant perturbations on food safety. A safety software sensor is build upon an on-line predictive simulation and a previous food-variability characterization such that, if any perturbation during the sterilization compromises food safety, a new processing strategy that optimizes a trade off among quality, uniformity and processing time is recomputed and implemented. Such multi-objective dynamic optimization problem under food product variability is efficiently addressed by taking advantage of the monotonicity and convexity properties of the food quality/safety dynamics.(c) 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - Severity of natural hazards and related disasters are increasing worldwide. Of the several disasters, forest fires are most common in South/Southeast Asia including Laos. In this study, we use the satellite imagery to detect forest fires in the prior to farming and to quickly estimate the total area of forest burned due to the farmers' land preparation activities Nam Kading national bio-diversity conservation area (NBCA). Pre-fire and post-fire dates were between January and April 2018. Specifically, we used Sentinel-2 data to calculate Differential Normalized Burned Ratio (dNBR) for burned area mapping in Google Earth Engine (GEE). Ground-truth was done at random sites to verify the results. Results suggested burnt areas about 2689 ha inside NBCA and 16,923 ha in the neighboring study area. A total of 500 random points were used to validate the burned area map and the results suggested an overall accuracy of about 97.4%, (98.1% of producer's accuracy, 96.2% of user's accuracy with 0.94 kappa-statistics). Our results highlight the potential of NBR in GEE framework for rapid assessment of burnt areas useful for fire management and mitigation purposes.

TI  - Using Point of Care Testing to estimate influenza vaccine effectiveness in the English primary care sentinel surveillance network
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionRapid Point of Care Testing (POCT) for influenza could be used to provide information on influenza vaccine effectiveness (IVE) as well as influencing clinical decision-making in primary care.MethodsWe undertook a test negative case control study to estimate the overall and age-specific (6 months-17 years, 18-64 years, >= 65 years old) IVE against medically attended POCT-confirmed influenza. The study took place over the winter of 2019-2020 and was nested within twelve general practices that are part of the Oxford-Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC), the English sentinel surveillance network.Results648 POCT were conducted. 193 (29.7%) of those who were swabbed had received the seasonal influenza vaccine. The crude unadjusted overall IVE was 46.1% (95% CI: 13.9-66.3). After adjusting for confounders the overall IVE was 26.0% (95% CI: 0-65.5). In total 211 patients were prescribed an antimicrobial after swab testing. Given a positive influenza POCT result, the odds ratio (OR) of receiving an antiviral was 21.1 (95%CI: 2.4-182.2, p = <0.01) and the OR of being prescribed an antibiotic was 0.6 (95%CI: 0.4-0.9, p = <0.01).DiscussionUsing influenza POCT in a primary care sentinel surveillance network to estimate IVE is feasible and provides comparable results to published IVE estimates. A further advantage is that near patient testing of influenza is associated with improvements in appropriate antiviral and antibiotic use. Larger, randomised studies are needed in primary care to see if these trends are still present and to explore their impact on outcomes.

TI  - Monitoring Mosquito-Borne Arbovirus in Various Insect Regions in China in 2018
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR AND INFECTION MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundIncreases in global travel and trade are changing arbovirus distributions worldwide. Arboviruses can be introduced by travelers, migratory birds, or vectors transported via international trade. Arbovirus surveillance in field-collected mosquitoes may provide early evidence for mosquito-borne disease transmission.MethodsDuring the seasons of high mosquito activity of 2018, 29,285 mosquitoes were sampled from seven sentinel sites in various insect regions. The mosquitoes were analyzed by RT-PCR for alphaviruses, flaviviruses, and orthobunyaviruses.ResultsWe detected three strains of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), five strains of Getah virus (GETV), and 45 strains of insect-specific flaviviruses including Aedes flavivirus (AeFV, 1), Chaoyang virus (CHAOV, 1), Culex flavivirus (CxFV, 17), Hanko virus (HANKV, 2), QuangBinh virus (QBV, 22), and Yunnan Culex flavivirus (YNCxFV, 2). Whole genomes of one strain each of GETV, CxFV, CHAOV, and AeFV were successfully amplified. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the new JEV strains detected in the Shanghai and Hubei Provinces belong to the GI-b strain and are phylogenetically close to the NX1889 strain (MT134112) isolated from a patient during a JE outbreak in Ningxia in 2018. GETVs were found in Inner Mongolia, Hubei, and Hainan and belonged to Group III. They were closely related to strains isolated from swine. HANKV was recorded for the first time in China and other ISFVs were newly detected at several sentinel sites. The bias-corrected maximum likelihood estimation value for JEV in Jinshan, Shanghai was 4.52/1,000 (range 0.80-14.64). Hence, there is a potential risk of a JEV epidemic in that region.ConclusionGI-b is the dominant circulating JEV genotype in nature and poses a health risk to animals and humans. The potential threat of widespread GETV distribution as a zoonosis is gradually increasing. The present study also disclosed the dispersion and host range of ISFVs. These findings highlight the importance of tracing the movements of the vectors and hosts of mosquito-borne pathogens in order to prevent and control arbovirus outbreaks in China.

TI  - To Turn the Whole World Over: Black Women and Internationalism
T2  - MODERN INTELLECTUAL HISTORY
M3  - Book Review
AB  - Published in Paris in 1928 under the leadership of Guadeloupean Maurice Satineau, the newspaper La depeche africaine featured a melange of African diasporic contributors from across the French colonies. Chief among them were the Afro-Martinican intellectuals and sisters Jane and Paulette Nardal. It was here that Jane Nardal published her now famous essay "Internationalisme noir," introducing the idea of "black internationalism" into popular parlance. Nardal documented a new understanding of blackness and collectivity amid post-World War I globalization. Just as wartime had broken down barriers among Europeans and white Americans, so too had it fostered the "sentiment" among black people from the around the world that they "belong[ed] to one and the same race." Introducing and reifying terms such as "Afro Latino" and "African American" into French and English vernaculars, Nardal focused on black people's efforts to rhetorically and ideologically link the African diaspora while also reconciling these new identities with the "ancient traditions" of Africa. The result: one of the first efforts to define black internationalism as an ideology, worldview, and political practice in a moment in which black people the world over were trying to negotiate the modernizing world and their place in it.

TI  - Cytologic Features of Lipogranulomatous Reaction in an Axillary Sentinel Lymph Node
T2  - ACTA CYTOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Multinucleated giant cells (MGC) are a rare finding when evaluating axillary sentinel lymph nodes. Some are described as foreign body-type MGC accompanied by foamy macrophages. They have been rarely reported in nodes from patients in which a previous breast biopsy was performed. The tissue damage induced by biopsy results in secondary changes including fat necrosis and hemorrhage that can migrate to axillary nodes. In this report, we illustrate a lipogranulomatous reaction in cytologic samples obtained during a sentinel lymph node examination of a woman previously biopsied because of breast carcinoma. We have found no previous cytologic descriptions and consider it an interesting finding that should be known to avoid diagnostic misinterpretations. Case: A 51-year-old woman underwent mastectomy of the right breast with a sentinel lymph node biopsy at our medical center. One month before, a control mammography revealed suspicious microcalcifications and a vacuum-assisted breast biopsy resulted in a diagnosis of high-grade intraductal carcinoma with comedonecrosis. Surgery with a sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed. The sentinel node was processed as an intraoperative consultation. Frozen sections and air-dried Diff-Quik stained samples were obtained. They showed abundant lymphocytes with MGC and tumoral cells. MGC showed ample cytoplasm with evident vacuoles of variable size. Occasional hemosiderin-laden macrophages were also present. The complete histologic analysis and immunohistochemical studies revealed no malignant cells. Histologic analysis showed, in subcapsular location, occasional MGC phagocyting lipid droplets. Hemosiderin-laden macrophages were a common finding. Conclusion: Lipogranulomas may appear at axillary sentinel lymph nodes because of fat necrosis induced by previous breast biopsy. The most important consideration is not confounding MGC with epithelial cell clusters. This can occur with not well-processed samples, especially if unmounted.

TI  - Harmonized and high-quality datasets of aerosol optical depth at a US continental site, 1997-2018
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Aerosol optical depth (AOD) characterizes the aerosol burden in the atmosphere, while its wavelength dependence is a sign of particle size. Long-term records of wavelength-resolved AOD with high quality and suitable continuity are required for climate change assessment. Typically, climate-related studies use AOD products provided by several, and perhaps different, ground-based instruments. The measurements from these instruments often have different accuracy and temporal resolution. To preserve the advantages of these products (high quality) and to reduce their disadvantages (patchy records), we generate a merged dataset obtained from four instruments deployed at a US continental site in which a nearly-continuous AOD record is found at two wavelengths (500 and 870 nm) with high quality and high temporal resolution (1-min) for a 21-yr period (1997-2018). The combined dataset addresses: (1) varying data quality and resolution mismatch of the individual AOD records, and (2) the uncertainty of the merged AOD and its relevance for user-specified needs. The generated dataset will be beneficial for a wide range of applications including aerosol-radiation interactions.

TI  - Production of global daily seamless data cubes and quantification of global land cover change from 1985 to 2020-iMap World 1.0
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Longer time high-resolution, high-frequency, consistent, and more detailed land cover data are urgently needed in order to achieve sustainable development goals on food security, high-quality habitat construction, biodiversity conservation and planetary health, and for the understanding, simulation and management of the Earth system. However, due to technological constraints, it is difficult to provide simultaneously high spatial resolution, high temporal frequency, and high quality observation data. Existing mapping solutions are limited by traditional remotely sensed data, that have shorter observation periods, poor spatio-temporal consistency and comparability. Therefore, a new mapping paradigm is needed. This paper develops a framework for intelligent mapping (iMap) of land cover based on state-of-the-art technologies such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, virtual constellations, and spatio-temporal reconstruction and fusion. Under this framework, we built an automated, serverless, end-to-end data production chain and parallel mapping system based on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and produced the first 30 m global daily seamless data cubes (SDC), and annual to seasonal land cover maps for 1985?2020. The SDC was produced through a multi-source spatio-temporal data reconstruction and fusion workflow based on Landsat, MODIS, and AVHRR virtual constellations. Independent validation results show that the relative mean error of the SDC is less than 2.14%. As analysis ready data (ARD), it can lay a foundation for high-precision quantitative remote sensing information extraction. From this SDC, we produced 36-year long, 30 m resolution global land cover map data set by combining strategies of sample migration, machine learning, and spatio-temporal adjustment. The average overall accuracy of our annual land cover maps over multiple periods of time is 80% for level 1 classification and over 73% for level 2 classification (29 and 33 classes). Based on an objective validation sample consisting of FLUXNET sites, our map accuracy is 10% higher than that of existing global land cover datasets including Globeland30. Our results show that the average global land cover change rate is 0.36%/yr. Global forest decreased by 1.47 million km2 from 38.44 million km2, cropland increased by 0.84 million km2 from 12.49 million km2 and impervious surface increased by 0.48 million km2 from 0.57 million km2 during 1985? 2020.

TI  - Estimating monthly air temperature using remote sensing on a region with highly variable topography and scarce monitoring in the southern Ecuadorian Andes
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring of air temperature has implications in a wide range of environmental applications. Air temperature commonly measured with meteorological stations provides a high accuracy and temporal resolution for specific monitoring sites. However, in regions with highly variable topography and scare monitoring such as the case of the southern Ecuadorian Andes, these in situ data poorly describe the spatial variability of air temperature. Thus, remote sensing data has a great potential to estimate the spatial distribution of climatological variables due to the spatial continuity of the information. This research aims to estimate the spatial distribution of the monthly air temperature in the Paute river basin for the period 2014-2017, using statistical and geostatistical methods: linear regression (LR), random forest regression (RF), and regression kriging (RK), in addition to evaluate the use of altitude and other auxiliary variables (land surface temperature, latitude, and longitude). Cross-validation showed that RF performed better than LR as well as when using auxiliary variables compared to only the altitude (LR-altitude: RMSE=1.325 degrees C, P bias= -0.150%, r=0.775; LR-auxiliary variables: RMSE=1.265 degrees C, P bias=0.000% r=0.795; RF-altitude: RMSE=1.235 degrees C, P bias =0.200%, r=0.810; RF-auxiliary variables RMSE=1.205 degrees C, P bias =0.200%, r=0.820). The application of regression kriging was limited since less than 50% of the months had spatial autocorrelation in the regression model residuals. Nevertheless, in these months, regression kriging increased the estimation performance. The outcomes of this research work increase the understanding of the spatial distribution of monthly air temperature in the Paute river basin, which will improve hydrological modeling.

TI  - Non-native Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) promotes sentinel prey attack rates in Central European forests
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The increased utilization of non-native tree species in monocultures or tree mixtures has repeatedly been shown to have negative consequences for the abundance and biomass of natural enemies. However, it is often unknown whether these effects translate into lower top-down control, and if so, whether these effects are driven by tree diversity and identity or by factors not strictly attributed to tree identity (e.g. light conditions or vegetation structure).Here, we used model caterpillars to study the effect of non-native Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) on pest control in Central European forests. Model caterpillars were set at two strata (ground and herb layer) in 40 plots of five forest stand types. Monocultures of European beech (Fagus sylvatica), Douglas fir and Norway spruce (Picea abies) and two-species mixtures of European beech and each of the conifers were studied. We analyzed plot-level attack rates (total, arthropod, bird, and mammal attack rates) in relation to stand type, stand composition and microhabitat variability.Against expectations, stands with a higher proportion of Douglas fir had higher total and arthropod attack rates. However, this effect was lessened in stands with higher tree species diversity. Indirect effects of Douglas fir were stronger than direct tree identity and proportion effects, with both increased light availability and understory vegetation complexity promoting attack rates. Therefore, promoting vegetation complexity and light availability by thinning, or planting more open Douglas fir stands with a lower stem density could help to promote pest control in forest stands of non-native tree species.

TI  - Intraoperative laparoscopic detection of sentinel lymph nodes with indocyanine green and superparamagnetic iron oxide in a swine gallbladder cancer model
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) can enable less invasive surgery. However, mapping is challenging for cancers of difficult-to-access visceral organs, such as the gallbladder, because the standard method using radioisotopes (RIs) requires preoperative tracer injection. Indocyanine green (ICG) and superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) have also been used as alternative tracers. In this study, we modified a previously reported magnetic probe for laparoscopic use and evaluated the feasibility of detecting SLNs of the gallbladder using a laparoscopic dual tracer method by injecting ICG and SPIO into five swine and one cancer-bearing swine. The laparoscopic probe identified SPIO nanoparticles in the nodes of 4/5 swine in situ, the magnetic field counts were 2.5-15.9 mu T, and fluorescence was detected in SLNs in all five swine. ICG showed a visual lymph flow map, and SPIO more accurately identified each SLN with a measurable magnetic field quite similar to the RI. We then developed an advanced gallbladder cancer model with lymph node metastasis using recombination activating gene 2-knockout swine. We identified an SLN in the laparoscopic investigation, and the magnetic field count was 3.5 mu T. The SLN was histologically determined to be one of the two metastatic lymph nodes. In conclusion, detecting the SLNs of gallbladder cancer in situ using a dual tracer laparoscopic technique with ICG and SPIO was feasible in a swine model.

M3  - Article
AB  - On August 11, 2012, two successive strong earthquakes (Mw = 6.4 and 6.3) hit the East Azerbaijan Province, NW Iran at 12:23 and 12:34 UTC. This study investigated the variations of multi earthquakes precursors, (Land Surface Temperature (LST), Total Electron Content (TEC), Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR), and Air Temperature (AT) of non-seismic phenomena before and after the successive Ahar (Iran) earthquakes. In this study, we used the moving median method to detect the anomalies in TEC, whereas ?2? (95% confidence level) interval was used in MODIS LST and OLR analyses as an anomaly indicator. The results indicated that the MODIS Nighttime LST decreased by 5.5?6.3 ?C compared to the mean (LST) within 10?12 days before the earthquakes Then a dramatic increase was observed on August 02, 2012. The LST results were consistent with the results of OLR, where the anomaly was observed on July 29, 2012. In addition to LST and OLR, significant TEC anomalous disturbances (increase and decrease) occurred two weeks before the earthquakes started on 28th July and reached the highest value 3 days before the earthquakes. Furthermore, AT analysis also provided identical results with LST behaviors. These results were instructive for seismologists and represent the importance of the corresponding potential precursors for upcoming earthquakes.

M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial depiction of wheat and predicting yields are crucial for national food security measures. This study has employed multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data for spatial mapping of winter wheat and estimating its acreage in the Gorakhpur district. Results showed that the estimated acreage of winter wheat based on SAR data was 189,740 hectares. Accordingly, the yield and production were predicted as 3.9 tonnes/ha and 740,000 tonnes, respectively, using a polynomial model. VH polarisation was effective in acreage mapping compared to VV. Thereby, the developed framework could support policymakers by giving advanced estimates of area and yield.

AB  - Introduction: The advent of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to the sudden disruption of routine medical care, and the subsequent reorganization of hospital structures and therapeutic algorithms, aiming at protecting patients and health professionals. This was inevitably bound to affect our Breast Unit, dilating both pre- and post-operative times. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect on patients' flow of organizational and logistic changes (key interventions) based on lean thinking implemented after the COVID-19 outbreak.Materials and Methods: Clinical and demographic data were retrospectively collected from patients undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy for breast cancer at the Verona University Hospital from January 2018 to June 2020. Patients enrolled (n = 341) were divided into two groups according to date of admission: before (Group A; n = 294) and after (Group B; n = 47) the implementation of key interventions. Each case in Group B was subsequently matched 1:1 by means of case-control matching with cases from Group A for age, comorbidities, and type of surgery (Subgroup A1; N = 47). Pre-admission time (T0) and length of stay (T1) were compared between the three groups.Results: Median T0 was 312 h, whereas median T1 was 24 h. Patients in Group B had a higher frequency of comorbidities (57.4 vs. 25.2%, p = 0.001) and underwent mastectomy more often than patients in Group A (61.7 vs. 36.7%, p = 0.001). Both median T0 and T1 were higher in group B than in group A (384 vs. 300 h, p = 0.001, 48 vs. 24 h, p = 0.001, respectively). Median T0 and T1 did not significantly differ between Group B and Subgroup A1 (all p > 0.05).Conclusions: Lean thinking and new technologies could prove useful to the optimization of preoperative and postoperative times during the current pandemic, minimizing healthcare personnel and patients' exposure to SARS-CoV-2, and promoting a rational use of limited resources, while complying with oncological principles.

TI  - <i>Herschel</i> and <i>Odin</i> observations of H<sub>2</sub>O, CO, CH, CH<SUP>+</SUP>, and [NII] in the barred spiral galaxy NGC 1365 Bar-induced activity in the outer and inner circumnuclear tori
T2  - ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Context. The Odin satellite is now into its twentieth year of operation, much surpassing its design life of two years. One of its major astronomical pursuits was the search for and study of water vapor in diverse regions of the Solar System and the Milky Way galaxy. The Herschel space observatory was needed to detect water vapor in external galaxies.Aims. Our goal is to study the distribution and excitation of water vapor and other molecules in the barred spiral galaxy NGC 1365.Methods. Herschel has observed the central region of NGC 1365 in two positions, and both its SPIRE and PACS observations are available in the Herschel Science Archive. Herschel PACS images have been produced of the 70 and 160 mu m infrared emission from the whole galaxy, and also of the cold dust distribution as obtained from the ratio of the 160 to 70 mu m images. The Herschel SPIRE observations have been used to produce simultaneously observed maps of the 557 GHz o-H2O, 752 GHz p-H2O, 691 GHz CO(6-5), 1037 GHz CO(9-8), 537 GHz CH, 835 GHz CH', and the 1461 GHz [N IT] lines (efficiently probing the warm ionized medium) in the inner bar and circumnuclear torus region; - however, these observations have no effective velocity resolution. For this reason Odin has recently observed the 557 GHz ortho-H2O ground state line in the central region with high (5 km s(-1)) spectral resolution.Results. The emission and absorption of H2O at 557 GHz, with a velocity resolution of 5 km s(-1), has been marginally detected in NGC 1365 with Odin. The water vapor is predominantly located in a shocked 15 '' (1.3 kpc) region near some central compact radio sources and hot-spot HIT regions, close to the northeast component of the molecular torus surrounding the nucleus. An analysis of the H2O line intensities and velocities indicates that a shock-region is located here. This is corroborated by a statistical image deconvolution of our SEST CO(3-2) observations, yielding 5 '' resolution, and a study of our Very Large Array HI absorption observations, as well as comparisons with published interferometric CO observations. Additionally, an enticing 20 '' HI ridge is found to extend south-southeast from the nucleus, coinciding in position with the southern edge of an O III outflow cone, emanating from the nucleus. The molecular chemistry of the shocked central region of NGC 1365 is analyzed with special emphasis on the CO, H2O and CH, CH+ results.Conclusions. The dominating activity near the northeast (NE) torus component may have been triggered by the rapid bar-driven inflow into the circumnuclear torus causing cloud-cloud collisions and shocks, leading to the formation of stellar superclusters and, hence, also to more efficient PDR chemistry, which, here, may also benefit from cosmic ray focusing caused by the observed aligned magnetic field. The very high activity near the NE torus component may reflect the fact that the eastern bar-driven gas inflow into the NE region is much more massive than the corresponding western gas inflow into the southwest region. The H2O and CH+ emissions peak in the NE torus region, but the CO and CH emissions are more evenly distributed across the whole circumnuclear torus. The higher energy CO spectral line energy distribution (SLED) is nicely modeled by a low velocity (10 km s(-1)) shock, which may as well explain the required CH excitation and its high abundance in denser gas. The higher velocity (40 km s(-1)) shock required to model the H2O SLED in the NE torus region, paired with the intense UV radiation from the observed massive young stellar superclusters, may also explain the high abundance of CH+ in this region. The nuclear H I ridge may have been created by the action of outflow-driving X-ray photons colliding with ice-covered dust grains. A precessing nuclear engine, as is suggested by the tilted massive inner gas torus, may be necessary to explain the various nuclear outflows encountered.

TI  - Does the false-negative rate for 1 or 2 negative sentinel nodes after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy translate into a high local recurrence rate?
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Prospective trials demonstrate that sentinel node (SN) biopsy after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) has a significant false-negative rate (FNR) when only 1 or 2 SNs are removed. It is unknown whether this increased FNR correlates with an elevated risk of recurrence. Tumor Registry data at an NCI-Designated Comprehensive Cancer Center were reviewed from 2004 to 2018 for patients having a negative SN biopsy after NACT. Among 190 patients with histologically negative nodes after NACT having 1 (n = 42), 2 (n = 46), and >= 3 (n = 102) SNs, axillary recurrences occurred in 7.14%, 0%, and 1.96% (p = 0.09), breast recurrences occurred in 2.38%, 6.52%, and 0.98% (p = 0.12), and distance recurrences occurred in 16.67%, 8.70%, and 7.84% (p = 0.27), respectively. Time to first recurrence did not differ by SN count (p = 0.41). After adjustment for age, race, clinical stage, and receptor status, there were no differences in the rates of axillary (p = 0.26), breast (p = 0.44), or distance recurrence (p = 0.24) by numbers of SNs harvested. Median follow-up was 46.8 months. Despite higher post-NACT FNRs reported in randomized trials for patients having <3 sentinel nodes, recurrence rates were not significantly different for 1 versus 2 versus >= 3 SNs. This suggests that patients having 1 or 2 post-NACT SNs identified may not necessitate axillary dissection.

TI  - Doing things together: Development of cooperation through cultural participation
T2  - JOURNAL FOR THE THEORY OF SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR
M3  - Article
AB  - Cooperative behaviour paves our development and accompanies us in our daily activities. This article suggests a possible way of exploring cooperation from a cultural perspective under the process-relational worldview. Firstly, a theoretical framework is proposed that combines a process-relational worldview with a cultural perspective in psychology and an enactive approach to social cognition in collaborative research. Next, a pathway from comparative studies on cooperative behaviours to cultural approaches looking into what cooperation means and how it is expressed is presented on the basis of the research conducted so far. A critique of previous research has been undertaken, with a focus on their limitations. The aim is to show that the theoretical framework of an embodied, embedded and enactive approach in contemporary developmental sciences along with cultural psychology complement each other, expanding the scope for the study of the development of cooperative behaviours. Research proposals embedded in theoretical reasoning are presented with their scientific value emphasised.

TI  - Field Evaluations of Sulfuryl Fluoride Fumigation for Control of the Common Bed Bug (Hemiptera: Cimicidae), Using a 1.9x Dosage Factor in Motor Vehicles and Filled Cargo Trailers
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the efficacy of using Vikane gas fumigant (sulfuryl fluoride) at the 1.9x dosage rate for eliminating bed bugs (Cimex lectularius L.) in two challenging infestation situations: personal vehicles, and confined spaces densely packed with personal belongings. The vehicles used in this study were large minivans with seating that folded into the floor. The confined spaces were cargo trailers filled to 85% capacity with books, furniture, and other household items. Each van and trailer was equipped with similar to 90 sentinel bed bugs consisting of three groups of 9-11 bed bug eggs, 10 nymphs, and 10 adults. The Vikane Fumiguide calculator was used to determine the target dosage (g-h/m3) to apply in each replicate (e.g., one van or trailer). Sulfuryl fluoride concentrations were measured throughout the fumigation process using a Spectros SF-ReportIR. Concentration readings were input into the Fumiguide to determine when the accumulated dosage (g-h/m(3)) was achieved, and when aeration should be initiated. After aeration was complete, the sentinel bed bugs were removed from the replicates and bed bug nymph and adult mortality was recorded. Bed bug eggs were monitored for 23 d to determine latent mortality. Fumigated bed bug mortality for each replication was 100% regardless of life stage. Latent mortality was observed in a single bed bug egg, but the first instar never fully eclosed. This study determined that fumigation with sulfuryl fluoride at the 1.9x dosage factor is an effective method for eliminating resistant bed bugs from vehicles and personal belongings in densely packed situations.

TI  - Intercomparison of arctic XH<sub>2</sub>O observations from three ground-based Fourier transform infrared networks and application for satellite validation
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we compare column-averaged dry-air mole fractions of water vapor (XH2O) retrievals from the COllaborative Carbon Column Observing Network (COC-CON) with retrievals from two co-located high-resolution Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometers as references at two boreal sites, Kiruna, Sweden, and Sodankyla, Finland, from 6 March 2017 to 20 September 2019. In the framework of the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC), an FTIR spectrometer is operated at Kiruna. The H2O product derived from these observations has been generated with the MUlti-platform remote Sensing of Isotopologues for investigating the Cycle of Atmospheric water (MUSICA) processor. In Sodankyla, a Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) spectrometer is operated, and the official XH2O data as provided by TCCON are used for this study. The datasets are in good overall agreement, with COCCON data showing a wet bias of (49.20 +/- 58.61) ppm ((3.33 +/- 3.37) %, R-2 = 0.9992) compared with MUSICA NDACC and (56.32 +/- 45.63) ppm ((3.44 +/- 1.77) %, R-2 = 0.9997) compared with TCCON.Furthermore, the a priori H2O volume mixing ratio (VMR) profiles (MAP) used as a priori information in the TCCON retrievals (also adopted for COCCON retrievals) are evalu-ated with respect to radiosonde (Vaisala RS41) profiles at Sodankyla. The MAP and radiosonde profiles show similar shapes and a good linear correlation of integrated XH2O, indicating that MAP is a reasonable approximation of the true atmospheric state and an appropriate choice for the scaling retrieval methods as applied by COCCON and TCCON. COCCON shows a reduced dry bias (-14.96 %) in comparison with TCCON (-19.08 %) with respect to radiosonde XH2O.Finally, we investigate the quality of satellite data at high latitudes. For this purpose, the COCCON XH2O is compared with retrievals from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) generated with the MUSICA processor (MUSICA IASI) and with retrievals from the TRO-POspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). Both paired datasets generally show good agreement and similar correlations at the two sites. COCCON measures 4.64% less XH2O at Kiruna and 3.36% less at Sodankyla with respect to MUSICA IASI, whereas COCCON measures 9.71% more XH2O at Kiruna and 7.75% more at Sodankyla compared with TROPOMI.Our study supports the assumption that COCCON also delivers a well-characterized XH2O data product. This emphasizes that this approach might complement the TCCON network with respect to satellite validation efforts. This is the first published study where COCCON XH2O has been compared with MUSICA NDACC and TCCON retrievals and has been used for MUSICA IASI and TROPOMI validation.

TI  - Rhabdomyolysis related to acute recreational drug toxicity-A Euro-DEN study
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThis study was conducted to retrospectively assess the relationships between: rhabdomyolysis (quantified by creatine kinase (CK) activity) and kidney injury (quantified by serum creatinine concentration), sex, age, body temperature on admission, presence of seizures, and agitation or aggression in patients presenting to the Emergency Department with acute recreational drug toxicity. We also investigated the association with the substances ingested.MethodsAll presentations to the 16 sentinel Euro-DEN centres in 10 European countries with acute recreational drug toxicity during the first year of the Euro-DEN study (October 2013 to September 2014) were considered. Cases that had abnormal CK activity recorded as part of routine clinical care were divided into 3 cohorts depending on peak CK activity. Cases with normal CK activity were included as a control group (4(th) cohort).ResultsOnly 1,015 (18.4%) of the 5,529 Euro-DEN presentations had CK activity concentration recorded. Of this group 353 (34.8%) had also creatinine concentration measured. There were 375 (36.9%) with minor rhabdomyolysis, 69 (6.8%) with moderate rhabdomyolysis, and 24 (2.4%) with severe rhabdomyolysis; 547 (53.9%) were included in the control group. There was a positive correlation between CK activity and creatinine concentration (correlation coefficient r = 0.71, p<0.0001). There was no correlation between CK activity and body temperature at the time of presentation to the ED (correlation coefficient r = 0.07, p = 0.03). There was a positive correlation between CK activity and length of stay in the hospital (r = 0.31, p<0.001). There was no association between CK activity and the presence of seizures (p = 0.33) or agitation/aggression (p = 0.45), patients age (p = 0.4) or sex (p = 0.25). The 5 most common agents amongst patients presenting with rhabdomyolysis were: cocaine (n = 107; 22.9% presentations), amphetamine (76; 16.2%), cannabis (74; 15.8%), GHB/GBL (72; 15.4%) and heroin (67; 14.3%). The distribution of rhabdomyolysis in 5 most common drugs was (drug; patients with rhabdomyolysis, patients without rhabdomyolysis): cocaine (107, 122), cannabis (74, 117), GHB/GBL (72, 81), amphetamine (76, 66), heroin (67, 70).ConclusionsAbnormal values of CK activity occurred in almost half (46.1%) of presentations to the Emergency Department with acute recreational drug toxicity in whom CK activity was measured; however, severe rhabdomyolysis is seen in only a small minority (2.4%). Those with rhabdomyolysis are at significantly higher risk of kidney injury and have a longer length of hospital stay.

TI  - Assessment of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> anti-malarial drug resistance markers in <i>pfk13</i>-propeller, <i>pfcrt</i> and <i>pfmdr1</i> genes in isolates from treatment failure patients in Democratic Republic of Congo, 2018-2019
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The national policy for malaria treatment of the Democratic Republic of Congo recommends two first-line artemisinin-based combinations for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria: artesunate-amodiaquine and artemether-lumefantrine. This study investigated the presence of markers associated with resistance to the current first-line artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) in isolates of Plasmodium falciparum from treatment failure patients in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Methods From November 2018 to November 2019, dried blood spots were taken from patients returning to health centres for fever within 28 days after an initial malaria treatment in six sentinel sites of the National Malaria Control Programme across Democratic Republic of Congo. The new episode of malaria was first detected by a rapid diagnostic test and then confirmed by a real-time PCR assay to define treatment failure. Fragments of interest in pfk13 and pfcrt genes were amplified by conventional PCR before sequencing and the Pfmdr1 gene copy number was determined by a TaqMan real-time PCR assay. Results Out of 474 enrolled patients, 364 (76.8%) were confirmed positive by PCR for a new episode of P. falciparum malaria, thus considered as treatment failure. Of the 325 P. falciparum isolates obtained from 364 P. falciparum-positive patients and successfully sequenced in the pfk13-propeller gene, 7 (2.2%) isolates carried non-synonymous mutations, among which 3 have been previously reported (N498I, N554K and A557S) and 4 had not yet been reported (F506L, E507V, D516E and G538S). Of the 335 isolates successfully sequenced in the pfcrt gene, 139 (41.5%) harboured the K76T mutation known to be associated with chloroquine resistance. The SVMNT haplotype associated with resistance to amodiaquine was not found. None of the isolates carried an increased copy number of the pfmdr1 gene among the 322 P. falciparum isolates successfully analysed. Conclusion No molecular markers currently known to be associated with resistance to the first-line ACT in use were detected in isolates of P. falciparum from treatment failure patients. Regular monitoring through in vivo drug efficacy and molecular studies must continue to ensure the effectiveness of malaria treatment in Democratic Republic of Congo.

TI  - Flash flood susceptibility assessment using the parameters of drainage basin morphometry in SE Bangladesh
T2  - QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Predicting the occurrence and spatial patterns of rainfall induced flash floods is still a challenge. Instant genesis and typically smaller areal coverage of the flash floods are the major impediments to their forecasting. Analysis of the morphometric parameters provides useful insight on hydrological response of the drainage basins to high intensity rainfall events. This information is valuable for understanding the flash flood potential of the drainage basins and for evading the destructions caused by the hazard. Here, we use eighteen morphometric parameters that influence the runoff volume, flow velocity, and inundation depth scenario of a flash flood. The analysis has been carried out for simulating the relative flash flood susceptibility of thirteen watersheds (B1 to B13) of variable sizes in southeastern Bangladesh. The morphometric parameters were derived from Digital Elevation Model (DEM) using Geographic Information System (GIS). The evaluated basin parameters include: area (A), perimeter (P), length (Lb), stream order (Su), stream number (Nu), stream length (Lu), stream frequency (Fs), drainage density (Dd), texture ratio (Rt), bifurcation ratio (Rb), basin relief (Hr), relief ratio (Rr), ruggedness number (Rn), time of concentration (Tc), infiltration number (If), and form factor (F). Two relative flash flood susceptibility scenarios were generated: (i) general watershed level, and (ii) more precise pixel level status. The watershed level comparison reveals that B4 and B6 watersheds constituting 72.61% of the total area are ?very high? susceptible, whereas the susceptibility of the other watersheds has been found as ?high? [B5 (6.95%)], ?moderate? [B8 and B13 (8.63%)], ?low? [B2, B10, B11 (4.64%)], and ?very low? [B1, B3, B7, B9, and B12 (7.18%)]. The derived watershed susceptibility map was subsequently integrated with two spatial analysis algorithms i.e., topographic wetness index (TWI) and topographic position index (TPI) through overlay analysis. The integration helped to understand the combined role of the general watershed morphometry and the in situ topography for determining the flash flood susceptibility of each spot (30 m ? 30 m) within all the selected watersheds. The quantitative analysis and characterization of the watersheds from the perspective of flash flood hazard in this investigation is expected to be useful for implementing the site-specific mitigation measures and alleviating the effects of the hydrological hazard in the study area.

TI  - A novel approach for global solar irradiation forecasting on tilted plane using Hybrid Evolutionary Neural Networks
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - An efficient management of solar power systems requires direct and continuous predictions of global irradiation received on inclined planes. This paper proposes a new approach that simultaneously estimates and forecasts inclined solar irradiation. The method is based on a multi-task Hybrid Evolutionary Neural Network with two output neurons: one estimates the irradiation at the current instant and another predicts it for the next hour. An Evolutionary Algorithm is used to learn the most proper topology (number of neurons and connections). Two studies are carried out to evaluate the performance of the method, considering experimental ground data for the same inclination angle and satellite data with different tilt angles. The data only contain one measured variable, what improves its applicability to other sites. The potential of three different basis functions in the hidden layer is compared (Sigmoidal Units, Radial Basis Functions and Product Units), concluding that the results achieved by Sigmoidal Units are better. Single and multi-task models are also compared with a statistical analysis, which shows no significant differences. However, the proposed multi-task option is much simpler and computationally efficient than individual models. The problem tackled is more complex and challenging than previous works, due to inclined solar irradiation is predicted based on the horizontal irradiation and also because the model simultaneously estimates and predicts irradiation. However, the performance obtained is excellent compared to the literature. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Signatures of late Quaternary land-sea interactions and landform dynamics along southern Kerala coast, SW India
T2  - QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Kerala coast displays a spectrum of varied geomorphic features that are evolved as a function of Late Quaternary land-sea interaction. The southern Kerala coast, south of Achankovil Shear Zone (ASZ) has been characterised by cliffed coast with entrenched estuarine basins, pocket beaches, promontories, older and younger strand plains, etc., that are evolved as a result of the transgressive-regressive phases to which the coast has been subjected during the late Quaternary Period. In spite of having varied geomorphic features, lacuna in comprehending the evolutionary phases of the coastal landform features is the primary impediment that bolstered us to unravel the Late Quaternary land-sea interactions and landform changes of the coast between Thottapally and Vizhinjam. Moreover, the last two centuries are known to have been witnessing many natural as well as human induced environmental perturbations in the area.The present study attempts to reconstruct t he late Quaternary landform dynamics based on the satellite data while the last century changes were extracted from the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS). The evidences based on geomorphic variations suggest that the present study area hosts two distinct paleo-coastlines ? 1) coincides with the eastern boundary of the older strand plains (accreted during Late Pleistocene) and, 2) marks the boundary between older and younger strand plains (accreted during Early?Middle Holocene). A sector-wise analysis reveals that the northern half of the study area is characterised by many coast perpendicular estuarine basins with well-developed Bay Head Deltas in its fluvial end, and Flood Tide Islands near the estuarine mouth. On the contrary, the southern half is characterised by pocket beaches and coast parallel backwater bodies developed during the regressive phases of the sea. A high-resolution study of the shoreline changes during the period, 1920?2018 reveals that the younger strandlines are vulnerable to severe coastal erosion and shoreline retreat at many places compared to coastal accretion. The study stresses the imminent need for continuous monitoring and implementation of site-specific mitigation measures for the conservation and management of this coast known for its outstanding natural beauty and strategic beach placer deposits.

TI  - Fire in the Atlantic Rainforest: an analysis of 20 years of fire foci distribution and their social-ecological drivers
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Atlantic Rainforest biome, where fire events were originally less frequent, is now increasingly at risk of burning due to anthropogenic influences on the climate and landscape. Identifying fire patterns and their leading causes in tropical forests is essential to improve prevention and fire management. We applied a filtering algorithm to remove redundant heat signals from the National Institute for Space Research (INPE) fire foci database, generate fire density maps after validating the data, and build Random forest (RF) regression models to identify fire risk and the variables that best explain the fire patterns. Results showed high redundancy of heat signals and that the minimum detection size for fire scars was lower for forests than other land covers. Mean annual temperature higher than 22oC was associated with a high risk of fire and tree cover greater than 80% with low fire risk. Our study reveals a fire pattern that can expose the last remnants of the Atlantic Rainforest in Rio de Janeiro to fire, including inside Protected Areas.

TI  - Measurement and Modelling of Particulate Pollution over Kashmir Himalaya, India
T2  - WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground and satellite measurements of particulate pollution play an important role in determining the particulate pollutant-Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) relationship. The daily observed PM10 and PM2.5 concentration varied from 11-757 mu g/m(3) and 8-630 mu g/m(3) with the mean concentrations of 137 +/- 119 mu g/m(3) and 86 +/- 90 mu g/m(3), respectively. The long-term mean annual PM10 and PM2.5 levels are several times higher than the WHO permissible limits. The 1377 satellite-derived AOD observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer, ground-based particulate matter (PM) and meteorological observations from 2013-2017 were analysed to develop two-variate linear model (TVM) (AOD versus PM10 or PM2.5) and multi-variate regression models (MVMs) (AOD + meteorological parameters versus PM10 or PM2.5) for estimation of the ground level PM10 and PM2.5 in the Kashmir Himalaya, India. The model evaluation showed that the PM predication estimates are significant at 99% confidence level for all the models. The TVM predicts daily PM10 concentration better than PM2.5 explaining 82% and 74% variance in the observed data, respectively. By adding meteorological data to the regression analysis, there is an improvement of 5% and 11% in R-2 for PM10 and PM2.5 estimates which inter alia reduced the RMSE by 11.8% and 20.47%, respectively. Estimation of the particulate pollution, utilising satellite-based AOD, observed PM and meteorology, would encourage satellite-based air quality monitoring in the data-scarce Himalaya. However, it is suggested that more studies are required to improve the operational prediction of PM pollution by incorporating satellite observations of other pollutants, and processes in the model using advanced approaches.

TI  - Remote sensing of wildlife connectivity networks and priority locations for conservation in the Southern Agricultural Growth Corridor (SAGCOT) in Tanzania
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Land conversion is causing habitat loss and fragmentation worldwide, particularly in Africa, where the proliferation of agricultural development corridors may threaten vital areas for ecological connectivity and wildlife survival. To conserve connectivity, careful landscape planning is necessary, which strongly relies on remotely sensed land cover maps. Here, we present a remote sensing-based framework that efficiently identifies priority locations for connectivity conservation. We applied the framework in the Kilombero catchment and development cluster of the Southern Agricultural Growth Corridor (SAGCOT) in Tanzania, where new agricultural development projects could act as barriers for connectivity. Using satellite imagery from Sentinel-1 and 2, we mapped the mixture of mountain and lowland land covers and habitats with an overall accuracy of 75%. Then, we assessed ecological connectivity to predict African elephant corridors and prioritize them in two ways. First, we identified elephant corridors that contribute the most to current landscape connectivity, and second, we identified those whose restoration would significantly enhance landscape functionality and improve the current connectivity level. We mapped 214 potential elephant corridors, identified 43 of them as priority for conservation, and 43 as target for restoration. Our model predicted four already known corridor areas in and around the Kilombero valley floodplain, and other important corridors not yet identified by previous studies in the south of the basin. Priority elephant corridors inside the floodplain showed narrow widths and low permeability, indicating low functionality in the connectivity network. Nevertheless, the abundance of priority corridors for restoration suggests that connectivity could be recovered if the recommended measures are applied during SAGCOT planning and implementation process. Our findings demonstrate the possibilities of combining multispectral and radar data for guiding biodiversity management in development corridors and for assessing ecological connectivity worldwide.

TI  - Structured yet simple approaches to primary care data quality improvements can indeed strike gold
T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF PRIMARY HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - General practice data provide important opportunities for both population health and within-practice initiatives to improve health. Despite its promise, a lack of accuracy affects the use of such data. The Sentinel Practices Data Sourcing (SPDS) project is a structured chronic disease surveillance and data quality improvement strategy in general practice. A mixed-methods approach was used to evaluate data quality improvement in 99 participating practices over 12 months. Quantitative data were obtained by measuring performance against 10 defined indicators, whereas 48 semi-structured interviews provided qualitative data. Aggregated scores demonstrated improvements in all indicators, ranging from minor to substantially significant improvements. Participants reported positively on levels of support provided, and acquisition of new knowledge and skills relating to data entry and cleansing. This evaluation provides evidence of the effectiveness of a structured approach to improve the quality of primary care data. Investing in this targeted intervention has the potential to create sustained improvements in data quality, which can drive clinical practice improvement.

TI  - Assessing the impact of land use land cover changes on land surface temperature over Pune city, India
T2  - QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The intensification of land surface temperature (LST) is a consequence of changes in land use land cover (LULC). Variation of LST and LULC can be extracted from satellite images in different spatial and temporal resolutions. Thus, in the present study, we have used remote sensing and GIS techniques to quantify the land surface temperature variation over different land use land cover classes from 1990 to 2019 using Landsat data in Pune city. Furthermore, the effect of LULC changes on seasonal land surface temperature modification over the urbanized area is also assessed in this study. The result suggests an overall increase of built-up area from 116.6 km(2) in 1990 to 166.9 km(2) in 2019, witnessing a 43.1% rise during the study period, while the other LULC classes show a decreasing trend, most significantly by agriculture (40.8%) followed by scrubland (37.1%), fallow land (22%), water body (11.1%) and vegetation (2.8%). The 2009-2019 decade was found to be most significant in terms of change in LULC aerial extent over the city as compared to the other two decades (1990-1999 and 1999-2009). The overall mean land surface temperature over the city shows an increasing trend during the summer season (5.8%) and decreasing in the winter season (12.4%) from 1990 to 2019. The change in mean LST over different LULC classes shows a significant increasing and positive trend during the summer season as compared to the negative and decreasing trend of the winter season. The mean LST over agriculture, shrub land, water body, and fallow land shows an increasing trend as compared to the built-up area during both summer and winter season from 1990 to 2019. Furthermore, the study also confirms a higher LST over the surrounding rural area by 1.4 degrees C, as compared to the city urban area, which suggests the occurrence of the urban cool island over the city. The results of the present study will be very helpful for an urban planner and policymakers to evaluate the current urbanization status and improve their decisions to make cities better and sustaining in the future.

TI  - A long-term seasonal analysis on the relationship between LST and NDBI using Landsat data
T2  - QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization is necessary for the worldwide rapidly growing population to achieve a better living standard. Change of land surface feature is the key consequence of urbanization and it promotes a rise of land surface temperature (LST). The present article analyzes the seasonal variability of LST-normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) relationship on various land surface in Raipur City of India by collecting sixty-four Landsat images of four specific seasons from 1991?92, 1995?96, 1999?00, 2004?05, 2009?10, 2014?15, and 2018?19. Land surface composition and seasonal difference noticeably affect the LST distribution and LST-NDBI correlation. The LST always builds positive correlation with NDBI. The post-monsoon season indicates the strongest (0.72) LSTNDBI correlation, followed by the monsoon (0.69), pre-monsoon (0.67), and winter (0.57). The LST-NDBI correlation is strong on green vegetation; strong to moderate on built-up and open land; and moderate on water bodies. This research work recommends that the environmentalists and urban planners should consider the remaining open spaces for a better ecological condition.

TI  - High spatial resolution mapping identifies habitat characteristics of the invasive vine <i>Antigonon leptopus</i> on St. Eustatius (Lesser Antilles)
T2  - BIOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - On the Caribbean island of St. Eustatius, Coralita (Antigonon leptopus) is an aggressive invasive vine posing major biodiversity conservation concerns. The generation of distribution maps can address these conservation concerns by helping to elucidate the drivers of invasion. We test the use of support vector machines to map the distribution of Coralita on St. Eustatius at high spatial resolution and use this map to identify potential landscape and geomorphological factors associated with Coralita presence. This latter step was performed by comparing the actual distribution of Coralita patches to a random distribution of patches. To train the support vector machine algorithm, we used three vegetation indices and seven texture metrics derived from a 2014 WorldView-2 image. The resulting map shows that Coralita covered 3.18% of the island in 2014, corresponding to an area of 64 ha. The mapped distribution was highly accurate, with 93.2% overall accuracy (Coralita class producer's accuracy: 76.4%, user's accuracy: 86.2%). Using this classification map, we found that Coralita is not randomly distributed across the landscape, occurring significantly closer to roads and drainage channels, in areas with higher accumulated moisture, and on flatter slopes. Coralita was found more often than expected in grasslands, disturbed forest, and urban areas but was relatively rare in natural forest. These results highlight the ability of high spatial resolution data from sensors such as WorldView-2 to produce accurate invasive species, providing valuable information for predicting current and future spread risks and for early detection and removal plans.in Dutch is available with online material.

TI  - Effect of Body Size on Methylmercury Concentrations in Shoreline Spiders: Implications for Their Use as Sentinels
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Shoreline spiders have been proposed as sentinels to monitor aquatic contaminants including methylmercury (MeHg). The present study examined the effect of spider body size on MeHg concentrations in shoreline spiders. We collected 6 taxa of spiders belonging to 4 families (orb-weavers [Araneidae], long-jawed orb weavers [Tetragnathidae: Tetragnatha sp.], jumping spiders [Salticidae], and wolf spiders [Lycosidae: Pardosa sp., Rabidosa sp., and Schizocosa sp.]) from the shorelines of 14 human-made ponds at the Lyndon B. Johnson National Grasslands in north Texas (USA). As a proxy for body size, we measured leg length (tibia + patella) of each spider. Spider taxa differed by 3-fold in mean MeHg concentration, and MeHg concentrations in 4 of 6 spider taxa increased significantly with leg length. The present study is the first to demonstrate that shoreline spider MeHg concentrations increase as a function of spider body size. Because spider size may account for some within-taxa variation in MeHg concentrations, future studies that utilize spiders as sentinels of aquatic contamination by MeHg or other biomagnifying contaminants should take spider size into account.

TI  - Mud Dauber Nests as Sources of Spiders in Mercury Monitoring Studies
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying ecosystems where biota may be contaminated with hazardous levels of methylmercury (MeHg) is a challenge. One widely used approach for determining site-specific MeHg contamination is to monitor MeHg contamination in sentinel species. Terrestrial shoreline spiders that consume emergent aquatic insects (e.g., midges and mayflies) have been proposed as sentinels of MeHg contamination of aquatic ecosystems. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether a novel sampling technique, collection of spiders from nests of mud dauber wasps (Sphecidae), would be an efficient method for capturing MeHg-contaminated shoreline spiders for use as sentinels in ecological risk assessments. Mud dauber nests were collected near the Clear Fork of the Trinity River in Fort Worth, Texas (USA) on 3 dates from 4 human-made structures. Nests contained 627 unconsumed spiders from 5 families: Araneidae, Salticidae, Thomisidae, Oxyopidae, and Theridiidae. Methylmercury concentrations ranged from 12.2 to 56.3 ng/g wet weight in Thomisidae and Araenidae, respectively. Methylmercury concentrations of the spiders were generally low relative to risk thresholds for adult birds, but a few families of spiders could pose a risk to nestlings. Although mud dauber nests have been recognized as a source of spiders for biodiversity studies, the present study is the first to demonstrate the potential use of spiders collected from mud dauber nests for ecotoxicology studies.

TI  - Upward shifts in elevational limits of forest and grassland for Mexican volcanoes over three decades
T2  - BIOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Global climates have been warming over the past four decades, with many implications and effects on species and natural communities, in terms of shifts in geographic and elevational ranges. Nonetheless, major knowledge gaps exist, particularly for tropical regions, as regards the timescale and rate of range shifts. We used Landsat imagery to characterize the upper limits of forest and of bunch grassland on the 15 highest (>3500 m) volcanoes of central Mexico over three decades (1986-2018), and documented upward vegetation shifts averaging >490 m in elevation over this period. Treelines showed upward shifts averaging 17.3 m/year over 1986-2018; for one eastern Mexican volcano (Sierra Negra), the NDVI-based rate (35.7 m/year) contrasts dramatically with a rate of 4.5 m/year measured over the preceding century for that volcano based on comparisons of photographs. These upward elevational shifts imply areal reductions for high-elevation habitats, and particularly for the bunch grassland that is the focus of considerable local endemism.in Spanish is available with online material.

TI  - Balancing livelihood enhancement and ecosystem conservation in seaweed farmed areas: A case study from Gulf of Mannar Biosphere Reserve, India
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Kappaphycus alvarezii, a red seaweed cultured in tropical waters for extraction of carrageenan, is widely considered a bioinvader of coral reefs. In India, this seaweed is cultivated in Palk Bay, South India by the coastal community amidst the concern of its invasion in the sub-tidal reef regions of adjoining Gulf of Mannar Marine National Park (GoMMNP). The current study was undertaken to assess the extent of coral reefs in Pak Bay and Gulf of Mannar (GoM) affected by this red alga and evaluate the possible causes for its spread in GoM including the long-term commercial seaweed cultivation in Palk Bay. The study was carried out in Palk Bay and 19 emergent and two submerged Islands of GoM. Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) satellite images were used to map the spatial cover of the alga over the reef. The reef zones with K. alvarezii were mapped using GIS. The study showed that K. alvarezii has not spread over the coral reefs in Palk Bay, a region where the cultivation is underway for over ten years. Nevertheless, the algae had spread in some of the islands in Gulf of Mannar region viz., Shingle (1.1 ha; 2.12% of reef area), Krusadai (0.572 ha; 0.35% of reef area) and Mulli Islands (0.00025 ha; 0.00022% of reef area). The temporal change in the extent of live corals (between 2002 and 2014) in Palk Bay and GoM corroborated a possible phase shift i.e., from a coral dominated reef to an algal dominated reef, with Halimeda spp., Caulerpa spp. and Ulva reticulata being the dominant macro-algae. Based on a critical analysis of the sources of fragments for the spread of the alga in GoM and the factors that aid in their dispersion, we conclude that K. alvarezii farming activities in Palk Bay are not the primary source for the broken fragments, responsible for the spread of the alga in GoM. However, considering the potential risks of unintended transfer of farmed algae into the sensitive ecosystems, the study calls for evolving codes for cultivation of seaweeds so as to leave least ecological footprints over the coastal ecologically sensitive ecosystems like coral reefs.

TI  - Spatio-temporal fluctuations over Chorabari glacier, Garhwal Himalaya, India between 1976 and 2017
T2  - QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The current research work deals with the health of Chorabari glacier between 1976 and 2017, using multi spectral and multi dated satellite data series of LANDSAT (MSS, TM, and ETM+) and RESOURCESAT II (LISS IV). Result closely reveals that the studied glacier receding continuously with inconsistent rate for the last 41 years and rate of receding dominates significantly after 2012. It lost similar to 306.43 +/- 61 m total length (7.46 +/- 1.48 m a(-1)); 0.074 km(2) frontal area (0.0018 km(2) a(-1)); 0.31 km(2) (24%) glaciated area (0.007 km(2) a(-1)); 0.015 km(3) (32.60%) glaciated volume. The upward migration of SLA (Snow Line Altitude) from 5265 m to 5290 m also suggests that the melting process were prevailing during the study tenure. An existence of supra glacial lakes and its successive growth over the surface of Chorabari glacier further justifies that the temperature of the surroundings has increased significantly and influences the melting process as well. The melting process between 1976 and 1990 of the studied glacier directly influenced by the frequent episodes of precipitation and temperature anomalies of central Himalayan region during 1960-1990. While the melting process after 1990 is directly influenced by the increase in average mean temperature and decrease in average mean precipitation of Garhwal Himalayan region. The tree ring data of Garhwal Himalaya region also well matches the precipitation data of IMD (Indian Meteorological Department). The overall analysis explains that the Chorabari glacier is retreating continuously since 1976.

TI  - Recessional pattern of Thelu and Swetvarn glaciers between 1968 and 2019, Bhagirathi basin, Garhwal Himalaya, India
T2  - QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assesses the temporal changes of Swetvarn and Thelu glaciers between 1968 and 2019 in Rakvarn glacial valley of Bhagirathi basin. Here we utilized high-resolution satellite images of CORONA KHA (1968), LISS IV (2012) and SENTINEL-2 MSI (2019), along with medium resolution images of LANDSAT TM (1990) and SRTM (2000) to carry out the research work. Analytical viewed strongly convinced that the selected glaciers receding continuously with non homogeneous retreat rate since 1968. During 1968 to 2019 the snout of the Swetvarn glacier lost similar to 623m total length with 12.21ma(-1) retreat rate, while the snout of Thelu glacier lost similar to 590m total length (11.56ma(-1)). Results further confirmed that about 16.60% glaciated area of Swetvarn glacier and 24.50% glaciated area of Thelu glacier also vanished completely between 1968 and 2019. During this tenure the ablation zone also shows 160m upward shift for Swetvarn glacier and 145m for Thelu glacier respectively. Overall analysis explains that three climatic trends of Garhwal Himalayan region; (1) catastrophic variation between rainfall and temperature during 1960-1990, (2) gradual increase in temperature and decrease in precipitation, (3) increased liquid precipitation and decreased solid precipitation highly influences the process of melting of the study region.

TI  - Glacier changes and associated climate drivers for the last three decades, Nanda Devi region, Central Himalaya, India
T2  - QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The glaciers are considered as iconic indicators of climate change, and receding at differential rates worldwide. Variable retreat rates of glacier termini and inadequate supporting field data (e.g. mass balance, ice thickness, velocity, etc.) of the glaciers makes it difficult to access the impact of climate change. Here, we examined eight glaciers in the upper Rishi Ganga catchment, Nanda Devi region, Central Himalaya, India, to assess their spatial and temporal variability towards the climate change. The temporal coverage of analysis spans from twentieth to early twenty-first centuries (ranges 1980 to 2017). The study was designed by comparing the estimates of different temporal satellite images of the Hexagon KH-9 (1980) with Landsat 5 TM (1989), Landsat 7 ETM+ (1999), Landsat 8 OLI/TRIS (2017) and ASTER DEM (2011) with local and regional meteorological conditions of the study area. The upper Rishi Ganga catchment covers an area of similar to 690 km(2), having a glaciated area of similar to 243 km(2) (similar to 35% of the total area) during 1980. Our study reveals that the glaciers of the valley lost similar to 26 km(2) (10%) of the glaciated area between 1980 and 2017. The total glacierized area in 2017 is similar to 217 km(2), which is similar to 26% of the total area. However, during the same periods (1980-2017) the Equilibrium Line Altitude (ELA) of the glaciers fluctuated between 5200 and 5700 m asl. The present study suggests that the glaciers in the region have responded to deprived precipitation conditions since 1980, overlapping our understanding of glacier retreat due to temperature increase, in the context of the global warming scenario.

TI  - Estimation of active surface deformation in the eastern Kachchh region, western India: Application of multi -sensor DInSAR technique
T2  - QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The focus of the present study is to estimate the active surface deformation/displacement affecting the landscape of the eastern Kachchh basin with a particular emphasis on the Wagad, Khadir Island, Bela Island, Chorar Island, and adjoining regions by implementing Differential Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) technique using ENVISAT and SENTINEL-1A radar imagery. To evaluate the deformation pattern using DInSAR, we used ENVISAT-ASAR 2003 to 2005 and 2006 to 2009 data products and SENTINEL-1A data set of 2018?2020. The cumulative displacement of 0.2?0.3 cm for the period of 2003?2005 and 0.19?0.22 cm for the period of 2006?2009 has been observed for the South Wagad Fault region. Similarly, the results acquired from SENTINEL-1A data set revealed a cumulative displacement of 0.16?0.18 cm for the period of 2018?2020. The Island Belt Fault zone shows 0.27 cm displacement, while it is 0.10?0.17 cm for the Gedi Fault zone. The rate of deformation estimated from the present study is well corroborated with the existing results of GPS driven uplift rates. The combined results of DInSAR and GPS indicate that the northern part of the Wagad region is deforming much faster than the south Wagad region. The displacement detected to the east of the epicentral zone of the 2001 Bhuj earthquake indicates the presence of a zone of weaker structures, which may trigger a large magnitude earth-quake in the future. Our estimated results of the short-term ground displacement are well corroborated with the existing geological information. This ground displacement is attributed to the tectonic subsidence towards the eastern part of the South Wagad Fault region and within the wide zone of the Island Belt Fault and Gedi Fault zones. The areas with a high amount of displacement have experienced continuous seismicity during the last two decades in the Eastern Kachchh region and might encounter moderate to high seismicity in the near future. The results also provide a better understanding of the active surface deformation pattern taking place in the seis-mically sensitive eastern Kachchh region.

TI  - Exploring the Variations of Redbed Badlands and Their Driving Forces in the Nanxiong Basin, Southern China: A Geographically Weighted Regression with Gridded Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - At present, most of the international research cases on badlands are based on semiarid regions, while there are few studies on badlands in humid regions. Therefore, the research on badlands in humid regions has strong theoretical and practical significance. By taking the Nanxiong Basin, which is located in the humid regions of southern China as the research object, this paper analyzes the scale and spatial distribution variation characteristics of redbed badlands and builds a set of factors that influence redbed badlands to explore the driving forces influencing the variation of redbed badlands based on remote sensing images of the American KH-4A satellite from 1969 and a Landsat 8 image from 2017. The result shows that the scale of redbed badlands in the Nanxiong Basin had generally decreased from 1969 to 2017. The area of redbed badlands decreased from 1693.97 hm(2) in 1969 to 127.4 hm(2) in 2017, with a decrease of 92.48%. The spatial distribution of redbed badlands had gradually changed from the contiguous planar distribution form in 1969 to the dispersed island distribution form in 2017, forming four agglomerations. The influence degree of the driving forces for the scale variation of redbed badlands is in the order of lithology > road > aspect > residential locations > slope > water system > vegetation > garden plots. Among these driving forces, except vegetation and garden plots, which have a negative correlation with the variation of redbed badlands, other factors have a positive correlation. Lithology is positively correlated with the variation of redbed badlands and has the strongest influence on the redbed badlands of all the influencing factors. The road factor is second to the lithological factor; the more accessible an area is, the stronger the human influence will be and the more serious the damage to vegetation will be, which easily cause surface vegetation damage, induce land degradation, and form redbed badlands.

TI  - Glacial geomorphology and recent glacial recession of the Harmukh Range, NW Himalaya
T2  - QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - A comprehensive description of the glaciation and glacial geomorphology of the Harmukh range, northwest Himalaya is reported first time in this study. The geomorphic system of the range is dominated by glaciation and provides an excellent opportunity to assess the glacial fluctuations from the Late Quaternary to the present. Using a time series of the satellite data from 1992 to 2018, the glacier area, snout and equilibrium line altitude (ELA) changes of the existing glaciers in the Harmukh Range were estimated. The glacier cover has receded from 7.47 +/- 0.58 km(2) in 1992 to 6.24 +/- 0.62 km(2) in 2018, a deglaciation of 16.46 +/- 0.24%. The glaciers showed an upward shift in ELA from 47 m to 80 m during the last two and a half decade. The observations revealed that, other than the climatic factors, the ELA change and glacier recessions are influenced by the glacier size, mean altitude, and the aspect of the glaciers. Further, the high-resolution Google Earth images, supplemented by field observations, were used for mapping various glacial-geomorphic landforms. The nature of glacial grooves, overdeepenings, the height of the lateral moraine deposits and trimlines indicated appreciable thickness of the former glaciers. The pattern of the glaciated valleys revealed that the area has predominantly experienced alpine type of glaciation with most of the glaciers centred on the Harmukh peak. Based on the shape and the number of lateral moraine ridges present, it is suggested that the area has witnessed three major glacial advances. By tracing the outer limits of the glacial valleys, moraine boulders, and ice scoured terrain, it was estimated that the glaciers in the range covered 629 km(2) during the glacial maxima. The presence of numerous rock glaciers and debris-free cirque glaciers on the north-eastern slopes of the range indicated a strong climatic and topographical control on the pattern, situation and extent of glaciers. However, there is a need for detailed field-based mapping of the glacial-geomorphology and geochronological study in order to better understand the nature and extent of paleoglaciation, the observed glacier recession and the past climatic variations in this hitherto understudied glaciated region of the Kashmir Himalaya.

TI  - Monitoring of land subsidence due to excessive groundwater extraction using small baseline subset technique in Konya, Turkey
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Konya, which is located within the Konya Closed Basin, is the most important agricultural production region in Turkey. The future of agriculture is threatened in this region due to the decline in groundwater levels and the intensive agricultural activities that require high water consumption and are not suitable to the climate conditions of the region. In addition to these parameters, the geological structure of Konya also poses various environmental problems such as land subsidence and sinkhole formation. This study aimed to investigate the causes of the land subsidence problem in Konya and its surroundings with the help of the interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technique and auxiliary data, namely optic, Coordination of Information on the Environment (CORINE), and groundwater monitoring station data. In order to investigate the land subsidence in the study area, 58 Sentinel-1A images acquired between 2014 and 2018 were processed by using the small baseline subset (SBAS) technique. In addition, the time series derived from the SAR data was validated by a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) station located in the study area. The results revealed that severe land subsidence, some of which reached 75 mm/year, occurred in certain areas of the study area over a period of three and a half years. High consistency was found between the land subsidence and the groundwater level change observed in the region, with a cross-correlation of over 95%. Moreover, the temporal and spatial patterns of the cultivated area and urbanization, which are the main reasons for the consumption of groundwater in the region, were revealed using the optic data.

TI  - Geodetic slip model of the November 26, 2019 Albania earthquake estimated from Sentinel-1 TOPS interferometry
T2  - TECTONOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study uses Sentinel-1 Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data to investigate the source model of the 26 November 2019 Albania earthquake, the largest earthquake to hit the northwestern region of the country in the last century. The preferred InSAR-based coseismic slip model shows that the slip is distributed in a relatively narrow area and is located at a depth of similar to 11 km with a maximum amplitude of similar to 0.89 m. The estimated geodetic moment of this earthquake is 3.70 x 10(18) Nm, with a shear modulus of 40 GPa, which is equivalent to Mw 6.31. The preferred slip model shows that this earthquake ruptured an east-dipping fault, namely the Shijak Fault wherein the primary slip mechanism is the dip-slip motion. Two-dimensional (2.5-D) surface displacement derived from three pairs of InSAR data is used to ensure the dip direction of the seismogenic fault responsible for the 2019 Albania earthquake. The result of 2.5-D displacement shows the dominance of the westward and uplift motion with a maximum amplitude of similar to 0.1 m. It indicates that the source fault dips to the east, confirming the result of inversion analysis.

TI  - Study on snowmelt and algal growth in the Antarctic Peninsula using spatial approach
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent times, global warming across the world is one of the major factors that triggers surface snow melting. According to the reports, climate change across the globe has a major impact on the poles, which has resulted in rapid snowmelt and red-pigmented algal growth. Because of its less sunlight reflecting characteristics, algal growth results in the rapid melting of snow. In this study, we used Landsat images of 30 m resolution to estimate the area of snowmelt and evaluate the impact of algal growth in snow reflectance in Eagle Island, Antarctic, Peninsula. Based on the analysis, it is estimated that within a span of 9 days between 4 and 13 February 2020, around 21.37% of the area of snow melted resulting in the formation of a pond of 2.13 km(2). Variation in the visible band is witnessed, indicating reduction of snow reflectance due to algal growth that leads to reduced albedo and increased warming.

TI  - Potential of airborne LiDAR data for terrain parameters extraction
T2  - QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) remote sensing is the most popular technology delivering higher detailed information and accuracy. LiDAR data is majorly used for generating a high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM), which is one of the primary data for most of the remote sensing applications. DEM forms the basis to derive other terrain parameters that are important to understand the topographic variations for the majority of applications. This research work highlights the potential of airborne LiDAR data for the extraction of terrain parameters. The airborne LiDAR dataset used in this study is of the St. Petersburg region of Russia. Terrain parameters like digital surface model (DSM), bare earth model (BEM), slope, aspect, curvature and terrain ruggedness index (TRI) are estimated from the airborne LiDAR data. Ground control points surveyed using Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) technique are used to assess the accuracy of the generated digital elevation model. An RMSE of 1.30 cm is obtained for the generated DSM with a maximum error of 3.5 cm magnitude. A complete analysis of derived parameters is done to observe the accuracy achieved.

TI  - Mapping rice residues burning and generated pollutants using Sentinel-2 data over northern part of India
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The study investigates the potential of Sentinel-2 imageries in spatio-temporal assessment of Rice residue burnt areas and generated pollutants in Kurukshetra, districts of Haryana, India. Datasets spanning from pre-burning (Sep.) to post-burning (Nov.) for the year 2018 were taken and variation in color and spectra of burnt and unburnt surfaces were assessed. Two indices widely accepted for burned area assessment namely Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Burnt Ratio (NBR) have been compared as numeric indicator for burnt surfaces. Dynamic thresholds developed using image statistics (over ground surveyed locations near to the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) fire events) was applied on time series indices for burnt area mapping. New plug-in model addable in ArcGIS software has been developed for the automatic burned area extraction. Short wave infrared composite (SIC) showed better visualization of active fire events. NBR was found better in spectral discrimination of burned and unburned surface with over all accuracy 91.38% as compared to NDVI (accuracy = 75.86%). Comparison of Sentinel-2B burnt area product for the year 2018 and 2019 with MODIS burnt area showed higher coverage under burning while with AWiFS it showed lower. Nearly 24.5% of total shown area (120800 ha) i.e. 30974.9 ha were found under stubble burning which contributed 138.69 Gg/yr air pollutants for the year 2018. The main reasons for the stubble burning obtained both from current study and literature were mechanized agriculture practices, poor storage facilities, farmers intension to get more profit from produces, easily available irrigation facilities, shift in rice cropping, and less time for next cropping.

TI  - Characterizing the glacier surge dynamics in Yarkand basin, Karakoram using remote sensing
T2  - QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Karakoram region contains a large number of surge-type glaciers, but few surging glaciers have been investigated by surface displacement and DEM differencing. The paper presents the surge dynamics of one unnamed glacier in Yarkand basin, of Karakoram region between 2000 and 2019 using satellite imagery (e.g., Landsat and Sentinel 2). Also, multiple high-resolution DEMs (e.g., HMA and Cartosat 1) were used to estimate mass transfer from the reservoir zone to the receiving zone. The DEM differencing exhibit maximum thickening of the lower receiving zone was-190 +/- 31 m whereas a maximum thinning of the upper reservoir zone was similar to 17 +/- 31 m between 2018 and 2016. The receiving zone gained 256 +/- 143 +/- 106 m(3) ice mass between 2018 and 2011. The surface displacement was lower than 0.07 +/- 0.02 m d(-1) in the quiescent phase between 2000 and 2011 and it reached to similar to 5 +/- 0.3 m d(-1) in the active phase (autumn 2015). The glacier terminus retreated similar to 765 +/- 89 m from 1978 to 2016 but advanced +681 +/- 57 m during 2016-2019. This analysis indicate that the gradual increase in surface displacement about four years before the onset of the surge, long active phase (three years) and slow termination corroborate partially thermally controlled Svalbard-type surge.

TI  - Indian Himalayan timberline ecotone in response to climate change - initial findings
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This article enumerates the findings of a team research on the Indian Himalayan timberline ecotone, with focus on three sites (located in Kashmir, Utta-rakhand and Sikkim). Timberline elevation increased from west to east, was higher in the warmer south aspect than the cooler north aspect, and was generally depressed. Betula, Abies, Rhododendron and Juniperus were important treeline genera. The Himalaya has not only the highest treelines (Juniperus tibetica, at 4900 m), but also the widest elevational range (>1700 m). Remotely sensed data revealed that the timberline is a long, twisting and turning ecotone, traversing a length of 8-10 km per km horizontal distance. Surface temperature lapse rate in the monsoonal regions was lower (-0.53 degrees C/100 m elevation) than generally perceived and varied considerably with season, being the lowest in December. The Himalayan treeline species are not water-stressed at least in monsoonal regions, predawn tree water potential seldom getting below -1 MPa. The upward advance of Rhododendron campanulatum (a krummholz species) may deplete alpine meadows with climatic warming. Tree-ring chronology indicated that winter warming may be favouring Abies spectabilis. Early snowmelt increased growth period and species richness. Treelines generally are stable in spite of decades of warming. Dependence of people on timberline was still high; so economic interventions are required to reduce the same.

TI  - Qualitative and quantitative analysis of topographically derived CVA algorithms using MODIS and Landsat-8 data over Western Himalayas, India
T2  - QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The change detection via remote sensing offers a cost-effective solution to monitor the earth surface variations and manage natural resources. Change vector analysis (CVA) is one of the most appropriate suitable amongst various change detection techniques that attract the interest of researchers due to its potential and overall applicability. However, the effectiveness of recently developed CVA methods is yet to be explored over the mountainous region like Himalayas with most commonly used satellite sensors such as MODIS and Landsat-8. In the present analysis, we have performed the qualitative and quantitative analysis of advanced CVA algorithms such as improved CVA (ICVA), posterior probability-based CVA (CVAPS), median CVA (MCVA) and fuzzy-based CVA (FCVA). Two experiments were conducted on different study sites of western Himalayas (Himachal Pradesh, India) using topographically corrected MODIS and Landsat-8 datasets. The experimental outcomes of change maps confirm the effectiveness of FCVA (86.80?87.6%) as compared to MCVA (78.4?83.6%), CVAPS (82.8?84%) and ICVA (73.6?80.4%). This study provides a comprehensive framework to explore the potential of different CVA algorithms to detect the land use and land cover changes especially over rugged terrain region.

TI  - Detection of snow/ice cover changes using subpixel-based change detection approach over Chhota-Shigri glacier, Western Himalaya, India
T2  - QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping and monitoring of the glacier changes over different regions of Earth surface is a challenging task due to regional rugged topography and climate conditions. This study focused on the monitoring of snow or ice cover changes over Chhota-Shigri glacier, Western Himalaya, India. A subpixel-based change detection (SCD) approach is proposed, aiming to identify the transition zones (mixed pixels) between the two class categories. The SCD approach involves the integration of subpixel classification and change vector analysis (CVA) to define the changes in the form of magnitude and direction between two multitemporal dates at the subpixel level. To check the efficacy of proposed SCD, experimental outcomes have also been compared with existing neural-network (NN) based SCD (NN-SCD). The result analysis has shown that proposed SCD achieved better accuracy (84.80%) as compared to NN-SCD (78.80%). In addition, a time series data was acquired using the Landsat series (Landsat 5, 7 and 8 as per availability) to perform the trend analysis over Chhota-Shigri glacier, during the period 2001?2019. This study offers the effective way of estimating the bi-temporal snow/ice changes especially over rugged terrains around the globe.

TI  - Finding Meaning Amidst COVID-19: An Existential Positive Psychology Model of Suffering
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The global COVID-19 pandemic has created a crisis of suffering. We conceptualize suffering as a deeply existential issue that fundamentally changes people indelible ways and for which there are no easy solutions. To better understand its effects and how people can flourish in the midst of this crisis, we formally introduce and elaborate on an Existential Positive Psychology Model of Suffering (EPPMS) and apply that to the COVID-19 global pandemic. Our model has three core propositions: (a) suffering reveals existential concerns, (b) existential anxiety impairs one's ability to find meaning, and (c) cultivating meaning is the primary way to address suffering and allay existential anxiety, eventually leading to flourishing (and potentially growth). We apply this model to the COVID-19 pandemic, including how to build meaning, and discuss clinical implications.

TI  - Inundation mapping of Kerala flood event in 2018 using ALOS-2 and temporal Sentinel-1 SAR images
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In August 2018, the southern Indian state of Kerala received unusually heavy rainfall leading to large-scale flooding and destruction. Reliable flood inundation maps derived from remote sensing techniques help in flood disaster management activities. The freely available Sentinel-1A/B SAR data have the potential for flood inundation mapping due to its all-weather imaging capability. In this study, temporal dual-pol Sentinel-1 SAR data have been utilized. Single-date ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 commercial SAR data were also used to fill the gap between Sentinel-1 acquisitions during the peak flood-period. Two flood-mapping approaches, viz. rule-based classification in case of temporal SAR data and histogram-based thresholding approach in case of single-date imagery, were utilized in the study. Also, flood inundation mapping with different data constraints, i.e. availability of single-date and multi-date imagery has been analysed and discussed. The obtained results were validated with multiple data sources like survey data and secondary data from government agencies. An overall accuracy of 90.6% and a critical success index of 81.6% were achieved with the proposed rule-based classification approach. This study highlights the potential of the combination of Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 data for flood inundation mapping.

TI  - Hetero-GCD2RDF: An Interoperable Solution for Geospatial Climatic Data by Deploying Semantic Web Technologies
T2  - WIRELESS PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ocean and Land based satellite observation system comprises of various sensors and configurations. The generated Geospatial Climatic Data (GCD) by sensors is transmitted in heterogeneous file formats with heterogeneous vocabularies that lead to semantic heterogeneity of data. Government and public organizations started to publish these datasets to users through climatic web portals. The critical task in handling heterogeneous files is data interpretation and interoperability. This can be handled by facilitating the data to reach semantically structured or linked data. This paper proposes a Hetero-GCD2RDF data retrieval approach that focuses on two aspects (1) Extraction of records from satellite data and represent it as linked data namely Resource Description Framework (RDF) and (2) Implementation of SPARQL query engine to the resultant RDF for data retrieval. Data from Indian Meteorological Satellite INSAT-3D is taken as a typical example to execute the proposed approach. Where, approximately 170 files of about 650 MB in memory containing 1,278,000 records have been converted and queried. Compared to conventional methods the proposed method saves nearly 38.12% of time to represent the data in RDF. Thus, the proposed Hetero-GCD2RDF approach is recognized to be efficient, reliable and suitable for semantic web.

TI  - On the applicability of satellite SAR interferometry to landslide hazards detection in hilly areas: a case study of Shuicheng, Guizhou in Southwest China
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - SAR Interferometry (InSAR) has been proven to be effective for measuring landslides deformation. However, the InSAR application of landslide mapping is limited by the blind observation areas caused by SAR geometric distortion or vegetation decorrelation. We proposed an approach of landslide detection and mapping with a priori assessment of InSAR applicability, which can not only guide the selection of SAR data, but also prejudge the observable areas. Meanwhile, it can assist to analyze the reliability of landslide detection and help to reveal the reason of detection failure of occurred landslides. We employed this approach to evaluate the InSAR applicability over the whole Guizhou Province at first. Then, we took Shuicheng County as an example to conduct time-series InSAR landslide detection combined with a priori applicability. Six large active landslides were identified from the results of three SAR data stacks (ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 and ascending/descending Sentinel-1 from April 2017 to July 2019). The reliabilities of landslide detection results were analyzed and the possible reasons for the detection failure of Jicangzhen landslide were revealed. We inferred that the Jichangzhen landslide suddenly happened induced by short-term heavy rainfalls and presented no precursors, which cannot be captured by SAR satellites with intermittent observations.

TI  - Influence of snow making on albedo and local radiative forcing in an alpine area
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present paper, the climate cooling potential of technical snow making on ski slopes is investigated with regard to radiative forcing. It is well-known, that snow shows a higher degree of reflection compared to other ground surfaces. During snow-poor winters, guaranteeing snow covered ski slopes by using snow making may therefore lead to an increase in the albedo of a mountainous region. Since increasing albedo engenders a negative radiative forcing, the cooling potential of snow production on ski slopes is of particular relevance in the context of the current climate debate. Investigations were however generally performed for flat surfaces. Several studies nevertheless demonstrated that the topography leads to a substantial decrease in the mean albedo of a given region. This is attributable to shading effects and to slope inclinations. The present study was therefore dedicated to the accurate simulation of the impact of the albedo increase of ski slopes on the mean albedo and on the resulting change in shortwave radiative budget of a chosen mountainous region. We used therefore a state of the art 3-dimensional radiative transfer model. The investigations were carried out for the skiing area Saalbach-Hinterglemm in Austria. Broadband snow albedo values between 0.61 and 0.62 in cloudless conditions and 0.64 and 0.65 in cloudy conditions for solar zenith angle (sza) between 30 and 80 degrees were used for the simulations. An uncertainty of ?0.17 was taken into account. First a sensitivity study was performed, that showed a substantial decrease in the mean albedo of the ski slopes as a function of slope inclination. A strong impact of topography and of surrounding trees on the mean albedo of the ski slopes of up to 40% and 14% respectively was found at high sza under clear sky conditions. Compared to snow free conditions an increase in albedo between 0.18 and 0.36 was observed, the higher values for smaller sza and assuming no trees in the surroundings. Only related to the ski slopes a radiative forcing between -7 and -35 W/m2 was obtained. If the long-term snow cover conditions were taken into account, snow making lead to a change in albedo, only, in March and April. The increase in albedo was just below 0.10 in April and 0.02 in March, resulting in a radiative forcing around -12 W/m2 and around -1.5 W/m2 respectively. Though, in order to analyze an eventual cooling effect on climate the whole carbon footprint related to the production of technical snow making shall be determined.

TI  - Snow cover mapping, topographic controls and integration of meteorological data sets in Din-Gad Basin, Central Himalaya
T2  - QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Din-Gad basin, located in central Himalaya is occupied by the Dokriani glacier in upper reaches. Landsat TM, OLI and Sentinel MSI data sets of seven years from 2009 to 2011 and 2013 to 2016 are utilized to map the areal extent of snow-cover, its seasonal variability and topographical controls (elevation, aspect, and slope). Coefficient of Variation (CV) in Snow Cover Area (SCA) below the elevation of similar to 5000 m asl is high (similar to 2.0), and is low at higher elevations. CV is also higher for southern as compared to northern aspects. Meteorological data (temperature, relative humidity, and solar radiation) from Automatic Weather Stations (AWSs) is utilized to compute isotherms (similar to 0, 1, and 2 degrees C) by extrapolation method using Near-surface Temperature Lapse Rate (NSTLR). These data sets are integrated and presented by graphical as well as on Geographical Information System (GIS). Month-wise isotherms closely correspond with snow-cover extent during ablation season, suggesting that the extrapolated temperatures represent a significant proxy for depletion pattern, while month-wise and hourly isotherms deviate largely from the SCA during winter months due to snow events. Elevation zones above 5200 m asl retain snow throughout the year, indicating proximity with Equilibrium Line Altitude (ELA). The effects of Relative Humidity (RH) and solar radiation on melting history during different seasons have also emerged. The proposed methodology is efficient and reliable in terms of estimating the depletion patterns, and deriving the isotherms that can be applied to other comparable snow-covered areas.

TI  - Regional land degradation assessment for dryland environments: The Namaqualand <i>Hardeveld</i> bioregion of the Succulent <i>Karoo</i> biome as a case-study
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - There is growing consensus that land degradation assessments should occur at local to regional scales, as global assessments fail to capture the complexity of land degradation processes, and how they manifest in different social-ecological contexts. We have tested a statistically rigorous method for regional land degradation assessment in drylands, using fuzzy classification theory and techniques, that results in the creation of a habitat condition archetype for the Namaqualand Hardeveld bioregion of the Succulent Karoo biome in South Africa. The methodology initially groups field data into classes based on known indicators of land degradation, before predicting observed field cover with 16 remote sensing variables, derived from both LANDSAT 8 and SENTINEL-2A satellite data. Using fuzzy classification techniques, projections of field cover from the resulting model are combined with variables representing a potential change in cover to produce a map of the habitat condition of the bioregion. Approximately 17% of the bioregion had habitat condition values less than one standard deviation smaller than the mean and could therefore be considered degraded. To provide context, this map is presented with potential drivers of change for the bioregion. The map, and accompanying drivers of change, is ultimately presented in a Google Earth Engine app for easy interpretation and use.

M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundNear-infrared fluorescence imaging (NIRFI) of breast cancer (BC) after the intravenous (IV) injection of free indocyanine green (fICG) has been reported to be feasible. However, some questions remained unclarified.ObjectiveTo evaluate the distribution of fICG in BC and the axillary lymph nodes (LNs) of women undergoing surgery with complete axillary LN dissection (CALND) and/or selective lymphadenectomy (SLN) of sentinel LNs (NCT no. 01993576 and NCT no. 02027818).MethodsAn intravenous injection of fICG (0.25 mg/kg) was administered to one series of 20 women undergoing treatment with mastectomy, the day before surgery in 5 (group 1) and immediately before surgery in 15 (group 2: tumor localization, 25; and pN+ CALND, 4) as well as to another series of 20 women undergoing treatment with tumorectomy (group 3). A dedicated NIR camera was used for ex vivo fluorescence imaging of the 45 BC lesions and the LNs.ResultsIn group 1, two of the four BC lesions and one large pN+ LN exhibited fluorescence. In contrast, 24 of the 25 tumors in group 2 and all of the tumors in group 3 were fluorescent. The sentinel LNs were all fluorescent, as well as some of the LNs in all CALND specimens. Metastatic cells were found in the fluorescent LNs of the pN+ cases. Fluorescent BC lesions could be identified ex vivo on the surface of the lumpectomy specimen in 14 of 19 cases.ConclusionsWhen fICG is injected intravenously just before surgery, BC can be detected using NIRFI with high sensitivity, with metastatic axillary LNs also showing fluorescence. Such a technical approach seems promising in the management of BC and merits further investigation.

TI  - Automated in-field leaf-level hyperspectral imaging of corn plants using a Cartesian robotic platform
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) has been widely adopted in field plant phenotyping activities. Current HSI solutions such as airborne remote sensing platforms and handheld spectrometers have been proven effective and have become popular in various phenotyping applications. However, the imaging quality of current airborne sensing systems still suffers from various noises due to the changing ambient lighting condition, long imaging distance, and comparatively low resolution. Handheld leaf spectrometers provide a higher quality of spectral data, but they only measure a small spot on the leaf, which cannot represent the whole leaf or canopy very well due to the great variation between different locations. In 2018, the Purdue Ag engineers developed a new handheld hyperspectral leaf imager, LeafSpec. For the first time, phenotyping researchers were able to collect highresolution hyperspectral leaf images without the impacts of the changing ambient light and leaf slopes. However, the application of LeafSpec was still limited by its low throughput and intensive labor cost in the field measurements. The goal of this project was to develop a robotic system that could replace the human operator to perform in-field and leaf-level HSI using LeafSpec. The system consisted of a machine-operable version of the LeafSpec device, a machine vision system for target leaf detection, and a customized cartesian robotic manipulator with five Degrees of Freedom (DOF). In the 2019 field test, the designed system collected data from corn plants with two genotypes and three levels of nitrogen treatments with an average cycle time of 86 s. The nitrogen content predicted by the designed system had an R2 value of 0.7307 against the ground truth. The prediction could also differentiate the different nitrogen treatments with P-values of 0.0193 and 0.0102. The performance was similar to human operators?. The developers, therefore, conclude that the robotic system has the potential of replacing human operators for LeafSpec hyperspectral corn leaf imaging in the field.

TI  - Remote sensing-derived combined index for agricultural drought assessment of rabi pulse crops in Bundelkhand region, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a novel approach defined for drought severity of Bundelkhand region of India, especially for rabi (winter) season crops using analytical hierarchy process established a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making approach based combined drought index (CDI). The remote sensing multi-sensor derived datasets, as long-term MODIS satellite data, rainfall from CHIRPS datasets and soil moisture from Era Interim datasets, used for quantification for the 2001-2018 period. The CDI is generated by integrated multi-spectral indices as Vegetation Condition Index, Temperature Condition Index, Precipitation Condition Index, Soil Moisture Condition Index using analytical hierarchy process derived weightage with a consistency ratio of 4.2% and consistency index of 0.038 value. The results show that Jalaun, Hamirpur and Banda districts as Northern part affected more as compared to Lalitpur and parts of Jhansi districts as the Southern part of the study area. The statistical analysis illustrated a significant correlation between crop yield anomaly and CDI for all districts for rabi pulses crops. Thus, a geospatial platform-based approach using historical earth observations with analytical hierarchy process integrated expert advice to finalize variables and their weighing will make this methodology more realistic, easier and quicker to apply in future at any region. Eventually, remote sensing can address the drought risk or severity for all kind of crop ecosystem by using cohesive approach derived from multi-sensor satellite datasets.

TI  - An alternative approach to delineate wetland influence zone of a tropical intertidal mudflat using geo-information technology
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mudflats are important tropical coastal wetlands having high carbon sequestration and biodiversity potentials. The actual reach of a mudflat environment spreads far beyond its perennial wetland areas in a coastal site. Accurate demarcation of the extent of these buffer areas is imperative for sustainable wetland management. This study tried to delineate the wetland influence zone (WIZ) of an intertidal mudflat in the Medinipur coastal plain, India as a functional extension around the considerably smaller yet hydrous cum muddy depressions. Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), derived from Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) datasets, and Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI), derived from the coupled use of Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat-8 datasets, had been analyzed and merged to develop nine characteristic zones. Among these, eight zones (Zone I to Zone VIII) were identified as part of the WIZ and the rest one (NDWI: -0.15, TVDI 0.7) was considered as a supra-tidal zone, devoid of the mudflat features. Although the overall extent of WIZ (Minimum: 339.20 ha, Maximum: 350.22 ha) did not change much from 2016 to 2020, the inter-zonal spatial arrangements of vegetation and physiography transformed continuously. The gradual disappearance of the major tidal creek from the south-western parts and increasing human footprints throughout the mudflat had expedited this transformation. Accordingly, periodic assessments incorporating microwave and optical datasets along with high precision insitu measurements of soil moisture was suggested for the efficient monitoring of these fragile tropical ecosystems.

TI  - Morphotype and haplotype identification of <i>Varroa destructor</i> (Acari: Varroidae), and its importance for apiculture in Nicaragua
T2  - EXPERIMENTAL AND APPLIED ACAROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The ectoparasite Varroa (Acari: Varroidae) is considered to be the main pest of honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) in Nicaragua. The aim of this study was to determine morphotypes and mitochondrial haplotypes of the Varroa mites, related to infestation levels in A. mellifera hives in Nicaragua in a cross-sectional study (2013-2016). Samples were taken from 34 sentinel apiaries in five geographical zones; from 713 Varroa females collected during the study, 153 were selected for measurement of various morphometric characters for further classification into morphotypes. The mitochondrial haplotype was assigned to one of the two (Korean or Japanese), using the restriction by SacI of the PCR product of a fragment of the gene CO-I. Morphometric measurement and sequencing revealed the affiliation to the species Varroa destructor with a mean (+/- SD) body width of 1699.1 +/- 60.2 mu m and a body length of 1161.1 +/- 34.9 mu m. Body characters were significantly different among the 34 apiaries. Varroa destructor samples were classified into four morphotypes, with no significant differences in the geographical zones. As GAGCTC SacI enzyme cleavage sequences were not observed, all PCR products were identified as V. destructor Korean haplotype. The CO-I gene nucleotide sequences from two samples V. destructor showed both 100% similarity with the Korean haplotype and 99.8% similarity to the Japanese haplotype. Although the V. destructor mite was identified as a Korean haplotype, host-parasite association in 2 decades has led into a balance without entering into severe losses in the Nicaraguan apiculture.

TI  - East Antarctica magnetically linked to its ancient neighbours in Gondwana
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a new magnetic compilation for Central Gondwana conformed to a recent satellite magnetic model (LCS-1) with the help of an equivalent layer approach, resulting in consistent levels, corrections that have not previously been applied. Additionally, we use the satellite data to its full spectral content, which helps to include India, where high resolution aeromagnetic data are not publically available. As India is located north of the magnetic equator, we also performed a variable reduction to the pole to the satellite data by applying an equivalent source method. The conformed aeromagnetic and satellite data are superimposed on a recent deformable Gondwana plate reconstruction that links the Kaapvaal Craton in Southern Africa with the Grunehogna Craton in East Antarctica in a tight fit. Aeromagnetic anomalies unveil, however, wider orogenic belts that preserve remnants of accreted Meso- to Neoproterozoic crust in interior East Antarctica, compared to adjacent sectors of Southern Africa and India. Satellite and aeromagnetic anomaly datasets help to portray the extent and architecture of older Precambrian cratons, re-enforcing their linkages in East Antarctica, Australia, India and Africa.

TI  - Water vapor retrieval from MERSI NIR channels of Fengyun-3B satellite using ground-based GPS data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - An ensemble-based empirical regression algorithm is for the first time developed to retrieve total column water vapor from the Medium Resolution Spectral Imager (MERSI) near-infrared (NIR) channels onboard the Fengyun3B (FY-3B) satellite. This retrieval method uses precipitable water vapor (PWV) data estimated from groundbased Global Positioning System (GPS) data to build a regression model in which the reflectance ratio observed from MERSI NIR absorption channels and the corresponding GPS PWV data are the parameters. The MERSI Level 1b data, specifically the three water vapor absorption channels centered at 905 nm, 940 nm, and 980 nm are used to retrieve water vapor. PWV data observed from 256 ground-based GPS stations located in the western North America in 2016 are used as reference data for model development. Then, validation is performed with data obtained during 2017-2019 from both the western North America and Australia to assess the performance of the proposed algorithm. The results indicate that the new PWV results agree very well with groundbased PWV reference data. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for ensemble median PWV is 16.72% similar to 36.74% in western North America and is 15.47% similar to 32.31% in Australia. The RMSE is 4.635 mm similar to 8.156 mm in western North America and is 5.383 mm similar to 8.900 mm in Australia. The weighted mean value using three-channel ratio transmittance has the best retrieval accuracy, with RMSE of 4.635 mm in western North America and 5.383 mm in Australia. This new PWV algorithm can retrieve PWV from FY-3B data with a higher accuracy for different regions. Different from conventional algorithms, no pre-observed information of atmospheric parameters is required in this model.

TI  - Probing 3-D electrical conductivity of the mantle using 6 years of Swarm, CryoSat-2 and observatory magnetic data and exploiting matrix Q-responses approach
T2  - EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents results of mapping three-dimensional (3-D) variations of the electrical conductivity in depths ranging from 400 to 1200 km using 6 years of magnetic data from the Swarm and CryoSat-2 satellites as well as from ground observatories. The approach involves the 3-D inversion of matrix Q-responses (transfer functions) that relate spherical harmonic coefficients of external (inducing) and internal (induced) origin of the magnetic potential. Transfer functions were estimated from geomagnetic field variations at periods ranging from 2 to 40 days. We study the effect of different combinations of input data sets on the transfer functions. We also present a new global 1-D conductivity profile based on a joint analysis of satellite tidal signals and global magnetospheric Q-responses.

TI  - Satellite-Based Drought Reporting on the Navajo Nation
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In data scarce regions of the world, co-produced management tools that combine remote sensing, modeled, and in situ data provide the information needed to support ground-based monitoring systems for improved water and natural resource management. On the Navajo Nation (N.N.), in the Four Corners of the southwestern United States, there is a need for data-driven management of water resources as the region is prone to water scarcity and emergency drought declarations, which have become more common under a changing climate. The current tools used by the N.N. Department of Water Resources largely lack the spatial detail, consistent measurements, and political and administrative information specific to their needs for determining appropriate response actions. The Drought Severity Evaluation Tool (DSET), a cloud-based web application that harnesses the capabilities of Google Earth Engine, is a user-friendly tool that pairs remotely sensed, modeled, and in situ data on the N.N. The DSET computing capabilities include on-the-fly generation of regional to field scale maps, time series figures, and reporting metrics that can assist in drought emergency declarations and the assistance to local communities through the subsequent allocation of relief dollars across the N.N. to the regions that need it most.

TI  - Water quality assessment of the Ganges River during COVID-19 lockdown
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ganges River water quality was assessed to record the changes due to the nation-wide pandemic lockdown. Satellite-based (Sentinel-2) water quality analysis before and during lockdown was performed for seven selected locations spread across the entire stretch of the Ganges (Rishikesh-Dimond Harbour). Results revealed that due to the lockdown, the water quality of the Ganges improved with reference to specific water quality parameters, but the improvements were region specific. Along the entire stretch of Ganges, only the Haridwar site showed improvement to an extent of being potable as per the threshold set by the Central Pollution Control Board, New Delhi, India. A 55% decline in turbidity at that site during the lockdown was attributed to the abrupt halt in pilgrimage activities. Absorption by chromophoric dissolved organic matter which is an indicator of organic pollution declined all along the Ganges stretch with a maximum decline at the downstream location of Diamond Harbour. Restricted discharge of industrial effluent, urban pollution, sewage from hotels, lodges, and spiritual dwellings along the Ganges are some of the reasons behind such declines. No significant change in the geographic trend of chlorophyll-a was observed. The findings of this study highlight the importance of regular monitoring of the changes in the Ganges water quality using Sentinel-2 data to further isolate the anthropogenic impact, as India continues the phase-wise opening amidst the pandemic.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph-Node Mapping with Near-Infrared Indocyanine Green in Laparotomy for Early Endometrial Cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Sentinel lymph-node (SLN) mapping with indocyanine green (ICG) and near-infrared (NIR) imaging is a feasible alternative to pelvic lymphadenectomy in endometrial cancer staging. While ICG SLN mapping is now used extensively in minimally invasive surgery, there is little literature validating its use in open surgery. The technique, and the effectiveness and feasibility of ICG SLN mapping in open surgical staging for endometrial cancer are discussed.Materials and Methods: This single-center cohort study looked at patients with early endometrial cancer undergoing staging laparotomy between March 2016 and February 2019. Intracervical ICG injection was performed prior to peritoneal dissection. Lymph-node chains were inspected in NIR mode. In each hemipelvis, if SLN mapping was not achieved, ipsilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed. Full pelvic lymphadenectomy was then performed if there were suspicious nodes, large tumor sizes, or if surgeons preferred to have this done.Results: The study included 36 patients. Average operating time was 139 minutes. Median blood loss was 131 mL. ICG use did not cause any complications. The detection rate of SLNs was 92%. Bilateral pelvic SLN mapping was achieved in 81% of patients. The median number of SLNs was 3. SLNs were mapped most commonly to the external iliac (53%) and obturator (30%) nodes. In 4 patients (11%), SLNs were positive. Full pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed in 18 patients (50%). No false-negative SLNs were detected.Conclusions: SLN mapping with ICG is technically feasible in patients with endometrial cancer requiring laparotomy. SLN mapping in laparotomy has high SLN-detection rates and minimal side-effects comparable to that of minimally invasive surgery. (J GYNECOL SURG 20XX:000)

TI  - ACIX-Aqua: A global assessment of atmospheric correction methods for Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 over lakes, rivers, and coastal waters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric correction over inland and coastal waters is one of the major remaining challenges in aquatic remote sensing, often hindering the quantitative retrieval of biogeochemical variables and analysis of their spatial and temporal variability within aquatic environments. The Atmospheric Correction Intercomparison Exercise (ACIX-Aqua), a joint NASA - ESA activity, was initiated to enable a thorough evaluation of eight state-of-the-art atmospheric correction (AC) processors available for Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data processing. Over 1000 radiometric matchups from both freshwaters (rivers, lakes, reservoirs) and coastal waters were utilized to examine the quality of derived aquatic reflectances ((rho) over cap (w)). This dataset originated from two sources: Data gathered from the international scientific community (henceforth called Community Validation Database, CVD), which captured predominantly inland water observations, and the Ocean Color component of AERONET measurements (AERONET-OC), representing primarily coastal ocean environments. This volume of data permitted the evaluation of the AC processors individually (using all the matchups) and comparatively (across seven different Optical Water Types, OWTs) using common matchups. We found that the performance of the AC processors differed for CVD and AERONET-OC matchups, likely reflecting inherent variability in aquatic and atmospheric properties between the two datasets. For the former, the median errors in (rho) over cap (w)(560) and (rho) over cap (w)(664) were found to range from 20 to 30% for best-performing processors. Using the AERONET-OC matchups, our performance assessments showed that median errors within the 15-30% range in these spectral bands may be achieved. The largest uncertainties were associated with the blue bands (25 to 60%) for best-performing processors considering both CVD and AERONET-OC assessments. We further assessed uncertainty propagation to the downstream products such as near-surface concentration of chlorophyll-a (Chla) and Total Suspended Solids (TSS). Using satellite matchups from the CVD along with in situ Chla and TSS, we found that 20-30% uncertainties in (rho) over cap (w)(490 <= lambda <= 743 nm) yielded 25-70% uncertainties in derived Chla and TSS products for top-performing AC processors. We summarize our results using performance matrices guiding the satellite user community through the OWT-specific relative performance of AC processors. Our analysis stresses the need for better representation of aerosols, particularly absorbing ones, and improvements in corrections for sky- (or sun-) glint and adjacency effects, in order to achieve higher quality downstream products in freshwater and coastal ecosystems.

T2  - HTS TEOLOGIESE STUDIES-THEOLOGICAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this article is to put forward an acceptable scriptural stance with respect to an evolutionary worldview. The authors posit that a theologically orthodox position can best be substantiated when the moral ideal embodied in Christ is the starting point for all deliberations. In light of this premise, the authors consider the following topics: the great divide between science and religion; the various theoretical shifts taking place on both sides of the science and religion arena concerning the veracity of evolution a substantive consideration of Darwin's evolutionary theory; the issue of whether Genesis is only a myth or a narration of literal, historical events and the profound implications of evolutionary theory for religious belief. The authors conclude that a choice does not have to be made between evolution and religion but between good and bad evolutionary theory and good and bad religious beliefs.Contribution: The article's challenge is to not only show that science and theology are not in conflict, but also that ascribing to an evolutionary worldview when discussing God's creative acts, is also not in conflict with God's Word.

TI  - Temperature effects on the temporal dynamics of a subarctic invertebrate community
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate warming is predicted to have major impacts on the structure of terrestrial communities, particularly in high latitude ecosystems where growing seasons are short. Higher temperatures may dampen seasonal dynamics in community composition as a consequence of earlier snowmelt, with potentially cascading effects across all levels of biological organisation.Here, we examined changes in community assembly and structure along a natural soil temperature gradient in the Hengill geothermal valley, Iceland, during the summer of 2015. Sample collection over several time points within a season allowed us to assess whether temperature alters temporal variance in terrestrial communities and compositional turnover.We found that seasonal fluctuations in species richness, diversity and evenness were dampened as soil temperature increased, whereas invertebrate biomass varied more. Body mass was found to be a good predictor of species occurrence, with smaller species found at higher soil temperatures and emerging earlier in the season.Our results provide more in-depth understanding of the temporal nature of community and population-level responses to temperature, and indicate that climate warming will likely dampen the seasonal turnover of community structure that is characteristic of high latitude invertebrate communities.

TI  - Prediction of crop biophysical variables with panel data techniques and radar remote sensing imagery
T2  - BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the late 1970s, remote sensing techniques have been proven to be suitable for characterizing and monitoring plants and crops. In particular, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) missions contribute considerably to this prediction effort. However, the main issue when using SAR image series together with field observations is the scarcity of data due to the difficulty of acquiring field measurements. This research aimed to contribute to solving this problem with an alternative statistical model that can overcome the lack of a long, robust series of field-based ground truth observations. The main novelty of this research is the evaluation of the potential of a panel data approach to radar remote sensing imagery for predicting crop biophysical variables. For this purpose, RADARSAT-2 imagery was acquired over the study area in central Spain. Simultaneously, a field campaign was deployed to estimate crop parameters in the same area and to validate the results of the modelling. The analysis of the influence of the crop type on the incidence angle and the polarimetric parameters showed a strong influence of the co-polar channels (HH, VV), the entropy (H) and the coherence between the co-polar channels (gHHVV), with the differences being higher at 25 degrees. The panel data analysis method demonstrated that good predictions, with R-2 greater than 0.78, were achieved for all biophysical variables analysed in this study. Overall, this novel statistical approach with remote sensing data showed great applicability for the prediction of crop variables, even with a short series of observations. (C) 2021 IAgrE.

AB  - The differential code biases (DCBs) of the global positioning system (GPS) receiver onboard low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites are commonly estimated by a local spherical symmetry assumption together with the known GPS satellite DCBs from ground-based observations. Nowadays, more and more LEO satellites are equipped with GPS receivers for precise orbit determination, which provides a unique chance to estimate both satellite and receiver DCBs without any ground data. A new method to estimate the GPS satellite and receiver DCBs using a network of LEO receivers is proposed. A multi-layer mapping function (MF) is used to combine multi-LEO satellite data at varying orbit heights. First, model simulations are conducted to compare the vertical total electron content (VTEC) derived from the multi-layer MF and the reference VTEC obtained from the empirical ionosphere model International Reference Ionosphere and Global Core Plasmasphere Model. Second, GPS data are collected from five LEO missions, including ten receivers used to estimate both the satellite and receiver DCBs simultaneously with the multi-layer MF. The results show that the GPS satellite DCB solutions obtained from space-based data are consistent with ground-based solutions provided by the Centre for Orbit Determination in Europe. The proposed normalization procedure combining topside observations from different LEO missions has the potential to improve the accuracies of satellite DCBs of Global Navigation Satellite Systems as well as the receiver DCBs onboard LEO satellites, although the number of LEO missions and spatial-temporal coverage of topside observations are limited.

TI  - Impacts of climate change on wind erosion in Southern Africa between 1991 and 2015
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wind erosion is the main form of soil erosion in arid and semiarid areas. It leads to soil loss and land degradation, which aggravates ecosystem vulnerability and threatens regional sustainable development. Exploring wind erosion and associating driving factors can provide useful information to reduce soil wind erosion and solve corresponding environmental problems. Southern Africa is characterized with severe soil wind erosion, which has brought a series of socioeconomic issues, such as food crises and poverty. This study used meteorological and remote sensing data, and the revised wind erosion equation (RWEQ) model to explore the spatio-temporal dynamics of soil erosion in Southern Africa from 1991 to 2015. The impact of climate change on soil wind erosion was also analyzed. The results showed that wind erosion fluctuated during the study period, which first showed a downward trend and then stabilized at a relatively low level after 2010. Soil wind erosion across 66.65% of the study area significantly decreased (p < .05) and near-surface wind speed was the most important influencing factor. The decrease of wind speed can significantly reduce the soil wind erosion across 39.89% of the study area. Temperature and precipitation were significantly related to soil wind erosion over 18.96% and 24.63% of the study area, respectively. Both can indirectly affect soil wind erosion through their impacts on vegetation cover. This study will help decision-makers to identify high-risk areas for soil erosion in Southern Africa and to take countermeasures effectively.

TI  - Mapping grass above-ground biomass of grazing-lands using satellite remote sensing
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Review
AB  - Over the years, global growth in population and changing climate has contributed to shifts in vegetation species composition, and lower production of grass biomass. Several studies have been conducted globally to quantify grassland biomass utilizing satellite data, but rarely in African Savannah, particularly in Jibiro grazing land, Nigeria. In this study, the grass above-ground biomass (GAB) was estimated from Sentinel-2A/2B data using (i) in-situ samplings on GAB and (ii) upscaling the measured GAB to corresponding satellite data. Spectral indices show that the vegetation index number (VIN) is the best suited vegetation index for modelling GAB (R (2) > 0.86, p < 0.001) and is verified (RMSE +/- 15.99/100 g) with an equally independent assessment set. The result indicated that the grazing reserve has maximum GAB production of 0.76 ton/ha as of September and least GAB of 0.001 ton/ha in January 2018. This study contributes to planning rotational grazing in study area and similar ecosystem.

TI  - Southern coastal subtropical shallow lakes skin temperature driven by climatic and non-climatic factors
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Subtropical coastal shallow lakes (SCSL) are sensitive ecosystems. The lake-skin-water temperature (LSWT) is an average lake temperature proxy and responds to changes in surroundings, affecting biological and physical lake processes. In this study, M*D11A1 products are used to develop daytime and nighttime LSWT time series for 20 SCSL in South America. The influence of climatic (air temperature, surface net solar radiation, wind speed, and wind direction) and non-climatic (latitude, lake area, perimeter, width, length, and morphology) factors are evaluated from 2001 to 2017. Pearson's coefficients (rho) and auto- and cross-correlations are used to establish the relation between LWST and the selected factors. We identify that the dynamic of LSWT is sensitive to geomorphological factors (latitude and lake width) throughout the year, especially in summer. In winter, the LSTW regime is mainly affected by wind direction (rho = -0.66, p value < 0.01). Linear models are fitted to the temperature series to check the trend changes in the inflection points and the warming or cooling trend for LSWT. Considering the complete series, the maximum warming rate of LSWT is 0.25 <degrees>C per decade (degrees C/dec). The analysis of the identified sub-periods reveals that warming and cooling can occur (significantly) in shorter periods. The average trends within sub-periods for skin temperature-daytime (+/- 0.0105 degrees C/dec), skin temperature-nighttime (0.0041 degrees C/dec), and air temperature (- s0.006 degrees C/dec; 0.007 degrees C/dec) are estimated. Our approach has the potential to be applied in future studies due to the expansion of knowledge about the behavior of SCSL and the understanding of the current and potential effects of climate change in association with physical and geomorphological traits.

TI  - Hourly remote sensing monitoring of harmful algal blooms (HABs) in Taihu Lake based on GOCI images
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasingly serious harmful algal blooms (HABs) in Taihu Lake has brought huge losses to the local economy and people's life in Taihu Lake. Satellite remote sensing technology has become one of the most important monitoring methods for HAB disasters due to its large-scale and long-term advantages. GOCI image has become the new data source of HAB monitoring because of its large size and high time resolution. Due to the low spatial resolution (500 m) and the existence of mixed pixels, the error of HAB area obtained by the NDVI method is large. In this paper, the linear mixing model (LMM) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) threshold method are combined to extract the HAB area from GOCI images with 500-m spatial resolution. Compared with the results of the HAB area extracted by Landsat8 OLI and MODIS data, three small areas in the study area were selected to verify the accuracy of the HAB area extracted from the GOCI image on October 2, 2015. The results show that when the NDVI threshold is 0.1, the area error of HABs is the smallest when the extracted HAB pixels mask the decomposition results of mixed pixels; besides, the area error of HABs extracted from the GOCI image is smaller than that from MODIS image; finally, GOCI image can extract the spatial dynamic distribution of HABs in Taihu Lake within 8 h a day, which has higher temporal resolution than the MODIS image. Compared with the NDVI threshold method and LMM method, the inversion accuracy is greatly improved, and the accuracy is stable in different regions. It can provide technical support for the decision-making and assessment of HAB ecological disasters.

TI  - Detecting and mapping irrigated areas in a Mediterranean environment by using remote sensing soil moisture and a land surface model
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although irrigation practices affect food production and water resource management, with ever more impacting effects under climate change and population increasing scenarios, detailed knowledge of irrigation is still lacking. In fact, explicit information on the spatial occurrence of irrigation and on the amounts of water used for this purpose is often not available, thus making irrigation the missing variable to comprehensively understand the hydrological cycle dynamics over agricultural areas. Nevertheless, remote sensing techniques can be used to delimit the irrigation extent.In this study, the capability of five remotely sensed soil moisture products to detect the irrigation signal over an area intensely equipped for irrigation in the North East of Spain is investigated; moreover, a method to map the actually irrigated areas based on the K-means clustering algorithm is proposed. The remote sensing soil moisture data sets used in this study are SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) at 1 km, SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) at 1 km and 9 km, Sentinel-1 at 1 km, and ASCAT (Advanced SCATterometer) at 12.5 km. The 1 km resolution versions of SMOS and SMAP are obtained by downscaling coarser SMOS and SMAP data through the DISPATCH (DISaggregation based on Physical And Theoretical scale CHange) algorithm. The analyses are supported by an additional data set of soil moisture at 1 km resolution simulated by the SURFEX-ISBA (SURFace EXternalisee - Interaction Sol Biosphere Atmosphere) land surface model.Among all the considered data sets, the L-band passive microwave downscaled products show the best performances in detecting the irrigation signal over the pilot area, especially SMAP at 1 km. The proposed maps of irrigated areas derived by exploiting soil moisture from SMAP at 1 km data set agree well (up to 78%) with the ground truth derived irrigated areas. Furthermore, the method is able to well distinguish the actually irrigated areas from rainfed agricultural areas, thus representing a useful tool to obtain reliable spatial information about the areas where irrigation actually occurs.

TI  - The Potential Scattering Model for Oil Palm Phenology Based on Spaceborne X-, C-, and L-Band Polarimetric SAR Imaging
T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Information about oil palm phenology is required for oil palm plantation management, but using spaceborne polarimetric radar imagery remains challenging. However, spaceborne polarimetric radar on X-, C-, and L-band is promising on structure vegetation and cloud area. This study investigates the scattering model of oil palm phenology based on spaceborne X-, C-, and L-band polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging. The X-, C-, and L-band polarimetric SAR are derived from spaceborne of TerraSAR-X, Sentinel-1A, and ALOS PALSAR 2. Study area is located in oil palm plantations, Asahan District, North Sumatra, Indonesia. The methodology includes data collection, preprocessing, radiometric calibration, speckle filtering, terrain correction, extraction of scattering value, and development of scattering model of oil palm phenology. The results showed different scattering characteristics for the X-, C-, and L-band polarimetric SAR of oil palm for age and found the potential of the scattering model for oil palm phenology based on the X-band on HH polarization that showed a nonlinear model with R-2 = 0.65. The C-band on VH and \TV polarization showed a nonlinear model with R-2 = 0.56 and R-2 = 0.89. The L-band on HV and HH polarization showed a logarithmic model with R-2 = 0.50 and R-2 = 0.51. In this case, the most potential of the scattering model of oil palm phenology based onR(2) is using C-band on \TV polarization. However, the scattering model based on X-, C-, and L-band is potentially to be used and applied to identify the phenology of oil palm in Indonesia, which is the main parameter in yield estimation. For the future phenology model needs to improve accuracy by integrating multisensors, including different wavelengths on optical and microwave sensors and more in situ data.

TI  - Above ground biomass carbon assessment using field, satellite data and model based integrated approach to predict the carbon sequestration potential of major land use sector of Arunachal Himalaya, India
T2  - CARBON MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The land-use sector needs special importance owing to its ability to store and emit carbon back to the atmosphere. Land-use changes and their correlations could elucidate conditions that put forests at risk of conversion to other land uses. The impact of rapid forest cover change tends to reduce the percentage of forest cover, thereby reducing the potential for carbon storage in woody biomass. The study was conducted in the state of Arunachal Pradesh to estimate the above-ground biomass, carbon pool and sequestration potential of major land-use sectors. The above-ground biomass of selected land-uses viz. dense forest, moderately dense forest, open forest, plantations, Jhum >5 years, Jhum <5 years and current jhum are 332.28 t ha(-1), 246.63 t ha(-1), 145.36 t ha(-1), 179.31 t ha(-1), 149.63 t ha(-1), 55.40 t ha(-1), 16.84 t ha(-1) respectively. The developed model is derived from Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) and Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (ARVI) for prediction of above-ground biomass (AGB) (R (2) = 0.85, p < 0.05). The resultant R (2) value of 85% predicts that 79% of accuracy could be assumed by the model. The RMSE of the model was 53.21 t ha(-1), having no multicollinearity problem keeping tolerance (0.49) and VIF (2.80). The spatial AGB density map was predicted using a step-wise linear regression model which used AGB, SAVI and ARVI of the corresponding sample plot location. The implication of the land-use change revealed that about 84% carbon will be lost from dense forest once it is converted to Jhum (Jhum is the alternate name of Shifting cultivation in India) followed by Jhum <5 years (65%). It is pertinent to mention here that, the present analysis will help the policymakers in visualizing a proper developmental goal to regulate land-use changes for achieving the higher carbon stock and maintaining balance in the global climate scenario.

TI  - Identifying the possibilities and pitfalls of conducting IUCN Red List assessments from remotely sensed habitat information based on insights from poorly known Cuban mammals
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species (RLS) is the key global tool for objective, repeatable assessment of species' extinction risk status, and plays an essential role in tracking biodiversity loss and guiding conservation action. Satellite remote sensing (SRS) data sets on global ecosystem distributions and functioning show exciting potential for informing range-based RLS assessment, but their incorporation has been restricted by low temporal resolution and coverage of data sets, lack of incorporation of degradation-driven habitat loss, and noninclusion of assumptions related to identification of changing habitat distributions for taxa with varying habitat dependency and ecologies. For poorly known mangrove-associated Cuban hutias (Mesocapromys spp.), we tested the impact of possible assumptions regarding these issues on range-based RLS assessment outcomes. Specifically, we used annual (1985-2018) Landsat data and land-cover classification and habitat degradation analyses across different internal time series slices to simulate range-based RLS assessments for our case study taxa to explore potential assessment uncertainty arising from temporal SRS data set coverage, incorporating proxies of (change in) habitat quality, and assumptions on spatial scaling of habitat extent for RLS parameter generation. We found extensive variation in simulated species-specific range-based RLS assessments, and this variation was mostly associated with the time series over which parameters were estimated. However, results of some species-specific assessments differed by up to 3 categories (near threatened to critically endangered) within the same time series, due to the effects of incorporating habitat quality and the spatial scaling used in RLS parameter estimation. Our results showed that a one-size-fits-all approach to incorporating SRS information in RLS assessment is inappropriate, and we urge caution in conducting range-based assessments with SRS for species for which habitat dependence on specific ecosystem types is incompletely understood. We propose novel revisions to parameter spatial scaling guidelines to improve integration of existing time series data on ecosystem change into the RLS assessment process.

TI  - Evaluation of various image transformation techniques for the delineation of coastal sand dune features in Tamil Nadu, South India
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Image transformation techniques such as Principal Component Analysis, Minimum Noise Fraction and Independent Component Analysis were used for extracting information from the satellite image in various fields, but its application in landform mapping seems to be very less. The objective of the study is to demonstrate the viability of less explored image transformation techniques for delineating coastal dune complex and associated features using European satellite Sentinel 2 multispectral data. Based on the difference in lithology and vegetation cover the study sites has been chosen to extract coastal dune complex features such as dune ridges, dune with or without vegetation, swale with or without vegetation and water. Overall results of ICA shows enhanced visualization followed by PCA in bringing up the fine variations, identifying micro landforms within the dune complex from the optimum band combinations. Thus, sentinel data coupled with advanced image processing technique like ICA could identify maximum information about the boundaries and micro landform within the coastal sand dune complex in a cost-effective manner. However, in areas with dense vegetation cover none of these techniques has given good results in identifying the boundary or in identifying the micro landforms.

TI  - Management of melanoma patients during COVID-19 pandemic in an Italian skin unit
T2  - DERMATOLOGIC THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the COVID-19 crisis, many scheduled medical and surgical activities have been suspended. This interruption to the healthcare system can negatively affect the diagnosis and management of melanoma. Neglecting melanoma throughout the outbreak may be associated with increased rates of mortality, morbidity, and healthcare expenses. We performed a retrospective review of all dermatological and surgical activity performed in our Melanoma Skin Unit between 23 February 2020 and 21 May 2020 and compared these data with those from the same period in 2019. During the lockdown period, we observed a decrease in dermatologic follow-up (DFU) (-30.2%) and in surgical follow-up (SFU) (-37%), and no modification of melanoma diagnosis (-3%). Finally, surgical excisions (SE) (+ 31.7%) increased, but sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) (-29%) and lymph node dissections(LND) (-64%) decreased compared to the same period in 2019. Our experience supports the continuation of surgical and diagnostic procedures in patients with melanoma during the COVID-19 pandemic. Surgical and follow-up procedures for the diagnosis and treatment of melanoma should not be postponed considering that the pandemic is lasting for an extended period.

TI  - Diversity and Epistemic Marginalisation: The Case of Inclusive Education
T2  - STUDIES IN PHILOSOPHY AND EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In the literature on inclusion and inclusive education there is a frequent conflation of (1) inclusion of diverse people, or people in all their diversity, (2) inclusion of diverse worldviews, and (3) inclusion of diverse epistemologies. Only the first of these is plausible-and perhaps even morally and politically mandatory. Of course, more needs to be said about inclusion and its possible difference from integration, conditions of access, etc. Regarding the second type of inclusion, not all worldviews merit inclusion. Moreover, worldviews and epistemologies are not identical: everyone may have a worldview but not everyone has an epistemology. Finally, the idea of diverse epistemologies makes only limited sense, as do the associated notions of 'indigenous knowledge', 'legitimation of knowledge' and 'epistemic marginalisation'.

TI  - Land consumption in cities: A comparative study across the globe
T2  - CITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land consumption delineates how effectively we use our living space - whether wastefully in area or efficiently. As the United Nations (UN) projects 5.1 billion population will live in urban areas in 2030, it is crucial to measure, compare, and understand land consumption for our cities across the globe. Currently global approaches for land consumption analysis rely on settlement layers produced by remote sensing data and population data achieved by distributing census data over settlement layers. These layers, however, do not have sufficient spatial details to capture the intra-urban structural variability within a city. In this study, we develop a classification system that consistently produces accurate local climate zone (LCZ) maps at intra-urban scale for 40 cities using Sentinel data. We use the LCZ classes as proxies to disaggregate the global population grids (GHS-POP) to this intra-urban scale. With the refined data, we perform an intra-urban land consumption analysis for 40 cities across the globe. Our measurements shows that current per-city land consumption studies severely deviate from the intra-urban variability. We argue urban land consumption at global scale must proceed to an intra-urban resolution. In addition, our measurements also indicate that urban land consumption is differing immensely across the globe.

TI  - False Discovery Rates to Detect Signals from Incomplete Spatially Aggregated Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - There are a number of ways to test for the absence/presence of a spatial signal in a completely observed fine-resolution image. One of these is a powerful nonparametric procedure called enhanced false discovery rate (EFDR). A drawback of EFDR is that it requires the data to be defined on regular pixels in a rectangular spatial domain. Here, we develop an EFDR procedure for possibly incomplete data defined on irregular small areas. Motivated by statistical learning, we use conditional simulation (CS) to condition on the available data and simulate the full rectangular image at its finest resolution many times (M, say). EFDR is then applied to each of these simulations resulting in M estimates of the signal and M statistically dependent p-values. Averaging over these estimates yields a single, combined estimate of a possible signal, but inference is needed to determine whether there really is a signal present. We test the original null hypothesis of no signal by combining the M p-values into a single p-value using copulas and a composite likelihood. If the null hypothesis of no signal is rejected, we use the combined estimate. We call this new procedure EFDR-CS and, to demonstrate its effectiveness, we show results from a simulation study; an experiment where we introduce aggregation and incompleteness into temperature-change data in the Asia-Pacific; and an application to total-column carbon dioxide from satellite remote sensing data over a region of the Middle East, Afghanistan, and the western part of Pakistan. for this article are available online.

TI  - Estimation of regional surface deformation post the 2001 Bhuj earthquake in the Kachchh region, Western India using RADAR interferometry
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The key objective of the present study is to estimate the surface displacement and to understand/monitor the active deformation pattern in the Kachchh region post the 2001 Bhuj Earthquake by implementing the Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PSI) and Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) techniques. We employed the ENVISAT ASAR (15 images), ALOS PALSAR (6 pairs) and SENTINEL-1A (117 images) data sets acquired during the periods 2003-2005, 2007-2009, and 2016-2020 respectively. The PSI results of the Envisat dataset reveals that the Kachchh mainland region has undergone an average surface deformation of +/- 22 mm/yr during 2003-2005. The maximum displacement observed from the ALOS PALSAR data sets (Window-1 to 6) during the period 2007-2009 is similar to +/- 1.2 cm. Further, the ground displacement observed from the Sentinel-1A dataset during the period 2016-2020 is +/- 16 mm/yr for the west-central region and 6 mm/yr uplift and 8 mm/yr subsidence in the eastern Kachchh mainland region. Surprisingly, high rate of deformation is detected towards the Pachham Island, Banni, Rann and the eastern region of the Kachchh after the 2001 Bhuj event. Correlating the results of different data sets, it is concluded that the deformation is high near the vicinity of the fault zones indicating the tectonically active nature of the faults. From the obtained results, we infer that, post the 2001 Bhuj earthquake, the surface displacement in the Kachchh mainland region is escalated till 2009 which is due to continuous aftershock activity and then started declining because of the ongoing seismic settlement. The acquired deformation rates are correlating well with the GPS derived displacement rates. Further, our results will assist in accurately demarcating the extent of the fault zones and also helps in precisely marking the areas undergoing active deformation, which will aid in micro zonation studies, mitigation planning and also for the preparation of an active tectonic map for the region.

TI  - Remote sensing of CDOM and DOC in alpine lakes across the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau using Sentinel-2A imagery data
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - As important components of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in an aquatic environment, colored DOM (CDOM) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) play an essential role in the carbon cycle of an inland aquatic system. Traditionally, CDOM and DOC in inland waters have been primarily determined using in situ observations and laboratory measurements. Most of past lake investigations on CDOM and DOC focused on easily accessible regions and covered a small fraction of lakes worldwide. To our knowledge, little is known about lakes in less accessible areas like the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). To address this challenge, optical satellite remote sensing might be useful for capturing a synoptic view of CDOM and DOC with high frequency at large scales, complementing in situ sampling methods for inland waters. In this study, 216 samples collected from 36 lakes across the QTP (2014-2017) were examined to determine the relationships between CDOM absorption coefficient at 350 nm (a(350)) and Sentinel-2A Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI) imagery reflectance data. A strong positive linear correlation with a(350) was observed with B4/B2 (R-2 = 0.78, p < 0.01) and with B4/B3 (R-2 = 0.62). A multi-step regression model was established for estimating a(350) with B4/B2 and B4/B3 as input variables (R-2 = 0.81, p < 0.01). A scattered CDOM-DOC relationship was revealed (R-2 = 0.34, p < 0.05) using a pooled dataset. By dividing the inland waters into four separate groups in accordance with their salinity gradients, we were able to develop much stronger relationships (R-2 > 0.8, p < 0.01) for CDOM-DOC. Significant differences between fresh and saline waters were demonstrated using satellite-derived CDOM and DOC, where high CDOM (0.86 +/- 0.67 m(-1)) and low DOC (3.76 +/- 4.92 mg L-1) concentrations were observed for freshwaters, while inverse trends of CDOM (0.53 +/- 0.72 m(-1)) and DOC (15.76 +/- 17.07 mg L-1) were demonstrated for saline lakes in the Tibetan Plateau. This study confirmed that satellite optical imagery can be used for the monitoring of CDOM and DOC of the lakes of the Tibetan Plateau, which are sensitive to a changing climate and are infrequently investigated due to the harsh environment and poor accessibility. Moreover, it highlighted the importance of combining salinity and remote sensing data in the process of estimating lake DOC.

TI  - Current profile and management of gonococcal infections: A population-based study in Western France
T2  - INFECTIOUS DISEASES NOW
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: To characterize the current profile of gonococcal infections in France, and to describe their management.Patients and method: A population-based retrospective study of all gonococcal infections documented by PCR in two French departments (Ile-et-Vilaine, Morbihan), in 2014-2016. Cases were identified through hospital databases and the Renago sentinel network.Results: We enrolled 245 patients (96 females, 149 males), with a median age of 25 years [inter quartile range, 21-33]. The incidence rate was estimated at 4.54 per 100,000 inhabitants-year. Cases were diagnosed mostly by a general practitioner (n = 122, 49.8%) or a gynecologist (n = 45, 18.4%). The main clinical presentations included urethritis (n = 59), pelvic inflammatory disease (n = 40), cervicitis (n = 12), and anorectitis (n = 11). The main coinfections were Chlamydia trachomatis (n = 40) and HIV (n = 8). Ceftriaxone MIC was <= 0.12 mg/L in 146/147 patients with positive culture. Treatment was appropriate in 52/74 (70.2%) patients with available data.Conclusions: In France, general practitioners are at the front line in management of gonococcal infections.

TI  - Inverse modelling of carbonyl sulfide: implementation, evaluation and implications for the global budget
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbonyl sulfide (COS) has the potential to be used as a climate diagnostic due to its close coupling to the biospheric uptake of CO2 and its role in the formation of stratospheric aerosol. The current understanding of the COS budget, however, lacks COS sources, which have previously been allocated to the tropical ocean. This paper presents a first attempt at global inverse modelling of COS within the 4dimensional variational data-assimilation system of the TM5 chemistry transport model (TM5-4DVAR) and a comparison of the results with various COS observations. We focus on the global COS budget, including COS production from its precursors carbon disulfide (CS2) and dimethyl sulfide (DMS). To this end, we implemented COS uptake by soil and vegetation from an updated biosphere model (Simple Biosphere Model - SiB4). In the calculation of these fluxes, a fixed atmospheric mole fraction of 500 pmol mol(-1) was assumed. We also used new inventories for anthropogenic and biomass burning emissions. The model framework is capable of closing the COS budget by optimizing for missing emissions using NOAA observations in the period 2000-2012. The addition of 432 Gg a(-1) (as S equivalents) of COS is required to obtain a good fit with NOAA observations. This missing source shows few year-to-year variations but considerable seasonal variations. We found that the missing sources are likely located in the tropical regions, and an overestimated biospheric sink in the tropics cannot be ruled out due to missing observations in the tropical continental boundary layer. Moreover, high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere require extra COS uptake or reduced emissions. HIPPO (HIAPER Pole-to-Pole Observations) aircraft observations, NOAA airborne profiles from an ongoing monitoring programme and several satellite data sources are used to evaluate the optimized model results. This evaluation indicates that COS mole fractions in the free troposphere remain underestimated after optimization. Assimilation of HIPPO observations slightly improves this model bias, which implies that additional observations are urgently required to constrain sources and sinks of COS. We finally find that the biosphere flux dependency on the surface COS mole fraction (which was not accounted for in this study) may substantially lower the fluxes of the SiB4 biosphere model over strong-uptake regions. Using COS mole fractions from our inversion, the prior biosphere flux reduces from 1053 to 851 Gg a(-1), which is closer to 738 Gg a(-1) as was found by Berry et al. (2013). In planned further studies we will implement this biosphere dependency and additionally assimilate satellite data with the aim of better separating the role of the oceans and the biosphere in the global COS budget.

TI  - A novel hybrid approach using SVM and spectral indices for enhanced land use land cover mapping of coastal urban plains
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In present study, Landsat images of years 2001, 2009 and 2018 are used for LUC mapping of a coastal-urban-floodplain wherein built-up and coastal-barren classes have been identified to be the most confusing classes for interpretation. Otsu's thresholding techniques have been used for mapping of waterbodies, built-up, and coastal-barren lands. The performance of most commonly used built-up indices have been assessed, among which BCI performed best for the study area. A new index, called Coastal-Barren-Index (CBI), has been developed using the spectral characteristics of SWIR1 and green spectral reflectance bands. A critical comparison of SVM and RFC classifiers are reported, and, finally, a hybrid approach is proposed as a combination MNDWI-CBI-SVM for mapping of the study area with Overall Accuracy 90.5% and Kappa value 0.87. The proposed approach is validated for an independent site, and, can be considered as generic in nature for LUC mapping of coastal urban plains.

TI  - The influence of urban form on the spatiotemporal variations in land surface temperature in an arid coastal city
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This article explores using satellite images to monitor spatiotemporal variations in temperature related to urban form. Land surface temperatures (LST) were estimated from Landsat images (1986-2016) and the land cover and urban form LST were extracted by using samples representing different urban forms/cover types. A transect of 20 km was taken across the city to derive the LST across the different land cover types. Urban heat island index and statistical analysis were carried out to understand the influence of urban form and cover on changes in surface temperature. The results are compared with temperature regimes of an industrial city (Yanbu) to depict differences in the two cities. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) shows variations, at 0.01 level of significance, in the LST values of the city centre, high-rise, low-density, vegetation, desert and industrial land-use types. The outcome of the study is valuable for decision-makers in achieving sustainable urban development.

TI  - To what extent can <i>Ulva</i> and <i>Sargassum</i> be detected and separated in satellite imagery?
T2  - HARMFUL ALGAE
M3  - Article
AB  - Blooms of floating macroalgae have been reported around the world, among which are recurrent blooms of Ulva prolifera and Sargassum horneri in the Yellow Sea and East China Sea. While satellite remote sensing has often been used to estimate their distributions and abundance as well as to trace their origins, because the algae mats are often much smaller than the size of an image pixel, it is unclear to what extent they can be detected and discriminated from each other in satellite imagery. Using data collected from laboratory experiments and by the Sentinel-3 OLCI (Ocean and Land Colour Instrument) and Sentinel-2 MSI (Multi Spectral Instrument) satellite instruments, we conduct simulated experiments to determine the lower detection limit and discrimination limit for these two macroalgae in different water environments and under different atmospheric conditions. For OLCI, the detection limit for both macroalgae is about 0.5% of a pixel, while the discrimination limit varies between 0.8% for clear water and 2% for turbid water. For MSI, the detection limit is about 2%, while the discrimination limit is about 6% for all water types. Below these two limits, detection and discrimination of macroalgae in these regions using the two sensors are subject to large uncertainties, thus requiring additional caution when interpreting algae areas and tracing algae origins.

TI  - Machine learning inversion approach for soil parameters estimation over vegetated agricultural areas using a combination of water cloud model and calibrated integral equation model
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating volumetric soil moisture (M-v) and surface roughness (S) are the key parameters for numerous agricultural and hydrological applications. Although these two parameters can be effectively retrieved from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, the presence of vegetation can negatively affect the results. A method was proposed to accurately estimate M-v and S over vegetated agricultural areas. The method was based on applying the machine learning inversion approach along with SAR data to invert a combination of the parameterized water cloud model (PWCM) and the calibrated integral equation model (CIEM). The soil backscattered component in water cloud model (WCM) was generated by CIEM to be applied to the WCM parameterization and dataset simulation. Three machine learning algorithms, including the support vector regression (SVR), multi-output SVR (MSVR), and artificial neural network (ANN), were employed to model the relationship between the simulated dataset variables. The genetic algorithm was also applied to optimize the models' parameters. The inversion technique results demonstrated that the MSVR and ANN had the highest accuracy in estimating M-v and S due to their better structures. The SMAPVEX-16 in situ dataset, along with three Sentinel-1 images, was applied to evaluate the accuracy of the WCM parameterization and the proposed method for M-v and S estimation. The accuracies of the PWCM in the VV and VH polarizations of Sentinel-1 C-band data were reasonable for VWC < 2.5 kg/m(2) [root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 1.44 and 1.77 dB, respectively]. Additionally, it was observed that the trained SVR, MSVR, and ANN had similar results for different VWC values. In summary, the proposed method had high potential in vegetated agricultural areas with VWC < 2.5 kg/m(2), for which the RMSEs were 4 to 7 vol. % and 0.35 to 0.46 cm depending on the VWC values in retrieving M-v and S, respectively.

TI  - Controversies in Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy for Gynecologic Malignancies
T2  - JOURNAL OF MINIMALLY INVASIVE GYNECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy represents an evolution in the advancement of minimally invasive surgical techniques for gynecologic cancers. Prospective and retrospective studies have consistently shown its accuracy in the detection of lymph node metastases for endometrial and cervical cancers. However, consistent with any emerging surgical technique in the early phases of adoption, new questions have arisen regarding its application and impact. This paper served as a scoping review to identify the key controversies that have arisen in the field of SLN biopsy for endometrial and cervical cancers.Data Sources: Several key controversies were identified, and PubMed, the Cochrane Library (cochranelibrary.com) advanced search function, and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines were searched for supporting evidence. These included search terms such as "the accuracy of SLN biopsy for high grade endometrial cancer or cervical cancers >2-cm," "cost effectiveness of SLN biopsy for gynecologic cancers," "clinical significance of low volume metastases in endometrial cancer," "morbidity of SLN biopsy for endometrial and cervical cancer," and "impact on cancer survival of SLN biopsy for endometrial and cervical cancer."Methods of Study Selection: Studies were selected for review if they included significant numbers of patients, were level I evidence, or were prospective trials. Where this level of evidence failed to exist, seminal observational series that were published in high-quality journals were included.Tabulation, Integration, and Results: Similar studies were listed and subcategorized and cross-compared, excluding those that included repeated analyses of the same patient populations. The relevant clinical trials or observational studies were clustered and reviewed for each chosen controversy. Adequate evidence supports the accuracy of SLN biopsy in the staging of high-grade endometrial cancer and cervical cancer, and it seems to be a cost-effective strategy for invasive endometrial cancer. Conclusive evidence was lacking with respect to the oncologic outcomes related to SLN biopsy, the impact on patient morbidity, and whether clinicians should treat isolated tumor cells in SLNs with adjuvant therapy.Conclusion: SLN biopsy is an accepted staging strategy for cervical and endometrial cancer surgery; however, controversies remain in how it can be applied with the most safety and efficacy. These ultimately need to be resolved with further clinical trials and observations of larger series of patients. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of AAGL.

TI  - High prevalence, intensity, and genetic diversity of <i>Trichinella</i> spp. in wolverine (<i>Gulo gulo</i>) from Yukon, Canada
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Species of Trichinella are globally important foodborne parasites infecting a number of domestic and wild vertebrates, including humans. Free-ranging carnivores can act as sentinel species for detection of Trichinella spp. Knowledge of the epidemiology of these parasites may help prevent Trichinella spp. infections in northern Canadian animals and people. Previous research on Trichinella spp. in wildlife from Yukon did not identify risk factors associated with infection, or the diversity and identity of species of Trichinella in regional circulation, based on geographically extensive sampling with large sample sizes.Methods: In a cross-sectional study, we determined the prevalence, infection intensity, risk factors, and species or genotypes of Trichinella in wolverine (Gulogulo) in two regions of Yukon, Canada, from 2013-2017. A double reparatory funnel digestion method followed by mutiplex PCR and PCR-RFLP were used to recover and identify species of Trichinella, respectively.Results: We found larvae of Trichinella in the tongues of 78% (95% CI 73-82) of 338 wolverine sampled. The odds of adult (>= 2 years) and yearling (1 year) wolverine being Trichinella spp.-positive were four and two times higher, respectively, compared to juveniles (<1 year). The odds of Trichinella spp. presence were three times higher in wolverine from southeast than northwest Yukon. The mean intensity of infection was 22.6 +/- 39 (SD, range 0.1-295) larvae per gram. Trichinella T6 was the predominant genotype (76%), followed by T. nativa (8%); mixed infections with Trichinella T6 and T. nativa (12%) were observed. In addition, T. spiralis was detected in one wolverine. Out of 22 isolates initially identified as T. nativa in multiplex PCR, 14 were analyzed by PCR-RFLP to distinguish them from T. chanchalensis, a recently discovered cryptic species, which cannot be distinguished from the T. nativa on multiplex PCR. Ten isolates were identified either as T. chanchalensis alone (n = 7), or mixed infection with T chanchalensis and T nativa (n= 2) or T. chanchalensis and Trichinella T6 (n =1)].Conclusions: Wolverine hosted high prevalence, high larval intensity, and multiple species of Trichinella, likely due to their scavenging habits, apex position in the food chain, and wide home range. Wolverine (especially adult males) should be considered as a sentinel species for surveys for Trichinella spp. across their distributional range.

TI  - An organelle-tethering mechanism couples flagellation to cell division in bacteria
T2  - DEVELOPMENTAL CELL
M3  - Article
AB  - In some free-living and pathogenic bacteria, problems in the synthesis and assembly of early flagellar components can cause cell-division defects. However, the mechanism that couples cell division with the flagellar biogenesis has remained elusive. Herein, we discover the regulator MadA that controls transcription of flagellar and cell-division genes in Caulobacter crescentus. We demonstrate that MadA, a small soluble protein, binds the type III export component FlhA to promote activation of FliX, which in turn is required to license the conserved sigma(54)-dependent transcriptional activator FlbD. While in the absence of MadA, FliX and FlbD activation is crippled, bypass mutations in FlhA restore flagellar biogenesis and cell division. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MadA safeguards the divisome stoichiometry to license cell division. We propose that MadA has a sentinel-type function that senses an early flagellar biogenesis event and, through cell-division control, ensures that a flagellated offspring emerges.

TI  - Relational Work and the Knowledge Transfer Process: Rituals in Rural Ghana
T2  - ORGANIZATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We advance understandings of knowledge transfer by showing the central role of symbolic action, taking the form of ritual, in contexts characterized by worldview differences. Using qualitative data from interactions between farming communities in rural Ghana and agriculture development specialists, we examine how rituals do relational work that enables informational work. We find that rituals (i.e., visits, value affirmations, gift-giving, prayer, performing, storytelling) do so by means of their functions-bracketing worldview differences, modeling collaboration between farmers and agriculture development specialists, and packaging new knowledge in displays of compatibility. Our work also expands scholarship on the role of rituals in organizations and on management practices in Africa. Overall, our paper offers a complex, comprehensive view of knowledge transfer as involving both relational and informational work and relying on both symbolic action and tangible elements.

TI  - The <i>CHEK2</i>*1100delC Mutation and Adolescent Breast Cancer: A Case Report of Breast Cancer in a 19-Year-Old and a Review of the Literature
T2  - BREAST CARE
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Breast cancer (BC) is the most common non-skin cancer affecting women but is extremely uncommon in the adolescent population. Genetic inheritance has been linked to CHEK2 is an uncommon genetic variant with a reported incidence of 0.3-1.6% in the general population and 4.9-5.7% in those with a family history of BC. Commonly, this mutation presents in females of European descent and is rare in North America. Case Presentation: A 19-year-old Caucasian female presented with breast pain and mass. She had an extensive family history of cancer, as well as a known CHEK2 gene mutation in 2 of her paternal aunts. Ultrasound and MRI confirmed a 4.5-cm mass with an enlarged right axillary lymph node. Image guided biopsy of the breast mass showed ER/PR-positive grade 1 invasive mucinous ductal cancer. Genetic testing confirmed an isolated CHEK2 mutation. After discussion by a multidisciplinary tumor board, the patient deferred bilateral mastectomy and underwent a right mastectomy with sentinel-lymph-node biopsy and immediate tissue-expander reconstruction. Final pathology confirmed ER/PR-positive Stage 1A (pT2 pN0 M0) invasive mucinous carcinoma. Chemotherapy was not recommended. Summary: Malignant adolescent breast masses are relatively rare and CHEK2 does not typically present at younger than 20 years of age. While there are many different differential diagnoses when evaluating an adolescent with a breast mass, we wish to increase providers' suspicion of malignancy, specifically in those individuals who have a strong family history of BC and the CHEK2*1100delC mutation.

TI  - Longitudinal Changes in Exercise Capacity in Patients Who Underwent Ross Procedure and Mechanical Aortic Valve Replacement: Does the Type of Surgery Matter?
T2  - PEDIATRIC CARDIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The surgical options for significant aortic valve disease include either Ross procedure (RP) or aortic valve replacement (AVR). The exercise stress test is routinely performed in these patients to assess the objective functional capacity. This retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the differences and the longitudinal changes of exercise capacity in patients following the RP and AVR for aortic valve disease. This is an IRB approved retrospective study and included patients who had either RP or AVR performed for aortic valve disease and had at least one exercise stress test performed after the surgical procedure. Patients with other congenital heart disease, pacemaker or defibrillators, and those with inadequate data were excluded. Demographic data including age at surgery, type of surgery and type of aortic valve was collected. Data regarding treadmill cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) was also collected. A total of 47 patients met inclusion criteria and were equally represented in each group, i.e. RP [n = 23, 73.9% male, age at surgery 11.2 (4.5-15.9) years] vs. AVR [n = 24, 88% mechanical AVR, 60.9% male, age at surgery 15.1 (12.8-19.4) years]. There was a significant decline in predicted oxygen consumption (%VO2) at time of first post-operative CPET in patients after AVR compared to RP (79 vs. 88%, p = 0.048) over a similar accrued median interval follow-up (4.6 vs. 6.2 years, p = 0.2). The longitudinal follow-up analysis of following AVR (n = 11, 54.5% male, median inter-test duration of 5 years) showed significant decline in peak exercise capacity or VO2 (34.2 vs. 26.2 vs., p = 0.006). In contrast, after RP (n = 12 patients [58.3% male, median inter-test duration 7.1 of years], exercise capacity and other key parameters remained preserved. In this small sentinel study, we report a better initial exercise capacity among patients after RP compared to AVR over an intermediate follow-up. During longitudinal follow-up in a subset of patients, exercise capacity remained preserved amongst the RP group while it further declined in the AVR group.

TI  - New challenges of marine ecotoxicology in a global change context
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, research agenda in marine ecotoxicology is facing new challenges with the emergence of newly and complex synthetized chemicals. The study of the fate and adverse effects of toxicants remains increasingly complicated with global change events. Ecotoxicology had provided for a decades, precious scientific data and knowledge but also technical and management tools for the environmental community. Regarding those, it is necessary to update methodologies dealing with these issues such as combined effect of conventional and emergent stressors and global changes. In this point of view article, we discuss one hand the new challenges of ecotoxicology in this context, and in the other hand, the need of updating agenda and methodologies currently used in monitoring programs and finally recommendations and future research needs. Among recommendations, it could be cited the necessity to perform long-term experiments, the standardization of sentinel species and taking benefit from baseline studies and omics technologies.

TI  - Shore Zone Classification from ICESat-2 Data over Saint Lawrence Island
T2  - MARINE GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - The shore zone is the most active zone in the atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere and lithosphere of nature, and has the environmental characteristics of both ocean and land. The ICESat-2 satellite provides height measurements of shore zone using a photon-counting LiDAR. The purpose of this study is to explore the application potential of ICESat-2 satellite data in shore zone classification. Saint Lawrence Island, Alaska, was chosen as the study area. Firstly, in this study, the upper and lower boundaries of the shore zone of the study area were extracted based on Google Earth images. The slope and width between the two boundaries were then calculated according to the formula. Secondly, six statistical indicators (standard deviation, relative standard deviation, average absolute deviation, relative average deviation, absolute median error and quartile deviation) related to the substrate and sediment classification that could reflect the characteristics of the shore zone profile were extracted, and the statistical indicators were used as input parameters of the softmax regression model for classification. Finally, the accuracy of the shore zone classification was validated using the ShoreZone classification system. The results show that, among the 246 shore zone sections in the study area, 86% (212) has been correctly classified. The results therefore indicate that ICESat-2 data can be used to support the characterization of shore zone morphology.

TI  - Interseismic slip rate and locking along the Maqin?Maqu Segment of the East Kunlun Fault, Northern Tibetan Plateau, based on Sentinel-1 images
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The East Kunlun Fault (EKF) is one of the most active left-lateral strike-slip faults of the Tibetan Plateau and defines the northern boundary of the Bayan Har Block. Many strong earthquakes have occurred over the past century in the western segment of the EKF, whereas few historical earthquakes have occurred in the eastern segment, that is, the Maqin?Maqu segment (MMS). Therefore, the MMS is widely recognized as a seismic gap with high risk. For this purpose, the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technique was used to process Sentinel-1 images of the MMS in the EKF to determine the interseismic deformation velocity field during 2014?2019. Then, the slip rate and locking of the MMS were obtained. The results are as follows. (1) The slip rate gradually decreased from west to east along the Maqin?Maqu Segment, i.e., from -8 mm/year to -2 mm/year, and a significantly low slip-rate zone exists near the Maqin Segment. (2) Four asperities having a high seismic risk were identified in the Maqin?Maqu Segment. (3) Based on the determined slip rate and previous studies, we propose that the deformation of the Bayan Har Block can be explained with a nonrigid passive bookshelf model.

TI  - Assessing the spatial distribution and impacts of recent oil spill along the Western Coast of Karachi, Pakistan
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil spill is an environmental challenthat influences various aspects of coastal zones including humans, health, economy, and coastal ecosystems. The source of the oil spill can be both natural and anthropogenic. Oil spill response is dependent on the prompt detection of spillain open waters and at the coast. This study uses Sentinel-1 (S-1) C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data to detect oil spill that transpired at Karachi's coastline from 23 to 26 October 2018. The oil spill detection was conducted using the K-means clustering algorithm of S-1 SAR data that involves reduction of speckle. Meteorological data consisting of wind speed and direction from S-1 Level-2 Ocean product (L2 OCN) based on the European Centre for Medium-RanWeather Forecasts (ECMWF) was also utilized. Initially, two long streaks of bunker oil covering an approximate area of 9.45 km(2) was detected on 23 October 2018. Later oil spill spread over an area of similar to 188.30 km(2) (similar to 20 times more) until 26 October 2018 along the Karachi shoreline. Spilled oil covered similar to 20 times more of its first spread area at an alarming rate of similar to 37.63 km(2) per day due to wind and wave action. Oil spill damaged the local ecology along the western coast of Karachi. Such damages can be avoided by installing an oil spill monitoring system using SAR and ground data which will support both environment and economy.

TI  - Biophysical controls of increased tundra productivity in the western Canadian Arctic
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid climate warming has widely been considered as the main driver of recent increases in Arctic tundra productivity. Field observations and remote sensing both show that tundra "greening" has been widespread, but heterogeneity in regional and landscape-scale trends suggest that additional controls are mediating the response of tundra vegetation to warming. In this study, we examined the relationship between changes in vegetation productivity in the western Canadian Arctic and biophysical variables by analyzing trends in the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) obtained from nonparametric regression of annual Landsat surface reflectance composites. We used Random Forests classification and regression tree modelling to predict the trajectory and magnitude of greening from 1984 to 2016 and identify biophysical controls. More than two-thirds of our study area showed statistically significant increases in vegetation productivity, but observed changes were heterogeneous, occurring most rapidly within areas of the Southern Arctic that were: (1) dominated by dwarf and upright shrub cover types, (2) moderately sloping, and (3) located at lower elevation. These findings suggest that the response of tundra vegetation to warming is mediated by regional- and landscape-scale variation in microclimate, topography and soil moisture, and physiological differences among plant functional groups. Our work highlights the potential of the joint analysis of annual remotely sensed vegetation indices and broad-scale biophysical data to understand spatial variation in tundra vegetation change.

TI  - Competing Identity Cues in the Hostile Media Phenomenon: Source, Nationalism, and Perceived Bias in News Coverage of Foreign Affairs
T2  - MASS COMMUNICATION AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The global media ecology offers news audiences a wide variety of sources for international news and interpretation of foreign affairs, and this kind of news coverage may increase the salience of both domestic and national partisan identity cues. Based upon the recognition that individuals hold multiple partisan identities that can be more or less salient in different situations, the current study draws upon self-categorization and social identity theory to design a set of studies that pit competing partisan identities against one another. The results of two experiments indicate that both national and domestic partisan identities are directly related to perceived media bias regarding the coverage of U.S-Chinese relations from both domestic and foreign media sources.Results varied based on the dimension of media bias considered, with perceived favorability towards the United States impacted more consistently by source origin than perceived favorability toward personal worldview.Results are discussed in terms of how they advance theory about perceived media bias, specifically in light of the implications of the global media environment for our understanding of partisanship.

TI  - Upstream flows drive the productivity of floodplain ecosystems in tropical Queensland
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rivers in tropical systems across the world are well known for their strong connections with floodplain wetlands. However, increased water needs and changing climate could drive water-management policy that leads to major changes in flow or surface water availability. These changes could have deleterious effects on ecological functions and ecosystem services provided by these freshwater ecosystems (e.g., groundwater recharge, food sources for fish, etc.). In this study, we introduce a cloud-based monitoring framework using multi-resolution satellite observations (2007 -2020), historical surface inundation (1984 -2015), and gauge data to better understand these connections in a large river catchment in tropical Queensland (Mitchell River catchment). A key driver and indicator of floodplain productivity, surface water inundation and aquatic biomass distribution respectively, are investigated to provide insight that underpins the prioritization of future surface water developments in this region. Results show that the characteristics of floodplain inundation; loss, persistence, gain and frequency, vary in time and space, and are driven by climate variability. The largest gain (7200 Ha) and persistence (8437 Ha) in total surface inundation were observed in the wet seasons during the periods of 2007 -2019, respectively. In the downstream catchment, permanent water surface area was approximately 4.5% (of the total downstream region) compared to the upstream region (2.7%). There is a higher proportion of new permanent water features (16.8%) and new seasonal (30%) surface water classes in the upstream are in contrast to the downstream section (0.7% and 9.6%, respectively). Using multivariate statistics, floodplain productivity was linked to inter-annual changes in flow and rainfall. A partial least squares regression (PLSR) model shows upstream flows drive changes in total floodplain inundation (observed vs predicted, r = 0.95, p = 0.000). Flows and local rainfall accounted for approximately 60% (r = 0.77, p = 0.005) and 25% (r = 0.50, p = 0.120) of the variability in total floodplain inundation, respectively. Different PLSR modelling scenarios confirmed that upstream flows are primary drivers of floodplain inundation and substantial lost in total surface inundation could happen if flows are altered. Just as local rainfall has limited impact on total floodplain inundation (r = 0.92, p = 0.000; for model excluding local rainfall), aquatic plant biomass accumulations are also strongly associated with upstream flows (e.g., r = 0.82). Given the dependence of downstream water level (r = 0.89) and floodplain inundation on upstream flows, sustainable management of river flows in the Mitchell River is fundamentally important to floodplain productivity.

TI  - Mapping mineralogy in evaporite basins through time using multispectral Landsat data: Examples from the Bonneville basin, Utah, USA
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Bonneville basin, located in north-western Utah, is a vast evaporite basin which is home to the world-renowned Bonneville Salt Flats international speedway and is a highly valued landscape undergoing rapid change and anthropogenic influence. Air quality, snowpack, the local hydrological system, and state tourism are all impacted by the nature of the surface sediments exposed in the Bonneville basin. Mapping the Bonneville basin over time with remote sensing methods provides insight into the dynamics and impacts of the changing surface landscape. Utilizing the Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensors, a set of band math indices are empirically established to map the predominant halite, gypsum, and carbonates mineralogical zones of the Bonneville basin. Spectral comparisons of representative samples from the study area and image-derived spectra indicate the halite of the Bonneville basin is wet and that gypsum deposits are slightly mixed with halite. The established indices are assessed in four ways, all of which support the ability of the indices to accentuate the associated mineralogical endmembers. Two study areas within the Bonneville basin are investigated temporally from 1986, 1995, 2005, and 2016 and show changing patterns in mineral distribution that align with surface processes active through these timescales. These indices provide a resource for mapping mineralogy though time in evaporite basins globally with diverse applications for questions about land use and environmental change.

TI  - Temporal fluctuations of siachen glacier velocity: a repeat pass sar interferometry based approach
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier velocity, the glacier's health indicator, is an emerging research interest in global warming among the scientific community over the current decade. As per scientific reports, due to their stable and advanced nature, the glaciers of Karakoram are exclusive. The present study focuses on understanding the temporal velocity variability of the Siachen Glacier, Shyok Basin, Karakoram using SAR datasets, in the perspective of the difficulties in estimating the glacier velocity over the inaccessible Karakoram Mountain. For the hydrological year 2017-18, 30 sentinel-1 derived interferograms using the DInSAR technique were analyzed to obtain Line Of Sight velocity. The transient velocity of the glacier reflects separate patterns within the glacier for different seasons due to the thermodynamic and orographic system over the glacier surface. In azimuth and range direction, the projected annual LOS velocity to a two-dimensional surface velocity is estimated to be around 103.8 +/- 3.1 m/year.

TI  - Species Distribution Modelling performance and its implication for Sentinel-2-based prediction of invasive <i>Prosopis juliflora</i> in lower Awash River basin, Ethiopia
T2  - ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundSpecies Distribution Modelling (SDM) coupled with freely available multispectral imagery from Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite provides an immense contribution in monitoring invasive species. However, attempts to evaluate the performances of SDMs using S2 spectral bands and S2 Radiometric Indices (S2-RIs) and biophysical variables, in particular, were limited. Hence, this study aimed at evaluating the performance of six commonly used SDMs and one ensemble model for S2-based variables in modelling the current distribution of Prosopis juliflora in the lower Awash River basin, Ethiopia. Thirty-five variables were computed from Sentinel-2B level-2A, and out of the variables, twelve significant variables were selected using Variable Inflation Factor (VIF). A total of 680 presence and absence data were collected to train and validate variables using the tenfold bootstrap replication approach in the R software "sdm" package. The performance of the models was evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, True Skill Statistics (TSS), kappa coefficient, area under the curve (AUC), and correlation.ResultsOur findings demonstrated that except bioclim all machine learning and regression models provided successful prediction. Among the tested models, Random Forest (RF) performed better with 93% TSS and 99% AUC followed by Boosted Regression Trees (BRT), ensemble, Generalized Additive Model (GAM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Generalized Linear Model (GLM) in decreasing order. The relative influence of vegetation indices was the highest followed by soil indices, biophysical variables, and water indices in decreasing order. According to RF prediction, 16.14% (1553.5 km(2)) of the study area was invaded by the alien species.ConclusionsOur results highlighted that S2-RIs and biophysical variables combined with machine learning and regression models have a higher capacity to model invasive species distribution. Besides, the use of machine learning algorithms such as RF algorithm is highly essential for remote sensing-based invasive SDM.

TI  - Comparison of the accuracy of daytime land surface temperature retrieval methods using Landsat 8 images in arid regions
T2  - INFRARED PHYSICS & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a significant parameter in surface and atmospheric systems which can be used to describe the physical processes of energy and water exchange. There are several ways to retrieve land surface temperature using satellite imagery. The purpose of the current study is to compare the accuracy of different LST retrieval algorithms, including 11 types of split-window algorithms, two mono-window algorithms, and three single-channel algorithms. The validation of LST retrieval algorithms was done using temperature-based and cross-validation methods. In this study, 20 images from Landsat 8 satellite related to 2017 and 2018 were used to retrieve LST in different ways. The temperatures obtained from different methods were compared in one day, and the average of LST of the different methods was about 5. different, which indicates the importance of the existing validation methods. Using Sentinel-2 image classification, 20 points in homogeneous areas with pure pixels were selected to measure the LST using a thermometer for land validation. Results showed that in a split window algorithm which was applied on the water vapor image, the RMSE error has been reduced by 2 degrees C. In cross-validation, MODIS LST images were used, and RMSE temporal image was prepared, and classified into five groups including less than 2, 2-3, 3-4 and more than 5 degrees C Comparing the area of each of these groups in different methods showed that MW2 and SW1 methods have less accuracy than the other methods. The SW9 algorithm can retrieve temperature with an error of less than 2. in 80% of the area. The results of cross-validation showed that the SC2 algorithm had the highest accuracy among the algorithms that use a thermal band for LST retrieval with a RMSE spatial of 5.3 degrees C and the SW10 and SW11 have shown the highest accuracy among the algorithms that use two thermal bands with RMSE less than 5 degrees C In general, the algorithms that use atmospheric transmittance coefficients and water vapor as inputs are more accurate than the others.

TI  - Impervious surface growth and its inter-relationship with vegetation cover and land surface temperature in peri-urban areas of Delhi
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial changes in urban areas are closely associated with the increasing impervious land and thus, monitoring the spatio-temporal changes in impervious area is crucial for identifying urban growth. The capital city of India, Delhi has become one of the most populated cities of the world for its fast-growing economy and infrastructural development. Although the city is expanding since the last couple of decades, the rate of growth has become significantly high in the previous decade. This study aims to identify the spatio-temporal pattern of impervious surface growth in and around Delhi National Capital Territory (NCT) by using bi-temporal Landsat images of 2003 and 2014. The linear spectral unmixing (LSU) technique was employed for assessing the impervious surface growth over the megacity. To understand the associated changes of such growth, vegetation surface fraction (VSF), land surface temperature (LST) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were estimated and compared with the impervious surface fraction (ISF). Further, the fractional abundance of impervious surface was validated with built-up density, urban expansion and population density of the area. This study reveals the significant growth of impervious land in the peri-urban centres surrounding Delhi. The fractional abundance of impervious surface was found highly correlated with the vegetation surface fraction, LST and NDVI. The significant (p < 0.005) correlation coefficients prove good agreement among these variables. Strong negative correlation (r2 = 0.857) between ISF and urban expansion index (UEI) proves the potentiality for urban expansion in the less developed areas with abundant pervious surface. The study also reveals a significant polynomial relationship (r2 = 0.746) between impervious surface fraction and population density indicating high ISF (0.9-1.0) in the densely populated areas and vice-versa. The expanding impervious surface especially in the peri-urban centres along with the rising intensity of urban heat island (UHI) calling for suitable planning and strategies for sustainable urban growth.

TI  - Aboveground biomass estimates of tropical mangrove forest using Sentinel-1 SAR coherence data - The superiority of deep learning over a semi-empirical model
T2  - COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The availability of advanced Machine Learning algorithms has made the estimation process of biophysical parameters more efficient. However, the efficiency of those methods seldom compared with the efficiency of already established semi-empirical procedures. Aboveground biomass (AGB) of mangrove forests is a crucial biophysical parameter as it is positively correlated to the carbon stocks and fluxes. The free availability of Sentinel-1 C-band SAR data and machine learning algorithms hold promises in estimating AGB of tropical mangrove forests. We reported high AGB (70 t/ha to 666 t/ha) using 185 field quadrats of 0.04ha each from Bhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary, located on the eastern Indian coast that could be attributed to species composition. The AGB maps generated using Interferometric Water Cloud Model (IWCM) and Deep Learning models were different from each other as they rely on different variables. IWCM was more dependent, especially on ground and vegetation components of coherence, while canopy height acted as the most crucial variable in the Deep Learning model. However, the negligible variations in Deep Learning-based AGB maps can be attributed to interpreting the importance of coherence and VH backscatter. Due to low canopy penetration power of C-band SAR, high temporal decorrelation resulting from longer time gap between interferometric image pairs, and high spatial heterogeneity of mangrove forests, IWCM found as an unsuitable method for AGB estimation. Interestingly, a Deep Learning algorithm could translate the exact relationship between predictor variables and mangrove AGB in Bhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary. The AGB estimation studies in mangrove forests using Sentinel data should focus more on using machine learning algorithms like Deep Learning rather than semi-empirical models.

TI  - An automatic method for clean glacier and nonseasonal snow area change estimation in High Mountain Asia from 1990 to 2018
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale glacier area expansion or shrinkage is among the most conspicuous indicators of regional and global climate change. Glacier extraction from satellite images is an essential step in large-scale area change monitoring. However, glacier extraction is usually influenced by cloud cover and seasonal snow, and thus far, there is no effective and automatic method to monitor glacier area change in large regions. In this study, a new method `multi-temporal minimum NDSI composite' is proposed for clean glacier and nonseasonal snow extraction, and the results agree well with the glacier inventory (excluding the debris part), except in Himalayan regions where non-seasonal snow exists widely out of glaciers. This method is also used to estimate the glacier and nonseasonal snow area changes in High Mountain Asia (HMA) over the past 29 years. With this method, we can use abundant Landsat images of summer seasons from continuous years to composite a cloud-free and seasonal snow-free glacial image pixel by pixel. Glacial maps for the whole HMA are produced every 10 years beginning in 1990, so glacier changes are presented in different subregions and periods. The number of images which is used to composite a glacial map in each pixel is also given for uncertainty analysis. According to the results, the clean glacier and nonseasonal snow area in HMA decreased by -0.43 +/- 0.19%/a during 1990-2018 but had high temporal and spatial heterogeneity. Clean glacier and nonseasonal snow area decreased rapidly during 1990-2000, slowed down during 2000-2010, and then sped up during 2010-2018. The fastest reductions were in Hengduan Shan at rates of approximately -1.05 +/- 0.09%/a, and the only area with growth (at a rate of 0.50 +/- 0.11%/a) was in West Kun Lun during 1990-2018.

TI  - Forest fire risk mapping using analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and earth observation datasets: a case study in the mountainous terrain of Northeast India
T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a geospatial approach in conjunction with a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) tool for mapping forest fire risk zones in the district of Ri-Bhoi, Meghalaya, India which is very rich in biodiversity. Analytical hierarchy process (AHP)-based pair-wise comparison matrix was constructed to compare the selected parameters against each other based on their impact/influence (equal, moderate, strong, very strong, and extremely strong) on a forest fire. The final output delineated fire risk zones in the study area in four categories that include very high-risk, high-risk, moderate-risk, and low-risk zones. The delineated fire risk zones were found to be in close agreement with actual fire points obtained from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) fire data for the study area. Results indicated that Ri-Bhoi's 804.31 sq. km. (32.86%) the area was under 'very high' fire susceptibility. This was followed by 583.10 sq. km. (23.82%), 670.47 sq. km. (27.39%), and 390.12 sq. km. (15.93%) the area under high, moderate, and low fire risk categories, respectively. These results can be used effectively to plan fire control measures in advance and the methodology suggested in this study can be adopted in other areas too for delineating potential fire risk zones.

TI  - Electromagnetic shielding behavior of epoxy multi-hybrid composites comprises of E-glass fiber, Ag nanoparticle, and Ni nanosheet: A novel approach
T2  - POLYMER COMPOSITES
M3  - Article
AB  - High performance epoxy based EMI shielding hybrid composites were prepared and characterized for their mechanical, magnetic, and Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) shielding behavior. The aim of this research was to enhance the electromagnetic interference shielding effect of a nanocomposite at high frequency with good mechanical strength. The shielding effectiveness of the epoxy composite was improved via the addition of E-glass/silver nanoparticle and nickel nanosheets. The reinforcements were silane surface modified to enhance the adhesion and dispersion of reinforcements with matrix. The composites were prepared via hand layup process using glass fiber, silver nanoparticle, and Ni nanosheets followed by room temperature curing. The characterization of hybrid composites was done in accordance with ASTM standards. The results revealed that the Ag and Ni along with E-glass fiber improved conductivity, permittivity, and permeability of epoxy composite. Similarly, the mechanical behavior of nanocomposite was found to be increased for tensile, flexural, and Izod impact toughness. Moreover, a maximum wave attenuation of -48 dB was observed for 3-mm thick composite shielding material in "J" band frequency. These mechanically sound high EMI shielding lightweight polymer composites could be used as potential material for aerospace, defense, tele-communication, and satellite data transfer applications. Besides the reduction of EMI effect between electronic gadgets could improves the utility and life span of electromagnetic devices and gadgets in several engineering applications.

TI  - Ground and satellite phenology in alpine forests are becoming more heterogeneous across higher elevations with warming
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The role of temperature as a key driver for plant phenology is well established. However, an increasing lack of winter chilling may strongly slow down spring phenological advances in the course of warming. Along elevational gradients in the mountains, differential changes in winter chilling as well as more homogeneous leaf unfolding due to warming have been observed. In this study, we analyzed the elevation-linked lapse rates of phenological ground observations and remote sensing data in the pre-alpine and alpine regions of the Bavarian Alps, Germany. Seasonal start (SOS) and end of season (EOS) dates were extracted from time series data of 4-day maximum value composite Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) sensor's Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for the years 2001-2016. Longer snow duration in the alpine region could be a possible reason of higher SOS elevational lapse rates as compared to the pre-alpine region. Significant and maximum differences in SOS rates between alpine and pre-alpine areas were observed in years with preceding warm winters with insufficient chilling. Minimum differences in SOS elevational lapse rates along the elevational gradients were found for cold spring and cold winter years. The MODIS-based SOS showed the highest correspondence when validated against the gridded German Meteorological Service (DWD) leaf unfolding data. However, EOS dates were in comparatively lower agreement with DWD data, and their lapse rates in the pre-alpine and alpine regions were difficult to validate. Contrary to the SOS, lower positive lapse rates of EOS were revealed in the alpine but not in the pre-alpine areas.

TI  - Geological mapping and mineral prospectivity using remote sensing and GIS in parts of Hamissana, Northeast Sudan
T2  - JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, various geological activities and different mineral prospecting and exploration programs have been intensified along the Red Sea hills in order to elucidate the geological maps and to evaluate the mineral potentials. This study is therefore aimed at testing the viability of using remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) techniques for geological mapping and prospecting for gold mineralization in the area. The study area is located in northeast Sudan and covers an area of about 1379 km(2). Different digital image processing techniques were applied to Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager image in order to increase the discrimination between various lithological units and to delineate wall rock alteration which represents target zones for gold mineralization. Image sharpening was performed to enhance the spatial resolution of the images for more detailed information. Contrast stretching was applied after the various digital processing procedures to produce more interpretable images. The principal component analysis transformations yielded saturated images and resulted in more interpretable images than the original data. Several ratio images were prepared, combined together and displayed in RGB color composite ratio images. This process revealed the existence of alteration zones in the study area. These zones extend from the northeast to the southwest in the acid meta-volcanic and silica barite rocks. The enhanced satellite images were implemented in the GIS environment to facilitate the final production of the geological map at scale 1:400,000. X-ray fluorescence analyses prove that selected samples taken from the wall rock alteration zones are gold-bearing.

TI  - Uncertainties in Digital Elevation Models from Global Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) digital topography data in the Indian subcontinent
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The study of the Earth's topographic surface using digital topography is an important component of many problems in the Earth Sciences. The 30-m Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) global digital topography datasets have been the most recently available global digital topography datasets. Most users directly download the data/DEMs in their native form assuming a vertical error close to their mission goals. We demonstrate, through the use of 221 dual-frequency static Global Positioning System (GPS) independent ground control points, that the datasets typically have outliers and voids that increase the error by an order of magnitude. Filtering the voids, outliers, and correcting systematic errors significantly improved the vertical accuracy of the datasets. We concluded from our study that the ALOS data generated the most accurate DEM in the Indian subcontinent. This finding needs to be tested and confirmed worldwide for generating the best DEMs.

TI  - Recent forest area increase in Europe: expanding and regenerating forests differ in their regional patterns, drivers and productivity trends
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In Europe, forest area is increasing. These recently established forests can be classified into regenerating after disturbances or expanding into agricultural areas after abandonment. We used European Space Agency land cover maps and MODIS data to investigate which socioenvironmental drivers influenced recent forest expansion and regeneration in Europe from 1992 to 2015 and to compare their productivity by means of the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). Our results showed that forest area increased in Europe by 1.4% from 1992 to 2015. The 66% of this forest area increase corresponded to forest expansion mostly in Mediterranean and temperate regions, while regeneration (34%) dominated in boreal areas. Forest area and land cover diversity in 1992 were the main drivers of local forest area increase from 1992 to 2015. Forest expansion occurred on the warmer zones far from urban areas in the boreal region while it was the opposite in temperate and Mediterranean areas. On the other hand, forest regeneration showed mostly a positive relation with the distance to urban areas and water availability but no relation with temperature. The EVI values in 2015 were higher in expanding than in regenerating forests except in the warmer and drier bioclimates of Europe. These EVI trends suggest a higher productivity of expanding forests, except in areas where they cannot benefit from biological and physicochemical legacies of abandoned agricultural soils for tree growth, owing to water shortage. In sum, our results highlight that recent forest area increase in Europe is mostly caused by forest expansion into former agricultural areas but this is mostly occurring in less productive (warmer and drought-prone) bioclimates where advantages of agricultural legacies may not occur. Ultimately, this casts doubts whether there may be a limit for the role of forest expansion into agricultural areas for carbon sequestration in the long term.

TI  - Application of remote sensing in alpine grasslands cover mapping of western Himalaya, Uttarakhand, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Grasslands are the world's most extensive terrestrial ecosystem, which provides a variety of services for humans, such as carbon storage, food production, crop pollination, pest regulation, and are a major feed source for livestock. However, grasslands are today one of the most endangered ecosystems due to land-use change, agricultural intensification, land abandonment, as well as climate change. Grasslands are an integral part of human societies across the globe, which are broadly known as tropical savannah and temperate grasslands. In the Himalayan region, grasslands are found in more than 55% of the area and different climatic conditions lead to different varieties of grasslands like Danthonia grasslands, kobresia sedge meadow, etc. Grasslands deal with the spatial and temporal distribution of heterogeneous landscapes, which support a high diversity of various species. Owing to very rugged terrain and inaccessibility, the information on the extent of alpine grassland and percent grass cover (%) across the meadows is limited. Therefore, the present attempt was made to assess the current status of grassland in the alpine region of Uttarakhand above 3000 m asl. LANDSAT-8 (OLI and TIRS sensors) satellite data were used to delineate the grasslands using normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVIs) of the alpine region with the help of over 179 ground truth points out of which 50 points are testing points and 129 points are training points. Grass covers (%) were also assessed in the whole alpine region of Western Himalaya of Uttarakhand which nearly consists of over 75 meadows by using random plots (1x1 m, total 10 per site) in each meadow. Overall, 89.52% accuracy was achieved based on 50 randomly selected testing points. A total of 4949.25 sq. km area is under the different percentage of grass cover in the alpine region of Uttarakhand, Western Himalaya. Danthonia grasslands below 4000 m and Kobresia sedge meadows above 4000 m elevation are dominant in the state. In the alpine region, over 1056 sq. km grassland area have less than 10% grass cover indicating higher degraded and cold desert areas and only 565.69 sq. km area have more than 60% grass cover, which is highly favorable for rich biodiversity and grazing.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Although completion lymph node dissection (CLND) is not routinely performed for a positive sentinel lymph node (SLN) anymore, adjuvant therapy depends on the risk factors available from SLN biopsy, including the risk of nonsentinel node metastases (NSNM). A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed in an attempt to identify risk factors that could be used to predict the risk of NSNM.Materials and methods: Medline, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane were searched for articles discussing predictive factors for NSNM. PRISMA guidelines were followed, and RevMan software was used to calculate pooled odds ratios (OR) using the Mantel-Haenszel test.Results: Fifty publications were suitable for additional analysis. The clinical and primary tumor factors that were consistently identified as risk factors for NSNMs were: age >50, T stage 3 or 4, Clark level IV/V, ulceration, microsatellitosis, lymphovascular invasion, nodular histology, and extremity versus trunk primary tumor location. SLN factors that predicted NSNMs were >1 positive SLN, SLN micrometastatic tumor burden, diameter >2 mm, extracapsular extension, nonsubcapsular location (Dewar), and Rotterdam > 1 mm or > 0.1 mm.Conclusions: The findings in this study support that many clinical and pathologic risk factors that can be assessed with SLN biopsy alone can be used to predict the risk of NSNMs. The factors identified in this review should be evaluated in clinical prediction models to predict the risk of NSNMS, a prediction that may be used to select patients for adjuvant therapy in high-risk melanoma.(c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Vegetation greening in more than 94% of the Yellow River Basin (YRB) region in China during the 21st century caused jointly by warming and anthropogenic activities
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable detection and observation of vegetation changes are increasingly essential for investigating the dynamic balance of regional ecosystems. The Yellow River Basin (YRB) serves as an ecological barrier in northern China, where vegetation is extremely sensitive to climate change and human activities. However, whether there has been a significant change in the intensity of vegetation dynamics in the YRB during the 21st century and how much anthropogenic disturbances contribute to the change are still poorly documented so far; thus, this work may hold a far-reaching significance for maintaining the eco-balance of northern China and even all of China. In this study, based on the annually and seasonally averaged normalized deviation vegetation index (NDVI), a comprehensive analysis was conducted to detect the trends of vegetation changes derived by NDVI at six different time scales during the period 2000-2018 using Theil-Sen statistics, and the Mann-Kendall (M-K) method was employed to test the significance levels of vegetation greening and browning. Subsequently, based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer land cover data, in situ climatic and meteorological data and socioeconomic and anthropogenic factors were included to explore the driving forces for vegetation change through the GeoDetector method. Our results show that the YRB experienced both significant vegetation greening and browning with great spatial heterogeneity. More than 94% of the regions in the YRB showed vegetation greening trends at average rates of 0.0040 yr(-1) in the annually averaged NDVI (NDVIAN) and 0.0053 yr(-1) in the growing season averaged NDVI (NDVIGS) during the 21st century; the trend was significant in more than 71% (p < 0.05) of the total YRB territory. This phenomenon was mainly detected in the middle reaches of the YRB, where effective land use activities and afforestation played vital roles. There was great seasonal disparity for greening; spring NDVI (NDVISP) and summer NDVI (NDVISU) exhibited the largest greening rates. However, only small parts of the YRB (0.9%, p < 0.05) showed browning trends at average rates of 0.0015 yr(-1) in NDVIAN and 0.0021 yr(-1) in NDVIGS, mainly located in the Weihe River basin and the lower reaches of the YRB, where the sharp increase in urban and built-up areas contributed substantially to the browning trends. Overall, warming, increasing population and afforestation jointly dominated the significant vegetation greening trends in the YRB.

TI  - Modelling the construction and long-term response of Go?ta Tunnel
T2  - COMPUTERS AND GEOTECHNICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a benchmark of a rate-dependent constitutive model for soft soils, implemented in a 2D finite element code, against the response of an instrumented excavation in sensitive clay: Go?ta Tunnel in Gothenburg. The monitoring data, which comprise time-series of pore water pressures, displacements, earth pressures and strut forces, provide valuable insights of the time-dependent response during the construction period. The longterm response, in terms of the ongoing settlement rates, is assessed using remote sensing data. The results of the numerical simulations demonstrate that the constitutive model, Creep-SCLAY1S, is capable of capturing the observed response. The trends of vertical and horizontal displacements are captured well until the stage of dewatering, and the evolution of pore pressures and earth pressures is computed with high accuracy, excluding peaks in the measurement values arising from pile and rock anchor installation. Most importantly, the results demonstrate that the rate-dependent model enables to model the complete service life of the tunnel, from construction of the excavation to the tunnel operation, with one unified model parameter set. Furthermore, the comparisons highlight the importance of assessing installation effects both in the choice of construction methods and modelling.

TI  - Detection range and efficiency of acoustic telemetry receivers in a connected wetland system
T2  - HYDROBIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Acoustic telemetry is an important tool for assessing the behavioural ecology of aquatic animals, but the performance of receivers can vary spatially and temporally according to changes in environmental gradients. Studies testing detection efficiency and/ or detection range are, therefore, important for data interpretation, although the most thorough range-testing approaches are often costly or impractical, such as the use of fixed sentinel tags. Here, stationary tag data (from study animals that had either died or expelled their tags) provided a substitute for the long-term monitoring of receiver performance in a wetland environment and was complemented by periodic boat-based range testing, with testing of the effects of environmental variables (water temperature, conductivity, transparency, precipitation, wind speed, acoustic noise) on detection efficiency (DE) and detection range (DR). Stationary tag DE was highly variable temporally, the most influential factors being water temperature and precipitation. Transparency was a strong predictor of DR and was dependent on chlorophyll concentration (a surrogate measure of algal density). These results highlight the value of stationary tag data in assessments of acoustic receiver performance. The high seasonal variability in DE and DR emphasises the need for long-term receiver monitoring to enable robust conclusions to be drawn from telemetry data.

TI  - Accuracy of breast MRI in evaluating nodal status after neoadjuvant therapy in invasive lobular carcinoma
T2  - NPJ BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Neoadjuvant therapy in breast cancer can downstage axillary lymph nodes and reduce extent of axillary surgery. As such, accurate determination of nodal status after neoadjuvant therapy and before surgery impacts surgical management. There are scarce data on the diagnostic accuracy of breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for nodal evaluation after neoadjuvant therapy in patients with invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), a diffusely growing tumor type. We retrospectively analyzed patients with stage 1-3 ILC who underwent pre-operative breast MRI after either neoadjuvant chemotherapy or endocrine therapy at our institution between 2006 and 2019. Two breast radiologists reviewed MRIs and evaluated axillary nodes for suspicious features. All patients underwent either sentinel node biopsy or axillary dissection. We evaluated sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values, and overall accuracy of the post-treatment breast MRI in predicting pathologic nodal status. Of 79 patients, 58.2% received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and 41.8% neoadjuvant endocrine therapy. The sensitivity and negative predictive value of MRI were significantly higher in the neoadjuvant endocrine therapy cohort than in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy cohort (66.7 vs. 37.9%, p=0.012 and 70.6 vs. 40%, p=0.007, respectively), while overall accuracy was similar. Upstaging from clinically node negative to pathologically node positive occurred in 28.0 and 41.7%, respectively. In clinically node positive patients, those with an abnormal post-treatment MRI had a significantly higher proportion of patients with >= 4 positive nodes on pathology compared to those with a normal MRI (61.1 versus 16.7%, p=0.034). Overall, accuracy of breast MRI for predicting nodal status after neoadjuvant therapy in ILC was low in both chemotherapy and endocrine therapy cohorts. However, post-treatment breast MRI may help identify patients with a high burden of nodal disease (>= 4 positive nodes), which could impact pre-operative systemic therapy decisions. Further studies are needed to assess other imaging modalities to evaluate for nodal disease following neoadjuvant therapy and to improve clinical staging in patients with ILC.

TI  - Effects of Quality Coffee Production by Smallholders on Local Land Use and Land Cover in Yirgacheffe, Southern Ethiopia
T2  - JOURNAL OF LAND USE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The objectives of the study are to identify LULC types that have undergone changes due to quality coffee production and assess smallholders' perceptions of the LULC changes associated with their coffee production practices in Yirgacheffe coffee area, southern Ethiopia. The study used Landsat satellite images of 1988, 2003, and 2018 to examine the LULC change. In addition, household surveys and focus group discussions were carried out to assess land management practices in the study area. The findings show that forest coffee (FC) cover decreased at a rate of 1.02% per year in the 30-year time, which was mostly changed to semi-forest and semi-plantation coffee cover. The study area has also experienced an increase in semi-plantation cover (0.07% per year), semi-forest coffee (0.9% per year) over the study period, showing a gradual decrease in vegetation cover. This also suggests that a major driving force for the local LULC change is the increasing demand for coffee in the global and national market, as evident from the increasing trend of coffee export from Ethiopia. Survey data show that quality coffee production drives coffee agroforest conversion while it has potitive effects on land management practices by smallholders. Reducing the current heavy dependence of livelihoods on coffee as the single most important commodity is likely to enhance sustainability of the coffee agroforests in the area.

TI  - Spring cold water intrusions as the beginningof the cold intermediate layer formation in the Baltic sea
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermohaline intrusions are a typical feature of the Baltic Sea water body. We report observations of vivid colder/saltier intrusion activity in intermediate layers and upper pycnocline of the Gdansk Bay (the south-eastern part of the Baltic Sea) in early spring (March-April, 2013). Extremely low water temperature (down to 1.4-2 degrees C) and specific water salinity (S((A) over tilde)7.5-7.8) of the intrusions point at a possible area of the intrusion waters formation: within the upper mixed layer in the Arkona/Bornholm basins at the end of March. Data on water temperature and salinity available from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) data repository, data of the Arkona Becken automated station, meteorological information, and remote sensing data for March-April 2013 are used to confirm the conclusions. It is confirmed once again that the transfer from the two-layered winter water stratification to the three-layered summer one in the Baltic Sea is a consequence of the sea-scale exchange process. The latter is manifested as simultaneous advection in upper and intermediate layers of waters with lower and higher salinity, correspondingly. The reported extremely cold intrusions indicate the beginning of the formation of the Cold Intermediate Layer (CIL), which thus contains waters of the Arkona/Bornholm basins. The main environmental factors driving the observed vivid intrusions in April 2013 are easterly winds and negative buoyancy fluxes due to seasonal solar heating of waters with the temperature below that of the density maximum. Substantial prolongation of the period of seasonal vertical mixing might be the most important process related to the transition of water temperature over the temperature of the density maximum (T-md) in the Baltic Sea. With the climate warming, the cooling of surface waters below the T-md becomes rare, limiting deep ventilation of Baltic waters in spring.

TI  - D-InSAR monitoring of ground deformation related to the dewatering of construction sites. A case study of Glories Square, Barcelona
T2  - ENGINEERING GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this paper is to demonstrate how the integration of differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (D-InSAR) and levelling improves the monitoring of ground deformation phenomena, thereby enabling their complete understanding. The complementarity between D-InSAR and levelling is illustrated through a case study of the construction of a road tunnel beneath Glories Square, Barcelona; D-InSAR is employed to continuously monitor the works, notably the dewatering of the site. This study focuses primarily on D-InSAR data obtained from the processing of Sentinel-1A data following a persistent scatterer interferometry procedure. The spatial distribution of the deformation and its temporal evolution are analysed with detailed hydrogeological and piezometric data. The magnitude of deformation is discussed using levelling data and an analytical estimation based on the hydromechanical parameters of the ground obtained from a pre-existing hydrogeological numerical model and pumping tests. The D-InSAR results are shown to be essential for identifying the origin of ground deformation and the constraints on its spread. Such observations at the construction site and district (similar to 2 km radius) scales with sub-centimetric deformation are precious contributions of D-InSAR data, whereas levelling offers a more accurate quantification of the deformation, although this remains an open issue to be further investigated.

TI  - An extended time series (2000-2018) of global NPP-VIIRS-like nighttime light data from a cross-sensor calibration
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - The nighttime light (NTL) satellite data have been widely used to investigate the urbanization process. The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) stable nighttime light data and Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP-VIIRS) nighttime light data are two widely used NTL datasets. However, the difference in their spatial resolutions and sensor design requires a cross-sensor calibration of these two datasets for analyzing a long-term urbanization process. Different from the traditional cross-sensor calibration of NTL data by converting NPP-VIIRS to DMSP-OLS-like NTL data, this study built an extended time series (2000-2018) of NPP-VIIRS-like NTL data through a new cross-sensor calibration from DMSP-OLS NTL data (2000-2012) and a composition of monthly NPP-VIIRS NTL data (2013-2018). The proposed cross-sensor calibration is unique due to the image enhancement by using a vegetation index and an auto-encoder model. Compared with the annual composited NPP-VIIRS NTL data in 2012, our product of extended NPP-VIIRS-like NTL data shows a good consistency at the pixel and city levels with R-2 of 0.87 and 0.95, respectively. We also found that our product has great accuracy by comparing it with DMSP-OLS radiance-calibrated NTL (RNTL) data in 2000, 2004, 2006, and 2010. Generally, our extended NPP-VIIRS-like NTL data (2000-2018) have an excellent spatial pattern and temporal consistency which are similar to the composited NPP-VIIRS NTL data. In addition, the resulting product could be easily updated and provide a useful proxy to monitor the dynamics of demographic and socioeconomic activities for a longer time period compared to existing products. The extended time series (2000-2018) of nighttime light data is freely accessible at https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/YGIVCD (Chen et al., 2020).

TI  - Indocyanine green guidance improves the efficiency of extended pelvic lymph node dissection during laparoscopic radical prostatectomy
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF UROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives To evaluate whether indocyanine green guidance can improve the quality of extended pelvic lymph node dissection in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.Methods A total of 214 patients underwent laparoscopic radical prostatectomy with indocyanine green-guided lymph node dissection plus extended pelvic lymph node dissection. These patients (group A) were matched 1:1 for clinical risk groups according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network classification with patients who underwent the same procedure without fluorescence guidance (group B). Biochemical recurrence was defined as two consecutive prostate-specific antigen rises of at least 0.2 ng/mL. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression models were used to identify predictors of biochemical recurrence.Results The median number of retrieved nodes was significantly higher in group A (22 vs 14, P < 0.001). The rate of lymph node metastases was higher in group A (65.9% vs 34.1%, P = 0.01). Increasing the yield of lymph node dissection was independently and negatively correlated with the biochemical recurrence risk in both overall and pN-positive patients (hazard ratio 0.97, P = 0.03; and hazard ratio 0.95, P = 0.02). The 5-year biochemical recurrence-free survival rates were (75.8% vs 65.9, P = 0.09) and (54.1% vs 24.9%, P = 0.023) for group A and group B in the overall cohort and pN-positive cohort, respectively.Conclusion Indocyanine green-guided lymph node dissection plus extended pelvic lymph node dissection improves identification of lymphatic drainage, resulting in a higher number of lymph nodes and retrieved lymph node metastases, and allowing a more accurate local staging and a prolonged biochemical recurrence-free survival.

TI  - Sero-surveillance of emerging viral diseases in camels and cattle in Nouakchott, Mauritania: an abattoir study
T2  - TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study reports the monitoring of several emerging viral pathogens in Mauritania, which was carried out by the analysis of bovine and camel samples taken at the slaughterhouse of Nouakchott. Blood and serum were collected by random sampling from 159 camels and 118 cattle in March 2013 at the large animals abattoir in Nouakchott. Serological tests for Rift Valley Fever (RVF), Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR), West Nile disease (WND), epizootic haemorrhagic disease (EHD) and African horse sickness (AHS) were carried out using commercial ELISA kits. The samples, which resulted positives for PPR, WND and AHS, were tested with the confirmatory virus neutralization test (VNT). According to ELISA results, serological prevalence of RVF was 45% (95% CI 52.3-37.7) in camels and 16% (95% CI 22.6-9.4) in cattle. The difference between the observed prevalences in camels and in cattle was significant (p value <= 0.01). PPR was absent in camels and had 12% prevalence (95% CI, 17.86-6.14) in cattle. Furthermore, camels showed 92% (95% CI, 96.1-87.9) prevalence of WNV, 73% (95% CI, 82.3-63.64) of EHD and 3% (95% CI, 5.6-0.4) of AHS. This data are of relevance since provided useful feedbacks on the circulation of the pathogens in field. Moreover, this survey provided new information on the susceptibility of camels to several emerging pathogens and on the possible use of this species as sentinel animal.

TI  - Modeling the impact of the COVID-19 lockdowns on urban surface ecological status: A case study of Milan and Wuhan cities
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedent negative impacts on our society, however, evidences show a reduction of anthropogenic pressures on the environment. Due to the high importance of environmental conditions on human life quality, it is crucial to model the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on environmental conditions. Consequently, the objective of this study was to model the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the urban surface ecological status (USES). To this end, the Landsat-8 images of Milan for three pre-lockdown dates (Feb 13, 2018 (MD1), April 18, 2018 (MD2) and Feb 3, 2020 (MD3)) and one date over the lockdown (April 14, 2020 (MD4)), and Wuhan for three pre-lockdown dates (Dec 17, 2017 (WD1), March 23, 2018 (WD2) and Dec 7, 2019 (WD3)) and one lockdown date (Feb 9, 2020 (WD4)) were used. First, pressure-state-response (PSR) framework parameters including index-based built-up index (IBI), vegetation cover (VC), vegetation health index (VHI), land surface temperature (LST) and Wetness were calculated. Second, by combining the PSR framework parameters based on comprehensive ecological evaluation index (CEEI), the USES were modeled on different dates. Thirdly, the USES during the COVID-19 lockdown was compared with the USES for pre-lockdown. The mean (standard deviation) of CEEI for Milan on MD1, MD2, MD3 and MD4 were 0.52 (0.12), 0.60 (0.19), 0.57 (0.13) and 0.45 (0.16), respectively. Also, these values for Wuhan on WD1, WD2, WD3 and WD4 were 0.63 (0.14), 0.67 (0.15), 0.60 (0.13) and 0.57 (0.13), respectively. Due to the lockdowns, the mean CEEI of built-up, bare soil and green spaces for Milan and Wuhan decreased by [0.18, 0.02, 0.08], [0.13, 0.06, 0.05], respectively. During the lock down period, the USES improved substantially due to the reduction of anthropogenic activities in the urban environment.

T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The space borne remote sensing satellite systems are increasingly used in ecological monitoring, growth dynamics, and mapping of mangrove extent worldwide. Sundarban is the largest, diverse contiguous productive mangrove ecosystem and is increasingly threatened by both environmental changes and anthropogenic forces. The study focuses on the spatio-temporal dynamics in the Indian Sundarban mangrove ecosystem using time-series Landsat satellite imagery during the periods from 1990 to 1999, 1999 to 2009, and 2009 to 2019. The maximum likelihood classifier approach has been applied for image classification and post-classification comparison techniques for change detection analysis over the study period. The findings revealed a decline of 3.76% areal extent of mangroves forest between 1990 and 2019. The areal extent of the Indian Sundarban mangrove areas has been maintained at a relatively constant despite the high population density in its immediate surrounding region. The overall accuracies of 72%, 83%, 79%, and 85.9% were recorded for the classified satellite image of 1990, 1999, 2009, and 2019, respectively. The present study is of great significance to the restoration and conservation of the mangrove forests in response to global climatic change. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It has been widely demonstrated that dysbiosis, which means the alternations of the gut microbial structure, is closely associated with development of intestinal chronic inflammation-related diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and even infectious diseases including bacterial and viral infection. Thus, for reshaping ecological balance, a growing body of the literatures have proposed numerous strategies to modulate the structure of the gut microbiota, which provide more revelation for amelioration of these inflammation or infection-related diseases. While the ameliorative effects of traditional probiotics seem negligeable, emerging next generation probiotics (NGPs) start to receive great attention as new preventive and therapeutic tools. Encouragingly, within the last decade, the intestinal symbiotic bacterium Faecalibacterium prausnitzii has emerged as the "sentinel of the gut," with multifunction of anti-inflammation, gut barrier enhancement, and butyrate production. A lower abundance of F. prausnitzii has been shown in IBD, Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), and virus infection such as COVID-19. It is reported that intervention with higher richness of F. prausnitzii through dietary modulation, fecal microbiota transplantation, or culture strategy can protect the mice or the subjects from inflammatory diseases. Therefore, F. prausnitzii may have potential ability to reduce microbial translocation and inflammation, preventing occurrences of gastrointestinal comorbidities especially in COVID-19 patients.

TI  - Aboveground biomass distributions and vegetation composition changes in Louisiana's Wax Lake Delta
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Wax Lake Delta (WLD) is an actively prograding delta in the Mississippi River Delta Plain that is otherwise experiencing widespread degradation and submergence of its coastal wetlands. The WLD is actively accumulating mineral and organic sediment that increases soil surface elevation, changing emergent wetland communities as the young delta develops. There is uncertainty in how the dynamics of community composition respond to net changes in soil elevation and determine aboveground biomass and carbon storage. This study utilizes high resolution imaging spectrometer data captured on October 17, 2016, to map the delta's dominant vegetation species and wetland types. We validated this vegetation map (overall accuracy = 77.62%, Kappa = 0.72) and compared it with a published species map that used WorldView-2 data collected five years earlier on October 16, 2011. This allowed us to map changes resulting from five years of delta development to determine changes in wetland forest species (Salix nigra), two dominant herbaceous wetland species (Colocasia esculenta and Polygonum punctatum), and various grass species. Results show an increase in C. esculenta and a marginal increase in forested wetlands (S. nigra). C. esculenta's expansion occurred largely from the delta island heads toward the fringes into wetland area previously occupied by P. punctatum, which saw a corresponding decline. Additionally, this study leveraged these species distributions with a published aboveground biomass (AGB) dataset to examine the dominant plant types' growth patterns across elevational gradients. We characterized variability in AGB by marsh platform elevation and across different elevational zones categorized by hydroperiod, or hydrogeomorphic zones. We found that the herbaceous plant species peak in AGB in the low intertidal zone and decrease with elevation before increasing slightly in the higher elevations, consistent with previous field-based mesocosm experiments for C. esculenta. With vegetation distributions, succession, and growth patterns in the WLD characterized, this study may inform future restoration efforts throughout the Mississippi River Delta Plain regarding the changing vegetation composition that may emerge following changes in surface elevation with sediment deposition.

TI  - Probable contribution of Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes to the circulation of chikungunya virus during an outbreak in Mombasa County, Kenya, 2017-2018.
T2  - Parasites & Vectors
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Chikungunya virus is an alphavirus, primarily transmitted by Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus. In late 2017-2018, an outbreak of chikungunya occurred in Mombasa county, Kenya, and investigations were conducted to establish associated entomological risk factors. Methods: Homes were stratified and water-filled containers inspected for immature Ae. aegypti, and larval indices were calculated. Adult mosquitoes were collected in the same homesteads using BG-Sentinel and CDC light traps and screened for chikungunya virus. Experiments were also conducted to determine the ability of Culex quinquefasciatus to transmit chikungunya virus. Results: One hundred thirty-one houses and 1637 containers were inspected; 48 and 128 of them, respectively, were positive for immature Ae. aegypti, with the house index (36.60), container index (7.82) and Breteau index (97.71) recorded. Jerry cans (n = 1232; 72.26%) and clay pots (n = 2; 0.12%) were the most and least inspected containers, respectively, while drums, the second most commonly sampled (n = 249; 15.21%), were highly positive (65.63%) and productive (60%). Tires and jerry cans demonstrated the highest and lowest breeding preference ratios, 11.36 and 0.2, respectively. Over 6900 adult mosquitoes were collected and identified into 15 species comprising Cx. quinquefasciatus (n = 4492; 65.04%), Aedes vittatus (n = 1137; 16.46%) and Ae. aegypti (n = 911; 13.19%) and 2 species groups. Simpson's dominance and Shannon-Wiener diversity indices of 0.4388 and 1.1942 were recorded, respectively. Chikungunya virus was isolated from pools of Ae. aegypti (1) and Cx. quinquefasciatus (4), two of which were males. Minimum infection rates of 3.0 and 0.8 were observed for female Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus, respectively. Between 25 and 31.3% of exposed mosquitoes became infected with CHIKV 7, 14 and 21 days post-exposure. For the experimentally infected Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes, between 13 and 40% had the virus disseminated, with 100% transmission being observed among those with disseminated infection. Conclusions: These results demonstrated high risk of chikungunya transmission for residents in the sampled areas of Mombasa. Transmission data confirmed the probable role played by Cx. quinquefasciatus in the outbreak while the role of Ae. vittatus in the transmission of chikungunya virus remains unknown.

TI  - Impacts of climate change on the tourism sector of a Small Island Developing State: A case study for the Bahamas
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the direct and indirect impacts of climate change to the tourism sector on the islands of New Providence and adjacent Paradise Island in the Bahamas. The assessment was carried out by conducting a geospatial analysis of tourism establishments at risk using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). We combined the geospatial analysis with publicly available databases to assess the integrated climate-related impacts pertaining to a Small Island Developing State (SIDS) economy. Our study estimated that many tourism properties currently lie in a storm surge zone and the extent of properties at risk increases with a future scenario of a 1 m rise in sea level. While sea level rise (SLR) by itself only threatens a small number of properties, when combined with weak (Category 1), moderate (Category 3) and strong (Category 5) storms the resulting coastal flooding impacts 34%, 69%, and 83% of the tourism infrastructure (hotels and resorts), respectively. In addition to flooding, properties are also susceptible to coastal erosion with 28% of the total hotels and resorts on the two islands being situated within 0-50 m and 60% of the tourism infrastructure within 0-100 m of the coastline. Considering the economic importance of the sector, the potential impacts on the tourism infrastructure will cause significant losses in revenue and employment for the two islands. Furthermore, the majority of the tourism on these islands is beach-based and visitor expenditures will decline due to their vulnerability. These losses will have far-reaching social-economic consequences for the Bahamas. Our findings reveal a need for integrated coastal zone management that incorporates tourism management strategies with adaptation measures to deal with climate change.

TI  - Suspended sediment dynamics in a deltaic estuary controlled by subtidal motion and offshore river plumes
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Two series of opportunistic observations captured the seasonal variability in the suspended sediment concentration (SSC) within the main inlet of Barataria Bay, a bar-built estuary within the Mississippi Delta, as the offshore environment transitioned from a period of low river discharge and high cold front activity to a period of high river discharge and low cold front activity. During winter, the SSC dynamics in Barataria Pass was mostly driven by resuspension in response to cold front passages, with correspondingly high SSC of up to 1.84 g L-1. In addition to cold fronts, diurnal variability associated with astronomic tides was also present in the SSC time series. The mean SSC during spring (0.23 g L-1) was significantly higher than during winter (0.15 g L-1). Higher SSC during spring, in spite of the less frequent and weaker cold fronts, was due to the strong offshore influence of the Mississippi River plume. The longitudinal salinity gradients during spring showed the existence of freshwater intrusion, which was associated with the Mississippi River plume advected north-west by the Louisiana Coastal Current. Intrusion of the river plume though the inlet into Barataria Bay was also observed in time-series of MODIS satellite imagery during March 2018. A decomposition of the sediment flux time series revealed that subtidal motion associated with cold fronts was the primary mechanism of sediment transport during both winter and spring. While cold fronts enhance sediment export during winter, they also increase sediment import when associated with the higher offshore SSC during spring. We conclude that the sediment discharged at the mouth of the Mississippi River is not completely lost to the coastal zone, but instead partially supplied to deltaic estuaries through their seaward boundaries.

TI  - Assessing subsidence of Mexico City from InSAR and LandSat ETM plus with CGPS and SVM
T2  - GEOENVIRONMENTAL DISASTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents an enhanced analysis of the subsidence rates and their effects on Mexico City. As a result of excess water withdrawal, Mexico City is experiencing subsidence. We integrated and analyzed Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), Continuous Global Positioning Systems (CGPS), and optical remote sensing data to analyze Mexico City's subsidence. This study utilized 52 ENVISAT-ASAR, nine GPS stations, and one Landsat ETM+ image from the Mexico City area to understand better the subsidence rates and their effects on Mexico City's community. The finding of this study reveals a high amount of correlation (up to 0.98) between two independent geodetic methods. We also implemented the Support Vector Machine (SVM) analysis method based on Landsat ETM+ image to classify Mexico City's population density. We used SVM to compare Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) subsidence rates with the buildings' distribution densities. This integrated study shows that the fastest subsidence zone (i.e., areas greater than 100 mm/yr), which falls into the above-mentioned temporal baseline, occurs in high and moderate building distribution density areas.

TI  - Assessment of WRF-CHEM Simulated Dust Using Reanalysis, Satellite Data and Ground-Based Observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the significant natural pollutants in the atmosphere is the mineral dust aerosols. In the northern hemisphere, Arabian Peninsula is one of the significant sources of dust aerosols with the frequency of dust storms changing seasonally. Dust emitted from the Arabian Peninsula region transports towards the Indian region through prevailing winds, therefore a positive correlation between the extreme dust episodes over the Arabian region and air quality over the Indian region is generally observed. Therefore, there is a need to monitor and forecast such an episodic event over the Arabian Peninsula and surrounding regions so that substantial measures may be taken in Indian subcontinent to mitigate the adverse impact of low air quality on human being and several other sectors such as aviation, energy and infrastructure. In the present study, the WRF-Chem simulations for dust particles are assessed against the observational data sets (i.e. MERRA-2, MODIS-Terra, Aura-OMI, CPCB). Based on the comparison of WRF-Chem simulated data sets with the satellite/reanalysis data, it is noted that in the post-monsoon season, WRF-Chem model can capture the entire dust episode (emission, transportation and dissipation) reasonably well. From the statistical analysis (PDF, CDF, Scatter plot and Temporal evolution), it was noted that there was a consistent underestimation of the simulated dust by WRF-Chem as compared to the observational data sets. A statistically robust categorical analysis has also been carried out for assessing the performance of WRF-Chem with respect to the observations for each dust event, and it is noted that on an average the probability of detection of dust event is about 77% and false alarm ratio is about 15% with an overall accuracy of 76%. Results obtained from the present analysis are encouraging and would be useful for the assessment of WRF-Chem simulations for other seasons also.

TI  - Impact of the assimilation of DWR-derived precipitation rates through latent heat nudging on simulation of rainfall events over Indian region using NCUM-R
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Radar estimate of precipitation is an important observation which can be used to initialize the high-resolution numerical weather prediction models for improved forecast of high impact weather. Impact of Indian Doppler Weather Radar (DWR) derived precipitation rates on short-range weather forecasts is studied here. The present work is one of the first-of-its-kind studies to assimilate the DWR derived rain rate into a high resolution model over Indian region. Chennai DWR derived surface precipitation rates are included in the high resolution regional version of NCMRWF Unified Model (NCUM-R) through latent heat nudging to study its impact on the simulations of two convective rainfall events that occurred over east-peninsular India. The high resolution initial condition for NCUM-R is prepared using 4D-VAR data assimilation system in which various conventional and satellite observations are used. In this study, two sets of numerical experiments are carried out, one experiment named as control experiment (CNTL) uses only the analysis created by 4D-VAR and in the second (LHN), latent heat nudging is also performed with DWR derived precipitation rates in addition to the use of the 4D-VAR analysis. The results of the study show that the assimilation of DWR derived precipitation rates has a positive impact on the simulation of convective rainfall events. The root mean square errors (RMSE) of the analysed meteorological fields, mainly the mass fields are improved in the LHN compared to CNTL in both cases. The error of Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) in the LHN analyses is considerably reduced compared to the CNTL analyses for both cases. The stability indices also suggested that the condition for convection is properly reproduced in the LHN analysis in both cases. When evaluated against rainfall observations, the amount and orientation of the main rainfall pattern showed noteworthy improvements in the LHN relative to CNTL. The rainfall forecasts are further verified based on the object oriented Contiguous Rain Area (CRA) technique. The vector displacement errors and total mean square error are reduced considerably in LHN simulations compared to CNTL. The vertical structure and time evolution of moisture flux and moisture convergence are also well simulated in the LHN. This preliminary study revealed encouraging results which shows that the assimilation of Indian DWR derived rain rates in the high resolution regional NWP system can improve the forecast of convective rainfall events over Indian region.

TI  - Remote estimates of CDOM using Sentinel-2 remote sensing data in reservoirs with different trophic states across China
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (DOM) is called as CDOM which could affect the optical properties of surface waters, and is a useful parameter for monitoring complex inland aquatic systems. Large-scale monitoring of CDOM using remote-sensing has been a challenge due to the poor transferability of CDOM retrieval models across regions. To overcome these difficulties, a study is conducted using Sentinel-2 images, in situ reflectance spectral data, and water chemical parameters at 93 water reservoirs across China classified by trophic state. Empirical algorithms are established between CDOM absorption coefficient aCDOM(355) and reflectance band ratio (B5/B2,vegetation Red Edge/Blue) acquired in situ and via Sentinel-2 MSI sensors. Relationships are stronger (r2 0.7, p < 0.05) when analysis is conducted separately by trophic states. Validation models show that, by accounting for trophic state of reservoirs and using B5/B2 band ratios, it is possible to expand the geographical range of remote sensing-based models to determine CDOM. However, the accuracy of model validation decreased from oligotrophic (r2: 0.86) to eutrophic reservoirs (r2: 0.82), likely due to increased complexity of CDOM sources in nutrient-rich systems. This study provides a strategy for using local and remotesensing data to monitor the spatial variations of CDOM in reservoirs based on different trophic states, and will contribute to water resources management.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines management approaches for hydropower generation and irrigation and domestic water supply for the Tekeze-Atbara, a transboundary river between Ethiopia, Eritrea and Sudan, in above- and below-normal hydrologic conditions, considering current and future water demand scenarios. Satellite data are used to substitute for unavailable or inaccessible ground meteorological and dam data. Based on three examined coordination scenarios, the analysis finds that coordinating the management of the Sudanese dams would bring significant benefits to water supply and energy generation. An optimization analysis is necessary to reveal the full value of coordination of dams in the Tekeze-Atbara Basin.

TI  - Increasing awareness for tick-borne encephalitis virus using small ruminants as suitable sentinels: Preliminary observations
T2  - ONE HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is one of the most common zoonotic vector-borne infections in Europe. An appropriate awareness is crucial to react quickly and efficiently to protect humans from this pathogen. From winter 2017 until spring 2018 serum samples were collected from 71 small ruminant flocks (3174 animals) in five German federal states. The sera were examined for TBEV antibodies by ELISA and serum neutralization test. In the TBEV risk areas, there was a coincidence in 14 districts between seropositive small ruminants and the occurrence of human TBE cases in 2017. In eight districts, the TBEV infection could not be detected in small ruminants although human cases were reported. In contrast, in five districts, small ruminants tested TBEV seropositive without notified human TBE cases in 2017. A changing pattern of TBEV circulation in the environment was observed by the absence of antibodies in a defined high-risk area. In the non-TBE risk areas, seropositive small ruminants were found in five districts. In two districts with a low human incidence the infection was missed by the small ruminant sentinels. An intra-herd prevalence of 12.5% was determined in a goat flock in the non-TBE risk area in 2017, two years prior the first autochthone human case was reported. All sheep and goats in this flock were examined for TBEV antibodies for three years. Individual follow-up of twelve small ruminants was possible and revealed mostly a short lifespan of TBEV antibodies of less than one year. The probability to identify TBEV seropositive sheep flocks was enhanced in flocks kept for landscape conservation or which were shepherded (p < 0.05). Our preliminary observations clearly demonstrated the successful utilization of small ruminants as sentinel animals for TBEV.

AB  - Scattered trees outside of dense, closed-canopy forests are very important for carbon sequestration, supporting livelihoods, maintaining ecosystem integrity, and climate change adaptation and mitigation. In contrast to trees inside of closed-canopy forests, not much is known about the spatial extent and distribution of scattered trees at a global scale. Due to the cost of high-resolution satellite imagery, global monitoring systems rely on medium-resolution satellites to monitor land use and land use change. However, detecting and monitoring scattered trees with an open canopy using medium-resolution satellites is difficult because individual trees often cover a smaller footprint than the satellites' resolution. Additionally, the variable background land uses and canopy shapes of trees cause a high variability in their spectral signatures. Here we present a globally consistent method to identify trees with canopy diameters greater than 3 m with medium-resolution optical and radar imagery. Biweekly cloud-free, pan-sharpened 10 metres Sentinel-2 optical imagery and Sentinel-1 radar imagery are used to train a fully convolutional network, consisting of a convolutional gated recurrent unit layer and a feature pyramid attention layer. Tested across more than 215 thousand Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 pixels distributed from - 60 degrees to +60 degrees latitude, the proposed model exceeds 75% user's and producer's accuracy identifying trees in hectares with a low to medium density (<40%) of tree cover, and 95% user's and producer's accuracy in hectares with dense (>= 40%) tree cover. In comparison with common remote-sensing classification methods, the proposed method increases the accuracy of monitoring tree presence in areas with sparse and scattered tree cover (<40%) by as much as 20%, and reduces commission and omission error in mountainous and very cloudy regions by nearly half. When applied across large, heterogeneous landscapes, the results demonstrate potential to map trees in high detail and consistent accuracy over diverse landscapes across the globe. This information is important for understanding current land cover and can be used to detect changes in land cover such as agroforestry, buffer zones around biological hotspots, and expansion or encroachment of forests.

TI  - Semi-supervised Classification of Paddy Fields from Dual Polarized Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images using Deep Learning
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice is the major food grain for many countries in this world, in particular South Asian countries such as Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, etc. India is one of the leading producers of rice, with agriculture contributing 14% to 15% to the Gross domestic product (GDP). Detection of paddy field requires constant monitoring of a region throughout the year. Hence, we use dual-polarized Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data with 20 m resolutions for our study. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised algorithm that detects paddy fields in various seasons. The technique is divided into two parts, unsupervised and supervised. Feature extraction layers of the Visual Geometry Group (VGG16) model are used to segregate patches into five clusters using an entropy-based loss function. Depending on the availability of the ground truth, data is sampled (stratified sampling), and only a certain amount of data is further used for the supervised section. Clusters showing higher similarity (Jaccard/Tanimoto test) with the paddy or nonpaddy classes are connected to a three-layer neural network used for the supervised method. This has been tested on two study sites using 10 data sets, five from 2018 to 2019, each. The highest accuracy reported for 2018 and 2019 is 85.61% and 84.92%, respectively. The two sites are selected from different districts of West Bengal, India. Our model has also shown higher generalization capability against the conventional-supervised models.

TI  - Effect of build orientation on the manufacturing process and the properties of stereolithographic dental ceramics for crown frameworks
T2  - JOURNAL OF PROSTHETIC DENTISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Statement of problem. Stereolithography (SLA) ceramic crown frameworks are suitable for clinical use, but the impact of SLA build orientation has not been identified.Purpose. The purpose of this in vitro study was to investigate the effect of 3 build orientations on the physical and mechanical properties and the microstructure of SLA alumina dental ceramics.Material and methods. The physical and mechanical properties and microstructures of 3 different oriented SLA alumina ceramics (ZX, ZY, and XY) were evaluated by visual observation, hydrostatic weighing (n=10/group), Weibull analyses (n=30/group), scanning electron microscopy, 3-point flexural strength (n=30/group), fracture toughness (indentation, single-edge-V-notched-beam) (n=4/group), and Vickers hardness (n=15/group) testing. The hydrostatic weighing, 3-point flexural strength, fracture toughness, and Vickers hardness testing data were statistically analyzed alpha=.05).Results. The minimum resting period of slurries between the polymerization of 2 layers was shorter for the ZY- and ZX-oriented specimens and increased with the layer surface. The density and Vickers hardness of the SLA-manufactured specimens were similar for all groups (P>.05). The 95% confidence intervals of the Weibull moduli of the ZX-and ZY-oriented specimens were higher than that of the XY-oriented specimens, with no overlap fraction. The ZY-oriented specimens displayed significantly higher 3-point flexural strength (P<.05) and fracture toughness as evaluated by the single-edge-V-notched-beam method than the ZX-oriented specimens (P<.05). They also displayed significantly higher 3-point flexural strength than the XY-oriented specimens (P<.05). The microstructural analysis showed that the texturing was heterogeneous and that the major axis of the large grains of alumina ran parallel to the orientation of the layers.Conclusions. The ZY orientation produced a reliable dental ceramic by SLA, with the shortest general manufacturing time and the highest mechanical strength when the layers were perpendicular to the test load surface.

TI  - Improving the monitoring of sugarcane residues in a tropical environment based on laboratory and Sentinel-2 data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Retaining a residue cover (RC) over the soil is the key to ensure its health. Since tropical agriculture systems, mostly in sugarcane, are characterized by intensive management, the discrimination of residue types becomes difficult and aims to be detected. Our goal was to identify features regarding sugarcane residues using hyperspectral and simulated Sentinel-2 dataset. Therefore, we collected green leafs (GL), straw (ST) and burn material (BM), added to two classes of contrasting soils, Ferralsols (S1) and Arenosols (S2). We developed control samples (GL, ST, BM, and soil) and also treatments with a combination of soil and RC with different dosages. We used the FieldSpec (350 to 2500 nm) to obtain the spectral data to each sample. The spectral data were subsequently used for the simulation of Sentinel-2 bands. GL presented features related to water absorption (1400 and 1900 nm) and pigments in the visible region. ST does not present features relating to pigments, neither water absorption. Due to the increase of BM, we observed a decreasing in the intensity of reflectance. Regardless the type of RC, soil features (kaolinite and mineralogy) were lost when more than 70% coverage was reached. The soil background affects the reflectance in all treatments, brighter soils influenced the spectral in the vis region. Sentinel-2 presented a strong positive correlation in the RedEdge (band 5) to assess green vegetation, in the Short-wave infrared (SWIR) to non-photosynthetically active material and in the blue band to BM. The Cellulose Absorption Index (CAI) combined with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and reflectance in the red could assist in distinction of the tree RC in mixed systems. We provided an interesting spectral analysis that could assist in futures studies to improve indices on the task for soil management.

TI  - Remote sensing versus the area sampling frame method in paddy rice acreage estimation in Indramayu regency, West Java province, Indonesia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With a population of 267 million, Indonesia faces the significant challenge of inaccurate rice production data leading to a flawed national rice import policy and supply problems. Its 2018 rice production and harvest area data were generated through the Area Sampling Frame (ASF) method which incurred high labour and financial costs as well as failing to optimize accuracy; hence, an alternative method needs exploration. This study compares ASF and remote sensing Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) methods to calculate rice growth stages (RGS) using Indramayu Regency, the highest rice producer in West Java Province, as the study area. The SAR-based method used time-series of Vertical Horizontal (VH) polarization of Sentinel-1A data that employed a combination of k-means clustering, hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), a visual interpretation and support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Both SAR and ASF methods can generate results on a monthly basis, although remote sensing satellite time revisits can be shortened (every 12 days). Whilst the ASF, a basic technique for collecting agricultural statistics, was easy to implement in large-scale areas its accuracy depended on the quantity and representativeness of the samples. This study applied the ASF by simulating a sample size of 1.7%, 3.3% and 5% of a rice field area with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) data as a reference. Whilst remote sensing SAR methods involve complex data processing the image classification process can be conducted automatically and cost-effectively (data and its software are free of charge). Moreover, it yields not only statistical data on RGS but also determines the spatial planting patterns and the RGS distribution at 10 m pixel resolution. This method showed more accurate results with overall accuracy of image classification of 81.89% and a kappa coefficient (kappa) of 0.73. The comparative result was relatively small, i.e., 4,094.89 ha more than the ASF results (3.5% difference), since this study covered a limited research area. Nonetheless, with evidence of more accurate results remote sensing holds the potential for replication across the country's 416 regencies, so enabling government to develop more appropriate policies that minimize the risks of either a surplus or shortage in the nation's most important food supply.

TI  - Identification of sentinel lymph node: Comparison between SNOLL and routine isotopic procedure
T2  - GYNECOLOGIE OBSTETRIQUE FERTILITE & SENOLOGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction. - Axillary staging remains the most accurate predictive factor for recurrence risk and survival in patients with invasive breast carcinoma. Sentinel Node Occult Lesion Localization (SNOLL) allows with a single intra-lesion injection both localization of impalpable breast lesion and sentinel node biopsy. Our aim was to compare the efficacy of SNOLL and standard radio isotopic method for sentinel node localization by lymphoscintigraphy.Methods. - This retrospective study enrolled 100 patients treated for breast carcinoma with indication of sentinel node biopsy between may 2017 and January 2019 in breast surgery unit of Montpellier university hospital.Results. - SNOLL and standard radio isotopic method were realized in respectively 65 and 35 patients. Failure rates of sentinel node localization were respectively 34% and 11% by lymphoscintigraphy P = 0.02), 17% and 9% intraoperatively and 11% et 6% using radioisotope combined with colorimetric method.Discussion. - Failure rate of sentinel node localization is higher using SNOLL. This rate is reduced by additional radioisope migration in the time between isotope injection and surgery and by the use of combined method. SNOLL should therefore be combined with colorimetric method. These results must be confirmed in a larger study. (C) 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.Y

TI  - Poetry as a communicative vehicle in the jihadi milieu: the case for modern extremist poetry
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF MIDDLE EASTERN STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - For over a millennium, poetry has held a prominent role in the socio-political scene of the Arab world to the extent that it is regarded as a powerful transmitter of a particular ideological worldview. To date, the classical Arabic ode remains an influential vehicle for mobilization among jihadi circles. This study examines modern variants of the classical Arabic ode as an essential factor in the devious and pernicious efficiency of the jihadi propaganda. The article intends to provide a more granular scheme for modern jihadi poetry by discussing the art and function of this genre. By resorting to the discussions about conventional poetic themes, this article demonstrates how modern jihadi poetry works to spread jihadi values and the uncompromising worldview of these groups.

TI  - A machine learning-based strategy for estimating non-optically active water quality parameters using Sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water-quality monitoring for small urban waterbodies by remote sensing gets to be difficult due to the coarse spatial resolution of remotesensing imagery. The recently launched Sentinel-2 produces imagery with a spatial resolution of 10 x 10 m and a temporal resolution of 5 days. It provides an opportunity to conduct high-frequency waterquality monitoring for small waterbodies. Since illegal discharges are an important issue for urban water management, total phosphorous (TP), total nitrogen (TN), and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were chosen as the target water-quality parameters. TP, TN and COD, however, are non-optically active parameters. There are fairly limited previous studies on retrieving these parameters in comparison with optically active parameters, e.g. Chlorophyll-a etc. Based on the fact that non-optically active parameters may be highly correlated with optically active parameters, this study compared 255 possible Sentinel-2 imagery band compositions to identify the most appropriate ones for TP, TN and COD retrieval. Three machine-learning models, namely Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Neural Networks (NN), were compared to seek the most robust ones for retrieving the above nonoptically active parameters. Results showed that the most appropriate band (hereafter termed as 'B-index' for brevity) compositions for TP, TN, and COD retrieval were `B-3 + B-4 + B-5 + B-6 + B-7 + B-8', `B-3 + B-4 + B-5 +B-6 + B-7 + B-8', and `B-2 + B-3 + B-5 + B-6 + B-7 + B-8' respectively. The coefficient of determination (R-2) of TP, TN, and COD estimations by NN, RF and SVR was 0.94, 0.88, and 0.86, respectively. The retrieval performances of these non-optically active parameters were hence significantly improved by the optimized machine-learning models and imagery band selection. The developed models have limitations in applying to other areas, thus band selection and tuning parameters with new data are necessary for different areas. The water-quality mapping obtained from Sentinel-2 imagery provided a full spatial coverage of the water-quality characterization for the entire water surface, and helped identify illegal discharges to urban waterbodies. This study provides a new practical and efficient water-quality monitoring strategy for managing small waterbodies.

TI  - Cloud Detection From Remote Sensing Imagery Based on Domain Translation Network
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud detection in optical imagery has drawn remarkable attention in the era of big Earth observation data analytic. While multiple supervised learning models have been developed for such purpose, large volumes of paired training samples annotated at the pixel level are essential to ensure the model's generalization capacity. However, constructing a comprehensive cloud detection training database is a tedious and time-consuming process. To tackle this dilemma, we simply regard cloud-contaminated remote sensing (RS) imagery as the combination of cloud and background domains and propose a cloud detection framework based on image-to-image domain translation network (DTNet) to separate cloud-contaminated RS imagery into two target domains of cloud and background object images without using any paired and pixel-level annotation training data. The framework was evaluated with multispectral images from two types of sensors, Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) (30 m) and GaoFen-1 (16 m), and demonstrated superior or comparable performance compared with several state-of-the-art cloud detection models.

TI  - Fuzzy machine learning approach for transitioned building footprints extraction using dual-sensor temporal data
T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a fuzzy approach, for detection of transitioned building footprints in urban area using medium resolution datasets. Multi-temporal remote sensing data sets from Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager and Sentinel-2A were used for generation of temporal indices database. The database was generated using class-based sensor independent-normalized difference vegetation index approach, with an aim to reduce spectral dimensionality of each image and maintain temporal dimensionality. The temporal indices database was subsequently used as input in Modified Possibilistic c-means classifier for transitioned building footprints extraction. The identified transitioned building locations were validated using ground samples as well as from Google images at four different test sites. For accuracy assessment, F-measure was calculated and its value was 0.75 or higher for all training and testing sites. Thus, using proposed fuzzy approach, transitioned building footprints were accurately identified compared to traditional techniques.

TI  - A new indicator of forest fire risk for Indonesia based on peat soil reflectance spectra measurements
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Conventional fire risk prediction using vegetation indexes is inappropriate because changes in soil moisture caused by plant drought stress have a 1 to 2 month time lag, which is too long for fire risk management. Further, soil and water indices used for traditional bare land assessments are also unsuitable because Indonesia is partially covered by peat soil, which has different reflection characteristics compared to typical agricultural and field soils. Here we describe a new index for estimating peat soil moisture using satellite remote sensing data. The method was developed using the ultra-blue band (435 to 451 nm) of the Land Remote-Sensing Satellite (Landsat 8) and is based on the moisture dependence of the reflected spectra measured directly. Our developed index showed a relatively strong correlation (r = 0.56 to 0.63) with real wildfire points and was a more reliable index than conventional measures used for fire risk management.

TI  - Understanding the local and remote source contributions to ambient O<sub>3</sub> during a pollution episode using a combination of experimental approaches in the Guadalquivir valley, southern Spain
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Guadalquivir Valley is one of three major O-3 hotspots in Spain. An airborne and surface measurement campaign was carried out from July 9th to 11th, 2019 to quantify the local/regional O3 contributions using experimental approaches. Air quality and meteorology data from surface measurements, a microlight aircraft, a helium balloon, and remote sensing data (TROPOMI-NO2-ESA) were used to obtain the 3D distribution of O-3 and various tracer pollutants.O-3 accumulation over 2.5 days started with inputs from oceanic air masses transported inland by sea breezes, which drew O-3 and its precursors from a local/regional origin to the northeastern end of the basin. The orographic-meteorological setting of the valley caused vertical recirculation of the air masses inside the valley that caused the accumulation by increasing regional background O-3 concentration by 25-30 ppb. Furthermore, possible Mediterranean O-3 contributions and additional vertical recirculation through the entrainment zone of the convective boundary layer also contributed. Using particulate matter finer than 2.5 mu m(PM2.5), ultrafine particles (UFP), and black carbon (BC) as tracers of local sources, we calculated that local contributions increased regional O-3 levels by 20 ppb inside specific pollution plumes transported by the breeze into the valley, and by 10 ppb during midday when flying over an area with abundant agricultural burning during the morning. Air masses that crossed the southern boundaries of the Betic system at mid-altitude (400-1850 m a.s.l.) on July 10th and 11th may have provided additional O-3. Meanwhile, a decreasing trend at high altitudes (3000-5000 m a.s.l.) was observed, signifying that the impact of stratospheric O-3 intrusion decreased during the campaign. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - With the advent of optical sensors, thermal-based indicators can be retrieved at multiscale levels from handheld devices to satellite platforms, providing a low-cost method to mirror plant water status. Here, we measured the canopy temperature of Orange trees subjected to different irrigation levels (100%, 75%, and 50% of crop water requirement) and strategies (regulated deficit irrigation (DI) and partial root drying (PRD)) to determine the crop water stress index (CWSI). Additionally, the CWSI was estimated based on Land Remote-Sensing Satellite (Landsat) thermal data using hot-cold patches (approach 1) and a novel mechanistic method combined with Sentinel-2 data (approach 2). Based on the in-situ measurements, the CWSI non-water stressed baseline was estimated as T (c) - T (a) = -0.57 x (VPD) + 2.31 (N = 370, R (2) = 0.82), defining 'VPD' as 'vapour pressure deficit', and the upper limit was found to be relatively constant (T (c) - T (a) = 3.43 degrees C). The in-field water stress variability among the different irrigation levels was effectively captured using the CWSI; however, the difference between the DI and PRD irrigated trees was only significant at the 50% irrigation level. Considering the remotely-sensed approach, the CWSI from our proposed method (approach 2) resulted in higher accuracy (root mean square error, RMSE = 0.03; mean bias error, MBE = -0.02) compared to approach 1 (RMSE = 0.10, MBE = -0.08). The improved accuracy from our proposed method was attributed to accounting for VPD and net radiation, applying an iterative method to calculate and calibrate aerodynamic resistance, and the use of high-resolution imagery from Sentinel-2 for reducing the soil background impact on canopy temperature.

TI  - On-Orbit Performance of the FY-4 GIIRS Stirling Cryocooler Over 2 Years
T2  - JOURNAL OF LOW TEMPERATURE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Fengyun series 4 (FY-4) Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GIIRS) is the first interferometric infrared sounder operating in geostationary orbit internationally, for vertical air soundings of temperature and humidity. This paper describes the long-life Stirling cryocooler operating at 60 K in GIIRS. The cryocooler's performance at room temperature, mounting status on the GIIRS, performance with and without phase control and on-orbit performance for 2 years are described. Until May 31, 2019, the cooler had more than 20,000 h of continuous running time with no indication of a change in performance. The undegraded performance provided by the cryocooler has enabled the GIIRS to fulfill its mission.

TI  - Center pivot field delineation and mapping: A satellite-driven object-based image analysis approach for national scale accounting
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Center pivot irrigation systems are used to enhance crop production in many countries around the world. Establishing the location and extent of such fields provides information that assists in describing a range of agricultural metrics, including crop identification, yield forecasts, monitoring of irrigation requirements and crop water use, as well as supporting national and regional auditing, licensing and compliance efforts. However, detailed information on the number, extent and changing dynamics of agricultural fields is often lacking in many countries: nowhere more so than in developing regions. To address this lack, we performed a national scale accounting of center pivot fields in Saudi Arabia, using a three year multi-temporal analysis of Landsat-8 satellite data. A geographic object-based image analysis approach was developed based on five 50 x 50 km sub-areas extracted from Landsat data for the year 2015, and applied to delineate individual center pivot fields at a national scale for 2013, 2014 and 2015. The extent of fields was determined via a map of the annual maximum Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), while a 15 m spatial resolution map of annual panchromatic band minimums was used to produce an edge detection layer to delineate individual adjoining fields. Amongst a range of classification parameters that were included in the object-based mapping approach, shape information, such as the center pivot field length, length:width ratio, and elliptic fit, were identified as critical parameters. Applying the rule-set that was developed from the five 50 x 50 km sub-regions to the national scale resulted in the identification of 36,052 (11,103 km(2)), 38,114 (11,902 km(2)), and 37,254 (11,555 km(2)) individual fields in 2013, 2014, and 2015, respectively. Approximately 94% of these fields were correctly detected, while their individually measured area was mapped with >95% combined accuracy for fields >0.225 km(2) when evaluated against manually delineated fields. Smaller center pivot fields, and specifically those adjoining neighbouring fields, had lower area mapping accuracies (>91% in 75% of cases). The object-based approach allowed a national scale and multi-temporal assessment of center pivot field delineation and mapping, affording new insights into agricultural practice and providing a methodological basis for examining the impact of water management and related policy initiatives, amongst many other potential applications. Apart from filling a clear knowledge gap in Saudi Arabia, the approach has the potential to be expanded elsewhere: particularly to similar locations within the Middle East and North Africa.

T2  - JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY AND THEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - According to Stark, the motive of God's glory provided the ideological basis for the Scientific Revolution. Smith argues that by the time that revolution began to spread to the human sciences in the late 1800's and early 1900's, another revolution was emerging, with which the human sciences have become thoroughly confounded, the Secular Revolution. Following MacIntyre, Johnson suggests that this confounding has created a crisis for the Christian intellectual and soul-care traditions, but one that was largely self-inflicted. One of the consequences of this crisis has been a serious wound/division in the Christian body regarding the relation between the Bible, and its theocentric worldview and way of life, and the current form of psychology and the therapeutic sciences (psychiatry, psychotherapy, and counseling). In this article, reasons are given for imagining one way the glory of God could again become a supreme motive among Christians in Western science, specifically psychology and the therapeutic sciences, that would help to overcome the current biblical knowledge/empirical knowledge dichotomy that afflicts the Christian community in these fields and could unify and empower it to develop Christian alternatives to their mainstream versions.

TI  - Natural and anthropogenic forcings lead to contrasting vegetation response in long-term vs. short-term timeframes
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding vegetation response to natural and anthropogenic forcings is vital for managing watersheds as natural ecosystems. We used a novel integrated framework to separate the impacts of natural factors (e.g. drought, precipitation and temperature) from those of anthropogenic factors (e.g. human activity) on vegetation cover change at the watershed scale. We also integrated several datasets including satellite remote sensing and in-situ measurements for a twenty-year time period (2000?2019). Our results show that despite no significant trend being observed in temperature and precipitation, vegetation indices expressed an increasing trend at both the control and treated watersheds. The vegetation cover was not significantly affected by the natural factors whereas the watershed management practice (as a human activity) had significant impacts on vegetation change in the long-term. Further, the vegetation cover long-term response to watershed management practice was mainly linear. We also found that the vegetation indices values in the 2011?2019 period (as the treated period in treated watershed) were significantly higher than those in the 2000?2010 period. In the short-term, however, the drought condition and decreased precipitation (as natural factors) explained the majority of the change in vegetation cover. For example, the majority of the breakpoints occurred in 2008, and it was related to a widespread extreme drought in the area. The watershed management practice as a human activity along with extreme climatic events could explain a large part of the vegetation changes observed in the treated and control watersheds.

TI  - Prey removal in cotton crops next to woodland reveals periodic diurnal and nocturnal invertebrate predation gradients from the crop edge by birds and bats
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Factors influencing the efficacy of insectivorous vertebrates in providing natural pest control services inside crops at increasing distances from the crop edge are poorly understood. We investigated the identity of vertebrate predators (birds and bats) and removal of sentinel prey (mealworms and beetles) from experimental feeding trays in cotton crops using prey removal trials, camera traps and observations. More prey was removed during the day than at night, but prey removal was variable at the crop edge and dependent on the month (reflecting crop growth and cover) and time of day. Overall, the predation of mealworms and beetles was 1-times and 13-times greater during the day than night, respectively, with predation on mealworms 3-5 times greater during the day than night at the crop edge compared to 95 m inside the crop. Camera traps identified many insectivorous birds and bats over crops near the feeding trays, but there was no evidence of bats or small passerines removing experimental prey. A predation gradient from the crop edge was evident, but only in some months. This corresponded to the foraging preferences of open-space generalist predators (magpies) in low crop cover versus the shrubby habitat preferred by small passerines, likely facilitating foraging away from the crop edge later in the season. Our results are in line with Optimal Foraging Theory and suggest that predators trade-off foraging behaviour with predation risk at different distances from the crop edge and levels of crop cover. Understanding the optimal farm configuration to support insectivorous bird and bat populations can assist farmers to make informed decisions regarding in-crop natural pest control and maximise the predation services provided by farm biodiversity.

TI  - A Bayesian-inspired, deep learning-based, semi-supervised domain adaptation technique for land cover mapping
T2  - MACHINE LEARNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover maps are a vital input variable to many types of environmental research and management. While they can be produced automatically by machine learning techniques, these techniques require substantial training data to achieve high levels of accuracy, which are not always available. One technique researchers use when labelled training data are scarce is domain adaptation (DA)-where data from an alternate region, known as the source domain, are used to train a classifier and this model is adapted to map the study region, or target domain. The scenario we address in this paper is known as semi-supervised DA, where some labelled samples are available in the target domain. In this paper we present Sourcerer, a Bayesian-inspired, deep learning-based, semi-supervised DA technique for producing land cover maps from satellite image time series (SITS) data. The technique takes a convolutional neural network trained on a source domain and then trains further on the available target domain with a novel regularizer applied to the model weights. The regularizer adjusts the degree to which the model is modified to fit the target data, limiting the degree of change when the target data are few in number and increasing it as target data quantity increases. Our experiments on Sentinel-2 time series images compare Sourcerer with two state-of-the-art semi-supervised domain adaptation techniques and four baseline models. We show that on two different source-target domain pairings Sourcerer outperforms all other methods for any quantity of labelled target data available. In fact, the results on the more difficult target domain show that the starting accuracy of Sourcerer (when no labelled target data are available), 74.2%, is greater than the next-best state-of-the-art method trained on 20,000 labelled target instances.

TI  - Assessing shallow groundwater level using RTI model and long-term MODIS data in Ejina Basin, Northwest China
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aims to exploit the thermal inertia model to assess the shallow groundwater level distribution, as an attempt to address agricultural water shortage and ecological degradation in arid and semi-arid regions. Apparent thermal inertia (ATI) model is one of the most commonly used and successfully implemented models, whereas in some cases, the scales of the results achieved on different dates are inconsistent, which poses a serious difficulty when monitoring soil moisture over time. To address this restriction, we introduce a soil moisture indicator, called RTI, which derives an approximation of soil thermal inertia, from flexible multi-temporal MODIS observations covering a 2-year period. Taking the Ejina Basin in arid area as an example, to more accurately assess the shallow groundwater level distribution, ATI and RTI models were adopted based on the long time series MODIS data to assess the multi-temporal soil moisture content in the study area. The data of groundwater level measured by observation well and thermal inertia were employed to generate scatter diagrams. Subsequently, a nonlinear equation was developed. Based on the thermal inertia, the temporal and spatial distribution map of the shallow groundwater level in the whole study area was generated with the inverse calculation of the nonlinear equation. It was found that the shallow groundwater level distribution in Ejina Basin tended to be shallower from south to north, as well as from summer to winter. As revealed from the results, both ATI and RTI models can effectively assess the shallow groundwater level in arid areas. The RTI model could better reflect the seasonal changes of soil moisture content and groundwater level.

TI  - Prognostic significance and targeting tumor-associated macrophages in cancer: new insights and future perspectives
T2  - BREAST CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Macrophages are phagocytic sentinel cells of the immune system that are central to both innate and adaptive immune responses and serve as the first line of defense against pathogenic insults to tissues. In the tumor microenvironment, tumor-derived factors induce monocyte polarization towards a pro-tumor phenotype. The pro-tumor macrophages regulate key steps in tumorigenicity including tumor growth, angiogenesis, immune suppression, and metastasis. Macrophage infiltration in solid tumors correlates with poor prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy in most cancers. Here in this review, we will shed light on tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in regulating tumorigenicity and TAMs as a prognostic biomarker. Also, we will review the recent advances in targeting TAMs to increase the prognosis of cancer patients.

TI  - Global land mask for satellite ocean color remote sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We develop a methodology to derive a global medium resolution (250 m) land mask from several existing data sources. In particular, a number of improved land mask data sets have been developed from satellite measurements recently, though some artifacts and omissions still remain. We show how combining global land mask data from multiple independent data sources can decrease the frequency of artifacts, and improve the data consistency and quality. We use the ocean color product imagery derived from measurements of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) to evaluate and validate the new global land mask implemented in the Multi-Sensor Level-1 to Level-2 (MSL12) ocean color data processing system, and demonstrate the improvements in the derived global ocean color data coverage. Results show that when using the new proposed land mask the accuracy of global ocean color data coverage is significantly improved over coastal and inland waters. The new land mask more accurately represents the current global land coverage status, providing more complete and consistent global land/water coverage data set for ocean color remote sensing and for various other satellite Earth observing applications.

TI  - New empirical backscattering models for estimating bare soil surface parameters
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Various models have been proposed to estimate the degree of backscatter in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. However, it is still necessary to calibrate these models based on the characteristics of different study areas and to propose new models to achieve the highest possible accuracy in estimating the backscattering coefficient (sigma(0)) SAR. In this study, three empirical models, including Champion, Sahebi and Zribi/Dechambre, were initially calibrated for two SAR datasets (i.e. The Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (AIRSAR) and Canadian Space Agency radar satellite (RADARSAT-1)) acquired over two bare soil study areas with various soil characteristics. The Zribi/Dechambre model was then modified by revising the roughness parameter to obtain higher accuracy in estimating sigma(0) over a larger range of incidence angles (theta). A new empirical model was also proposed by combining the four parameters of Soil Moisture (SM), standard deviation of surface height -root mean square- (rms), correlation length (l), and theta. To this end, the most appropriate form of the regression model was investigated and used for each of these parameters to obtain the highest correlation between the in-situ data and sigma(0) values. A comparison of the empirical models showed that the modified Zribi/Dechambre had the highest accuracy in predicting sigma(0) values with the Root Mean Square Errors (RMSE) of 1.20 dB and 1.59 dB over Oklahoma and Quebec, respectively. Furthermore, coefficients values of the new proposed model remained stable in the two datasets unlike the other investigated models. In this study, the effects of l on the accuracy of the new proposed model were also assessed. It was concluded that l had a considerable impact on the accuracy of the proposed model and including this parameter can improve the accuracy by up to 1 dB.

TI  - Evaluation of Landsat-8 TIRS data recalibrations and land surface temperature split-window algorithms over a homogeneous crop area with different phenological land covers
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Successive re-calibrations were implemented in Landsat-8 TIRS data since launch. This paper evaluates the performances of both: (1) these re-calibrations, up to the last calibration update announced for TIRS data in the next Landsat Collection 2; and (2) single-channel (SC) corrections and split-window (SW) algorithms to retrieve land surface temperature (LST) from TIRS data. A robust and accurate multi-year (2014-2019) set of reference ground data were used, which included thermal infrared (TIR) radiance measurements taken along transects in a uniform and thermally homogeneous rice paddy area, but also emissivity measurements for the different ground covers at the site through the year. The calibration results showed significant biases at the site for data after the 2014 reprocessing, but negligible biases and root-mean-square differences (RMSDs) <1.5 K were obtained when using the current TIRS data in Collection 1 (i.e., data after the 2017 reprocessing). The last announced calibration update mainly introduced differences in biases, improving slightly the results for band 10 and presenting a calibration response difference between bands. The SC corrections showed negligible LST biases for both bands and the lowest RMSDs (<1.6 K) when using the band 10 data in the current Collection 1, and the bias disappeared for this band after applying the calibration update. Three of the seventeen different SW equations evaluated in the paper showed negligible biases and LST RMSDs lower than or equal to 0.8 K. These three SW algorithms are mainly recommended for users of the current TIRS data in Collection 1; one of them being that proposed to generate a SW LST product in the future Collection 3. Finally, bias differences around 1.4 K were shown in the results of the SW algorithms after applying the calibration update announced for Collection 2.

TI  - Before <i>sentinel bleeding</i>: early prediction of postpancreatectomy hemorrhage (PPH) with a CT-based scoring system
T2  - EUROPEAN RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives Clinically significant pancreatic fistula (POPF) has been established as a well-known risk factor for late and severe postpancreatectomy hemorrhage after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) (postpancreatectomy pancreatic fistula-associated hemorrhage [PPFH]). Our aim was to assess whether contrast-enhanced CT scan after PD is an effective tool for early prediction of PPFH. Methods From a prospectively acquired database, all consecutive patients who underwent PD between January 2013 and May 2019 were identified; within this database, all patients who were evaluated, for clinical suspicion of POPF, with at least one contrast-enhanced CT scan examination, were enrolled in this retrospective study. The selected CT findings included perianastomotic fluid collections and air bubbles; pancreaticojejunostomy (PJ) was analyzed in terms of dehiscence and defect. Results One hundred seventy-eight out of 953 PD patients (18.7%) suffered from clinically significant POPF; after exclusions, 166 patients were enrolled. Among this subset, 33 patients (19.9%) had at least one PPFH episode. In multivariable analysis, PPFH was associated with postoperative CT evidence of fluid collections (p = 0.046), air bubbles (p = 0.046), and posterior PJ defect (p < 0.001). Based on these findings, a practical 4-point prediction score was developed (AUC: 0.904, Se: 76%, Sp: 93.8%): patients with a score >= 3 demonstrated a significantly higher risk of PPFH development (OR = 45.6, 95% CI: 13.0-159.3). Conclusions Postoperative CT scan permits early stratification of PPFH risk, thus providing an actual aid for patients' management.

TI  - Health problems in travellers to Nepal visiting CIWEC clinic in Kathmandu - A GeoSentinel analysis
T2  - TRAVEL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Nepal has always been a popular international travel destination. There is limited published data, however, on the spectrum of illnesses acquired by travellers to Nepal.Methods: GeoSentinel is a global data collection network of travel and tropical medicine providers that monitors travel-related morbidity. Records for ill travellers with at least one confirmed or probable diagnosis, were extracted from the GeoSentinel database for the CIWEC Clinic Kathmandu site from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2017.Results: A total of 24,271 records were included. The median age was 30 years (range: 0-91); 54% were female. The top 3 system-based diagnoses in travellers were: gastrointestinal (32%), pulmonary (16%), and dermatologic (9%). Altitude illness comprised 9% of all diagnoses. There were 278 vaccine-preventable diseases, most frequently influenza A (41%) and typhoid fever (19%; S. typhi 52 and S. paratyphi 62). Of 64 vector-borne illnesses, dengue was the most frequent (64%), followed by imported malaria (14%). There was a single traveller with Japanese encephalitis. Six deaths were reported.Conclusions: Travellers to Nepal face a wide spectrum of illnesses, particularly diarrhoea, respiratory disease, and altitude illness. Pre-travel consultations for travellers to Nepal should focus on prevention and treatment of diarrhoea and altitude illness, along with appropriate immunizations and travel advice.

TI  - Large-scale digital mapping of topsoil total nitrogen using machine learning models and associated uncertainty map
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the spatial distribution of soil nutrients and factors affecting their concentration and availability is crucial for soil fertility management and sustainable land utilization while quantifying factors affecting soil nitrogen distribution in Qorveh-Dehgolan plain is mostly lacking. This study, thus, aimed at digital modeling and mapping the spatial distribution of topsoil total nitrogen (TN) in Qorveh-Dehgolan plain with an area of 150,000 ha using random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), and cubist (CB) algorithms. A total of 130 observation points were collected from a depth of 0 to 30 cm from topsoil surfaces based on a random sampling pattern. Then, soil physicochemical properties, calcium carbonate equivalent, organic carbon, and topsoil total nitrogen were measured. A number of 51 environmental variables including 31 geomorphometric attributes derived from a digital elevation model with 12.5-m spatial resolution, 13 spectral indices and reflectance from SENTINEL-2 satellite (MSIsensor), and five soil properties and two spatial variables of latitude and longitude were used as covariates for digital mapping of topsoil total nitrogen. The most appropriate covariates were then selected by the Boruta algorithm in the R software environment. A standard deviation map was produced to show model uncertainty. The covariate selection resulted in the separation of 14 effective covariates in the spatial prediction of topsoil total nitrogen by using the data mining algorithms. The validation of digital mapping of topsoil total nitrogen by RF, DT, and CB models using 20% of independent data showed root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.032, 0.035, and 0.043%; mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.0008, 0.001, and 0.002%; and based on the coefficients of determination of 0.42, 0.38, 0.35, respectively. Relative importance (RI) of environmental covariates using the %IncMSE index indicated the importance of two geomorphometric variables of midslope position and normalized height along with SAVI and NDVI remote sensing variables in the spatial modeling and distribution of total nitrogen in the studied lands. The RF prediction and associated uncertainty maps, with show high accuracy and low standard deviation in the most part of study area, reveled low overfitting and overtraining in soil-landscape modeling; so, this model can lead to the development of a digital map of soil surface properties with acceptable accuracy for sustainable land utilization.

TI  - Water quality assessment using Sentinel-2 imagery with estimates of chlorophyll a, Secchi disk depth, and Cyanobacteria cell number: the Cantareira System reservoirs (Sao Paulo, Brazil)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite images were used to assess surface water quality based on the concentration of chlorophyll a (chla), light penetration measured by the Secchi disk method (SD), and the Cyanobacteria cells number per mL (cyano). For this case study, six reservoirs interconnected were evaluated, comprising the Cantareira System (CS) in Sao Paulo State (Brazil). The work employed Sentinel-2 images from 2015 to 2018, SNAP image processing software, and the native products conc_chl and kd_z90max, treated using Case 2 Regional Coast Color (C2RCC) atmospheric correction. The database was obtained from CETESB, the agency legally responsible for operation of the Inland Water Quality Monitoring Network in Sao Paulo State. The results demonstrated robustness in the estimates of chla (RMSE = 3.73; NRMSE% = 19%) and SD (RMSE = 2,26; NRMSE% = 14%). Due to the strong relationship between cyano and chla (r(2) = 0.84, p < 0.01, n = 90), both obtained from field measurements, there was also robustness in cyano estimates based on the estimates of chla from the satellite images. The data revealed a clear pattern, with the upstream reservoirs being more eutrophic, compared to those downstream. There were evident concerns, about water quality, particularly due to the high numbers of Cyanobacteria cells, especially in the upstream reservoirs.

TI  - Integration of deep convolutional neural networks and mathematical morphology-based postclassification framework for urban slum mapping
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We propose the convolutional neural networks approach for detecting urban slums from very high resolution (VHR) satellite images. Slums are becoming an inevitable and growing phenomenon in cities of the global south, whose locations are inappropriate in official statistics and maps. Thus the automatic detection and identification of slums provides vibrant information to decision-makers for formulating pro-poor policies in urban planning. However, field surveys are used as the conventional methods for slum detection, which are expensive and inefficient. The challenge is to find an automatic approach for identifying slums from VHR imagery. Although numerous studies focused on detecting slums from satellite data, only limited number captured their differences. Due to the unique spectral signatures of urban slums, it could not be simply classified as other urban (buildings, vegetation, and roads) features. We explore the potential of the dilated kernel-based deep convolutional neural network (DK-DCNN) approach to the learning of discriminatory spatial features and the automatic detection of slums from other features. However, the result obtained by the proposed DK-DCNN achieves high accuracy. The open area of informal settlements and the roofing structures of formal settlements are misclassified as slums. Morphological spatial pattern analysis, based on mathematical morphology, is used as a postprocessing method to enhance the classification accuracy. The four distinct very high-resolution satellite images captured byWorldView-2 Sensor (1.84 m) of Madurai and Tiruppur city, South India, have shown the performance of the proposed method to distinguish urban slums from other features by producing higher accuracy than any other approach.

TI  - Field-scale crop yield prediction using multi-temporal WorldView-3 and PlanetScope satellite data and deep learning
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural management at field-scale is critical for improving yield to address global food security, as providing enough food for the world's growing population has become a wicked problem for both scientists and policy-makers. County- or regional-scale data do not provide meaningful information to farmers who are interested in field-scale yield forecasting for effective and timely field management. No studies directly utilized raw satellite imagery for field-scale yield prediction using deep learning. The objectives of this paper were twofold: (1) to develop a raw imagery-based deep learning approach for field-scale yield prediction, (2) investigate the contribution of in-season multitemporal imagery for grain yield prediction with hand-crafted features and WorldView-3 (WV) and PlanetScope (PS) imagery as the direct input, respectively. Four WV-3 and 25 PS imagery collected during the growing season of soybean were utilized. Both 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) convolution neural network (CNN) architectures were developed that integrated spectral, spatial, temporal information contained in the satellite data. For comparison, hundreds of carefully selected spectral, spatial, textural, and temporal features that are optimal for crop growth monitoring were extracted and fed into the same deep learning model. Our results demonstrated that (1) deep learning was able to predict yield directly using raw satellite imagery to the extent that was comparable to feature-fed deep learning approaches; (2) both 2D and 3D CNN models were able to explain nearly 90% variance in field-scale yield; (3) limited number of WV-3 outperformed multi-temporal PS data collected during entire growing season mainly attributed to RedEdge and SWIR bands available with WV-3; and (4) 3D CNN increased the prediction power of PS data compared to 2D CNN due to its ability to digest temporal features extracted from PS data.

T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Satellite land surface temperature (LST) is vital for climatological and environmental studies. However, LST datasets are not continuous in time and space mainly due to cloud cover. Here we combine LST with Climate Forecast System Version 2 (CFSv2) modeled temperatures to derive a continuous gap filled global LST dataset at a spatial resolution of 1 km. Temporal Fourier analysis is used to derive the seasonality (climatology) on a pixel-by-pixel basis, for LST and CFSv2 temperatures. Gaps are filled by adding the CFSv2 temperature anomaly to climatological LST. The accuracy is evaluated in nine regions across the globe using cloud-free LST (mean values: R-2 = 0.93, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 2.7 degrees C, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) = 2.1 degrees C). The provided dataset contains day, night, and daily mean LST for the Eastern Mediterranean. We provide a Google Earth Engine code and a web app that generates gap filled LST in any part of the world, alongside a pixel-based evaluation of the data in terms of MAE, RMSE and Pearson's r.

TI  - Burning in southwestern Brazilian Amazonia, 2016?2019
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is one of the most powerful modifiers of the Amazonian landscape and knowledge about its drivers is needed for planning control and suppression. A plethora of factors may play a role in the annual dynamics of fire frequency, spanning the biophysical, climatic, socioeconomic and institutional dimensions. To uncover the main forces currently at play, we investigated the area burned in both forested and deforested areas in the outstanding case of Brazil?s state of Acre, in southwestern Amazonia. We mapped burn scars in already-deforested areas and intact forest based on satellite images from the Landsat series analyzed between 2016 and 2019. The mapped burnings in already-deforested areas totalled 550,251 ha. In addition, we mapped three forest fires totaling 34,084 ha. Fire and deforestation were highly correlated, and the latter occurred mainly in federal government lands, with protected areas showing unprecedented forest fire levels in 2019. These results indicate that Acre state is under increased fire risk even during average rainfall years. The record fires of 2019 may continue if Brazil?s ongoing softening of environmental regulations and enforcement is maintained. Acre and other Amazonian states must act quickly to avoid an upsurge of social and economic losses in the coming years.

TI  - Forecasting upper atmospheric scalars advection using deep learning: an <i>O</i><sub>3</sub> experiment
T2  - MACHINE LEARNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Weather forecast based on extrapolation methods is gathering a lot of attention due to the advance of artificial intelligence. Recent works on deep neural networks (CNN, RNN, LSTM, etc.) are enabling the development of spatiotemporal prediction models based on the analysis of historical time-series, images, and satellite data. In this paper, we focus on the use of deep learning for the forecast of stratospheric Ozone (O-3), especially in the cases of exchanges between the polar vortex and mid-latitudes known as Ozone Secondary Events (OSE). Secondary effects of the Antarctic Ozone Hole are regularly observed above populated zones on South America, south of Africa, and New Zealand, resulting in abrupt reductions in the total ozone column of more than 10% and a consequent increase in UV radiation in densely populated areas. We study different OSE events from the literature, comparing real data with predictions from our model. We obtained interesting results and insights that may lead to accurate and fast prediction models to forecast stratospheric Ozone and the occurrence of OSE.

TI  - Genomic profiling of endometrial cancer and relationship with volume of endometrial cancer disease spread
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Lymph node (LN) metastasis and genomic profiles are important prognostic factors in endometrial cancer (EMCA). However, the prognostic significance of low volume metastasis found in sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) is unknown. We sought to determine if genomic mutations were associated with metastatic volume.Methods: Surgically staged women with EC who were enrolled in both a SLN clinical trial and tumor sequencing protocol were eligible. Relevant targets were enriched by a custom designed Agilent SureSelect hybrid capture enrichment library using standard protocols. Three specific gene mutations were evaluated, TP53, PTEN and PIK3CA in the primary tumor of patients with LN negative, LN positive and ITC disease.Results: 42 patients were eligible; of these, 7 (16.7%) had ITC only and 7 (16.7%) had micrometastatic or macrometastatic (LN positive) disease. No differences were seen in TP53, PIK3CA or PTEN between groups. All ITC patients with TP53 mutations were of non-endometrioid histology (2/7). Deeper myometrial invasion and lymph vascular space invasion were more likely to occur in the LN positive group (p < 0.01 for both). No patients with ITC had a recurrence in a median 67.7 months of follow-up since surgery.Conclusions: This pilot investigation did not identify differences between frequency of PIK3CA, PTEN or TP53 mutations in tumors and volume of LN metastasis. Low number of ITC limited the ability to detect genomic differences, however mutations appeared to align with expected histology. More work is needed to define the relationship between genomic mutations, histology, ITC, and prognosis.

TI  - Inversion of the leaf area index of rice fields using vegetation isoline patterns considering the fraction of vegetation cover
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Inversion on the basis of radiative transfer model (RTM) is the prevailing approach for obtaining the leaf area index (LAI) from satellite images. Ill-posed inversions are a problem in RTM-based methods, however, and so here the vegetation isoline pattern in red and near-infrared spectral space was used, with consideration of the fraction of vegetation cover (fCover), to develop a look-up table (LUT) for the LAI inversion of rice fields. In PROSAIL (PROprietesSPECTrales and Scattering by Arbitrarily Inclined Leaves) model simulations, to avoid some unreasonable parameter combinations, the values of the input parameters were set with some a priori knowledge, and 3580 parameter combinations were generated in the LUT. This represents much fewer combinations than for a conventional LUT. Comparison tests demonstrated that the small-size LUT built with prior knowledge did not decrease the accuracy of the inversed LAIs; rather it improved the accuracy by taking into account fCover. The proposed LUT was applied to the images captured by the wide field of view (WFV) cameras loaded on the Gaofen-1 (GF-1) satellite. Evaluation of the inversed LAIs using in situ data showed that the root-mean-square error (RMSE) was 0.37, and that the relative error (RE) was 14%. Comparison with the error of inversed LAIs produced by the LUT without considering fCover revealed that taking into account the fCover when building a LUT based on the vegetation isoline pattern improved the accuracy of the LAI inversion. This study demonstrates that vegetation isoline-based LUT, with consideration of fCover, is a promising technique for producing LAI maps of crops with high spatial resolution. It will also be helpful for the validation of moderate-resolution LAI products and agricultural monitoring.

T2  - CELL
M3  - Article
AB  - SARS-CoV-2 canmutate and evade immunity, with consequences for efficacy of emerging vaccines and antibody therapeutics. Here, we demonstrate that the immunodominant SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) receptor binding motif (RBM) is a highly variable region of S and provide epidemiological, clinical, and molecular characterization of a prevalent, sentinel RBM mutation, N439K. We demonstrate N439K S protein has enhanced binding affinity to the hACE2 receptor, and N439K viruses have similar in vitro replication fitness and cause infections with similar clinical outcomes as compared to wild type. We show the N439K mutation confers resistance against several neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, including one authorized for emergency use by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and reduces the activity of some polyclonal sera from persons recovered from infection. Immune evasion mutations that maintain virulence and fitness such as N439K can emerge within SARS-CoV-2 S, highlighting the need for ongoing molecular surveillance to guide development and usage of vaccines and therapeutics.

AB  - Located between the sub-Antarctic Front and the Antarctic Polar Front, the Prince Edward Islands (PEIs) provide an essential breeding ground for top predators and are an ideal location to investigate disturbances linked to climate change. This study provides the first seasonal characterisation of surface hydrography at the PEIs, using satellite and reanalysis products from 1993 to 2016. Sea surface temperature (SST) showed consistently higher values to the north, while wind, currents and eddy kinetic energy all showed higher values to the south of the islands. The highest SST (8 degrees C) occurred in summer and the lowest (2 degrees C) in winter, with a one-to two-month delay between the maximum incoming solar radiation (in December-January) and the highest SST (in February). The highest wind speed occurred in July (10.8 m s(-1)) and the minimum in February (7 m s(-1)). Geostrophic currents were four-times larger than Ekman currents, showing lower speeds between April and June (0.25-0.30 m s(-1)) and a peak in August (0.45 m s(-1)). There were no significant differences for SST and Ekman currents between the regions upstream and downstream of the PEIs. In contrast, surface total and geostrophic current velocities were weaker downstream because the islands act as a barrier to the flow. A zone of lower wind speed, coinciding with enhanced positive wind stress curl (WSC), favouring downwelling, occurred directly upstream throughout the year. Although WSC over the PEIs was negative (upwelling-favourable), no corresponding cooling was evident in SST. This seasonal characterisation provides a baseline against which interannual/decadal variability and future changes in these parameters can be assessed.

TI  - Immunotherapy responsive SARS-CoV-2 infection exacerbating opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome
T2  - MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS AND RELATED DISORDERS
M3  - Letter
AB  - The global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 has been known to have diverse neurologic complications among adult patients. The neurologic effects of SARS-CoV-2 in the pediatric population is poorly described, especially in those with rare underlying neurologic conditions. We describe the first known case of SARS-CoV-2 in a pediatric patient with refractory opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome. A 25-month-old female with progressive opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome secondary to metastatic neuroblastoma status-post resection and chemotherapy presented with worsening opsoclonus, tremor, and breakthrough seizures. She had no fever or respiratory symptoms at presentation. Urine catecholamines were unchanged, with low suspicion for tumor recurrence. She was found to have SARS-CoV-2 via nasopharnygeal PCR assay. She received intravenous immunoglobulin and dexamethasone therapy with improvement in opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome symptoms and was discharged home at her neurologic baseline. Patients with opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome may present with exacerbation of symptoms in the context of SARS-CoV-2. This case describes a sentinel report of a child with opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome presenting with worsening symptoms with concomitant SARS-CoV-2. Improvement in symptoms was achieved with standard of care therapies.

TI  - Assessment of spatial?temporal changes of ecological environment quality based on RSEI and GEE: A case study in Erhai Lake Basin, Yunnan province, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Erhai Lake Basin is an area with the active economic and social development of agriculture and tourism, facing increasingly prominent environmental problems with rapid urbanization. Assessing spatial?temporal changes in ecological environment quality objectively and quantitatively in a timely fashion is crucial for environmental protection and policymaking. First, we selected the high-quality Landsat imagery acquired at the same time phase in the years of 1999, 2004, 2009, 2014, and 2019 respectively. Second, the remote sensingbased ecological index (RSEI) was constructed by using Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS imagery based on Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Third, we assessed the spatial?temporal changes and spatial autocorrelation of ecological environment quality in our study area based on five RSEI maps. The mean values of RSEI in 1999, 2004, 2009, 2014, and 2019 were 0.513 0.457, 0.462, 0.506, and 0.509, respectively, which indicated that the overall ecological environment quality of the Erhai Lake Basin degraded from 1999 to 2009 and promoted from 2009 to 2019. The worst degradation occurred between 1999 and 2004, about 27.12% of the total area was degraded, and the greatest improvement occurred between 2009 and 2014, about 26.42% of the total area was improved. The Globalmoran?s I value ranged from 0.662 to 0.783 in 1999?2019, which indicated that the spatial distribution of ecological environment quality was positively correlated. The cluster map of local indicator of spatial association of RSEI show that the high-high points were mainly located in the western and southern highaltitude area of the study area, and the low-low points were mainly distributed in lakeside area, where populations were dense and human activities were frequent. This study provides a promising approach to assess the spatial?temporal changes in ecological environment quality based on RSEI and GEE, which is critical to investigate the interactions between human activities and ecosystem services in basin systems.

TI  - Soil salinization monitoring in the Werigan-Kuqa Oasis, China, based on a Three-Dimensional Feature Space Model with Machine Learning Algorithm.
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is an important indicator for monitoring soil salinization in arid and semiarid regions. However, traditional salinity index (SI)-vegetation index (VI) feature space, and other single feature space often ignore the LST information, which has largely constrained the soil salinity detecting quantitatively and effectively. In this study, random forest (RF) as one of the machine learning algorithms was utilized to downscale the LST retrieved from Landsat 8 thermal-infrared band from 100 m to 30 m. Then, we developed a new three-dimensional feature space model that combines downscaled LST, SI and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to assess the soil salinity in the Werigan-Kuqa Oasis, a typical delta oasis in an arid region, China. The experiment results are further compared with 20 different feature spaces and spectral indices. The result shows that the proposed model produces higher accuracy than other method, which can provide a rapid and relatively accurate monitoring results of soil salinization in the study area.

TI  - A self-attention capsule feature pyramid network for water body extraction from remote sensing imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurately measuring surface water bodies and monitoring their conditions and changes are greatly important to a wide range of environmental and social activities. Recently, with the development of optical remote sensing sensors in resolutions and qualities, as well as the convenience in data acquisition, remote sensing images have become an important data source for assisting water body measurements. However, due to the considerable variations of water bodies in shapes, areas, and sizes, the diversities of colour appearances, and the complicated surface and surrounding scenarios, it is still challenging to automatically and accurately extract water bodies from remote sensing images. In this paper, we develop a novel self-attention capsule feature pyramid network (SA-CapsFPN) to extract water bodies from remote sensing images. By designing a deep capsule feature pyramid architecture, the SA-CapsFPN can extract and fuse multi-level and multiscale high-order capsule features to provide a high-resolution, semantically strong feature encoding for improving pixel-wise water body extraction accuracy. With the integration of the context-augmentation and self-attention modules, the SA-CapsFPN can exploit multiscale contextual properties and emphasize channel-wise informative features, thereby enhancing the feature representation capability. The SA-CapsFPN performs superiorly in extracting water bodies of varying shapes, areas, and sizes, as well as diverse surface and environmental scenarios. Quantitative evaluations on two big remote sensing image datasets show that an overall performance with a P, an R, and an F (score) of 0.9771, 0.9684, and 0.9727, respectively, are achieved. Comparative studies with five deep learning based methods also demonstrate the applicability and superiority of the SA-CapsFPN in water body extraction tasks.

TI  - Global inventory of fluvial ridges on Earth and lessons applicable to Mars
T2  - EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - Orbiting and landed spacecrafts have provided vast amounts of data on fluvial and fluvial-related landforms and sediments on Mars. One variant of these landforms consists of ridges interpreted to be remnants of ancient fluvial activity, observed at thousands of Martian locales, suggesting extensive precipitation and runoff on early Mars. The importance of these ridges increased after the selection of the Jezero crater and the Oxia Planum landing sites for NASA?s Perseverance and ESA?s Rosalind Franklin rovers because these locations preserve fluvial sediments in ancient, lithified deltaic landforms. To further understand Martian fluvial ridges, this contribution presents an inventory of 104 sites of fluvial ridges on Earth, offering Upper Ordovician to late Holocene examples that are analogous to their Martian counterparts. The Earth global data set provides environmental contexts for the formation mechanisms and conditions that accompanied channel and valley formation, erosion, and inversion. We describe four types of erosion-resistant capping materials by which channel and valley forms became ridges after materials adjacent to channels were eroded away: (1) twenty-seven cases of volcanic rock-capped ridges; (2) sixty examples of duricrust-capped ridges (eogenesis); (3) four examples of ridge sites formed through armoring by large clasts; and (4) thirteen locations where ridges were formed by erosion after deep burial and tectonic return to the Earth?s surface (mesogenesis). Water erosion, wind erosion, and mass wasting all play a role in removing the surrounding terrain, leaving the channel deposits or valley fills standing as ridges. Such ridges can contain as little as 0% and up to 100% fluvial sediments deposited in paleochannels and paleovalleys. Many of Earth?s fluvial ridges that preserve channel fill sediments were formed as a response to shortduration seasonal or intermittent fluvial events (i.e. a few thousand to tens of thousands of years). Ridges formed from stacked channel-belts mark vertical aggradation and lateral migration occurring over more prolonged periods of fluvial activity (i.e. millions of years). Underlying materials can be older alluvial or fluvial, aeolian and lacustrine deposits, and weathered bedrock. The wide range of fluvial ridge composition and formational pathways on Earth suggests that the accumulation of the Martian fluvial deposits in paleochannels and paleovalleys (now expressed as ridges) also likely developed by both short-lived and long-lived fluvial activity. Cementation of fluvial deposit and potentially channel-adjacent sediments in the surface/near-surface environment could be prevalent on Mars, particularly because tectonism, as compared to Earth, plays a negligible role in returning buried materials to the surface. Fluvial ridges that were capped by volcanic products are also common on Earth, but very few have been identified on Mars.The discrimination of ridges exposed by erosion after deep burial (mesogenesis) versus those never buried nor exhumed (eogenesis) is not feasible based on remotely-sensed data unless cross-cutting relationships are visible in plan view. Our observations on preserved fluvial deposits compared with the underlying materials in terrestrial ridges infer that uncertainties could be significant in the case of paleohydraulic reconstructions made using measurements of the geomorphic parameters of ridges from high-spatial-resolution orbiter images.

TI  - Comparison analysis of global methane concentration derived from SCIAMACHY, AIRS, and GOSAT with surface station measurements
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - CH4 (methane) is an important greenhouse gas that has a significant impact on the formation of, and change in, the global climate. Through the development of remote sensing technology, a series of remote sensing detectors to monitor CH4 sources and sinks have been launched into space. Although a series of studies have been conducted around the CH4 concentration retrieved by AIRS (The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder instrument), SCIAMACHY (The Scanning Imaging Absorption spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography instrument), and GOSAT (The Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite), there have been few comprehensive comparative studies between these three satellite results and ground-based data. In this article, the correlation coefficient, root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), and bias are used to evaluate the CH4 retrieved from satellite data. The results reveal that: AIRS can reflect the distribution and changes of CH4 all over the world. The space coverage of GOSAT is focused between 60 degrees S to 60 degrees N, and the correlation of GOSAT with land surface stations is generally better than that with ocean surface stations. The space coverage of SCIAMACHY is between GOSAT and AIRS. Though SCIAMACHY data show a poor consistency with surface measurements, SCIAMACHY can also reflect the spatial and temporal dynamic distribution of CH4 around the world to a certain extent.

TI  - Quantifying seasonal variations in microphytobenthos biomass on estuarine tidal flats using Sentinel-1/2 data
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying temporal and spatial changes in microphytobenthos (MPB) biomass is critical for understanding its ecological function in estuarine food web networks and carbon flows. However, tidal fluctuations and the complex composition of coastal sediment limit remote sensing applications for estimating MPB biomass seasonal variations in estuarine tidal flats. We integrated radar Sentinel-1 (S1) and optical Sentinel-2 (S2) remote sensing data to quantify the temporal and spatial variability in MPB biomass in the Changjiang estuary, China. Pixels of water bodies on the tidal flats were removed by dynamic threshold segmentation of the water index with the combined S1 and S2 data, and salt marsh pixels were masked with the first red-edge band in the S2 data. We used the continuum-removed spectral absorption depth feature to construct a regression model for estimating MPB biomass with a regression coefficient of 0.81. The results showed that spectral absorption continuum removal methods using broadband multispectral data for MPB estimation are a promising alternative to hyperspectral narrowband ratio operation. Compared with the widely used normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the scaled absorption depth feature was more stable for MPB estimation under a changeable sediment background. The produced seasonal map showed that the high biomass levels of the MPB in the study area are not limited to one season and one site, with an annual mean biomass of 14.39 mg chlorophyll a (Chl-a).m(-2) and 71% confirmed accuracy. The highest biomass levels occurred in summer in the supratidal zone (19.51 mg Chl-a.m(-2)) and in spring in the intertidal zone (17.10 mg Chl-a.m(-2)) in the Changjiang estuary. The relative shore height, derived fromthe tidal range here, is an important variable that shapes the MPB spatial distribution. This study demonstrates the potential of integrating high-spatial-resolution (10 m) S1 and S2 data for future large-scale estimation of intertidal MPB. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Comparison of the application of co- and cross-polarized sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar data to tropical cyclone evaluation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is considered one of the most powerful sensors for tropical cyclone assessment. In this study, 14 tropical cyclone (TC) events captured by the Sentinel-1A/B satellite are collected to compare the similarities, differences and quantitative relationships between co- and cross-polarization SAR applications for tropical cyclone evaluation. This study uses multiple co-polarized C-band geophysical model functions (GMFs) and cross-polarized ocean backscatter models, including a C-band Cross-Polarized Ocean Backscatter (C-2PO) model and a C-band Cross-Polarization Coupled-Parameters Ocean (C-3PO) model to estimate the sea surface tropical cyclone wind field. The results reveal that the structure values of the wind circle radius by co-polarization SAR wind inversion are similar to those of cross-polarization. The combination of the two polarization modes can get a more accurate estimation on tropical cyclone rating of the intensity level and hazard of the potential tropical cyclone damages. In addition, a corresponding formula with a correlation coefficient of 0.677 between co- and cross-polarization at 10-km resolution is obtained.

TI  - Comparison of gap-filling techniques applied to the CCI soil moisture database in Southern Europe
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is a key variable that plays an important role in land-atmosphere interactions. Monitoring SM is crucial for many applications and can help to determine the impact of climate change. Therefore, it is essential to have continuous and long-term databases for this variable. Satellite missions have contributed to this; however, the continuity of the series is compromised due to the data gaps derived by different factors, including revisit time, presence of seasonal ice or Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) contamination. In this work, the applicability of different gap-filling techniques is evaluated on the ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI) SM combined product, which is the longest available satellite-based SM data record. The methods used were linear, cubic and autoregressive interpolation and support vector machines (SVMs). This study focused on Southern Europe and spanned the years 2003?2015. The different methods were applied in the temporal and spatial domains and evaluated using the holdout cross-validation technique. A set of variables was introduced in the SVM model to estimate SM, namely, land surface temperature, precipitation, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), potential evaporation, soil texture and geographical coordinates. For the SVMs, several combinations of these variables were considered, including a principal component analysis (PCA) containing all of them. Although the different methods show a generally good performance, the SVM method outperforms the rest. Using the SM of the precedent day (SMt-1) is key to obtain good estimates. The median value of the correlation coefficient (R) obtained with the SVM and the SMt-1 series in the temporal analysis was 0.83, and the RMSE was 0.025 m3m? 3. Similar results were obtained in the spatial analysis, with the best performance (R = 0.88; RMSE = 0.024 m3m? 3) obtained by the SVM using the SMt-1 series and the static variables. The application of PCA to input variables was not beneficial, and the interpolation methods failed when dealing with large spatial or temporal gaps. A validation of the CCI SM series with in situ SM data from four networks located in Spain, France, Germany and Italy was also performed and no substantial differences were observed between results obtained with the original and with the reconstructed series. In addition, best inputs obtained with SVM were used to evaluate the random forest (RF) method in the temporal and spatial domain. This method showed a good ability to estimate soil moisture values in the temporal domain but to a lesser extent than SVM while for the spatial domain it did not seem to be as accurate. Our results confirm that we can efficiently deal with spatio-temporal gaps on observational SM databases using the SVM method and the past time series and soil texture as supporting information.

TI  - An early warning sign of critical transition in the Antarctic ice sheet - a data-driven tool for a spatiotemporal tipping point
T2  - NONLINEAR PROCESSES IN GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Our recently developed tool, called Directed Affinity Segmentation (DAS), was originally designed for the data-driven discovery of coherent sets in fluidic systems. Here we interpret that it can also be used to indicate early warning signs of critical transitions in ice shelves as seen from remote sensing data. We apply a directed spectral clustering methodology, including an asymmetric affinity matrix and the associated directed graph Laplacian, to reprocess the ice velocity data and remote sensing satellite images of the Larsen C ice shelf. Our tool has enabled the simulated prediction of historical events from historical data and fault lines responsible for the critical transitions leading to the breakup of the Larsen C ice shelf crack, which resulted in the A-68 iceberg. Such benchmarking of methods, using data from the past to forecast events that are now also in the past, is sometimes called post-casting, analogous to forecasting into the future. Our method indicated the coming crisis months before the actual occurrence.

T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Anthropogenic and natural impacts threaten the sustainability of ecosystem services provided by the ocean and its coastlines. Coral reefs are an endangered and important component of the tropical realm. Coral reef science, management and conservation programs greatly benefit from habitat maps when they are available. This study reviews the use of the Millennium Coral Reef Mapping Project (MCRMP), which hierarchically mapped since 2004 coral reefs worldwide using Landsat satellite multispectral imagery at 30 m spatial resolution. Tracking in the scientific literature the impact of MCRMP products proved to be difficult because of frequent lack of citations (omission errors) and confusion with products that have integrated MCRMP data but degraded them (commission errors). To categorize the applications, we selected 62 representative studies that unambiguously used MCRMP products. MCRMP products were used prominently to achieve new results in coral reef inventories; conservation planning; enhancement of biodiversity and fishery resource mapping, monitoring and modeling; connectivity and climate change modeling. The products were also useful to map other ecosystems. We evaluate the main strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats to MCRMP products. From this review, we also make recommendations and reflect more generally on the value of future global-scale mapping projects targeting specific ecosystems.(c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Forest remnants in private lands are critical to the persistence of endangered birds in an Amazonian hotspot
T2  - JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation is considered the main human-induced and short-term threat to the persistence of forest species in the Amazon. Long-lasting and high-intensity deforestation, low coverage of protected areas, and high level of species endemism make the Bele ' m Endemism Area (BEA) particularly more vulnerable than the rest of the Amazon area. However, this occurrence remains strongly neglected in global and regional conservation analyses. In this study, we used species distribution modeling and remote sensing data to map the richness pattern of endangered birds from the Amazon and assessed the species' conservation status based on landscape patterns of forest remnants. Our results revealed that the BEA's imperiled avifauna presents the most significant state of vulnerability to extinction compared with other areas of endemism in the Amazon. Almost 80 % of the total area of the BEA presents a strong anthropization of natural ecosystems. Of the 20 % of the area with high conservation value remnants, only 25 % is within protected areas, whereas the other 75 % is under private property domains. Moreover, forest remnants on private properties have a higher biodiversity conservation value as they are home to more threatened bird species than remnants within protected areas. Therefore, we argue that effective implementation of conservation of threatened bird species in the BEA depends directly on the maintenance of forest remnants on private properties from practical conservation actions.

TI  - Prediction of grape yields from time-series vegetation indices using satellite remote sensing and a machine-learning approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Grape yield prediction is an important tool used by growers to optimize vineyard management and obtain better income. In this regard, the growth stages of grapes play important roles in the evaluation of vineyard production throughout the season. Predicted yield maps allow growers to view spatial variability across fields and to determine the best harvesting time and marketing strategy. Different methods are used to estimate yield; however, large-scale estimation is difficult due to labor and time requirements. Machine learning and satellite remote sensing have the potential to obtain quick and rapid assessments over large areas with lower costs and in shorter timeframes. In this context, the purpose of this research was to develop yield prediction models based on a machine-learning approach using satellite-based time-series images. In this study, Landsat 8 surface reflectance products from 2017, 2018 and 2019 were used to map the satellite-based normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), leaf area index (LAI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI). Moreover, different growth stages were observed using moving averages and exponential smoothing methods based on the per-pixel values from the satellite imagery. The vegetation indices had particularly close relationships with each other at the time of maximum canopy expansion. To remove the seasonality of the vegetation indices, a moving average was applied to determine one representative mean for each vineyard. The generated models were validated using regression analysis and an artificial neural network (ANN) approach. The results indicated that of all the vegetation indices, NDVI had the highest accuracy (r(2) = 0.79) in 2017 and 2019; however, the LAI accuracy was higher than the accuracies of the other indices (r(2) = 0.79) in 2019. Nevertheless, the artificial neural network-based machine learning results indicated that NDVI had the highest accuracy in 2017 (R = 0.94), 2018 (R = 0.95) and 2019 (R = 0.92) among all the vegetation indices. Thus, machine learning achieved reliable grape yield monitoring across the studied years at local and regional levels. Ground reference yield datasets were used for comparison with the predicted yields. The findings suggest that vegetation indices can be used for calculating site-specific management of vineyards and for predicting yields. The machine-learning methods applied with satellite time-series images can achieve reliable table grape yield prediction models. These integrated models could be used for logistics and decision-making regarding table grape production.

T2  - DOKLADY EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The results of space monitoring of an extreme ecological situation near Kamchatka Peninsula, which was responsible for a mass death of hydrobionts in autumn 2020, are presented. The analysis of long-term series of satellite data (>15 000 scenes) on sea surface temperature (from 1981 to 2020) and concentration of chlorophyll a (from 2000 to 2020) showed strong positive temperature anomalies (deviations from a climate norm 3-6 degrees C) in the studied region in July-September 2020, which resulted in anomalous increase in the concentration of chlorophyll a (5-8 times higher than the background values) in the end of September-the beginning of October 2020. As a result, a significantly changed biogenic regime led to harmful bloom of algae (red tide), which caused death of hydrobionts both in Avacha Bay and coastal regions of the entire Kamchatka Peninsula.

TI  - Validation and comparison of high-resolution MAIAC aerosol products over Central Asia
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosols are an important contributor to global atmospheric environmental changes and have critical effects on the global climate system and human health. Central Asia is one of the most important sources of dust aerosols in the world and produces a significant portion of global aerosols. Central Asia is also a scarce aerosol-data area, so it is of great significance to obtain and verify new aerosol data from this region. In this study, based on the aerosol optical depth (AOD) data from remote sensing (MYD04_L2) and ground-based observations (AERONET and Microtops II), the applicability of multiangle implementation of atmospheric correction (MAIAC) AOD in Central Asia was comprehensively analyzed, and the variation in AOD in Central Asia over the last 20 years was analyzed by the information entropy method. The results indicate that MAIAC AOD has good application prospects in Central Asia and can effectively compensate for the lack of observational data from Central Asia. MAIAC AOD exhibits excellent spatiotemporal consistency with MYD04 deep blue (DB) AOD and has a better ability than MYD04 DB AOD to describe local fine-scale features. Furthermore, MAIAC AOD demonstrates high consistency with ground-based AOD observations, showing high R (0.737) and low RMSE (0.067) values and having 65.2% of samples falling within the expected error (EE) envelope. When employing the ground-based AOD observations as a bridge, MAIAC exhibits superiority to MYD04 DB in both the richness number of valid high-quality retrievals and the retrieval accuracy of various evaluation indicators. The annual variation in AOD in Central Asia exhibits a unimodal distribution, with AOD being largest in April, followed by March and May, and comparable rangeability. Based on information entropy, interannual variation in AOD exists in most areas of Central Asia, with AOD in the Taklimakan Desert area being significantly increased and that in northern Central Asia (Kazakhstan) showing a downward trend.

TI  - Spatial Distribution of Chesapeake Bay Riparian Hemlock Forests Threatened by Hemlock Woolly Adelgid
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Landscape-scale maps of tree species densities are important tools for managing ecosystems threatened by forest pests. Eastern hemlock dominates riparian forests throughout its range. As a conifer in a deciduous landscape, hemlock plays an ecohydrological role, especially when other species are dormant. The nonnative, hemlock woolly adelgid has caused widespread hemlock decline and mortality. We used two existing basal area raster layers first to identify Chesapeake Bay subwatersheds with >= 6 percent hemlock basal area and second to quantify hemlock basal area densities within fixed-width riparian buffers of 50 m, 100 m, 250 m, and 500 m. Hemlock densities were higher in riparian zones compared with entire subwatersheds. In five subwatersheds, 50 m and 100 m zones had higher percentages of pixels with >= 25 percent hemlock basal area. We produced maps identifying hemlock riparian densities in the Pine Creek Watershed, which managers can use to prioritize sites for supplemental conifer planting under anticipated hemlock decline.Study Implications: Forest inventory and satellite data were used to map riparian hemlock stands in the Pine Creek Watershed (Pennsylvania). Pine Creek is a subwatershed of the Chesapeake Bay and an important tributary of West Branch Susquehanna River. Pine Creek headwaters are a brook trout refuge, and hemlock shading along streams stabilizes water temperature. These fisheries provide recreational value and economic support to local communities. Hemlock woolly adelgid, an invasive insect, has recently entered the watershed and will cause hemlock decline and mortality. Our maps assist the Pine Creek Watershed Council in identifying riparian areas for supplemental planting of alternative conifer seedlings.

TI  - White-Sand Savannas Expand at the Core of the Amazon After Forest Wildfires
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Across the tropics, climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of wildfires, exposing tropical forests to the risk of shifting into an open vegetation state. A recent satellite analysis of the Amazon basin suggests this might happen first in floodplains where forests are particularly fragile. We studied floodplain landscapes of the middle Rio Negro, covering similar to 4100 km(2) at the Central Amazon region, where forest ecosystems are dominant. We used Landsat images to map 40 years of wildfire history and test the hypothesis that repeatedly burnt forests fail to regenerate and can be replaced by white-sand savanna ecosystems. In the field, using a chronosequence of 'time after the first fire', we assessed changes in tree species composition, herbaceous cover and topsoil properties. Here we show that when these forests are repeatedly disturbed by wildfires, their soil gradually loses clay and nutrients and becomes increasingly sandy. In synchrony, native herbaceous cover expands, forest tree species disappear and white-sand savanna tree species become dominant. This drastic ecosystem shift happened within 40 years, likely accelerated by topsoil erosion. When recurrent fires maintain floodplain forests in an open vegetation state, topsoil erosion intensifies, transforming clay-rich soils into white-sand soils that may favour savanna tree species. Our findings reveal that white-sand savannas may expand through seasonally flooded ecosystems at the core of the Amazon, facilitated by wildfires.

TI  - Assessment of surface soil moisture from ALOS PALSAR-2 in small-scale maize fields using polarimetric decomposition technique
T2  - ACTA GEOPHYSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface soil moisture knowledge is important, especially in agriculture and irrigation management. Properties of microwave remote sensing like penetration power and longer wavelength facilitate retrieval of surface soil moisture. ALOS PALSAR-2, quad polarized data are used to retrieve surface soil moisture using polarization decomposition techniques in a marginal farmer small-scale maize field. The focus of the study is to explore the utility of ALOS PALSAR-2 in retrieving surface soil moisture using the polarization decomposition technique. The demonstration of the study is carried out in Malavalli village, southern India, an agricultural predominant area. The study involves field soil moisture sampling in synchronous with satellite pass, measuring soil properties, preprocessing of SAR data, polarization decomposition, proportional analysis, regression analysis, model calibration and validation. Van Zyl decomposition gave the highest surface scattering component (43%) and reduced volumetric scattering component compared to Yamaguchi and Freeman-Durden decomposition. Surface scattering component of Yamaguchi decomposition gave a good coefficient of determination (R-2 = 0.8029) with field-measured surface soil moisture. The semi-empirical model (SEM) was developed using surface scattering component and depolarization ratio with adjusted R-2 = 0.75 at 95% confidence interval. On its comparison with existing soil moisture models, it is observed that the developed model is performing well with RMSE and AE(max) of 1.81 and 2.88, respectively. Implying the applicability of ALOS PALSAR-2 in soil moisture retrieval in marginal farmer small-scale maize fields gave satisfactory results of accuracy.

TI  - Desmoplastic melanoma: a review of its pathology and clinical behaviour, and of management recommendations in published guidelines
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY AND VENEREOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Desmoplastic melanomas are uncommon. Their behaviour differs from that of other melanoma subtypes; therefore, management guidelines for non-desmoplastic melanomas may not be applicable. This review sought to examine all available evidence relating to the behaviour and management of desmoplastic melanomas, based on review of all relevant English-language publications, and to critically assess the recommendations for their management in current published melanoma management guidelines. Compared with other melanoma subtypes, patients with 'pure' desmoplastic melanomas (where >= 90% of the invasive melanoma is of desmoplastic melanoma subtype) have much lower rates of sentinel node positivity and distant metastasis. Local recurrence rates are higher for desmoplastic melanomas, but resection margins wider than those recommended for non-desmoplastic melanomas have not been shown to be of benefit. Adjuvant radiotherapy reduces the risk of local recurrence when a satisfactory histological clearance (>= 8 mm) cannot be achieved. Of 29 published melanoma management guidelines identified, only 11 specified management for desmoplastic melanomas, while seven simply stated that the feature should be reported. Desmoplastic melanoma is a unique melanoma subtype with biology that differs from that of other melanoma subtypes. It requires specific management strategies but few current guidelines address these.

TI  - Predicting within-field cotton yields using publicly available datasets and machine learning
T2  - AGRONOMY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Early detection of within-field yield variability for high-value commodity crops, such as cotton (Gossypium spp.), offers growers potential to improve decision-making, optimize yields, and increase profits. Over recent years, publicly available datasets have become increasingly available and at a resolution where within-field yield prediction is possible. However, the viability of using these datasets with machine learning to predict within-field cotton lint yield at key growth stages are largely unknown. This study was conducted on two cotton fields, located near Mungindi, New South Wales, Australia. Three years of yield data, soil, elevation, rainfall, and Landsat imagery were collected from each field. A total of 12 models were created using: (a) two machine learning algorithms: random forest (RF) and gradient boosting machines (GBM); (b) three growth stages: squaring, flowering, and boll-fill; and (c) two different amounts of variables: all variables and the optimal variables determined by a recursive feature elimination (RFE). Results showed a strong agreement between predicted and observed yields at flowering and boll-fill when more information was available. At flowering and boll-fill, root mean square error (RMSE) ranged between 0.15 and 0.20 t ha(-1) and Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (LCCC) ranged between 0.50 and 0.66, with RF providing superior results in most cases. Models created using the optimal variables determined by the RFE provided similar results compared to using all variables, allowing greater model accuracy and resolution with targeted sampling. Overall, these findings indicate significant potential of publicly available datasets to predict within-field cotton yield and guide decision-making in-season.

TI  - First validation of GOME-2/MetOp absorbing aerosol height using EARLINET lidar observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study is to investigate the potential of the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2) instruments, aboard the Meteorological Operational (MetOp)-A, MetOp-B and MetOp-C satellite programme platforms, to deliver accurate geometrical features of lofted aerosol layers. For this purpose, we use archived ground-based lidar data from stations available from the European Aerosol Research Lidar Network (EARLINET) database. The data are post-processed using the wavelet covariance transform (WCT) method in order to extract geometrical features such as the planetary boundary layer (PBL) height and the cloud boundaries. To obtain a significant number of collocated and coincident GOME-2 - EARLINET cases for the period between January 2007 and September 2019, 13 lidar stations, distributed over different European latitudes, contributed to this validation. For the 172 carefully screened collocations, the mean bias was found to be -0.18 +/- 1.68 km, with a near-Gaussian distribution. On a station basis, and with a couple of exceptions where very few collocations were found, their mean biases fall in the +/- 1 km range with an associated standard deviation between 0.5 and 1.5 km. Considering the differences, mainly due to the temporal collocation and the difference, between the satellite pixel size and the point view of the ground-based observations, these results can be quite promising and demonstrate that stable and extended aerosol layers as captured by the satellite sensors are verified by the ground-based data. We further present an in-depth analysis of a strong and long-lasting Saharan dust intrusion over the Iberian Peninsula. We show that, for this well-developed and spatially well-spread aerosol layer, most GOME-2 retrievals fall within 1 km of the exact temporally collocated lidar observation for the entire range of 0 to 150 km radii. This finding further testifies for the capabilities of the MetOp-borne instruments to sense the atmospheric aerosol layer heights.

TI  - Sectm1a Facilitates Protection against Inflammation-Induced Organ Damage through Promoting TRM Self-Renewal
T2  - MOLECULAR THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tissue-resident macrophages (TRMs) are sentinel cells for maintaining tissue homeostasis and organ function. In this study, we discovered that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration dramatically reduced TRM populations and suppressed their self-renewal capacities in multiple organs. Using loss- and gain-of-function approaches, we define Sectm1a as a novel regulator of TRM self-renewal. Specifically, at the earlier stage of endotoxemia, Sectm1a deficiency exaggerated acute inflammation-induced reduction of TRM numbers in multiple organs by suppressing their proliferation, which was associated with more infiltrations of inflammatory monocytes/neutrophils and more serious organ damage. By contrast, administration of recombinant Sectm1a enhanced TRM populations and improved animal survival upon endotoxin challenge. Mechanistically, we identified that Sectm1a-induced upregulation in the self-renewal capacity of TRM is dependent on GITR-activated T helper cell expansion and cytokine production. Meanwhile, we found that TRMs may play an important role in protecting local vascular integrity during endotoxemia. Our study demonstrates that Sectm1a contributes to stabling TRM populations through maintaining their self-renewal capacities, which benefits the host immune response to acute inflammation. Therefore, Sectm1a may serve as a new therapeutic agent for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.

TI  - Dynamics of CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes and controlling environmental factors in sugarcane (C4)-wheat (C3) ecosystem of dry sub-humid region in India
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, CO2 exchange over sugarcane and wheat growing season was quantified by continuous measurement of CO2 fluxes using eddy covariance (EC) system from January 2014 to June 2015. We also elaborated on the response of CO2 fluxes to environmental variables. The results show that the ecosystem has seasonal and diurnal dynamics of CO2 with a distinctive U-shaped curve in both growing seasons with maximal CO2 absorption reaching up to -8.94 g C m(-2) day(-1) and -6.08 g C m(-2) day(-1) over sugarcane and wheat crop, respectively. The ecosystem as a whole acted as a carbon sink during the active growing season while it exhibits a carbon source prior to sowing and post-harvesting of crops. The cumulative net ecosystem exchange (NEE), gross primary productivity (GPP), and ecosystem respiration (R-eco) were -923.04, 3316.65, and 2433.18 g C m(-2) over the sugarcane growing season while the values were -192.30, 621.47, and 488.34 g C m(-2) over the wheat growing season. The sesbania (green manure) appeared to be a carbon source once it is incorporated into soil. The response of day-time NEE to photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) under two vapor pressure deficit (VPD) sections (0-20 h Pa and 20-40 h Pa) seems more effective over sugarcane (R-2 = 0.41-0.61) as compared to the wheat crop (R-2 = 0.25-0.40). A decrease in net CO2 uptake was observed under higher VPD conditions. Similarly, night-time NEE was exponentially related to temperature at different soil moisture conditions and showed higher response to optimum soil moisture conditions for sugarcane (R-2 = 0.87, 0.33 <= SWC < 0.42 m(3) m(-3)) and wheat (R-2 = 0.75, 0.31 <= SWC < 0.37 m(3) m(-3)) crop seasons. The response of daily averaged NEE to environmental variables through path analysis indicates that PAR was the dominant predictor with the direct path coefficient of -0.65 and -0.74 over sugarcane and wheat growing season, respectively. Satellite-based GPP products from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (GPP(MOD)) and Vegetation Photosynthetic model (GPP(VPM)) were also compared with the GPP obtained from EC (GPP(EC)) technique. The seasonal dynamics of GPP(EC) and GPP(VPM) agreed well with each other. This study covers the broad aspects ranging from micro-meteorology to remote sensing over C4-C3 cropping system

AB  - To evaluate the SEVIRI retrieval for aerosols above clouds presented in Part 1 of the companion paper, the algorithm is applied over the south-east Atlantic Ocean during the CLARIFY-2017 field campaign period. The first step of our analysis compares the retrieved aerosol and cloud properties against equivalent products from the MODIS MOD06ACAERO retrieval (Meyer et al., 2015). While the correlation between the two satellite retrievals of the above-cloud aerosol optical thickness (AOT) is good (R = 0.78), the AOT retrieved by SEVIRI is 20.3% smaller than that obtained from the MODIS retrieval. This difference in AOT is attributed mainly to the more absorbing aerosol model assumed for the SEVIRI retrieval compared to MODIS. The underlying cloud optical thickness (COT) derived from the two satellites is in good agreement (R = 0.90). The cloud droplet effective radius (CER) retrieved by SEVIRI is consistently smaller than MODIS by 2.2 mu m, which is mainly caused by the use of different spectral bands of the satellite instruments. In the second part of our analysis, we compare the forecast water vapour profiles used for the SEVIRI atmospheric correction as well as the aforementioned aerosol and cloud products with in situ measurements made from the Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurements (FAAM) aircraft platform during the CLARIFY-2017 campaign. Around Ascension Island, the column water vapour used to correct the SEVIRI signal is overestimated by 3.1mm in the forecast compared to that measured by dropsondes. However, the evidence suggests that the accuracy of the atmospheric correction improves closer to the African coast. Consistency is observed between the SEVIRI above-cloud AOT and in situ measurements (from cavity ring-down spectroscopy instruments) when the measured single-scattering albedo is close to that assumed in the retrieval algorithm. On the other hand, the satellite retrieval overestimates the AOT when the assumed aerosol model is not absorbing enough. Consistency is also found between the cloud properties retrieved by SEVIRI and the CER measured by a cloud droplet probe and the liquid water path derived from a microwave radiometer. Despite the instrumental limitations of the geostationary satellite, the consistency obtained between SEVIRI, MODIS and the aircraft measurements demonstrates the ability of the retrieval in providing additional information on the temporal evolution of the aerosol properties above clouds.

TI  - Impacts of climate extremes on ecosystem metrics in southwest China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to global warming, climate extremes are increasing significantly, which is greatly impacting ecosystems dynamics. Identified as a key ecological area, southwest China (SWC) has experienced frequent extreme climatic events. Using daily meteorological data and Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data, we analyzed the spatiotemporal variations of 21 extreme climate indices (ECIs) and 3 ecosystem metrics, namely, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), leaf area index (LAI), and gross primary production (GPP), as well as the responses of these metrics to ECIs during 2000-2018. Our results showed that the regionally averaged NDVI, LAI, and GPP increased significantly in this period with annual rates of 0.003, 0.04 m(2) m(-2), and 10.58 g C m(-2), respectively (P < 0.001). Cold-related ECIs and consecutive wet days decreased, while warm-related ECIs, heavy precipitation days, and extreme precipitation intensity displayed the opposite trend. The sums (22.48%, 12.98%, and 32.70%, respectively) of the relative contribution proportions of the sensitive temperature-related ECIs (T-ECIs) to NDVI, LAI, and GPP were higher than that those (14.60%, 12.75%, and 16.37%, respectively) of the sensitive precipitation-related ECIs (P-ECIs). Ecosystem metrics were significantly correlated with most ECIs with time lags of 2-3-month. The correlation coefficients between large-scale atmospheric circulation indices and T-ECIs were significant (P < 0.05). The Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation had a greater influence on T-ECIs than any other large-scale climatic oscillations. Our study indicated that T-ECIs had a greater impact on ecosystems than P-ECIs in SWC and that more attention should be paid to increasingly heavy precipitation and extreme high temperatures in the region.

TI  - Human impact on river planform within the context of multi-timescale river channel dynamics in a Himalayan river system
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rivers are dynamic landscape features which are often altered by human activity, making it difficult to disentangle human impact on geomorphic change from natural river dynamics. This study evaluated the human impact on river planform change within the context of short-and long-term river channel dynamics in the Himalayan Sutlej and Beas Rivers, by (i) systematically assessing river planform change over centennial, annual, seasonal and episodic timescales; (ii) connecting observed changes to human-environment drivers; and (iii) conceptualising these geomorphic changes in terms of timescale-dependent evolutionary trajectories (press, ramp, pulse). Landsat imagery was used to extract components of the post-monsoon active river channel (1989-2018), using the modified Normalized Differences Water Index to identify the wet river area, and visible red to determine active gravel bars. Findings were compared with a historical map to represent the pre-dam period (1847-1850) and with data on potential driving factors of change (discharge, climate and land cover). River planform characteristics changed significantly over all timescales, exhibiting strong spatiotemporal variation between and within both rivers. Dam construction likely caused channel narrowing and straightening at the centennial scale (press trajectory). In the Sutlej, this process has continued over the last 30 years, likely enforced by the cumulative effect of water abstraction and climatic changes (ramp trajectory). In the Beas, the pattern of change in river planform metrics was less pronounced over the same period and more variable along the length of the river, possibly linked to different dam operations that maintain a higher degree of flow variability and peak flows (press trajectory). High local erosion rates caused by aggregate mining (episodic) in the Sutlej were also observed (pulse trajectory). Expressed as evolutionary trajectories, the observed responses to human activity confirm the importance of legacy effects of human impact on river systems, and stress the dependency on spatial and temporal scales to determine trajectories of change. The multi-timescale assessment and conceptualisation provide insights into different dimensions of human impact on river planform change, which is pivotal to developing holistic management strategies.(c) 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Assessment of Land Cover Dynamics, Land Surface Temperature, and Heat Island Growth in Northwestern Bangladesh Using Satellite Imagery
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESSES-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The study examined the spatiotemporal variability of land use/land cover changes (LULC), land surface temperature (LST), and heat island (HI) in northwestern Bangladesh. Landsat images were used for evaluating LULC, LST, and HI for the years 1990, 2002, 2014, and 2018. Unsupervised and index-based classification approaches were used for mapping LULC. The mono-window algorithm was employed to identify the spatiotemporal variability of LST and HI. The analysis suggested that water bodies, forests, and bare land dwindled during these 28 years with an average of about 40%, 70%, and 45%, respectively. Agricultural land had been expanded from 1990 to 2002 and gradually stabilized in recent decades. Settlement areas increased alarmingly from 1990 to 2018. The water bodies, forests and bare lands were reduced due to the widening of agricultural land and rapid growth of urban area. The extents of the HI were found to be spreading out and became most extensive in 2018. LST had risen by around 5.5 degrees C from 1990 to 2018. The lower temperature zones prevailed in the water bodies, forests and agricultural lands whereas higher temperature zones were visible in the river sand bars and highly urbanized areas. The method used in this study is very successful in sparse built-up areas. The outputs of the study will be a great input in the city masterplan for landscape optimization and urban ecological balance in the study area and provide baseline information for future researches looking for inspecting the impacts of LULC change on a regional scale in plainland regions.

M3  - Article
AB  - Multifractals have proven to be a valuable tool in image analysis applications and remote sensing (RS). They can be used for image segmentation, texture analysis, and classification. This study explores their applicability to change detection. We present a new approach to image texture description based on the calculation of a spatialized Holder exponent on multispectral satellite data. Holder exponents are evaluated in the context of an unsupervised change detection algorithm, and the classification of change in various land cover classes. Obtained results show that the sensitivity of proposed methods varies from 69% up to 93% with a considerably low level of false alarms.

TI  - Calibration of FEST-EWB hydrological model using remote sensing data in a climate transition region in Brazil
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The association of hydrological models with remote sensing data allows the estimation of parameters that cannot be easily measured in situ, especially in regions with poor monitoring networks. In this paper, a distributed hydrological energy water balance model (FEST-EWB) was calibrated and validated in a basin located in a climate transition zone between a semi-arid region and the humid Atlantic Forest, in Brazil. Land surface temperature (LST) data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were used to calibrate the model, that solves the system of energy and mass balance equations as a function of the representative equilibrium temperature. For validation, soil moisture and LST data collected in situ were used. The model presented good performance for the simulation of the variables studied in the basin, even with reduced availability of MODIS data due to cloud coverage, allowing the use of FEST-EWB in areas with these characteristics, which are common in many regions of the world.

TI  - Liberal Socialism in Russia: Genealogy of the Idea (Herzen and Mikhailovsky)
T2  - BYLYE GODY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, V.V. Blokhin analyzes the worldview of Alexander Herzen and Nikolai Mikhailovsky, their projects for the social reconstruction of post-reform Russia in the second half of the 19th century. Scientific interest in the theorists of populism is caused by the similarity of their socio-political concepts, which are based on the ideas of liberal socialism. In modern Russian historiography, interest in the typology of trends in democratic thought is growing from year to year. In modern Russian historiography, interest in the typology of trends in democratic thought is growing from year to year. Modern researchers give priority attention to reformatory socialism, in which the right and left, conservative trends are distinguished.The author believes that Herzen and Mikhailovsky expressed an unorthodox liberal-socialist trend in populism. Based on scientific journalism and memoirs, the author compares the socio-political views of Herzen and Mikhailovsky. The common foundations for theorists of liberal socialism are personalism, the idea of personality as the goal and meaning of progress. If Herzen formulated his doctrine of personality, relying on the philosophy of Hegel and the teachings of Saint-Simon, then Mikhailovsky - on the ideas of Proudhon. The philosophy of the Enlightenment with faith in man and a rational social structure became the theoretical prerequisite for the social theory of the populists.Being people of a critical and free mind, both Herzen and Mikhailovsky viewed progress as a contradictory and unfinished process of gradual changes in society. They were decisive opponents of violence in history, believing that the state as a historical institution had not yet outlived its usefulness, and therefore believed in the reform potential of the autocratic power. The reformism of Herzen and Mikhailovsky was based both on the conservatism of the peasantry, who did not want to follow the revolutionaries, and on the unpreparedness of young people for revolutionary activity, their ignorance of the people. The idea of the intrinsic value of an individual and his freedom, of the priority of social reform over the revolution, of the struggle for political freedoms are the constituent components of liberal socialism, to which both Herzen and Mikhailovsky belonged.

TI  - Behind the scenes of streamflow model performance
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Streamflow is often the only variable used to evaluate hydrological models. In a previous international comparison study, eight research groups followed an identical protocol to calibrate 12 hydrological models using observed streamflow of catchments within the Meuse basin. In the current study, we quantify the differences in five states and fluxes of these 12 process-based models with similar streamflow performance, in a systematic and comprehensive way. Next, we assess model behavior plausibility by ranking the models for a set of criteria using streamflow and remote-sensing data of evaporation, snow cover, soil moisture and total storage anomalies. We found substantial dissimilarities between models for annual interception and seasonal evaporation rates, the annual number of days with water stored as snow, the mean annual maximum snow storage and the size of the root-zone storage capacity. These differences in internal process representation imply that these models cannot all simultaneously be close to reality. Modeled annual evaporation rates are consistent with Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) estimates. However, there is a large uncertainty in modeled and remote-sensing annual interception. Substantial differences are also found between Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and modeled number of days with snow storage. Models with relatively small root-zone storage capacities and without root water uptake reduction under dry conditions tend to have an empty root-zone storage for several days each summer, while this is not suggested by remote-sensing data of evaporation, soil moisture and vegetation indices. On the other hand, models with relatively large root-zone storage capacities tend to overestimate very dry total storage anomalies of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE). None of the models is systematically consistent with the information available from all different (remote-sensing) data sources. Yet we did not reject models given the uncertainties in these data sources and their changing relevance for the system under investigation.

TI  - Annual 30m dataset for glacial lakes in High Mountain Asia from 2008 to 2017
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Atmospheric warming is intensifying glacier melting and glacial-lake development in High Mountain Asia (HMA), and this could increase glacial-lake outburst flood (GLOF) hazards and impact water resources and hydroelectric-power management. There is therefore a pressing need to obtain comprehensive knowledge of the distribution and area of glacial lakes and also to quantify the variability in their sizes and types at high resolution in HMA. In this work, we developed an HMA glacial-lake inventory (Hi-MAG) database to characterize the annual coverage of glacial lakes from 2008 to 2017 at 30m resolution using Landsat satellite imagery. Our data show that glacial lakes exhibited a total area increase of 90.14 km(2) in the period 2008-2017, a +/-:90% change relative to 2008 (1305.59 +/- 213.99 km(2)). The annual increases in the number and area of lakes were 306 and 12 km(2), respectively, and the greatest increase in the number of lakes occurred at 5400m elevation, which increased by 249. Proglacial-lake-dominated areas, such as the Nyainqentanglha and central Himalaya, where more than half of the glacial-lake area (summed over a 1 degrees x 1 degrees grid) consisted of proglacial lakes, showed obvious lake-area expansion. Conversely, some regions of eastern Tibetan mountains and Hengduan Shan, where unconnected glacial lakes occupied over half of the total lake area in each grid, exhibited stability or a slight reduction in lake area. Our results demonstrate that proglacial lakes are a main contributor to recent lake evolution in HMA, accounting for 62.87% (56.67 km(2)) of the total area increase. Proglacial lakes in the Himalaya ranges alone accounted for 36.27% (32.70 km(2)) of the total area increase. Regional geographic variability in debris cover, together with trends in warming and precipitation over the past few decades, largely explains the current distribution of supraglacial- and proglacial-lake area across HMA. The Hi-MAG database is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4275164 (Chen et al., 2020), and it can be used for studies of the complex interactions between glaciers, climate and glacial lakes, studies of GLOFs, and water resources.

TI  - Time series analysis of the enhanced vegetation index to detect coffee crop development under different irrigation systems
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The coffee crop spectral behavior identification throughout its cycle can contribute to its development monitoring under pest incidence. We aim to identify coffee development through time signatures of enhanced vegetation index (EVI), as well as to evaluate the use of seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) models to identify coffee trees spectrum-time patterns under different irrigation management and design future scenarios. Three coffee fields were selected under different irrigation systems, whose EVI data of 8 years were obtained from the moderate resolution image spectroradiometer sensor. Each coffee crop model was subjected to residual autocorrelation test and classified according to information criteria, while its accuracy was assessed by means of prediction error measures and agreement index. The estimated and observed EVI values were similar, even for the predicted year. However, in agricultural years during which coffee diseases occurred, the crops showed vegetative vigor below the expected. We concluded that SARIMA models enabled the establishment of a reliable spectral signature expected for coffee crop, which could help with crop management defining, regardless of the irrigation system adopted. Based on the evaluation of divergence between expected and observed spectral signatures, early signs of coffee underdevelopment were detected, which could reduce economic loss risks on its commercial chain.

TI  - A Channel Phase Error Estimation Method for Multichannel TOPS and Multichannel Sliding Spotlight SAR Imaging
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In an azimuth multichannel synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system operating in sliding spotlight mode or Terrain Observation by Progressive Scans (TOPS) mode, due to the varying Doppler centroid and the greater processed Doppler bandwidth, the conventional channel phase error estimation algorithms that tailored to stripmap mode will fail and unable to be directly employed. To address these issues, a deramping-based method is proposed in this letter, which extends the conventional methods to sliding spotlight and TOPS cases. By multiplying the signals of each channel with the corresponding deramp phase, the problem of varying Doppler centroid is solved, and its resulting greater Doppler bandwidth is reduced. Therefore, the spectral properties of the signals are the same as those in the stripmap case, and the conventional channel phase error estimation methods can be applied subsequently. Estimation and imaging results of the simulation data and the real data of GaoFen-3 (GF-3) operating in dual-channel sliding spotlight mode demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI  - Measurements meet human observations: integrating distinctive ways of knowing in the Pamir Mountains of Tajikistan to assess local climate change
T2  - CLIMATIC CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - In mountain environments dimensions of climate change are unclear because of limited availability of meteorological stations. However, there is a necessity to assess the scope of local climate change, as the livelihood and food systems of subsistence-based communities are already getting impacted. To provide more clarity about local climate trends in the Pamir Mountains of Tajikistan, this study integrates measured climate data with community observations in the villages of Savnob and Roshorv. Taking a transdisciplinary approach, both knowledge systems were considered as equally pertinent and mutually informed the research process. Statistical trends of temperature and snow cover were retrieved using downscaled ERA5 temperature data and the snow cover product MOD10A1. Local knowledge was gathered through community workshops and structured interviews and analysed using a consensus index. Results showed, that local communities perceived increasing temperatures in autumn and winter and decreasing amounts of snow and rain. Instrumental data records indicated an increase in summer temperatures and a shortening of the snow season in Savnob. As both knowledge systems entail their own strengths and limitations, an integrative assessment can broaden the understanding of local climate trends by (i) reducing existing uncertainties, (ii) providing new information, and (iii) introducing unforeseen perspectives. The presented study represents a time-efficient and global applicable approach for assessing local dimensions of climate change in data-deficient regions.

TI  - Investigation of dynamic lake changes in Zhuonai Lake-Salt Lake Basin, Hoh Xil, using remote sensing images in response to climate change (1989-2018)
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The area covered by the four lakes in the Zhuonai Lake-Salt Lake Basin in Hoh Xil (Zhuonai Lake, Kusai Lake, Heidinor Lake, and Salt Lake) has changed significantly over the past 30 years. In this study, remote sensing image data gathered via the Landsat thematic mapper, enhanced thematic mapper plus, and operational land imager from 1989 to 2018 were used to extract the areal parameters of four lakes. The total area of the four lakes had increased by 18% in the past 30 years due to climate change. Interpolated results based on the meteorological data from 28 meteorological stations in the basin were used for trend analysis. A single-layer lake evaporation model was utilized to study the changes in the annual lake evaporation in the basin. The annual lake evaporation slightly increased from 1989 to 1995, followed by a sharp decrease from 1995 to 2018. From 1989 to 2018, the annual evaporation in the basin ranged between 615.37 and 921.66 mm, with a mean of 769.73 mm. A mass balance model was developed to estimate the changes in the lake volumes due to precipitation and evaporation. The increase in precipitation and the decrease in the annual lake evaporation promote the expansion of the four lakes. Lake evaporation is the main factor inducing changes in the lake areas.IS

TI  - Robotic Proximal Gastrectomy with Double-Tract Reconstruction for Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF GASTROINTESTINAL SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - The current standard surgical procedure for proximal gastric and gastroesophageal junction (P/GEJ) cancers with limited esophageal involvement is total gastrectomy (TG). TG is associated with impaired appetite and weight loss due to decreased levels of ghrelin (a "hunger hormone" secreted by the stomach) and with anemia due to intrinsic factor loss and vitamin B12 malabsorption. Theoretically, proximal gastrectomy (PG) with an anti-reflux technique such as double-tract reconstruction (DTR) can improve quality of life (QoL) by preserving gastric function.1 A recent Japanese prospective GEJ adenocarcinoma study reported a low incidence of lymph node metastases at peripyloric stations,2 indicating the oncological safety of PG for GEJ adenocarcinoma regardless of tumor stage. As a result, PG is increasingly performed in South Korea and Japan, although the QoL benefit of PG over TG remains unknown.3, 4 We have performed PG with DTR in select cases with satisfying short-term outcomes. In this video, we introduce our technique for robotic PG with DTR. The presented case is a 75-year-old woman with GEJ adenocarcinoma that showed an excellent response to preoperative chemoradiation therapy. The patient underwent robotic PG with DTR. Fluorescent sentinel lymphatic mapping was performed by injecting indocyanine green solution (total of 2 ml, at four quadrants around the tumor at submucosal space) via endoscopy at the beginning of the operation. It showed absence of sentinel lymphatic flow to peripyloric lymph nodes, which were thus considered safe to preserve. Pathologic examination confirmed a complete response. The patient's recovery was favorable, and she reported satisfaction with her QoL and good appetite, though some intermittent bloating after eating. PG with DTR has theoretical disadvantages including incomplete lymph node removal, which may result in recurrence; therefore, PG should be carefully performed for P/GEJ cancers with low risk of perigastric lymph node metastases, such as cT1 tumors or GEJ tumors with limited gastric involvement.2 In addition, delayed gastric emptying of the remnant stomach can cause upper gastrointestinal symptoms such as reflux and bloating. The QoL benefits of PG with DTR must be demonstrated before encouraging its use in the USA and other countries. International collaboration is warranted to test the benefits and safety of PG, and the effective use of sentinel lymphatic mapping, to standardize the surgical care of patients with P/GEJ cancers.

TI  - Two decades of aerosol observations by AATSR, MISR, MODIS and MERRA-2 over India and Indian Ocean
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric aerosols play key roles in radiation budget, ecosystem dynamics, air quality and cloud microphysics of a region and thus, they greatly influence the global climate, ecosystem and public health. We present the temporal variability of atmospheric aerosols over India and north Indian Ocean (NIO) for the past two decades (2000?2019). Here, the measurements from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Terra, Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) on Terra, and Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) measurements from Envisat, and Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2) reanalysis data are considered. On average, the Indo Gangetic Plain (IGP) shows the largest (0.5?1.2), and NIO and Himalaya show the smallest (0.1 or smaller) Aerosol Optical depth (AOD) values. The peak AOD loading is observed in June?July-August, and IGP has a secondary peak in March owing to the stubble and biomass burning in winter months. In contrast, the peak aerosol loading in the northeast is in winter due to forest and biomass burning during the period there. The inter-annual variability is very small in NIO, Himalaya and Bay of Bengal. The trends estimated from the combined (AATSR, MISR, MODIS and MERRA-2) data show the highest positive trends at the lower IGP and east central regions, about 0.8?1.2/dec, and are statistically significant. This is consistent with the urban activity, industries and dense population there. However, the Desert, northern Himalaya and northern Arabian Sea show insignificant negative trends, from-0.2 to-0.4/dec, as the anthropogenic sources of aerosols are very limited there. The bias estimate shows that most satellite and reanalysis data are in very good agreement at all regions (within 0.1?0.2). Even though the bias in the measurements are considered, the trends estimated are still large enough to be statistically significant. The analyses, therefore, caution the increasing aerosol loading and their plausible climate feedback in these regions. The assessment also demonstrate the potential of synergetic use of multiple-platform measurements for climate system studies.

TI  - ECOSTRESS estimates gross primary production with fine spatial resolution for different times of day from the International Space Station
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of gross primary production (GPP), the amount of carbon absorbed by plants via photosynthesis, is of great importance for understanding ecosystem functions, carbon cycling, and climate-carbon feedbacks. Remote sensing has been widely used to quantify GPP at regional to global scales. However, polarorbiting satellites (e.g., Landsat, Sentinel, Terra, Aqua, Suomi NPP, JPSS, OCO-2) lack the capability to examine the diurnal cycles of GPP because they observe the Earth?s surface at the same time of day. The Ecosystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS), launched in June 2018, observes the land surface temperature (LST) at different times of day with high spatial resolution (70 m ? 70 m) from the International Space Station (ISS). Here, we made use of ECOSTRESS data to predict instantaneous GPP with high spatial resolution for different times of day using a data-driven approach based on machine learning. The predictive GPP model used instantaneous ECOSTRESS LST observations along with the daily enhanced vegetation index (EVI) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), land cover type from the National Land Cover Database (NCLD), and instantaneous meteorological data from the ERA5 reanalysis dataset. Our model estimated instantaneous GPP across 56 flux tower sites fairly well (R2 = 0.88, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) = 2.42 ?mol CO2 m- 2 s- 1). The instantaneous GPP estimates driven by ECOSTRESS LST captured the diurnal variations of tower GPP for different biomes. We then produced multiple high resolution ECOSTRESS GPP maps for the central and northern California. We found distinct changes in GPP at different times of day (e.g., higher in late morning, peak around noon, approaching zero at dusk), and clear differences in productivity across landscapes (e.g., savannas, croplands, grasslands, and forests) for different times of day. ECOSTRESS GPP also captured the seasonal variations in the diurnal cycling of photosynthesis. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using ECOSTRESS data for producing instantaneous GPP (i.e., GPP for the acquisition time of the ECOSTRESS data) for different times of day. The ECOSTRESS GPP can shed light on how plant photosynthesis and water use vary over the course of the diurnal cycle and inform agricultural management and future improvement of terrestrial biosphere/land surface models.

TI  - Association between residential greenness and glycosylated hemoglobin in pregnant women: Findings from the baseline data of Yuexiu birth cohort
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYGIENE AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Previous studies have indicated that residential greenness can affect human health, but limited studies have examined the association between residential greenness and glucose homeostasis during pregnancy. We aimed to investigate the associations of residential greenness with plasma glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Methods: We recruited a total of 587 pregnant women aged 20?45 years in Guangzhou, China. We extracted normalized difference vegetation index with different buffers (NDVI-250m, 500m and 1000m) from remote satellite data based on maternal residential addresses. We measured plasma glucose levels and HbA1c during 20?28 weeks? gestation, and GDM was diagnosed with a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test. We collected the information of relevant covariates by face-to-face interviews and questionnaires. We used generalized linear regression to examine the associations of residential greenness with quantitative and categorized outcomes. Results: In the final analyses, 123 (21.0%) of the pregnant women were diagnosed as GDM at 20?28 weeks gestation. With a 0.1 unit increase in NDVI-250m, the percent of HbA1c changed by -0.05% [95% confidence interval (CI): -0.08, -0.02]. The results of HbA1c were consistent when using different resolution of NDVI [NDVI-500m: 0.03, 95%CI: -0.05, -0.01; NDVI-1000m: 0.05, 95%CI: -0.08, -0.02]. We observed nonsignificant associations of glucose levels and the risk of GDM in relation to NDVI with different resolutions when adjusted for confounding. The results remained robust in sensitivity analyses. Conclusion: The present study in Guangzhou, China was the first to identify negative association of NDVI with HbA1c in pregnant women, but we did not observe its association with plasma glucose levels or the risk of GDM. The results support that building sufficient green infrastructure could be considered in urban design and planning to promote maternal health.

TI  - Remotely sensed birch forest resilience against climate change in the northern China forest-steppe ecotone
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessments of forest resilience to climate change are becoming increasingly urgent with more frequent drought events. In this study, we examined warming-induced variations in canopy greenness and water content in developing a robust approach to monitor forest resilience with the dense time series of the Landsat normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference infrared index (NDII). Remote sensing observations and field data from five sites in the northern China forest-steppe ecotone were selected for assessment. The results reveal that the NDVI and NDII were negatively correlated with the investigated mortality ratios (with R-2 values of 0.45 and 0.27, respectively), corresponding to the canopy greenness reduction and water loss, respectively, in the context of forest mortality. We further observed four patterns of birch forest resilience based on the NDVI-NDII coordinated variation trends identified from the Mann-Kendall (MK) test. Accordingly, arid timberline forests were found to exhibit greater resilience with more significant recovery of greenness and water content even after a canopy decline period of more than 10 years. Larger standard deviation (SD) values of the NDVI residual time series (all above 0.07) and a longer time lag of the NDII variations relative to those of the NDVI were observed, indicating that the greenness changes dominated the canopy dynamics observed in birch forest. Compared to traditional field surveys, remote sensing techniques focus on the continuous and quasi-synchronous monitoring of canopy dynamics, contributing to a more accurate detection and prediction of semiarid forest resilience on large scales.

TI  - Oscillations in deep-open-cells during winter Mediterranean cyclones
T2  - NPJ CLIMATE AND ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Open cloud cells can be described in ideal form as connected clouds that surround spots of isolated clear skies in their centers. This cloud pattern is typically associated with marine stratocumulus (MSc) that form in the oceanic boundary layer. However, it can form in deeper convective clouds as well. Here, we focus on deep-open-cells (with tops reaching up to similar to 5-7 km) that form in the post-frontal regions of winter Mediterranean cyclones, and examine their properties and evolution. Using a Lagrangian analysis of satellite data, we show that deep-open-cells have a larger equivalent diameter (similar to 58 +/- 18 km) and oscillate with a longer periodicity (similar to 3.5 +/- 1 h) compared to shallow MSc. A numerical simulation of one Cyprus low event reveals that precipitation-generated convergence and divergence dynamic patterns are the main driver of the open cells' organization and oscillations. Thus, our findings generalize the mechanism attributed to the behavior of shallow marine cells to deeper convective systems.

TI  - A novel technique for ship wake detection from optical images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring ships at sea is of great importance for both civilian and military purposes. Since ship wakes are more distinct than hulls, wakes are widely employed for ship detection from satellite imagery. In this paper, a novel approach was proposed to detect ships from optical imagery. Candidate wakes were first obtained by the normalized Radon transform of an image with the ship hull in the center. False wakes were then removed by pixel value verification, turbulent wake identification, included angle verification, and contrast verification. Meanwhile, bright edges of turbulent wakes were detected after turbulent wake identification. Detected wakes were verified with wakes delineated through visual inspection. By implementing the proposed technique to optical imagery, reflectance at the near-infrared (NIR) band of GF 1 and Sentinel 2 MSI and the panchromatic band of Landsat 8 OLI showed the best accuracies. Total recalls of turbulent and Kelvin wakes were 93.5% and 91.2%, respectively, while total precisions were 93.7% and 93.8%, respectively. Positions, directions, and endpoints of wakes were also obtained with good accuracy. The categories of wakes were confirmed by the wake features and the spatial relationships between wakes. Factors influencing the accuracy of the developed method and comparison with state-of-the-art wake detection methods were then discussed.

T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, the causes and damages of 2010 flood disaster were analyzed in districts Muzaffar Garh. The study area is one of the severely flood affected districts by floods in the past. A mix research approach is applied to analyse the 2010-flood generating factors and damages in the study area. Primary data were acquired through questionnaires, personal observations and Global Positioning System (GPS). Remote Sensing (RS) Landsat-7 ETM data were obtained from USGS online database for pre- and post-flooding periods to delineate the spatial extent of inundation and estimate different land covers classes with damages. Secondary data regarding Rainfall and river discharge were acquired from concerned Government Departments. Modified Normalized Difference in Water Index (MNDWI) was applied to extract inundation, and supervised image classification algorithm was utilized to classify land cover into different classes. The analysis indicates that the flood was generated by extreme rainfall event in the last week of July, 2010 in the upper catchment areas of River Indus. This generated ever highest discharge in the River Indus. As a consequence, this disastrous flow has breached the left marginal embankment (LME) near Taunsa barrage. Spatially, more than half of the land area was inundated. Moreover, the analysis showed that the inundation incurred total estimated economic loss of about 9.85 million US$. Out of total, the maximum damages of 4.45 million US$ were reported from agriculture sector followed by infrastructures 3.5 million US$. This study will provide an empirical basis for flood disaster management authorities to plan disaster response activity and mitigation strategies to reduce the risk of potential damages. The results can also assist decision makers to evaluate breaching points.

TI  - Automatic delineation of glacier grounding lines in differential interferometric synthetic-aperture radar data using deep learning
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Delineating the grounding line of marine-terminating glaciers-where ice starts to become afloat in ocean waters-is crucial for measuring and understanding ice sheet mass balance, glacier dynamics, and their contributions to sea level rise. This task has been previously done using time-consuming, mostly-manual digitizations of differential interferometric synthetic-aperture radar interferograms by human experts. This approach is no longer viable with a fast-growing set of satellite observations and the need to establish time series over entire continents with quantified uncertainties. We present a fully-convolutional neural network with parallel atrous convolutional layers and asymmetric encoder/decoder components that automatically delineates grounding lines at a large scale, efficiently, and accompanied by uncertainty estimates. Our procedure detects grounding lines within 232 m in 100-m posting interferograms, which is comparable to the performance achieved by human experts. We also find value in the machine learning approach in situations that even challenge human experts. We use this approach to map the tidal-induced variability in grounding line position around Antarctica in 22,935 interferograms from year 2018. Along the Getz Ice Shelf, in West Antarctica, we demonstrate that grounding zones are one order magnitude (13.3 +/- 3.9) wider than expected from hydrostatic equilibrium, which justifies the need to map grounding lines repeatedly and comprehensively to inform numerical models.

TI  - A deep neural network learning-based speckle noise removal technique for enhancing the quality of synthetic-aperture radar images
T2  - CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The speckle noise present in synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) images is responsible for hindering the extraction of the exact information that needs to be utilized for potential remote sensing applications. Thus the quality of SAR images needs to be enhanced by removing speckle noise in an effective manner. In this paper, A Deep Neural Network-based Speckle Noise Removal Technique (DNN-SNRT) is proposed that utilizes the benefits of convolution and Long Short Term Memory-based neural networks to enhance the quality of SAR images. The proposed DNN-SNRT uses multiple radar intensity images that are archived from the specific area of interest to facilitate the self-learning of the intensity features derived from the image patches. The proposed DNN-SNRT incorporates a dual neural network to remove speckle noise and flexibly estimates the thresholds and weights to achieve an effective SAR image quality improvement. The proposed DNN-SNRT is capable of automatically updating the intensity features of SAR images during the training process. Experimental investigation of the proposed DNN-SNRT conducted based on TerraSAR-X images confirmed the superior enhancement of image quality over comparable recent filters. The results of the DNN-SNRT scheme were also proved that it is able to reduce noise and preserve edges during the image quality enhancement process.

TI  - Daily Terra-Aqua MODIS cloud-free snow and Randolph Glacier Inventory 6.0 combined product (M*D10A1GL06) for high-mountain Asia between 2002 and 2019
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Snow is a dominant water resource in high-mountain Asia (HMA) and crucial for mountain communities and downstream populations. Snow cover monitoring is significant to understand regional climate change, managing meltwater, and associated hazards/disasters. The uncertainties in passive optical remote-sensing snow products, mainly underestimation caused by cloud cover and overestimation associated with sensors' limitations, hamper the understanding of snow dynamics. We reduced the biases in Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra and Aqua daily snow data and generated a combined daily snow product for high-mountain Asia between 2002 and 2019. An improved MODIS 8 d composite MOYDGL06* product was used as a training data for reducing the underestimation and overestimation of snow in daily products. The daily MODIS Terra and Aqua images were improved by implementing cloud removal algorithms followed by gap filling and reduction in overestimated snow beyond the respective 8 d composite snow extent of the MOYDGL06* product. The daily Terra and Aqua snow products were combined and merged with the Randolph Glacier Inventory version 6.0 (RGI 6.0) described as M*D10A1GL06 to make a more complete cryosphere product with 500m spatial resolution. The pixel values in the daily combined product are preserved and reversible to the individual Terra and Aqua improved products. We suggest a weight of 0.5 and 1 to snow pixels in either or both Terra and Aqua products, respectively, for deriving snow cover statistics from our final snow product. The values 200, 242, and 252 indicate snow pixels in both Terra and Aqua and have a weight of 1, whereas pixels with snow in one of the Terra or Aqua products have a weight of 0.5. On average, the M*D10A1GL06 product reduces 39.1% of uncertainty compared to the MOYDGL06* product. The uncertainties due to cloud cover (underestimation) and sensor limitations, mainly larger solar zenith angle (SZA) (overestimation) reduced in this product, are approximately 32.9% and 6.2 %, respectively. The data in this paper are mainly useful for observation and simulation of climate, hydro-glaciological forcings, calibration, validation, and other water-related studies. The data are available at https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.918198 (Muhammad, 2020) and the algorithm source code at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3862058 (Thapa, 2020).

TI  - Spatio-temporal distribution of chlorophyll-a concentration, sea surface temperature and wind speed using aqua-modis satellite imagery over the Savu Sea, Indonesia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The climatological means and annual variation of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration, sea surface temperature (SST) and sea surface wind (SSW) from 2002 to 2016 in the Savu Sea (SS) within Indonesia were analysed. Chl-a variability and SST information was used as a reference in determining potential fishing grounds. The research aimed to investigate the variability of Chl-a and SST along with the influencing factor of the Australian-Indonesian Monsoon (AIM) winds. The study was conducted in SS waters, in East Nusa Tenggara (NTT), Indonesia, using 15 years of monthly Aqua MODIS Level 3 data. The retrieved data were corrected geometrically and radiometrically and then analysed to produce mean climatology data. The results indicated that the spatial and temporal AIM winds had a significant influence on the Chl-a concentration and the SST in SS waters. There was a two-month delay in the peak concentration of Chl-a/SST; moreover, the AIM wind speed, which peaks in June, was not followed by either the SST minima or the Chl-a maxima, which occur in August. The level of Chl-a in the SS waters showed seasonal patterns, with the highest concentration occurring during the east season (June-August), the peak concentration being 0.52 mg m(-3), alongside a wind speed of 5.42 m s(-1) and an SST of 22.89 degrees C in August. Meanwhile, the lowest concentration of Chl-a 0.17 mg m(-3) occurred in February during the west season (December-February), with a wind speed of 2.10 m s(-1) and an SST of 29.57 degrees C. Three specific areas showed characteristics that differed from the general pattern of the monsoon winds' effects on Chl-a and SST in the SS. This study provides the latest description of Chl-a, SST and wind speed distribution at seasonal and spatial scales and their variability across the Savu Sea. The results of this study are essential for fishing catching activities and fisheries management in the region.

TI  - Family and Ideas of the Worldview of the Russian Local Nobility at the turn of the XIX - early XX centuries (on the Example of the Memoirs of S.E. Trubetskoy, A.A. Kornilov, V.V. Rozanov)
T2  - BYLYE GODY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is about actual new methodological approaches, various types of worldview of the local nobility are considered in the new socio-economic and political conditions. The main attention is paid to the subjects of the memoirs of S.Y. Trubetskoy, A.A. Kornilov, as well as the autobiographical notes of V.V. Rozanov, liberal periodical press. On the basis of new methodological approaches, the question of self-identification of the Russian local nobility is raised. The review of the current modern historiography on the problem is carried out. It defines the basic methodological approaches and methods: micro-historical approach, narrative modeling. The analysis of sources was carried out using comparative-historical, historical-typological and historical-biographical research methods. Several worldview types of the Russian local nobility of the XIX-XX centuries are revealed, their distinctive characteristics are given: "new local nobility" (A.A. Kornilov); "local bison" (S.E. Trubetskoy, A.A. Shcherbatov); "enterprising type" (Kubrin); "philosophical" (V.V. Rozanov). The proposed classification is determined by family traditions, the way of life and way of family life, the existing environment.

TI  - Does building development in Dhaka comply with land use zoning? An analysis using nighttime light and digital building heights
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Zoning is an important tool to regulate the use of land and to characterize built form over land, and thus to facilitate urban sustainability. Availability of reliable data is crucial for monitoring land use zoning, which contributes directly to the success of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in general, and SDG Goal 11 for sustainable cities and communities in particular. However, obtaining this valuable information using traditional survey methods is both costly and time-consuming. Remote sensing technology overcomes these challenges and supports urban policymaking and planning processes. This study unveils a novel approach to developing a cost-effective method for identifying building types using Sentinel-2A, Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS)-based nighttime light (NTL) data, and TanDEM-X-based Digital Surface Model (DSM) data. A newly developed index for this study, the Normalized Difference Steel Structure Index (NDSSI), is useful for rapidly mapping industrial buildings with steel structures. The implementation status of Dhaka's existing land use plan was evaluated by analyzing the spatial distribution of different types of building uses. This study classifies residential, commercial, and industrial buildings within Dhaka using building height, and nighttime light emission. The experimental results reveal that about 67% of commercial and 51% of industrial buildings within the Dhaka Metropolitan Area (DMA) do not comply with the land use zoning by the Detailed Area Plan (DAP). It also reveals that approximately 10% of commercial buildings, 9% of industrial buildings, and 6% of residential buildings have encroached upon conservation zones (such as open space, flood-prone zones, water bodies, and proposed areas for future road extension). A major constraint in the study was the low spatial resolution of the nighttime light dataset, which made it difficult to distinguish individual sources of light. Still, the methodological approaches proposed in this study are expected to promote reduced costs and efficacious decision-making in urban transformation and to help achieve SDG 11, especially in developing countries.

TI  - African burned area and fire carbon emissions are strongly impacted by small fires undetected by coarse resolution satellite data
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Fires are a major contributor to atmospheric budgets of greenhouse gases and aerosols, affect soils and vegetation properties, and are a key driver of land use change. Since the 1990s, global burned area (BA) estimates based on satellite observations have provided critical insights into patterns and trends of fire occurrence. However, these global BA products are based on coarse spatial-resolution sensors, which are unsuitable for detecting small fires that burn only a fraction of a satellite pixel. We estimated the relevance of those small fires by comparing a BA product generated from Sentinel -2 MSI (Multispectral Instrument) images (20-m spatial resolution) with a widely used global BA product based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images (500 m) focusing on subSaharan Africa. For the year 2016, we detected 80% more BA with Sentinel-2 images than with the MODIS product. This difference was predominately related to small fires: we observed that 2.02 Mkm(2) (out of a total of 4.89 Mkm(2)) was burned by fires smaller than 100 ha, whereas the MODIS product only detected 0.13 million km2 BA in that fire-size class. This increase in BA subsequently resulted in increased estimates of fire emissions; we computed 31 to 101% more fire carbon emissions than current estimates based on MODIS products. We conclude that small fires are a critical driver of BA in sub-Saharan Africa and that including those small fires in emission estimates raises the contribution of biomass burning to global burdens of (greenhouse) gases and aerosols.

TI  - Can We Avoid Axillary Lymph Node Dissection (ALND) in Patients with 1-2 Positive Sentinel/Low Axillary Lymph Nodes (SLN/LAS plus ) in the Indian Setting?
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The ACOSOG Z0011 study, heralded as a "practice changing" trial, suggested that women with T1-2 breast cancer with 1-2 SLN+, undergoing breast conservation therapy, need not be offered further ALND. However, whether these results are applicable to all women in the Indian setting, it remains debatable. A retrospective audit of all cN0 operated from 2013 to 2018 was conducted. We analyzed the percentage of additional LN positive (LN+) in the ALND group and compared it to the ACOZOG Z11 trial. Of the 2350 cN0 with EBC who underwent LAS, 687 (29%) had positive lymph nodes on final histopathology. Five hundred ninety-seven (86.9%) patients had 1-2 LN+, 40 (5.8%) patients had 3 LN+, and 50 (7.3%) had 4 or more nodes positive. Demographic features in the ACOSOG Z11 are different from those in our study, looking at ACOZOG Z11 versus our cohort-median pT 1.7 cm versus 3 cm, 45% micrometastasis versus 99.16% macrometastasis, and 28-30% grade 3 tumors versus 73.7%. In our cohort 31.82% of the 1-2 LN positive had additional LN+ on ALND. Keeping in mind the difference in clinicopathological features between our cohort and that of ACOZOG Z0011 and that 31.82% of women had additional LN+ on ALND, it may not be appropriate to apply the results of the ACOSOG Z0011 trial directly to our general population. Possibly, only a select subset of patients who match the trial population of the ACOSOG Z11 could be offered observation of the axilla and validated nomograms can be used to identify high-risk patients.

TI  - SAR-derived flow velocity and its link to glacier surface elevation change and mass balance
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Modern remote sensing techniques, such as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), can measure the direction and intensity of glacier flow. Yet the question remains as to what these measurements reveal about glaciers? adjustment to the warming climate. Here, we present a technique that addresses this question by linking the SARderived velocity measurements with the glacier elevation change and the specific mass balance (i.e. mass balance per unit area). The technique computes the speckle offset tracking results from the north, east and vertical flow displacement time series, with the vertical component further split into a Surface Parallel Flow (SPF) advection component due to the motion along a glacier surface slope and a non-Surface Parallel Flow (nSPF). The latter links the glacier surface elevation change with the specific mass balance and strain rates. We apply this technique to ascending and descending Sentinel-1 data to derive the four-dimensional flow displacement time series for glaciers in southeast Alaska during 2016-2019. Time series extracted for a few characteristic regions demonstrate remarkable temporal variability in flow velocities. The seasonal signal observed in the nSPF component is modeled using the Positive Degree Day model. This method can be used for computing either mass balance or glacier surface elevation change if one of these two parameters is known from external observations.

TI  - Special aspects of radiotherapy of nonmelanoma skin tumors
T2  - ONKOLOGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Radiotherapy is an integral part of local treatment in interdisciplinary concepts for the management of nonmelanoma skin tumors. Objectives The current role of radiotherapy modalities for the major types of nonmelanoma skin tumors is presented. Materials and methods Current publications as well as national and international guideline recommendations are summarized in the format of a narrative review. Results For basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, high local control rates are achieved with radiotherapy alone. Therefore, radiotherapy is a preferred alternative in case of inoperability due to tumor location or age. For Merkel cell carcinoma, postoperative radiotherapy of the primary tumor region is regularly used. The role of radiotherapy of the lymphatic drainage area as derived from the result of sentinel node biopsy is under intensive discussion. For mycosis fungoides, specific dose concepts are recommended for different patterns of involvement. Technical innovations permit the precise irradiation of very complex target volumes, e.g. whole scalp irradiation. Conclusions Modern radiotherapy makes an important contribution to the curative treatment of nonmelanoma skin tumors.

TI  - Spatial distribution and influencing factors on urban land surface temperature of twelve megacities in China from 2000 to 2017
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - China witnessed a rapid urbanization progress in the past 20 years. Urbanization can greatly influence urban environment, especially thermal environment. Causes for urban heat island (UHI) formation vary in different climatic regions. Understanding characteristics of spatial distribution of urban land surface temperature (ULST) and influencing factors of UHI formation is important for sustainable urban development. In this study, twelve megalopolises in China, each with a population over 5 million, were selected as research sites. Built-up areas and ULST of these megalopolises were extracted from remote sensing data of earth observation satellites of Landsat program for the three periods of 2000?2017. Spatial variation characteristics of ULST were analyzed. Influences of soil moisture, surface water availability, surface albedo, vegetation, energy consumption, gross domestic product, latitudes, precipitation, topography, and distance to the downtown on ULST were investigated through multivariate regression analysis. Results show that: all the cities expanded continuously from 2000 to 2017, but expansion rates varied significantly among the megalopolises. Urban expansion has significant effects on the spatial distribution of ULST. ULST changes more quickly when the expanded area and expansion rate are higher. Simultaneously, spatial distribution of ULST was found to relate to the shape of an urban boundary. Circularly expanding cities showed the most concentrated distribution of high-temperature regions. Correlation analysis revealed that surface water use, evapotranspiration, electric energy consumption, surface albedo, and vegetation activity were the primary influencing factors on ULST, while GDP, latitude, distance, and precipitation had no significant effects on ULST. Among the primary influencing factors, surface water was the main controlling factor on ULST in cities with more surface water distribution. Building area played a more important role in ULST in cities with less surface water distribution. In addition, vegetation area played a relatively more important role in ULST in semi-humid cities than humid cities.

TI  - Generation of Terawatt Attosecond Pulses from Relativistic Transition Radiation
T2  - PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - When a femtosecond duration and hundreds of kiloampere peak current electron beam traverses the vacuum and high-density plasma interface, a new process, that we call relativistic transition radiation (RTR), generates an intense similar to 100 as pulse containing similar to 1 terawatt power of coherent vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) radiation accompanied by several smaller femtosecond duration satellite pulses. This pulse inherits the radial polarization of the incident beam field and has a ring intensity distribution. This RTR is emitted when the beam density is comparable to the plasma density and the spot size much larger than the plasma skin depth. Physically, it arises from the return current or backward relativistic motion of electrons starting just inside the plasma that Doppler up shifts the emitted photons. The number of RTR pulses is determined by the number of groups of plasma electrons that originate at different depths within the first plasma wake period and emit coherently before phase mixing.

TI  - Global citizens, cosmopolitanism, and radical relationality: Towards dialogue with the Kyoto School?
T2  - EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY AND THEORY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent discussions around education for global citizenship continues to retrace notions of cosmopolitanism first laid out in Europe. Ostensibly seeking global inclusivity, much of this work ultimately returns to a rather narrow set of ontological and epistemic themes, primarily Stoicism and Pauline Christianity. The Kyoto School offers a constructive reconstruction of these core premises of European cosmopolitanism. In resisting the ontologizing of autonomous individualism and abstract universalism, Kyoto School thinkers offered an alternative tripartite structure that drew greater attention to the specific (nation-state): individual and universal are inevitably mediated by the 'logic' of specific histories, languages, institutions, and communities. Rather than naive nationalism, this view emerged within a radically relational worldview: 'continuity-in-discontinuity' emplaced within absolute nothingness. Kimura Motomori, a leading Kyoto School educational thinker, explicitly extended these Nishidian ideas to challenge Rousseau's contracting individualism, Kantian abstract universalism, and Hegelian teleological temporality, thus offering a fresh vision of cosmopolitanism: self-aware citizens engaging concretely in the task of (re)opening their specific societies. In conclusion, in part to demonstrate the very forms of critique we envisage, we trace historically the impacts of Kyoto School cosmopolitanism ideas on postwar policy in Japan and lament the recent regressive closing.

TI  - Narcissism and Motives to Pursue Status Through the Use of Dominance-Based Strategies, Prestige-Based Strategies, and Leadership-Based Strategies
T2  - EVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The present research examined the associations that narcissistic personality features had with motives to pursue status through the use of dominance-based strategies, prestige-based strategies, and leadership-based strategies as well as whether these associations were mediated by either dangerous or competitive social worldviews. Across three studies (N = 2082), the assertive/extraverted and antagonistic/disagreeable aspects of narcissism had indirect associations with the motive to use dominance-based strategies through the competitive social worldview. However, the results for the antagonistic/disagreeable aspect of narcissism were more robust than those for the assertive/extraverted aspect of narcissism which were weakened when other aspects of narcissism were included in the same analysis. In contrast, the assertive/extraverted, vulnerable/neurotic, and communal aspects of narcissism were positively associated with the motive to pursue status through the use of prestige-based strategies but social worldviews did not consistently mediate these associations. These results suggest that these aspects of narcissism have divergent associations with motives to pursue status through the use of particular strategies and that the competitive social worldview may play a role in some-but not all-of these associations.

TI  - Multi-Temporal Change Detection Analysis of Vertical Sprawl over Limassol City Centre and Amathus Archaeological Site in Cyprus during 2015-2020 Using the Sentinel-1 Sensor and the Google Earth Engine Platform
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban sprawl can negatively impact the archaeological record of an area. In order to study the urbanisation process and its patterns, satellite images were used in the past to identify land-use changes and detect individual buildings and constructions. However, this approach involves the acquisition of high-resolution satellite images, the cost of which is increases according to the size of the area under study, as well as the time interval of the analysis. In this paper, we implemented a quick, automatic and low-cost exploration of large areas, for addressing this purpose, aiming to provide at a medium resolution of an overview of the landscape changes. This study focuses on using radar Sentinel-1 images to monitor and detect multi-temporal changes during the period 2015-2020 in Limassol, Cyprus. In addition, the big data cloud platform, Google Earth Engine, was used to process the data. Three different change detection methods were implemented in this platform as follow: (a) vertical transmit, vertical receive (VV) and vertical transmit, horizontal receive (VH) polarisations pseudo-colour composites; (b) the Rapid and Easy Change Detection in Radar Time-Series by Variation Coefficient (REACTIV) Google Earth Engine algorithm; and (c) a multi-temporal Wishart-based change detection algorithm. The overall findings are presented for the wider area of the Limassol city, with special focus on the archaeological site of "Amathus" and the city centre of Limassol. For validation purposes, satellite images from the multi-temporal archive from the Google Earth platform were used. The methods mentioned above were able to capture the urbanization process of the city that has been initiated during this period due to recent large construction projects.

TI  - Detection of urban spot in the plain of Mina (Western Algeria)
T2  - Biodiversity Journal
M3  - Article
AB  - During the last three decades, the plains of the Oued Cheliff watershed, have been affected by the decisions of the State which tried to change its development policy. This has put these plains in a state of transformation, whose rate of population has increased by causing greater worries such as consumption, employment, and housing needs. The latter has affected this environmental space and its agro systems by reducing the area of its most fertile lands and the pollution of the places that use its natural resources. In order to do our studies, we have chosen the Mina plain, which is part of a space that is in full change with regard to its physical environment, its demographic and economic aspect while acting on its agro systems. This study will develop a methodology, based on the integration of satellite images and cartographic data into a geographical information system (SIG) for the identification and mapping of urban extensions on agricultural land in the Mina Plain.

TI  - Composite Aerosol Optical Depth Mapping over Northeast Asia from GEO-LEO Satellite Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to generate a near real time composite of aerosol optical depth (AOD) to improve predictive model ability and provide current conditions of aerosol spatial distribution and transportation across Northeast Asia. AOD, a proxy for aerosol loading, is estimated remotely by various spaceborne imaging sensors capturing visible and infrared spectra. Nevertheless, differences in satellite-based retrieval algorithms, spatiotemporal resolution, sampling, radiometric calibration, and cloud-screening procedures create significant variability among AOD products. Satellite products, however, can be complementary in terms of their accuracy and spatiotemporal comprehensiveness. Thus, composite AOD products were derived for Northeast Asia based on data from four sensors: Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI), Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), Moderate Infrared Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). Cumulative distribution functions were employed to estimate error statistics using measurements from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET). In order to apply the AERONET point-specific error, coefficients of each satellite were calculated using inverse distance weighting. Finally, the root mean square error (RMSE) for each satellite AOD product was calculated based on the inverse composite weighting (ICW). Hourly AOD composites were generated (00:00-09:00 UTC, 2017) using the regression equation derived from the comparison of the composite AOD error statistics to AERONET measurements, and the results showed that the correlation coefficient and RMSE values of composite were close to those of the low earth orbit satellite products (MODIS and VIIRS). The methodology and the resulting dataset derived here are relevant for the demonstrated successful merging of multi-sensor retrievals to produce long-term satellite-based climate data records.

TI  - Analysis of Surface Water Extraction and Change Detection Over Barur Lake, India
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF PURE & APPLIED PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Water is one of the most essential and devastating element in the world. The lack of access to water and its abundance can be a serious threat to human life. These two circumstances may create a difficult situation against the sustainability of human life. Inadequate access to water causes drought, affects agriculture and on other side high level water availability in urban areas affects daily life. Hence, mapping and analysing of the surface water of the earth benefits from such impacts. Therefore, this study analysis evaluates the performance of available Landsat-8 OLI images for mapping water bodies and to obtaining precise Normalized Differential Water Index (NDWI) extraction. Change detection analysis of the obtained data shows that the area of the surface water body keeps on changing every year. The surface area of the lake has undergone a drastic change in the year 2019.

TI  - SEVIRI Aerosol Optical Depth Validation Using AERONET and Intercomparison with MODIS in Central and Eastern Europe
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the validation results of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) retrieved from the Spinning Enhanced Visible Infrared Radiometer (SEVIRI) data using the near-real-time algorithm further developed in the frame of the Satellite-based Monitoring Initiative for Regional Air quality (SAMIRA) project. The SEVIRI AOD was compared against multiple data sources: six stations of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) in Romania and Poland, three stations of the Aerosol Research Network in Poland (Poland-AOD) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data overlapping Romania, Czech Republic and Poland. The correlation values between a four-month dataset (June-September 2014) from SEVIRI and the closest temporally available data for both ground-based and satellite products were identified. The comparison of the SEVIRI AOD with the AERONET AOD observations generally shows a good correlation (r = 0.48-0.83). The mean bias is 0.10-0.14 and the root mean square error RMSE is between 0.11 and 0.15 for all six stations cases. For the comparison with Poland-AOD correlation values are 0.55 to 0.71. The mean bias is 0.04-0.13 and RMSE is between 0.10 and 0.14. As for the intercomparison to MODIS AOD, correlations values were generally lower (r = 0.33-0.39). Biases of -0.06 to 0.24 and RMSE of 0.04 to 0.28 were in good agreement with the ground-stations retrievals. The validation of SEVIRI AOD with AERONET results in the best correlations followed by the Poland-AOD network and MODIS retrievals. The average uncertainty estimates are evaluated resulting in most of the AOD values falling above the expected error range. A revised uncertainty estimate is proposed by including the observed bias form the AERONET validation efforts.

TI  - Application of Drone and WorldView-4 Satellite Data in Mapping and Monitoring Grazing Land Cover and Pasture Quality: Pre- and Post-Flooding
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Frequent flooding worldwide, especially in grazing environments, requires mapping and monitoring grazing land cover and pasture quality to support land management. Although drones, satellite, and machine learning technologies can be used to map land cover and pasture quality, there have been limited applications in grazing land environments, especially monitoring land cover change and pasture quality pre- and post-flood events. The use of high spatial resolution drone and satellite data such as WorldView-4 can provide effective mapping and monitoring in grazing land environments. The aim of this study was to utilize high spatial resolution drone and WorldView-4 satellite data to map and monitor grazing land cover change and pasture quality pre-and post-flooding. The grazing land cover was mapped pre-flooding using WorldView-4 satellite data and post-flooding using real-time drone data. The machine learning Random Forest classification algorithm was used to delineate land cover types and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was used to monitor pasture quality. This study found a seven percent (7%) increase in pasture cover and a one hundred percent (100%) increase in pasture quality post-flooding. The drone and WorldView-4 satellite data were useful to detect grazing land cover change at a finer scale.

TI  - Integrating GIS-Based MCDA Techniques and the SCS-CN Method for Identifying Potential Zones for Rainwater Harvesting in a Semi-Arid Area
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - An increasing scarcity of water, as well as rapid global climate change, requires more effective water conservation alternatives. One promising alternative is rainwater harvesting (RWH). Nevertheless, the evaluation of RWH potential together with the selection of appropriate sites for RWH structures is significantly difficult for the water managers. This study deals with this difficulty by identifying RWH potential areas and sites for RWH structures utilizing geospatial and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) techniques. The conventional data and remote sensing data were employed to set up needed thematic layers using ArcGIS software. The soil conservation service curve number (SCS-CN) method was used to determine surface runoff, centered on which yearly runoff potential map was produced in the ArcGIS environment. Thematic layers such as drainage density, slope, land use/cover, and runoff were allotted appropriate weights to produced RWH potential areas and zones appropriate for RWH structures maps of the study location. Results analysis revealed that the outcomes of the spatial allocation of yearly surface runoff depth ranging from 83 to 295 mm. Moreover, RWH potential areas results showed that the study areas can be categorized into three RWH potential areas: (a) low suitability, (b) medium suitability, and (c) high suitability. Nearly 40% of the watershed zone falls within medium and high suitability RWH potential areas. It is deduced that the integrated MCDA and geospatial techniques provide a valuable and formidable resource for the strategizing of RWH within the study zones.

TI  - Satellite-Based Meteorological and Agricultural Drought Monitoring for Agricultural Sustainability in Sri Lanka
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - For Sri Lanka, as an agricultural country, a methodical drought monitoring mechanism, including spatial and temporal variations, may significantly contribute to its agricultural sustainability. Investigating long-term meteorological and agricultural drought occurrences in Sri Lanka and assessing drought hazard at the district level are the main objectives of the study. Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Rainfall Anomaly Index (RAI), and Vegetation Health Index (VHI) were used as drought indicators to investigate the spatial and temporal distribution of agriculture and meteorological droughts. Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) data from 1989 to 2019 was used to calculate SPI and RAI. MOD13A1 and MOD11A2 data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) from 2001 to 2019, were used to generate the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) and Temperature Condition Index (TCI). Agricultural drought monitoring was done using VHI and generated using the spatial integration of VCI and TCI. Thus, various spatial data analysis techniques were extensively employed for vector and raster data integration and analysis. A methodology has been developed for the drought declaration of the country using the VHI-derived drought area percentage. Accordingly, for a particular year, if the country-wide annual extreme and severe drought area percentage based on VHI drought classes is >= 30%, it can be declared as a drought year. Moreover, administrative districts of Sri Lanka were classified into four hazard classes, No drought, Low drought, Moderate drought, and High drought, using the natural-beak classification scheme for both agricultural and meteorological droughts. The findings of this study can be used effectively by the relevant decision-makers for drought risk management (DRM), resilience, sustainable agriculture, and policymaking.

TI  - An Improved Index for Urban Population Distribution Mapping Based on Nighttime Lights (DMSP-OLS) Data: An Experiment in Riyadh Province, Saudi Arabia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of the spatial pattern of the population is important. Census population data provide insufficient spatial information because they are released only for large geographic areas. Nighttime light (NTL) data have been utilized widely as an effective proxy for population mapping. However, the well-reported challenges of pixel overglow and saturation influence the applicability of the Defense Meteorological Program Operational Line-Scan System (DMSP-OLS) for accurate population mapping. This paper integrates three remotely sensed information sources, DMSP-OLS, vegetation, and bare land areas, to develop a novel index called the Vegetation-Bare Adjusted NTL Index (VBANTLI) to overcome the uncertainties in the DMSP-OLS data. The VBANTLI was applied to Riyadh province to downscale governorate-level census population for 2004 and 2010 to a gridded surface of 1 km resolution. The experimental results confirmed that the VBANTLI significantly reduced the overglow and saturation effects compared to widely applied indices such as the Human Settlement Index (HSI), Vegetation Adjusted Normalized Urban Index (VANUI), and radiance-calibrated NTL (RCNTL). The correlation coefficient between the census population and the RCNTL (R = 0.99) and VBANTLI (R = 0.98) was larger than for the HSI (R = 0.14) and VANUI (R = 0.81) products. In addition, Model 5 (VBANTLI) was the most accurate model with R-2 and mean relative error (MRE) values of 0.95% and 37%, respectively.

TI  - Magmatic Processes in the East African Rift System: Insights From a 2015-2020 Sentinel-1 InSAR Survey
T2  - GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The East African Rift System (EARS) is composed of around 78 Holocene volcanoes, but relatively little is known about their past and present activity. This lack of information makes it difficult to understand their eruptive cycles, their roles in continental rifting and the threat they pose to the population. Although previous InSAR surveys (1990-2010) showed sign of unrest, the information about the dynamics of the magmatic systems remained limited by low temporal resolution and gaps in the data set. The Sentinel-1 SAR mission provides open-access acquisitions every 12 days in Africa and has the potential to produce long-duration time series for studying volcanic ground deformation at regional scale. Here, we use Sentinel-1 data to provide InSAR time series along the EARS for the period 2015-2020. We detect 18 ground deformation signals on 14 volcanoes, of which six are located in Afar, six in the Main Ethiopian Rift, and two in the Kenya-Tanzanian Rift. We detected new episodes of uplift at Tullu Moje (2016) and Suswa (mid-2018), and enigmatic long-lived subsidence signals at Gada Ale and Kone. Subsidence signals are related to a variety of mechanisms including the posteruptive evolution of magma reservoirs (e.g., Alu-Dallafila), the compaction of lava flows (e.g., Nabro), and pore-pressure changes related to geothermal or hydrothermal activity (e.g., Olkaria). Our results show that similar to 20% of the Holocene volcanoes in the EARS deformed during this 5-years snapshot and demonstrate the diversity of processes occurring.

TI  - Temporal dynamics of evapotranspiration in semiarid native forests in Brazil and Spain using remote sensing
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) plays an important role in integrated water resource planning, development and management. This process is particularly relevant in semiarid regions. The aim of this study is, hence, to compare spatial and temporal patterns of actual ET, as well as the temporal trends in two different semiarid forests, Caatinga (Brazil) and Tierra de Pinares (Spain). We used the surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL) to assess actual evapotranspiration (ETa) in both areas. In the Brazilian semiarid forest, Caatinga is the main vegetation, while it is Pinares in Spain. For this purpose, 69 Landsat-5 and 42 Landsat-8 images (1995-2019) were used. The Mann-Kendall test was applied to assess the occurrence of trends in precipitation, temperature and potential ET data; and the Temporal Stability Index (TSI) to know which areas have greater seasonal ETa. The annual amplitude of the potential evapotranspiration (ET0) is the same in both areas, however, the Caatinga values are higher. In the Caatinga forest, when ET0 presents its highest values throughout the year, ETa presents the lowest, and vice versa. In the Pinares forest, ETa follows the ET0 dynamics during the year, and the difference between ET0 and ETa is maximum during the summer. The Caatinga forest showed a greater spatial variation of ETa than the Pinares forest as well as a greater extension with lower temporal stability of ETa than the Pinares forest. Both the Caatinga forest and the Pinares forest showed significant positive trends in annual ET0 and ETa. We estimate that the value of ETa increases more rapidly in Pinares than in the Brazilian Caatinga. Taking Caatinga as a hydrological mirror, some consequences are expected to Pinares, such as significant changes in the water balance, increase of biodiversity vulnerability, and reduction of water availability in soil and reservoirs.

TI  - Varying snow and vegetation signatures of surface-albedo feedback on the Northern Hemisphere land warming
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in snow and vegetation cover associated with global warming can modify surface albedo (the reflected amount of radiative energy from the sun), therefore modulating the rise of surface temperature that is primarily caused by anthropogenic greenhouse-gases emission. This introduces a series of potential feedbacks to regional warming with positive (negative) feedbacks enhancing (reducing) temperature increase by augmenting (decreasing) the absorption of short-wave radiation. So far our knowledge on the importance and magnitude of these feedbacks has been hampered by the limited availability of relatively long records of continuous satellite observations. Here we exploit a 31 year (1982-2012) high-frequency observational record of land data to quantify the strength of the surface-albedo feedback on land warming modulated by snow and vegetation during the recent historical period. To distinguish snow and vegetation contributions to this feedback, we examine temporal composites of satellite data in three different Northern Hemisphere domains. The analysis reveals and quantifies markedly different signatures of the surface-albedo feedback. A large positive surface-albedo feedback of +0.87 (CI 95%: 0.68, 1.05) W(m2.K)-1<i absorbed solar radiation per degree of temperature increase is estimated in the domain where snow dominates. On the other hand the surface-albedo feedback becomes predominantly negative where vegetation dominates: it is largely negative (-0.91 (-0.81, -1.03) W(m2.K)-1<i) in the domain with vegetation dominating, while it is moderately negative (-0.57 (-0.40, -0.72) W(m2.K)-1<i) where both vegetation and snow are significantly present. Snow cover reduction consistently provides a positive feedback on warming. In contrast, vegetation expansion can produce either positive or negative feedbacks in different regions and seasons, depending on whether the underlying surface being replaced has higher (e.g. snow) or lower (e.g. dark soils) albedo than vegetation. This work provides fundamental knowledge to model and predict how the surface-albedo feedback will evolve and affect the rate of regional temperature rise in the future.

TI  - Influence of the proportion, height and proximity of vegetation and buildings on urban land surface temperature
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban areas are characterised by the dominance of impervious surfaces and decreased presence of vegetation compared to their rural surroundings. The resultant increase in temperature is known to amplify global warming, with negative impacts on health and increased energy requirements for cooling. Intra-urban variations in temperature have received less attention than urban-rural variations, although the former can be even larger than the latter. Land cover composition is known to influence surface temperature, while the influence of heights, of buildings and vegetation, is less explored. There are also fewer studies in high-latitude cities although extreme heat events are increasing in frequency and severity in these cities, and high-resolution geospatial datasets are often available for detailed analysis. The aim of this study is therefore to assess the influence of selected land cover variables on the estimated surface temperature in the four largest cities in Denmark-Copenhagen, Aarhus, Odense and Aalborg.Land surface temperatures (LST) of the four cities were estimated using Band 10 (10.60-11.19 mu m) from Landsat 8 imagery. Vegetation cover, building cover, vegetation height and building height were estimated using 4-band aerial imagery, building footprints and LiDAR-based elevation models, and their correlations with LST were estimated. Moving average filters, with window sizes from 3 x 3 (90 m x 90 m) to 11 x 11 (330 m x 330 m), were used to understand the area of influence of surrounding land cover on the LST within 30-m cells. When vegetation cover and building cover increased from 0-5% to 95-100%, median values of LST decreased by 4.16 +/- 0.76 degrees C and increased by 4.31 +/- 0.69 degrees C, respectively. Land cover variables within 7 x 7 windows (210 m x 210 m) are shown to have strong correlations with the LST of 30-m cells. The area of influence of building heights on the LST of 30-m cells was the largest in Copenhagen, which also has the tallest buildings among the cities. LST reduced by 4.10 degrees C when the mean vegetation height within a 30-m cell increased from 0-2 m to 20-22 m, and by 5.75 degrees C for 210 m x 210 m patches with the same height range. A combination of increased vegetation cover and height could therefore be used to regulate temperature in or close to hot spots in cities depending on the availability of space.

AB  - The rapid increase in the population of many of the older major cities within the countries of the Saharan-Arabian Desert is steering vast and disorganized urban expansion and in many cases introducing adverse environmental impacts such as soil erosion, rise in groundwater levels, and contamination of shallow aquifers, as well as development of deformational features including land subsidence. Using the rapidly growing city of Riyadh (1992: 467 km(2); 2018: 980 km(2)), the capital of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia as a test site, we utilized Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) interferometric analyses of 2016 to 2018 Sentinel-1 images together with multi-temporal high-resolution images viewable on Google Earth, GPS, field, land use land cover (LULC), and geological data to assess the distribution and rates of land subsidence and their causal effects. Three main causes of subsidence were identified and assessed: (1) discharge of wastewater effluents from septic systems in newly urbanized areas that lead to an increase in soil moisture, rise in groundwater levels, waterlogging, and wetting and hydrocompaction of dry alluvium loose sediments causing land subsidence (up to -20 mm/y) in wadis and lowlands; (2) the subsurface dissolution of karst formation by wastewater effluents and the collapse of voids and cavities at depth under stresses introduced by heavy construction machinery, causing sagging and land subsidence (up to -5 mm/y); and (3) leveling, compaction, and degradation of municipal and building waste materials in organized landfills and disorganized dump sites that resulted in significant land subsidence (up to -21 mm/y) and differential settling that could jeopardize the stability of structures erected over these sites. Our findings highlight the potential use of the advocated integrated approach to assess the nature and extent of land deformation associated with rapid urban growth in arid lands, and to identify areas most impacted for the purpose of directing and prioritizing remediation efforts.

M3  - Article
AB  - A number of theoretical results have provided sufficient conditions for the selection of payoff-efficient equilibria in games played on networks when agents imitate successful neighbors and make occasional mistakes (stochastic stability). However, those results only guarantee full convergence in the long-run, which might be too restrictive in reality. Here, we employ a more gradual approach relying on agent-based simulations avoiding the double limit underlying these analytical results. We focus on the circular-city model, for which a sufficient condition on the population size relative to the neighborhood size was identified by Alos-Ferrer & Weidenholzer [(2006) Economics Letters, 93, 163-168]. Using more than 100,000 agent-based simulations, we find that selection of the efficient equilibrium prevails also for a large set of parameters violating the previously identified condition. Interestingly, the extent to which efficiency obtains decreases gradually as one moves away from the boundary of this condition.

TI  - On the Use of Preconditioners to Improve the Accuracy and Effectiveness of Iterative Methods to Enhance the Spatial Resolution of Radiometer Measurements
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this letter, a new approach is proposed to ameliorate the performance of iterative gradient-like regularization schemes aimed at enhancing the spatial resolution of microwave radiometer measurements in the Hilbert space. The approach consists of preconditioning the ill-conditioned discrete problem to let the iterative gradient-based inversion technique be more computer-time effective. Experiments undertaken on the simulated radiometer brightness profiles demonstrate the soundness of the proposed rationale that outperforms conventional gradient-like methods in terms of both computer-time effectiveness and accuracy in reconstructing spot-like discontinuities while resulting in larger fluctuations over the background.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy following neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer patients with axillary node metastasis: A cross-sectional survey
T2  - MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: A survey of breast surgeons in Saudi Arabia was conducted to evaluate changes in clinical practice regarding sentinel node biopsy (SNB) among clinically node-negative patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer with axillary node metastasis. Methods and Materials: The study was conducted in a tertiary university hospital in Riyadh between August and October 2020 and utilized a 22-question, online survey to examine various factors leading to the omission of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) among KSA breast surgeons. The questions pertained to basic demographics and the participant's cited influencing factors. Cross-tabulation and the chi-square square test were used to analysis subgroups, and binary logistics regression was used to assess doctor-related factors contributing to a decision to omit ALND after NAC. Results: A total of 24 participants completed the survey. The proportion of surgeons preferring SLNB adjunctively or replaced by axillary radiotherapy in patients with clinically positive axilla and receiving NAC was 70.8%. Conclusion: The implementation of SLNB post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy has led to a wide variation in clinical practice. Further prospective randomized clinical trials should be conducted in order to evaluate the clinical outcomes of SNB versus more conventional therapies.

TI  - From jihad to resistance: the evolution of Hamas's discourse in the framework of mobilization
T2  - MIDDLE EASTERN STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article is the first attempt to examine the dynamics of Hamas's political discourse since the movement's birth with relations to mobilization. Based on extensive primary sources and interviews with Hamas leaders in Gaza, the article identifies three key framing processes. First, at its inception, Hamas's words and actions centered around the movement's interpretation of Islam from 1987 to 1993. Second, during the Oslo period from 1993-2000, Hamas attempted to de-frame its religious discourse. Third, from 2000 to the present, Hamas has reframed its discourses around the more inclusive concept of muqawama or resistance. While Hamas was in office after 2006, Hamas's notions of resistance, however, eschew a sole meaning and instead function as a floating signifier. Each of these framings are investigated by relation to changing socio-political realities. The article argues that Hamas is not necessarily becoming either less Islamic or more secular-nationalist. Rather, the employment of the discourses of muqawama - that is, as a non-religious and more inclusive term - is better suited to Hamas's current mobilization needs, and the rearticulation of its evolving worldview, without jeopardizing its religious identity.

TI  - Spatial Relationship between Irrigation Water Salinity, Waterlogging, and Cropland Degradation in the Arid and Semi-Arid Environments
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water scarcity in arid and semiarid regions has resulted in using of low-quality waters for crop irrigation. This study aims to investigate the spatial relationship of low-quality irrigation water and waterlogging in arid and semiarid environments. The multi-decadal (1990-2020) time series Landsat images and hadrochemical water analysis were employed within geographical information system mapping (GIS) to understand the relationship between irrigation water, soil salinity, and waterlogging in the western Nile Delta, Egypt. The normalized difference water index (NDWI) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from the Landsat images were combined to quantify the Spatiotemporal changes in the croplands and waterlogging from 1990 to 2020. ArcGIS inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation was used to create spatial layers of irrigation water salinity from electrical conductivity (EC), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), and soluble sodium percentage (Na%). The results demonstrated a significant spatial relationship between waterlogging and EC, SAR, and Na% in irrigation groundwater. Long-term irrigation with high salinity groundwater led to increased soil salinity, low soil permeability, and waterlogging. This study offers a time- and cost-efficient geospatial method for regional monitoring of surface waterlogging and mitigation strategies for cropland degradation and agricultural drainage water recycling that would benefit stakeholders and decision-makers.

AB  - Change detection method with multi-temporal satellite images based on Wavelet decomposition with Daubechies wavelet function (Multi Resolution Analysis), and tiling is proposed. The method allows detection of changes in time series analysis and is not sensitive to geometric distortions included in the satellite images. In this paper, the author proposed a method based on MRA as a method for extracting change points from satellite images acquired over many periods. Change detection method with multi-temporal satellite images based on Wavelet decomposition and tiling is proposed. The method allows to detect changes and is not sensitive to geometric distortions included in the satellite images. The experimental results with simulation image and a Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) image show that more appropriate changes can be detected with the proposed method in comparison with the existing method of subtraction. When applied to simulations and real satellite images, it was confirmed that they were robust to minute nonlinear geometric distortion.

TI  - Can Nitrogen Excretion of Dairy Cows Be Reduced by Genetic Selection for Low Milk Urea Nitrogen Concentration?
T2  - ANIMALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple SummaryNew Zealand dairy cows predominantly feed on pasture with protein to energy ratios well in excess of requirements and consequently their urine has a substantially greater concentration of nitrogen compared to cows fed indoors on total mixed rations. The nitrogen excreted directly onto land decompose into nitrous oxide and ammonium, causing global warming and freshwater pollution, respectively. One of the strategies to reduce the environmental contamination is genetic selection for reduced nitrogen excretion. The nitrogen excreted in urine is an expensive trait to measure in cows grazed outdoors. One possible approach to reduce the concentration of nitrogen excreted in urine is by selection for reduced urea nitrogen concentration in milk, which is readily measurable. The primary objective of this study was to quantify the likely correlated responses for milk production and liveweight traits in a selection index including breeding values for concentration of milk urea nitrogen with different relative emphasis in order to evaluate the usefulness of milk urea nitrogen for the purpose of reducing nitrogen excretion. Although a per cow reduction in urinary nitrogen excretion was predicted through selection in this study, the reduction of excretion is negligible at the whole farm level due to the influence of stocking rate, measured as the number of cows grazed per hectare, on the per hectare nitrogen excretion. Therefore, selection for low concentration of milk urea nitrogen is unlikely to be effective in reducing nitrogen excretion of dairy cows in New Zealand.The objectives of this study were two-fold. Firstly, to estimate the likely correlated responses in milk urea nitrogen (MUN) concentration, lactation yields of milk (MY), fat (FY) and crude protein (CPY) and mature cow liveweight (LWT) under three selection scenarios which varied in relative emphasis for MUN; 0% relative emphasis (MUN0%: equivalent to current New Zealand breeding worth index), and sign of the economic value; 20% relative emphasis positive selection (MUN+20%), and 20% relative emphasis negative selection (MUN-20%). Secondly, to estimate for these three scenarios the likely change in urinary nitrogen (UN) excretion under pasture based grazing conditions. The predicted genetic responses per cow per year for the current index were 16.4 kg MY, 2.0 kg FY, 1.4 kg CPY, -0.4 kg LWT and -0.05 mg/dL MUN. Positive selection on MUN in the index resulted in annual responses of 23.7 kg MY, 2.0 kg FY, 1.4 kg CPY, 0.6 kg LWT and 0.10 mg/dL MUN, while negative selection on MUN in the index resulted in annual responses of 5.4 kg MY, 1.6 kg FY, 1.0 kg CPY, -1.1 kg LWT and -0.17 mg/dL MUN. The MUN-20% reduced both MUN and cow productivity, whereas the MUN+20% increased MUN, milk production and LWT per cow. Per cow dry matter intake (DMI) was increased in all three scenarios as milk production increased compared to base year, therefore stocking rate (SR) was adjusted to control pasture cover. Paradoxically, ten years of selection with SR adjusted to maintain annual feed demand under the MUN+20% actually reduced per ha UN excretion by 3.54 kg, along with increases of 63 kg MY, 26 kg FY and 16 kg CPY compared to the base year. Ten years of selection on the MUN0% index generated a greater reductions of 10.45 kg UN and 30 kg MY, and increases of 32 kg FY and 21 kg CPY per ha, whereas the MUN-20% index reduced 14.06 kg UN and 136 kg MY with increases of 32 kg FY and 18 kg CPY compared to base year. All three scenarios increased partitioning of nitrogen excreted as feces. The selection index that excluded MUN was economically beneficial in the current economic circumstances over selection indices including MUN regardless of whether selection was either for or against MUN. There was no substantial benefit from an environmental point of view from including MUN in the Breeding Worth index, because N leaching is more a function of SR rather than of individual cow UN excretion. This study demonstrates that attention needs to be paid to the whole system consequences of selection for environmental outcomes in pastoral grazing circumstances.

T2  - ISRAEL STUDIES REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Decades before he was known as a historian or as an early neoconservative thinker, let alone as the father of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Benzion Netanyahu was a young student and journalist in British Mandatory Palestine. In this tumultuous period, reaching its peak with the 1933 murder of Haim Arlosoroff, Netanyahu dwelt at the margins of Zionist politics, belonging to a group of well-educated, right-wing, young outsiders-students, poets, journalists, intellectuals, and pseudo-intellectuals-all of whom rebelled against their current and former Hebrew University professors. This study examines the crystallization of Netanyahu's worldview and his Zionist ideology by focusing on three events between 1932 and 1935 that shaped his hostility toward the left and, much later, which became integral components of politics in Israel.

AB  - Machine-learning algorithms used for modelling olive-tree phenology generally and largely rely on temperature data. In this study, we developed a prediction model on the basis of climate data and geophysical information. Remote measurements of weather conditions, terrain slope, and surface spectral reflectance were considered for this purpose. The accuracy of the temperature data worsened when replacing weather-station measurements with remote-sensing records, though the addition of more complete environmental data resulted in an efficient prediction model of olive-tree phenology. Filtering and embedded feature-selection techniques were employed to analyze the impact of variables on olive-tree phenology prediction, facilitating the inclusion of measurable information in decision support frameworks for the sustainable management of olive-tree systems.

TI  - Climate Variability, Land Cover Changes and Livelihoods of Communities on the Fringes of Bobiri Forest Reserve, Ghana
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate variability coupled with land use and land cover changes have resulted in significant changes in forest reserves in Ghana with major implications for rural livelihoods. Understanding the link between climate variability, land use and land cover changes and rural livelihoods is key for decision-making, especially regarding sustainable management of forest resources, monitoring of ecosystems and related livelihoods. The study determined the extent to which climate variability drives land cover changes in the Bobiri forest reserve, Ghana. Landsat images from 1986, 2003, 2010 and 2014 were used to evaluate land cover changes of the Bobiri forest reserve in Ghana. Participatory research approaches including household questionnaire surveys, focus group discussions and key informant interviews were conducted in four fringe communities of the Bobiri forest reserve. Findings showed that local people perceived changes in rainfall and temperature patterns over the past years. Historical rainfall and temperature data for the study area showed increased variability in rainfall and an increasing temperature trend, which are consistent with the perception of the study respondents. Analysis of land cover satellite images showed that there has been significant transformation of closed forest to open forest and non-forest land cover types over the 28-year period (1986-2014), with an overall kappa statistic of 0.77. Between 2003 and 2014, closed forest decreased by 15.6% but settlement/bare ground and crop land increased marginally by 1.5% and 0.9%, respectively. Focus group discussions and key informant interviews revealed that increased land cover changes in the Bobiri forest reserve could partly be attributed to erratic rainfall patterns. Other factors such as logging and population growth were reported to be factors driving land cover changes. The study concluded that the Bobiri forest reserve has witnessed significant land cover changes and recommended that alternative livelihood sources should be provided to reduce the direct dependency of fringe communities on the forest for livelihood and firewood.

TI  - Estimating Global Gross Primary Production from Sun-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence Data and Auxiliary Information Using Machine Learning Methods
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The gross primary production (GPP) is important for regulating the global carbon cycle and climate change. Recent studies have shown that sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is highly advantageous regarding GPP monitoring. However, using SIF to estimate GPP on a global scale is limited by the lack of a stable SIF-GPP relationship. Here, we estimated global monthly GPP at 0.05 degrees spatial resolution for the period 2001-2017, using the global OCO-2-based SIF product (GOSIF) and other auxiliary data. Large amounts of flux tower data are not available to the public and the available data is not evenly distributed globally and has a smaller measured footprint than the GOSIF data. This makes it difficult to use the flux tower GPP directly as an input to the model. Our strategy is to scale in situ measurements using two moderate-resolution satellite GPP products (MODIS and GLASS). Specifically, these two satellite GPP products were calibrated and eventually integrated by in situ measurements (FLUXNET2015 dataset, 83 sites), which was then used to train a machine learning model (GBRT) that performed the best among five evaluated models. The GPP estimates from GOSIF were highly accurate coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.58, root mean square error (RMSE) = 2.74 g C center dot m(-2), bias = -0.34 g C center dot m(-2)) as validated by in situ measurements, and exhibited reasonable spatial and seasonal variations on a global scale. Our method requires fewer input variables and has higher computational efficiency than other satellite GPP estimation methods. Satellite-based SIF data provide a unique opportunity for more accurate, near real-time GPP mapping in the future.

The goal of this study was to evaluate the short-term outcomes of patients undergoing uterine transposition after trachelectomy for cervical cancer or before chemoradiation for vaginal cancer.MethodsWe retrospectively evaluated patients with early stage cervical cancer after radical trachelectomy or with vaginal cancer with indication for pelvic radiation who had uterine transposition performed as fertility sparing strategy.ResultsFour patients with cervical cancer and one patient with vaginal cancer were included. Median age was 32 years (range 28-38). All patients had squamous cell carcinomas. All patients with cervical cancer had radical trachelectomies with sentinel lymph node dissection (SLN). Two of these patients also had pelvic lymphadenectomies. Indications for adjuvant radiotherapy was due to Sedlis criteria in two patients and to lymph node metastasis in the other two patients. The patient with stage IIB vaginal cancer was recommended primary chemoradiation. All patients underwent uterine transposition before radiotherapy. The median uterine transposition surgical time was 90 min (range 80-205) and no early complications (30 days) occurred. Average time from uterine transposition to start of radiotherapy was 16 days (10-28). After radiation, the uterus along with the ovaries and tubes were repositioned and the residual cervix sutured to the vagina. One patient declined uterine reimplantation after radiation and underwent a hysterectomy. After a median follow-up of 25 months (range 1-30), all patients were without evidence of disease. All patients with preserved uterus have normal menses after treatment. One patient has attempted to conceive with IVF techniques without success.ConclusionsUterine transposition may be an option in selected patients with cervical and vaginal cancers who want to preserve fertility. However, further studies that address its oncological safety and obstetrical outcomes are encouraged.

TI  - Automatic Subsidence Troughs Detection in SAR Interferograms Using Circlet Transform
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents the results of automatic detection of subsidence troughs in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferograms. The detection of subsidence troughs is based on the circlet transform, which is able to detect features with circular shapes. Compared to other methods of detecting circles, the circular transform takes into account the finite data frequency. Moreover, the search shape is not limited to a circle but identified on the basis of a certain width. This is especially important in the case of detection of subsidence troughs whose shapes may not be similar to circles or ellipses but to their fragments. The transformation works directly on the image gradient; it does not require further binary segmentation or edge detection as in the case of other methods, e.g., the Hough transform. The entire processing process can be automated to save time and increase reliability compared to traditional methods. The proposed automatic detection method was tested on a differential interferogram that was generated based on Sentinel-1A SAR images of the Upper Silesian Coal Basin area. The test carried out showed that the proposed method is 20% more effective in detecting troughs that than the method using Hough transform.

TI  - Analyses of Short- and Long-Term Shoreline Trends of the Southwest Benin Coast
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal zones are the economic heart of coastal countries and are therefore densely populated. In recent times, coastal zones are found to be globally eroding at variable spatiotemporal scales, leading to loss of business activities, ecosystems, economic lands, and infrastructures. Similar to elsewhere in the world, in West Africa and particularly the Benin Republic, the problem of the eroding shoreline is on the increase. Currently, the Grand-Popo section (the western part of the Benin coast) is experiencing serious shoreline change, which is causing the destruction of physical infrastructure and ecosystems. This study aims to determine the shoreline change trends in the study area over approximately a 10-year period from 1988 to 2018. To attend this objective, the SPOT and Sentinel-2 remotely sensed data of 10-m resolution were used, and the shoreline feature was extracted using the high-water line as an indicator. The shoreline feature dynamics were analysed using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System extension in ArcGIS, where the shoreline change statistics were computed and analysed. The results indicate that from 1988 to 2001, a high net shoreline accretion occurred, representing 80.39% of the entire study area at an average rate of 3.46 m/y. From 2001 to 2012, the Grand-Popo shoreline was affected by erosion representing approximately 85.17% of the study area at an average erosion rate of -4.54 rn/y. Net shoreline accretion corresponding to 76.08% of the entire study coast at an average rate of 7.98 m/y also occurred between 2001 and 2012. Considering the entire study period (1988 to 2018), 68.51% of the shoreline accreted at an average rate of 0.79 m/y whereas 31.49% of the entire coast eroded at an average rate of -0.75 m/y. Major erosion was observed near the mouth of the Bouche du Roy estuary.

TI  - Sensitivity of Satellite Ocean Color Data to System Vicarious Calibration of the Long Near Infrared Band
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite ocean color missions require accurate system vicarious calibrations (SVC) to retrieve the relatively small remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs, sr(-1)) from the at-sensor radiance. However, the current atmospheric correction and SVC procedures do not include calibration of the "long" near infrared band (NIRL-869 nm for MODIS), partially because earlier studies, based primarily on simulations, indicate that accuracy in the retrieved R-rs is insensitive to moderate changes in the NIRL vicarious gain (g). However, the sensitivity of ocean color data products to g(NIRL) has not been thoroughly examined. Here, we first derive 10 SVC "gain configurations" (vicarious gains for all visible and NIR bands) for MODIS/Aqua using current operational NASA protocols, each time assuming a different g(869). From these, we derive a suite of similar to 1.4E6 unique gain configurations with g(869) ranging from 0.85 to 1.2. All MODIS/A data for 25 locations within each of five ocean gyres were then processed using each of these gain configurations. Resultant time series show substantial variability in dominant R-rs(547) patterns in response to changes in g(869) (and associated gain configurations). Overall, mean R-rs(547) values generally decrease with increasing g(869), while the standard deviations around those means show gyre-specific minima for 0.97 < g(869) < 1.02. Following these sensitivity analyses, we assess the potential to resolve g(869) using such time series, finding g(869) = 1.025 most closely comports with expectations. This approach is broadly applicable to other ocean color sensors, and highlights the importance of rigorous cross-sensor calibration of the NIRL bands, with implications on consistency of mergedsensor data sets.

TI  - A Significant Decrease in the Incidence of Shigellosis in Israel during COVID-19 Pandemic
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes COVID-19 and is mostly person-to-person transmitted through respiratory droplets. The implications of the strategies implemented to prevent COVID-19 transmission on other infectious diseases are unclear. We aimed to appraise trends in the incidence of salmonellosis, shigellosis and campylobacteriosis in Israel during COVID-19 pandemic. Positive stool samples for Salmonella, Shigella and Campylobacter are reported on a monthly basis to the Israel Center for Disease Control from sentinel laboratories, within the framework of a surveillance network of bacterial culture-proven enteric diseases. Age-adjusted incidence rates per 100,000 of shigellosis, salmonellosis and campylobacteriosis were calculated. Mean rates before and after the local onset of COVID-19 pandemic in Israel were compared and Relative Risk Reduction (RRR) was calculated. Joinpoint was used to evaluate secular trends. The mean age-adjusted incidence rate of shigellosis in March-July 2020 was lower than the rate observed in March-July 2018-2019 (RRR = 86.6%), but also decreased for salmonellosis (RRR = 33.0%) and campylobacteriosis (RRR = 30.0%). Using Joinpoint we have shown that the decrease observed for shigellosis was significantly sharper (Annual Percent Change (APC) = -77.7) between February 2020 and May 2020 than for salmonellosis (APC = -14.0) between July 2019 and April 2020 and for campylobacteriosis (APC = -1.1) between January 2018 and July 2020. The preventive measures applied to reduce transmission of COVID-19, including social distancing and hand washing, were ecologically associated with a decreased risk of bacterial enteric diseases in Israel. The association was strongest for shigellosis, a disease that is mostly person-to-person transmitted, as compared to salmonellosis and campylobacteriosis which are mostly foodborne transmitted.

TI  - A Dance from Iglau: Gustav Mahler, Bohemia, and the Complexities of Austrian Identity
T2  - NINETEENTH CENTURY MUSIC
M3  - Article
AB  - A survey of Mahler's correspondents, especially his classmates at the University of Vienna in the 1870s, reveals a multifaceted identity he shared with them. Most of his fellow members of the Pernerstorfer Circle, young intellectuals who met to discuss art and politics during their university years, had a similar background: German-speakers with a Jewish heritage and an upbringing in one of the Eastern minority communities of the Habsburg Empire. While some of Mahler's music has been examined with respect to his Jewish background, little has been said about the influence of Bohemia on the composer, and even less about how this Austrian configuration of identity influenced his worldview and composition. We often repeat Mahler's famous quote that he was thrice homeless, as a Bohemian in Austria, as an Austrian among Germans, and as a Jew throughout the world, yet the meaning of being Austrian rather than German has been underexplored in Mahler's music.In this article, I suggest that the mixture of ethnic identities was Austrian for the composer, placing Mahler within a group of like-minded Austrians whose complex allegiances to multiple traditions influenced their contributions to the field of politics, literature, philosophy, and music. Focusing on Mahler's early symphonies, I demonstrate the interface between Jewish, Bohemian, and Austro-German musical characteristics, and I compare this musical synergy to similar interactions in the publications of members of the Mahler's university peers, as well as other intellectuals of his generation including Karl Emil Franzos. This article reveals multiethnic networks of influence in Mahler's music and reconsiders Austrian identity uncoupled from the traditional Austro-German formulation.

TI  - Ten things to know about ten cardiovascular disease risk factors
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PREVENTIVE CARDIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Given rapid advancements in medical science, it is often challenging for the busy clinician to remain up-to-date on the fundamental and multifaceted aspects of preventive cardiology and maintain awareness of the latest guidelines applicable to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. The "American Society for Preventive Cardiology (ASPC) Top Ten CVD Risk Factors 2021 Update" is a summary document (updated yearly) regarding CVD risk factors. This "ASPC Top Ten CVD Risk Factors 2021 Update" summary document reflects the perspective of the section authors regarding ten things to know about ten sentinel CVD risk factors. It also includes quick access to sentinel references (applicable guidelines and select reviews) for each CVD risk factor section. The ten CVD risk factors include unhealthful nutrition, physical inactivity, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, high blood pressure, obesity, considerations of select populations (older age, race/ethnicity, and sex differences), thrombosis/smoking, kidney dysfunction and genetics/familial hypercholesterolemia. For the individual patient, other CVD risk factors may be relevant, beyond the CVD risk factors discussed here. However, it is the intent of the "ASPC Top Ten CVD Risk Factors 2021 Update" to provide a succinct overview of things to know about ten common CVD risk factors applicable to preventive cardiology.

TI  - Phenology-based sample generation for supervised crop type classification
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop type mapping is relevant to a wide range of food security applications. Supervised classification methods commonly generate these data from satellite image time-series. Yet, their successful implementation is hindered by the lack of training samples. Solutions like transfer learning, development of temporal-spectral signatures of the target classes, re-utilization of existing inventories, or crowdsourcing initiatives are commonly applied to generate samples for thematically coarser classifications. These methods are rarely used for generating crop types samples. In this study, we leverage the phenology information of existing data inventories using Time-Weighted Dynamic Time Warping (TWDTW) to address the problem of automatic crop sample generation in two target areas. Resulting labeled samples are refined using proximity measures obtained from Random Forests (RF). Sentinel-2 time-series are used to obtain phenology information from two study areas. The proposed methodology achieved promising results for classes with a reduced inter-classes similarity such as sugar beets (user's accuracy, UA, of 98% and producer's accuracy, PA, of 100%) or grains (UA of 98% and PA of 90%). The crops with a high inter-classes similarity yielded less satisfactory results. Potatoes, for example, obtained a high PA of 95%, but a UA of only 36% because of the spectral-temporal similarity with maize. The methodology works well for areas with balanced crop samples. Yet, it favors prevalent classes in areas with imbalanced crops at the expense of a low accuracy for the minority crops. Despite these shortcomings, the proposed methodology offers a viable option to generate crop samples in regions with few ground labels.

TI  - Emergence of Lyme borreliosis in the province of Verona, Northern Italy: Five-years of sentinel surveillance
T2  - TICKS AND TICK-BORNE DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, laboratory data and antibiotic treatment of Lyme borreliosis in the province of Verona, Northern Italy, during the period 2015-2019. One hundred and 29 cases of Lyme borreliosis were diagnosed in a single hospital representing 27 % of all cases reported in the Veneto region in the same period. The mean annual incidence of Lyme borreliosis was 0.992/100,000 inhabitants. A peak incidence of 2/100,000 inhabitants was observed in 2018. Early localized Lyme borreliosis was the most common presentation (74 %), followed by early disseminated Lyme borreliosis (21 %). One possible early Lyme neuroborreliosis and two cranial neuropathies were diagnosed. IgM and/or IgG borrelia antibodies were positive in 90 % of the cases. This significant increase of Lyme borreliosis incidence in the province of Verona highlights the need to increase knowledge on its epidemiology and clinical manifestation among both the general population and clinicians to allow early diagnosis and treatment.

TI  - Exploring VIIRS Continuity with MODIS in an Expedited Capability for Monitoring Drought-Related Vegetation Conditions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation has been effectively monitored using remote sensing time-series vegetation index (VI) data for several decades. Drought monitoring has been a common application with algorithms tuned to capturing anomalous temporal and spatial vegetation patterns. Drought stress models, such as the Vegetation Drought Response Index (VegDRI), often use VIs like the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The EROS expedited Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (eMODIS)-based, 7-day NDVI composites are integral to the VegDRI. As MODIS satellite platforms (Terra and Aqua) approach mission end, the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) presents an alternate NDVI source, with daily collection, similar band passes, and moderate spatial resolution. This study provides a statistical comparison between EROS expedited VIIRS (eVIIRS) 375-m and eMODIS 250-m and tests the suitability of replacing MODIS NDVI with VIIRS NDVI for drought monitoring and vegetation anomaly detection. For continuity with MODIS NDVI, we calculated a geometric mean regression adjustment algorithm using 375-m resolution for an eMODIS-like NDVI (eVIIRS') eVIIRS' = 0.9887 x eVIIRS - 0.0398. The resulting statistical comparisons (eVIIRS' vs. eMODIS NDVI) showed correlations consistently greater than 0.84 throughout the three years studied. The eVIIRS' VegDRI results characterized similar drought patterns and hotspots to the eMODIS-based VegDRI, with near zero bias.

TI  - Uneven Frontiers: Exposing the Geopolitics of Myanmar's Borderlands with Critical Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A critical remote sensing approach illuminates the geopolitics of development within Myanmar and across its ethnic minority borderlands. By integrating nighttime light (NTL) data from 1992-2020, long-term ethnographic fieldwork, and a review of scholarly and gray literature, we analyzed how Myanmar's economic geography defies official policy, attesting to persistent inequality and the complex relationships between state-sponsored and militia-led violence, resource extraction, and trade. While analysis of DMSP-OLS data (1992-2013) and VIIRS data (2013-2020) reveals that Myanmar brightened overall, especially since the 2010s in line with its now-halting liberalization, growth in lights was unequally distributed. Although ethnic minority states brightened more rapidly than urbanized ethnic majority lowland regions, in 2020, the latter still emitted 5.6-fold more radiance per km(2). Moreover, between 2013 and 2020, Myanmar's borderlands were on average just 13% as bright as those of its five neighboring countries. Hot spot analysis of radiance within a 50 km-wide area spanning both sides of the border confirmed that most significant clusters of light lay outside Myanmar. Among the few hot spots on Myanmar's side, many were associated with official border crossings such as Muse, the formal hub for trade with China, and Tachileik and Myawaddy next to Thailand. Yet some of the most significant increases in illumination between 2013 and 2020 occurred in areas controlled by the Wa United State Party and its army, which are pursuing infrastructure development and mining along the Chinese border from Panghsang to the illicit trade hub of Mongla. Substantial brightening related to the "world's largest refugee camp" was also detected in Bangladesh, where displaced Rohingya Muslims fled after Myanmar's military launched a violent crackdown. However, no radiance nor change in radiance were discernible in areas within Myanmar where ethnic cleansing operations occurred, pointing to the limitations of NTL. The diverse drivers and implications of changes in light observed from space emphasize the need for political and economically situated remote sensing.

TI  - APPLICATION OF GIS IN THE DETERMINATION OF VERTICAL RELIEF FRAGMENTATION: ACASESTUDYON DRENICA RIVER BASIN (KOSOVO)
T2  - GEOGRAPHIA TECHNICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Advances in Remote Sensing (Digital Elevation Models) products and GIS techniques have made the calculation and analysis of morphometric indices much more accurate, effective, and less time-consuming. The energy of relief is a morphometric parameter that indicates the vertical variety of relief and represents the potential energy of a given terrain. Calculating morphometric parameters by manual methods is inconvenient because it takes a long time, is subject to mistakes that can be made by humans when extracting these parameters and, consequently leads to wrong conclusions. There is currently no fully automated method to calculate this parameter. The purpose of this paper is to define the procedures for extracting this parameter within a GIS environment using data from high resolution (HR) ALOS-PALSAR (Advanced Land Observing Satellite-Phased Array-Type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar) Radiometrically Terrain Corrected (RTC) DEM with a spatial resolution of 12.5 m with the help of ArcGIS software. To calculate this parameter, a grid with 1x1 km cells with interpolation points in each cell was constructed. IDW was chosen as the most suitable method for the interpolation of points. Based on the obtained results, the maximum value of relief's energy for the Drenica River basin reaches 328 m/km(2). 57.19% of the surface belongs to the low and very low values of relief's energy, 42.72% belongs to the average values while only 0.09% belongs to the high values. The high participation of very small and small values of this parameter for the Drenica River basin indicates that the total area is increasing towards the creation of flat surfaces. The importance of deriving this parameter is reflected in the fact that the data obtained are quantitative (have numerical value), can be verified and applicable in practice for the purposes of the construction sector, tourism, spatial planning, etc.

TI  - Testing a Model of Pacific Oysters' (<i>Crassostrea gigas</i>) Growth in the Adriatic Sea: Implications for Aquaculture Spatial Planning
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing the potential biomass yield is a key step in aquaculture site selection. This is challenging, especially for shellfish, as the growth rate depends on both trophic status and water temperature. Individual ecophysiological models can be used for mapping potential shellfish growth in coastal areas, using as input spatial time series of remotely sensed SST and chlorophyll-a. This approach was taken here to estimate the potential for developing oyster (Crassostrea gigas) farming in the western Adriatic Sea. Industry relevant indicators (i.e., shell length, total individual weight) and days required to reach marketable size were mapped using a dynamic energy budget model, finetuned on the basis of site-specific morphometric data collected monthly for a year. Spatially scaled-up results showed that the faster and more uniform growth in the northern Adriatic coastal area, compared with the southern one, where chlorophyll-a levels are lower and summer temperatures exceed the critical temperature limit for longer periods. These results could be used in planning the identification of allocated zones for aquaculture, (AZA), taking into account also the potential for farming or co-farming C. gigas. In perspective, the methodology could be used for getting insights on changes to the potential productivity indicators due to climatic changes.

TI  - Eleven Years of Mangrove-Mudflat Dynamics on the Mud Volcano-Induced Prograding Delta in East Java, Indonesia: Integrating UAV and Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents a novel approach to explore mangrove dynamics on a prograding delta by integrating unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and satellite imagery. The Porong Delta in Indonesia has a unique geographical setting with rapid delta development and expansion of the mangrove belt. This is due to an unprecedented mud load from the LUSI mud volcanic eruption. The mangrove dynamics analysis combines UAV-based Structure from Motion (SfM) photogrammetry and 11 years (2009-2019) satellite imagery cloud computing analysis by Google Earth Engine (GEE). Our analysis shows unique, high-spatiotemporal-resolution mangrove extent maps. The SfM photogrammetry analysis leads to a 3D representation of the mangrove canopy and an estimate of mangrove biophysical properties with accurate height and individual position of the mangroves stand. GEE derived vegetation indices resulted in high (three-monthly) resolution mangrove coverage dynamics over 11 years (2009-2019), yielding a value of more than 98% for the overall, producer and consumer accuracy. Combining the satellite-derived age maps and the UAV-derived spatial tree structure allowed us to monitor the mangrove dynamics on a rapidly prograding delta along with its structural attributes. This analysis is of essential value to ecologists, coastal managers, and policymakers.

TI  - Mapping Home amid Shifting Spatialities in Mohsin Hamid's <i>Exit West</i>
T2  - LITERARY VOICE
M3  - Article
AB  - In postmodern, globalized worldview, the notion of home has entered into discursive modes o f representation across disciplines. The categories of gender, race, and class have inserted a disruptive discursiveness in the notional construct of home as its constitutive factors. The competing narratives on home make it a contested space of ideologies. The idea of home now is a reflection of continuous flux and reconstruction. This paper attempts to ground the notion of home within the renewed debates on space and spatiality in human geography by investigating the spatial dynamics of home in Mohsin Hamid's Exit West. Exit West inserts the issues of home and belonging into a global context by depicting condition of homelessness as an issue that concerns one and all irrespective of being an immigrant or not. A constantly shifting and fluid spatiality brings into play alternative narratives of home, disrupting the racialized and gendered notions of home.

TI  - <i>KAWAII</i> (CUTE) SIGNS AND SYMBOLS AS A MEANS OF MAINTAINING HARMONY IN JAPANESE SOCIETY
T2  - STUDIA UNIVERSITATIS BABES-BOLYAI PHILOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study focuses on the various facets of the Japanese concept of kawaii ("cute", "adorable"), as resulting from print advertisements. In the last decade it has been intensively studied by different scholars from various research fields aiming to understand the Japanese worldview. The analysis of pop culture elements, of which kawaii is part of, was not an area of interest due to the fact that they were considered inferior to high culture (classical arts and traditions), but the influence of this concept on culture and language, as well as on the way the Japanese communicate and relate is significant. Starting from the idea that the viewer is (often) persuaded through culture-specific signs and symbols, we intend to present the role of kawaii ("cute", "adorable") verbal and visual signs in maintaining group harmony (wa), one of Japan's core values. Hofstede's (2001, 2003, 2010) cultural dimensions theory was used to identify some of the dominant values in the Japanese society which determine people's expectations and behavior and signs and symbols used in adverts were analyzed from a cultural semiotics perspective. In order to explain the popularity of cute characters and "sweet talk" (oseji) in advertisements, we conducted a content analysis based on a corpus of over 200 Japanese print advertisements, covering both commercial and social (public interest) advertising, out of which we have selected four to discuss in this paper.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node detection in endometrial cancer with indocyanine green: laparoscopic versus robotic approach
T2  - FACTS VIEWS AND VISION IN OBGYN
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The aims of the present study were to assess bilateral sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping with laparoscopic versus robotic approach, to assess variables affecting bilateral detection rates and to assess survival difference in patients with no/unilateral, compared to bilateral SLN detection.Methods: This is a retrospective, single-centre, observational cohort study, including patients with endometrial cancer FIGO stage IA-IVB, treated with minimally invasive primary surgery and undergoing indocyanine green (ICG) injection to detect SLN, between January 2015 and December 2019.Results: Of the 549 included patients, 286 (52.1%) and 263 (47.9%) underwent the laparoscopic and robotic approach respectively. 387 (70.5%) patients had bilateral SLN mapping, 102 ( 18.6%) and 60 (10.9%) had unilateral and no mapping, respectively. Patients who underwent the robotic approach were older (median 61 versus 64 years, p=0.046) and had a higher BMI (median 26.0 versus 34.8 kg/m(2), p<0.001). No difference in any SLN mapping or in SLN bilateral detection was evident between the laparoscopic or robotic approach (p=0.892 and p=0.507 respectively). Patients with bilateral SLN detection in the entire cohort were younger (p<0.001) and had a better 3-year disease- free survival (DFS) compared to patients with no/unilateral SLN mapping (77.0% versus 66.3%, respectively, p=0.036). No 3-year overall survival (OS) difference was reported (p=0.491).Conclusion: SLN mapping and bilateral SLN detection with ICG in endometrial cancer was not different in the laparoscopic and robotic approach, even though patients undergoing the robotic approach were older and more obese. Bilateral SLN detection was associated with improved 3-year DFS, but not with 3-year OS, compared to no and unilateral SLN detection.

TI  - Classification of Nemoral Forests with Fusion of Multi-Temporal Sentinel-1 and 2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping forest extent and forest cover classification are important for the assessment of forest resources in socio-economic as well as ecological terms. Novel developments in the availability of remotely sensed data, computational resources, and advances in areas of statistical learning have enabled the fusion of multi-sensor data, often yielding superior classification results. Most former studies of nemoral forests fusing multi-sensor and multi-temporal data have been limited in spatial extent and typically to a simple classification of landscapes into major land cover classes. We hypothesize that multi-temporal, multi-sensor data will have a specific strength in the further classification of nemoral forest landscapes owing to the distinct seasonal patterns in the phenology of broadleaves. This study aimed to classify the Danish landscape into forest/non-forest and further into forest types (broadleaved/coniferous) and species groups, using a cloud-based approach based on multi-temporal Sentinel 1 and 2 data and a random forest classifier trained with National Forest Inventory (NFI) data. Mapping of non-forest and forest resulted in producer accuracies of 99% and 90%, respectively. The mapping of forest types (broadleaf and conifer) within the forested area resulted in producer accuracies of 95% for conifer and 96% for broadleaf forest. Tree species groups were classified with producer accuracies ranging 34-74%. Species groups with coniferous species were the least confused, whereas the broadleaf groups, especially Quercus species, had higher error rates. The results are applied in Danish national accounting of greenhouse gas emissions from forests, resource assessment, and assessment of forest biodiversity potentials.

TI  - Post-War Urban Damage Mapping Using InSAR: The Case of Mosul City in Iraq
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban infrastructures have become imperative to human life. Any damage to these infrastructures as a result of detrimental activities would accrue huge economical costs and severe casualties. War in particular is a major anthropogenic calamity with immense collateral effects on the social and economic fabric of human nations. Therefore, damaged buildings assessment plays a prominent role in post-war resettlement and reconstruction of urban infrastructures. The data-analysis process of this assessment is essential to any post-disaster program and can be carried out via different formats. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data and Interferometric SAR (InSAR) techniques help us to establish a reliable and fast monitoring system for detecting post-war damages in urban areas. Along this thread, the present study aims to investigate the feasibility and mode of implementation of Sentinel-1 SAR data and InSAR techniques to estimate post-war damage in war-affected areas as opposed to using commercial high-resolution optical images. The study is presented in the form of a survey to identify urban areas damaged or destroyed by war (Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, ISIL, or ISIS occupation) in the city of Mosul, Iraq, using Sentinel-1 (S1) data over the 2014-2017 period. Small BAseline Subset (SBAS), Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) and coherent-intensity-based analysis were also used to identify war-damaged buildings. Accuracy assessments for the proposed SAR-based mapping approach were conducted by comparing the destruction map to the available post-war destruction map of United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR); previously developed using optical very high-resolution images, drone imagery, and field visits. As the findings suggest, 40% of the entire city, the western sectors, especially the Old City, were affected most by ISIS war. The findings are also indicative of the efficiency of incorporating Sentinel-1 SAR data and InSAR technique to map post-war urban damages in Mosul. The proposed method could be widely used as a tool in damage assessment procedures in any post-war reconstruction programs.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy after Neoadjuvant Treatment for Breast Cancer. The Validation Protocol
T2  - CHIRURGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The identification and biopsy of the sentinel lymph node (SLNB) in breast cancer patients requiring neoadjuvant cytostatic treatment (NAC), with clinically negative lymph nodes fhllowing treatment, may be an effective method of de-escalation of axillary surgery.Materials and methods: This prospective study includes 47 cases of breast cancer stage with NAC treatment and complete axillary clinical and imaging response, surgeries perthrmed Prof. :Dr. Alexandru Trestioreanu Oncological Institute in Bucharest (1013) by the same team. In all the cases, SINB was employed using the radioactive tracer method The SI:NB technique with Tc99 radioactive tracer involves: - injection of the radioactive tracer and preoperative lymphoscintigraphy, - intraoperative identification of the sentinel node/ lymph nodes and their excisional biopsy, - intraoperative histopathological examination, in paraffin blocks, and immunohistochernistry of the lymph node (SIN).Results: SLN was identified in 46 of 47 cases. In 19 cases SLN was positive, and in 2 cases we recorded false negative results. All patients underwent standard axillary lymtihadenectomy (back-up lymphadenectomy). The correlation between the intraoperative and paraffin histopathological examination of SIN with the paraffin and immunohistochemical examination of the rest of the axillary nodes (N-SLN) led to the following results: sensitivity 91% (19/ 21), specificity 100% (25/ 25), positive predictive value 100% (19/ 19), negative predictive value 93% (25/ 27). The accuracy or the method was 96% 01/ 16). SIN invasion was more common in patients with residual tumor > 2 cm (vs T <2 cm) (p = 0.01), positive N -SIN (vs non -invaded N-SLN) = 0.003). N-SLNs were more frequently invaded when there was peritumoral lymphocyte invasion (vs. no invasion) (p = 0.01).Cone/usion:SLNI1 in patients with breast cancer who require NAC, with clinically and imaging negative lymph nodes following treatment, has a high rate of specificity and an acceptable number of false negative results. Node invasion is more common in patients with residual tumors > 2 cm, with lymphovascular invasion or with multicenter/ multifocal disease.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: This study combined ground and satellite observations with the results of HYSPLIT model to identify the origin, transport, and deposition of sand and dust storms (SDSs) affecting Western Iran.Methods: Field-measured dust exposure data were obtained during 2000-2014 to analyze variability of dust concentration and dust intensity at annual, monthly, and daily scales. Remote sensing measurements in this research include the analysis of a total of eight (Level 1B Calibrated Radiances 1 km (MOD021KM)) MODIS tiles selected based on interpreting the results of ground observations to capture the major SDS events occurred between 2000 and 2014.Results: The results, indicating a sharp rise in the number of dusty days from 2008 onwards, were used as a basis to identify the spatial coverage and intensity of SDSs over the central part of the Middle Fast and the study province using a number of eight MODIS images. According to the back trajectory analysis of Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory Model (HYSPLIT), the MODIS-derived SDSs were found to have both national and international sources. The most prevalent and powerful source was likely to initiate from deserts of Syria and Iraq by air masses coming from the Mediterranean Sea and terminate in Western Iran where the Zagros Mountains Chain blocks easterly winds.Conclusion: Despite the evident link between timing of regional SDSs and in situ observations, the contribution of local dust sources in the west of the province should be also investigated to provide insights into the development and spread of SDS events affecting Western Iran, especially Lorestan Province.

TI  - Cities Exacerbate Climate Warming
T2  - URBAN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization is a complex land transformation not explicitly resolved within large-scale climate models. Long-term timeseries of high-resolution satellite data are essential to characterize urbanization within land surface models and to assess its contribution to surface temperature changes. The potential for additional surface warming from urbanization-induced land use change is investigated and decoupled from that due to change in climate over the continental US using a decadal timescale. We show that, aggregated over the US, the summer mean urban-induced surface temperature increased by 0.15 degrees C, with a warming of 0.24 degrees C in cities built in vegetated areas and a cooling of 0.25 degrees C in cities built in non-vegetated arid areas. This temperature change is comparable in magnitude to the 0.13 degrees C/decade global warming trend observed over the last 50 years caused by increased CO2. We also show that the effect of urban-induced change on surface temperature is felt above and beyond that of the CO2 effect. Our results suggest that climate mitigation policies must consider urbanization feedback to put a limit on the worldwide mean temperature increase.

TI  - Here/There/Everywhere: Quantum Models for Decolonizing Canadian State Onto-Epistemology In a Situation of Oppression, Epistemic Relations are Screwed Up. (Medina, 2013)
T2  - FOUNDATIONS OF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In settler-colonial Canada, the state does not receive Indigenous testimony as credible evidence. While the state often accepts Indigenous testimony in formal hearings, the state fundamentally rejects Indigenous evidence as a description of the world as it is, as an onto-epistemology. In other words, the Indigenous worldview formation, while it functions as a knowledge system that knows and predicts life, is not admitted to regulatory discussions about effects of resource extraction projects on life. Particularly in such resource-extraction review hearings, partly for obvious reasons of ecological ethics, there is no space for Indigenous relational-ontology. I theorize that beyond racism, white supremacy, and greed, settler-colonial onto-epistemological structures are structured to systematically eliminate the potential for relational-ontologies. This exclusion is complementary to resource-extractivist and legal positivist procedures and is biased against Indigenous knowledge and knowledge-sharing procedures; it is a crisis of state integrity and is philosophically unsound. In my analysis of Canadian National Energy Board documents, I ferret out some of these structures that de facto discredit Indigenous onto-epistemologies; I propose this fundamental problem of the Canadian settler-colonial state must be recognized and changed if the calls of Canada's Truth and Reconciliation commission are to be met.

TI  - Monitoring <i>Tamarix</i> Changes Using WorldView-2 Satellite Imagery in Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing methods are commonly used to monitor the invasive riparian shrub tamarisk (Tamarix spp.) and its response to the northern tamarisk beetle (D. carinulata), a specialized herbivore introduced as a biocontrol agent to control tamarisk in the Southwest USA in 2001. We use a Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) supervised classification method with WorldView-2 (2 m spatial resolution) multispectral images from May and August of 2019 to map healthy tamarisk, canopy dieback, and defoliated tamarisk over a 48 km segment of the Colorado River in the topographically complex Grand Canyon National Park, where coarse-resolution satellite images are of limited use. The classifications in May and August produced overall accuracies of 80.0% and 83.1%, respectively. Seasonal change detection between May and August 2019 indicated that 47.5% of the healthy tamarisk detected in May 2019 had been defoliated by August 2019 within the WorldView-2 image extent. When compared to a previously published tamarisk map from 2009, derived from multispectral aerial imagery, we found that 29.5% of healthy tamarisk canopy declined between 2009 and 2019. This implies that tamarisk beetle impacts are continuing to accumulate even though land managers have noted the presence of the beetles in this reach of the river for 7 years since 2012.

TI  - National mapping and estimation of forest area by dominant tree species using Sentinel-2 data
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Nation-wide Sentinel-2 mosaics were used with National Forest Inventory (NFI) plot data for modelling and subsequent mapping of spruce-, pine-, and deciduous-dominated forest in Norway at a 16 m x 16 m resolution. The accuracies of the best model ranged between 74% for spruce and 87% for deciduous forest. An overall accuracy of 90% was found on stand level using independent data from more than 42 000 stands. Errors mostly resulting from a forest mask reduced the model accuracies by similar to 10%. The produced map was subsequently used to generate model-assisted (MA) and poststratified (PS) estimates of species-specific forest area. At the national level, efficiencies of the estimates increased by 20% to 50% for MA and up to 90% for PS. Greater minimum numbers of observations constrained the use of PS. For MA estimates of municipalities, efficiencies improved by up to a factor of 8 but were sometimes also less than 1. PS estimates were always equally as or more precise than direct and MA estimates but were applicable in fewer municipalities. The tree species prediction map is part of the Norwegian forest resource map and is used, among others, to improve maps of other variables of interest such as timber volume and biomass.

TI  - Identification of Surface Deformation in InSAR Using Machine Learning
T2  - GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The availability and frequency of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery are rapidly increasing. This surge of data presents new opportunities to constrain surface deformation that spans various spatial and temporal scales. This expansion also introduces common challenges associated with large volumes of data, including best practices for analyzing these data. In recent years, machine learning techniques have been at the forefront of big data challenges, as an efficient methodology for automatically classifying large volumes of data. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), in particular, have achieved strong levels of performance on image classification problems. Here we present SarNet, a CNN developed to detect, locate, and classify the presence of co-seismic-like surface deformation within an interferogram. We trained SarNet using 4 x 10(6) synthetic interferograms, including both wrapped and unwrapped forward modeled co-seismic-like surface deformation with synthetic noise representative of the atmospheric and topographic noise found in interferograms. The results show that SarNet obtains an overall accuracy of 99.74% on a validation data set. We use class activation maps (CAMs) to show that SarNet returns the location of surface deformation within the interferogram. We employ a transfer learning method to translate the accuracy of SarNet trained on synthetic data to real interferograms with manually classified co-seismic surface displacement. We train SarNet on 32 interferograms containing labeled co-seismic surface deformation as well as noise. The results show that, through transfer learning, SarNet obtains an overall accuracy of 85.22% on a real InSAR data set, and that SarNet returns the location of the surface deformation within the interferogram.

TI  - Evaluating remote sensing indices as potential productivity and stand quality indicators for <i>Pinus radiata</i> plantations
T2  - SCIENTIA FORESTALIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of the present research was to evaluate the use of several spectral vegetation indices (SVIs), including NDVI, SAVI, SR and RSR, obtained from Landsat 7 images, as potential predictors of forest productivity of radiata pine stands. We aimed to evaluate relationships between the variations in stand volume and SVIs over time and the effect of early weed control on stand growth response. We evaluated a large-scale silviculture experiment located at the Central Valley of Chile, since its establishment until 12 years of age, where weed control showed to be the major silvicultural response. Forest inventory measurements were made annually and local equations were used to estimate stand volume. Significant and highly significant correlation was found among SVI ' s and stand productivity parameters. The best relationship was found between NDVI and stand cumulative volume (R-adj=0.92, p-value < 0.0001, RMSE= 0.03), but SR and RSR were able to better track productivity and the major weed control effect on stand volume growth over time. SVIs' coefficient of variation estimates were correlated with estimates of stand productivity variability but no significant relationships were established to provide an index of stand quality due to the sensor spatial resolution and plot sizes. SVIs may serve as important tools to monitor forest growth and high-resolution imagery may provide valuable estimates of stand variability for inventory assessment or as a support tool for growth and yield models.

TI  - Measuring the Impact of Natural Hazards with Citizen Science: The Case of Flooded Area Estimation Using Twitter
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Twitter has significant potential as a source of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI), as its content is updated at high frequency, with high availability thanks to dedicated interfaces. However, the diversity of content types and the low average accuracy of geographic information attached to individual tweets remain obstacles in this context. The contributions in this paper relate to the general goal of extracting actionable information regarding the impact of natural hazards on a specific region from social platforms, such as Twitter. Specifically, our contributions describe the construction of a model classifying whether given spatio-temporal coordinates, materialized by raster cells in a remote sensing context, lie in a flooded area. For training, remotely sensed data are used as the target variable, and the input covariates are built on the sole basis of textual and spatial data extracted from a Twitter corpus. Our contributions enable the use of trained models for arbitrary new Twitter corpora collected for the same region, but at different times, allowing for the construction of a flooded area measurement proxy available at a higher temporal frequency. Experimental validation uses true data that were collected during Hurricane Harvey, which caused significant flooding in the Houston urban area between mid-August and mid-September 2017. Our experimental section compares several spatial information extraction methods, as well as various textual representation and aggregation techniques, which were applied to the collected Twitter data. The best configuration yields a F1 score of 0.425, boosted to 0.834 if restricted to the 10% most confident predictions.

TI  - Characteristics of Marjolin's Ulcers in 21st Century: A Retrospective Study, Systematic Review, and Surgical Guideline Recommendation
T2  - JOURNAL OF BURN CARE & RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Marjolin's ulcer is rare and aggressive malignancy. The objective was to conduct a review of Marjolin's ulcer cases to gain a better understanding and its management. A retrospective study of patients with Marjolin's ulcers at our hospital between 2010 and 2019 was conducted. For the systematic review, the electronic database of the National Library of Medicine was searched and articles published between 2000 and 2019 were included. A total of 14 patients were included in the retrospective study. Twelve patients were male. The mean age was 59.71 years. The latency period was 27.78 years. The most common malignancy was squamous cell carcinoma, and 71.43% had developed on the lower extremities. Well-differentiated squamous cell carcinomas occurred in 38.46% of the cases Rates of lymphovascular and perineural invasion were 30.77 and 23.08%, respectively. Results from the literature search yielded 80 case reports (91 cases) and 42 retrospective reviews (1216 cases). Most cases were male and the most common location was lower extremities. The latency period for the acute and chronic periods was 2.75 months and 20.75 years, respectively. The most common malignancy was squamous cell carcinoma (92.27% in the retrospective reviews) and 59.98% of the cases exhibited well-differentiation. Rates of regional lymph node involvement and distant metastases were 10.20 and 12.09%, respectively. Marjolin's ulcer in 21st century is not so rare. The most common is well differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Early flap surgery or skin grafts for chronic ulcers or burn scars are recommended to reduce risk. Guideline for surgical management is established.

TI  - A Modified Bare Soil Index to Identify Bare Land Features during Agricultural Fallow-Period in Southeast Asia Using Landsat 8
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Bare soil is a critical element in the urban landscape and plays an essential role in urban environments. Yet, the separation of bare soil and other land cover types using remote sensing techniques remains a significant challenge. There are several remote sensing-based spectral indices for barren detection, but their effectiveness varies depending on land cover patterns and climate conditions. Within this research, we introduced a modified bare soil index (MBI) using shortwave infrared (SWIR) and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths derived from Landsat 8 (OLI-Operational Land Imager). The proposed bare soil index was tested in two different bare soil patterns in Thailand and Vietnam, where there are large areas of bare soil during the agricultural fallow period, obstructing the separation between bare soil and urban areas. Bare soil extracted from the MBI achieved higher overall accuracy of about 98% and a kappa coefficient over 0.96, compared to bare soil index (BSI), normalized different bare soil index (NDBaI), and dry bare soil index (DBSI). The results also revealed that MBI considerably contributes to the accuracy of land cover classification. We suggest using the MBI for bare soil detection in tropical climatic regions.

TI  - Monitoring long-term annual urban expansion (1986-2017) in the largest archipelago of China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Islands that support numerous biodiversity are subject to increasing anthropogenic disturbance with the ever-growing coastal urbanization especially in developing countries. It is essential to monitor the island urban expansion to support sustainable policy making for ecological conservation and environmental management. However, current methods developed for mainland have limitations in capturing the annual urban expansion from land reclamation on islands. Besides, differences of urban expansion among various island development types remain unclear. This study developed an efficient framework on the Google Earth Engine platform for mapping annual urban dynamics in island regions using long-term time series of Landsat, by integrating coastal dynamic mapping approach, random forest classifier, and time-series change detection method. We implemented the developed framework in Zhoushan Archipelago, the largest archipelago in China that contains different island development types. The mapped urban areas and their conversion sources were reliable with overall accuracies over 90%. The overall accuracy of urbanized years was 86% using the one-year tolerance strategy. The total urban area expanded from 97 +/- 24 km(2) to 438 +/- 34 km(2) during 1986-2017, at the cost of 148 +/- 24 km(2) agricultural land, 138 +/- 14 km(2) water body, 41 +/- 13 km(2) forest and 14 +/- 8 km(2) tidal flat. The urban growth accelerated since 2004 driven by a series of government policies, as well as the growth of the population and socio-economy. Moreover, most urban expansion was concentrated in islands with comprehensive development type (65%), followed by the islands with harbor and logistics (15%), coastal tourism (10%), coastal industry (8%), scientific fishery (1%) and marine science and education (1%). The speed and scale of future urban expansion will play an important role for island sustainability. The proposed framework is transferable in other regions for a better understanding of the long-term island urban dynamics at large scales. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Laboratory-based surveillance of <i>Shigella</i> spp from human clinical cases in Colombia, 1997 to 2018
T2  - BIOMEDICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Shigellosis is endemic in low and middle-income countries, causing approximately 125 million diarrhea episodes annually, leading to around 160.000 deaths. One third of these deaths are associated with children.Objective: describe characteristics and antimicrobial resistance profiles of Shigella species recovered in Colombia from 1997 to 2018.Materials and methods: we obtained isolates from laboratories in twenty-nine Colombian states. Serotyping was performed with specific antiserum and antimicrobial resistance via Kirby-Bauer and minimal inhibitory concentration for ten antibiotics according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute recommendations.Results: In total 5251 isolates of Shigella spp. were studies. Most isolates were obtained from stool 96.4%. Also, 2511(47.8%) were from children under five years of age. Two most frequent species were founded S. sonnei (55.1%) and S. flexneri (41.7%). The highest rate of resistance was found for tetracycline (88.1%), followed by trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT, 79.3%) and ampicillin (65.5%). 50.8% of isolates were resistant to chloramphenicol, 43.6% to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid whilst resistance to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, gentamicin, and ciprofloxacin did not reach 1%. In S. sonnei, the most frequent resistance profile corresponded to SXT (92%), whereas for S. flexneri the most frequent antibiotic profiles were multidrug resistant.Conclusions. In Colombia the population under five years is affected by all Shigella species. These findings should be considered to guide funders and public health officials to make evidence-based decisions for protection and prevention measures. The antimicrobial resistant characteristics found in this study underlie the importance of combating the dissemination of the most frequently isolated species S. sonnei and S. flexneri.

TI  - Evaluation of changes in vegetation cover on Guadalupe Island with vegetation indices
T2  - MADERA Y BOSQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Detection of spatial and temporal changes in vegetation cover are essential for a better understanding of the state and abundance of resources in a region. This study focuses on the evaluation of the changes and the recovery of the vegetation cover of Guadalupe Island, affected by the presence of feral goats, eradicated in 2007. The change analysis was based on the calculation of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), using high-resolution multispectral satellite images of the QuickBird and WorldView-2 satellites, from 2004 and 2013, corresponding to the stage before and after the eradication of goats, respectively. The change in the surface and the rate of change in the coverage of the plant communities were evaluated. According to the results obtained, the cypress, pine and palm forest cover were easily identified, with an increase in biomass for 2013. Similarly, it was found that the grassland doubled its surface coverage, and there was a decrease in bare soil for 2013. However, the NDVI had limitations in determining changes in scrub cover due to the low and medium density of vegetation for both years; therefore, the analysis of SAVI coverage was deepened, with better results and a sustained increase in post-eradication values. The changes indicate a recovery for almost all communities by 2013.

AB  - Site-specific irrigation management for perennial crops such as grape requires water use assessments at high spatiotemporal resolution. In this study, small unmanned-aerial-system (UAS)-based imaging was used with a modified mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration (METRIC) energy balance model to map water use (UASM-ET approach) of a commercial, surface, and direct-root-zone (DRZ) drip-irrigated vineyard. Four irrigation treatments, 100%, 80%, 60%, and 40%, of commercial rate (CR) were also applied, with the CR estimated using soil moisture data and a non-stressed average crop coefficient of 0.5. Fourteen campaigns were conducted in the 2018 and 2019 seasons to collect multispectral (ground sampling distance (GSD): 7 cm/pixel) and thermal imaging (GSD: 13 cm/pixel) data. Six of those campaigns were near Landsat 7/8 satellite overpass of the field site. Weather inputs were obtained from a nearby WSU-AgWeatherNet station (1 km). First, UASM-ET estimates were compared to those derived from soil water balance (SWB) and conventional Landsat-METRIC (LM) approaches. Overall, UASM-ET (2.70 +/- 1.03 mm day(-1) [mean +/- std. dev.]) was higher than SWB-ET (1.80 +/- 0.98 mm day(-1)). However, both estimates had a significant linear correlation (r = 0.64-0.81, p < 0.01). For the days of satellite overpass, UASM-ET was statistically similar to LM-ET, with mean absolute normalized ET departures (ETd,MAN) of 4.30% and a mean r of 0.83 (p < 0.01). The study also extracted spatial canopy transpiration (UASM-T) maps by segmenting the soil background from the UASM-ET, which had strong correlation with the estimates derived by the standard basal crop coefficient approach (T-d,T-MAN = 14%, r = 0.95, p < 0.01). The UASM-T maps were then used to quantify water use differences in the DRZ-irrigated grapevines. Canopy transpiration (T) was statistically significant among the irrigation treatments and was highest for grapevines irrigated at 100% or 80% of the CR, followed by 60% and 40% of the CR (p < 0.01). Reference T fraction (TrF) curves established from the UASM-T maps showed a notable effect of irrigation treatment rates. The total water use of grapevines estimated using interpolated TrF curves was highest for treatments of 100% (425 and 320 mm for the 2018 and 2019 seasons, respectively), followed by 80% (420 and 317 mm), 60% (391 and 318 mm), and 40% (370 and 304 mm) of the CR. Such estimates were within 5% to 11% of the SWB-based water use calculations. The UASM-T-estimated water use was not the same as the actual amount of water applied in the two seasons, probably because DRZ-irrigated vines might have developed deeper or lateral roots to fulfill water requirements outside the irrigated soil volume. Overall, results highlight the usefulness of high-resolution imagery toward site-specific water use management of grapevines.

TI  - Characterizing Bushfire Occurrences over Jamaica Using the MODIS C6 Fire Archive 2001-2019
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - There is an increasing need to develop bushfire monitoring and early warning systems for Jamaica and the Caribbean. However, there are few studies that examine fire variability for the region. In this study the MODIS C6 Fire Archive for 2001-2019 is used to characterize bushfire frequencies across Jamaica and to relate the variability to large-scale climate. Using additive mixed model and backward linear regression, the MODIS represents 80% and 73% of the local Jamaica Fire Brigade (JFB) data variability for 2010-2015, respectively. However, the MODIS values are smaller by a factor of approximately 30. The MODIS climatology over Jamaica reveals a primary peak in March and a secondary maximum in July, coinciding with months of minimum rainfall. A significant positive linear trend is observed for July-August bushfire events over 2001-2019 and represents 29% of the season's variability. Trends in all-island totals in other seasons or annually were not statistically significant. However, positive annual trends in Zone 2 (eastern Jamaica) are statistically significant and may support an indication that a drying trend is evolving over the east. Significant 5-year and 3.5-year periodicities are also evident for April-June and September-November variability, respectively. Southern Jamaica and particularly the parish of Clarendon, known for its climatological dryness, show the greatest fire frequencies. The study provides evidence of linkages between fire occurrences over Jamaica and oceanic and atmospheric variability over the Atlantic and Pacific. For example, all-island totals show relatively strong association with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. The study suggests that development of an early warning system for bushfire frequency that includes climate indices is possible and shows strong potential for fire predictions.

TI  - The Decrease in Lake Numbers and Areas in Central Asia Investigated Using a Landsat-Derived Water Dataset
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although Central Asia has a strong continental climate with a constant moisture deficit and low relative humidity, it is covered by thousands of lakes that are critical to the sustainability of ecosystems and human welfare in the region. Vulnerability to climate change and anthropogenic activities have contributed to dramatic inter-annual and seasonal changes of the lakes. In this study, we explored the high spatio-temporal dynamics of the lakes of Central Asia using the terraPulse (TM) monthly Landsat-derived surface water extent dataset from 2000 to 2015 and the HydroLAKES dataset. The results identified 9493 lakes and significant linear decreasing trends were identified for both the number (rate: -85 lakes/year, R-2: 0.69) and area (rate: -1314.1 km(2)/year, R-2: 0.84) of the lakes in Central Asia between 2000 and 2015. The decrease rate in lake area accounted for 1.41% of the total lake area. About 75% of the investigated lakes (7142 lakes), mainly located in the Kazakh steppe (especially in the north) and the Badghyz and Karabil semi-desert terrestrial ecological zones, experienced a decrease in the water area. Lakes with increasing water area were mainly distributed in the Northern Tibetan Plateau-Kunlun Mountains alpine desert and Qaidam Basin semi-desert zones in the east-south corner of Central Asia. The possible driving factors of lake decreases in Central Asia were explored for the Aral Sea and Tengiz Lake on yearly and monthly time scales. The Aral Sea showed the greatest decrease in the summer months because of increased evaporation and massive irrigation, while the largest decrease for Tengiz Lake was observed in early spring and was linked to decreasing snowmelt.

TI  - A High-precision Water Segmentation Algorithm for SAR Image and its Application
T2  - JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Water segmentation of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is of great significance in land hydrological monitoring, such as lakes and rivers. Water segmentation accuracy is influenced by the blurring of the boundary between land and water region because of the insufficient resolution of SAR image. Sentinel-1A SAR image is used to study the Duoqing Co in the Tibetan Plateau of China. This paper integrates the enhanced deep residual block, channel attention mechanism and sub-pixel convolution, an enhanced channel attention deep residual network is proposed based on sub-pixel to reconstruct the filtered SAR image, extract the water contour and analyze the accuracy. By comparing the reconstruction results of different super-resolution algorithms and the accuracy of water contour extraction, this algorithm, with great robustness, is obviously better than the traditional method in both reconstruction effect and extraction accuracy.

TI  - Developing City-Wide Hurricane Impact Maps using Real-Life Data on Infrastructure, Vegetation and Weather
T2  - TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
M3  - Article
AB  - Hurricanes affect thousands of people annually, with devastating consequences such as loss of life, vegetation and infrastructure. Vegetation losses such as downed trees and infrastructure disruptions such as toppled power lines often lead to roadway closures. These disruptions can be life threatening for the victims. Emergency officials, therefore, have been trying to find ways to alleviate such problems by identifying those locations that pose high risk in the aftermath of hurricanes. This paper proposes an integrated methodology that utilizes both Google Earth Engine (GEE) and geographical information systems (GIS). First, GEE is used to access Sentinel-2 satellite images and calculate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to investigate the vegetation change as a result of Hurricane Michael in the City of Tallahassee. Second, through the use of ArcGIS, data on wind speed, debris, roadway density and demographics are incorporated into the methodology in addition to the NDVI indices to assess the overall impact of the hurricane. As a result, city-wide hurricane impact maps are created using weighted indices created based on all these data sets. Findings indicate that the northeast side of the city was the worst affected because of the hurricane. This is a region where more seniors live, and such disruptions can lead to dramatic consequences because of the fragility of these seniors. Officials can pinpoint the identified critical locations for future improvements such as roadway geometry modification and landscaping justification.

TI  - Effects of Different Spectral Resolutions on Modeling Soil Components
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The laboratory visible-near infrared (VIS-NIR) spectroscopy has been frequently used in quantifying soil components because it is effective, fast and nondestructive etc. The higher spectral resolution is the richer soil information we could obtain. However, hyperspectral data are red undant and should be preprocessed. The study of the effects of different spectral resolutions on the modeling of soil components is relatively inadequate. Taking advantage of the European Land Use/Cover Area Frame Statistical Survey (LUCAS) dataset having 19 036 soil samples, we investigate the effects of different spectral resolutions on modeling soil components: total soil nitrogen (N), organic carbon (OC), calcium carbonate (CaCO3), and clay. To achieve this, we took the partial least squares regression (PLS) method as the evaluation model and randomly chose 30% samples for independent verification. Firstly, the spectral data which have 4 200 bands with 0. 5 nm spectral resolution were resampled to 2, 4, 8, ..., 1 024 nm respectively using average reflection value by of uniform interval sampling. The results are as follows: (1) when the spectral resolution was decreased, the inversion accuracy of soil components showed a downward trend; (2) when the spectral resolution was higher than 64 nm, higher model validation accuracies were obtained for estimating the four selected soil components (R-2>0. 65, RPD>1. 7); (3) the accuracy for CaCO3 and clay components was significantly reduced when the spectral resolution was lower than 128 nm; (4) of the four soil components, CaCO3 was the most sensitive to spectral resolution. It has higher accuracy (R-2>0. 86, RPD>2. 72) at high spectral resolutions, but the accuracy reduced most rapidly as the spectral resolution decreases. Secondly, based on the spectral response functions for a group of common satellite sensors, the inversion performances of using GF2, S3A, L8, Aster, S3OLCI, and Modis spectral bands are summarized as follows: (1) all sensors achieved higher accuracy for soil N and OC even if GF2 has 4 different bands (R-2 = 0. 56; RPD=1. 51); (2) a low accuracy was obtained for CaCO3 and clay; (3) besides the number of spectral bands, the band positions are also important and the sensors (53A, L8, Aster, and MODIS) having bands in the spectral range 1 100 similar to 2 500 nm showed a stronger performance than the sensor (e. g. S3OLCI) without the corresponding bands. The results from this study provide a guiding reference for preprocessing hyperspectral data of soil, selecting suitable satellite data sources and designing new optical sensors for soil Vis-NIR spectroscopy.

TI  - Permanent Co-Seismic Deformation of the 2013 Mw7.7 Baluchistan, Pakistan Earthquake From High-Resolution Surface Strain Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Repeated earthquake cycles produce topography, fault damage zones, and other geologic structures along faults. These geomorphic and structural features indicate the presence of co-seismic permanent (inelastic) surface deformation, yet a long-standing question in earthquake research is how much of the co-seismic deformation field is elastic versus inelastic. These questions arise in part because it is unclear what measurable co-seismic characteristics, such as off-fault or distributed surface deformation and cracking, represent true unrecoverable deformation. One emerging descriptor of permanent co-seismic deformation is surface strain magnitudes inferred from imaging geodesy observations. In this study, we present the surface strain field of the 2013 Mw7.7 Baluchistan strike-slip earthquake in southern Pakistan. We invert co-seismic displacement fields generated from pixel-tracking of SPOT-5 and WorldView optical imagery for co-seismic surface horizontal strain tensors. We observe that co-seismic strain field is dominated by negative dilatation strains, indicating that the co-seismic fault zone contracted during the earthquake. We show that co-seismic inelastic failure exhibits a relatively consistent width along the rupture that is localized to a zone 100-200 m wide on the hanging wall side. The width of co-seismic permanent deformation does not correlate with variations in off-fault deformation or surface geology. Based on comparisons to other recent earthquakes, we posit that the permanent surface strains reflect inelastic deformation of the faults inner damage zone, and that the width of this zone reflects fault maturity.

TI  - Mapping Forest Types in China with 10 m Resolution Based on Spectral-Spatial-Temporal Features
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The comprehensive application of spectral, spatial, and temporal (SST) features derived from remote sensing images is a significant technique for classifying and mapping forest types. Facing limitations in the availability of detailed forest type identification processes for large regions, a forest type classification framework based on SST features was developed in this study. The advantages of Sentinel-2 and Landsat series imagery were used to extract SST forest type classification features, using red-edge bands, a gray-level co-occurrence matrix, and harmonic analysis, with the assistance of the Google Earth Engine platform. Considering four representative Chinese geographic regions-middle and high latitudes, complex mountainous areas, cloudy and rainy areas, and the N-S climate transition zone-our method was proven to be effective, with overall classification accuracies > 85%. The scheme to assess the importance of SST features for forest classification in various regions was designed using the Gini criterion in the random forest algorithm and revealed that spectral features were more effective in classifying forest types with complex compositions. Temporal features were found to be favorable for identifying forest types with obvious evergreen and deciduous growth patterns, while spatial features produced better classification results for forest types with different spatial structures, such as needle- or broad-leaved forests. The findings of this study can provide a reference for feature selection in remote sensing forest type classification processes, and identifying forest types in this way could provide support for the accurate and sustainable management of forest resources.

TI  - The Value of a Decrease in Temperature by One Degree Celsius of the Regional Microclimate-The Cooling Effect of the Paddy Field
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the face of climate change, extreme climates are becoming more frequent. There were severe droughts in Taiwan in 2020, 2014-2015, and 2002. In these years, the paddy fields were kept fallow to save water and transfer agricultural water to non-agricultural use. On the other hand, with global warming, the existence of paddy fields may be one of the natural solutions to regional temperature mitigation. This study used remote sensing to quantify the difference in temperature between paddy fields and urban areas. The result of overall surface temperature deductive analysis revealed that the temperature in the whole Taoyuan research area was 1.2 degrees C higher in 2002 than in 2003 because of fallowing of the paddy field, while in the Hsinchu research area, it was 1.5 degrees C higher in 2002 than in 2003, due to the same reason described above. In terms of the difference in land use, for the Hsinchu research area, the surface temperature deductive result showed that the average paddy field temperature in 2002 was 22.3 degrees C (sample area average), which was 7.7 degrees C lower than that of the building and road point and 4.3 degrees C lower than that of the bare land point. The average paddy field temperature in 2003 was 19.2 degrees C (sample area average), which was 10.1 degrees C lower than that of the building and road point and 8.3 degrees C lower than that of the bare land point. Then this study evaluated the economic valuation of the paddy field cooling effect using the contingent valuation method. Through the paddy field cooling effect and in the face of worsening extreme global climate, the willingness to pay (WTP) of the respondents in Taiwan for a decrease of 1 degrees C with regard to the regional microclimate was evaluated. It was found that people in Taiwan are willing to pay an extra 8.89 USD/per kg rice/year for the paddy for a decrease in temperature by 1 degrees C in the regional microclimate due to the paddy field. Furthermore, this study applied the benefits transfer method to evaluate the value of a decrease of 1 degrees C in the regional microclimate in Taiwan. The value of a decrease of 1 degrees C in the regional microclimate in Taiwan is 9,693,144,279 USD/year. In this regard, the economic value of 1 degrees C must not be underestimated. In conclusion, more caution is needed while making decisions to change the land use of paddy fields to other land uses.

TI  - Sentinel-1 Big Data Processing with P-SBAS InSAR in the Geohazards Exploitation Platform: An Experiment on Coastal Land Subsidence and Landslides in Italy
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The growing volume of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery acquired by satellite constellations creates novel opportunities and opens new challenges for interferometric SAR (InSAR) applications to observe Earth's surface processes and geohazards. In this paper, the Parallel Small BAseline Subset (P-SBAS) advanced InSAR processing chain running on the Geohazards Exploitation Platform (GEP) is trialed to process two unprecedentedly big stacks of Copernicus Sentinel-1 C-band SAR images acquired in 2014-2020 over a coastal study area in southern Italy, including 296 and 283 scenes in ascending and descending mode, respectively. Each stack was processed in the GEP in less than 3 days, from input SAR data retrieval via repositories, up to generation of the output P-SBAS datasets of coherent targets and their displacement histories. Use-cases of long-term monitoring of land subsidence at the Capo Colonna promontory (up -2.3 cm/year vertical and -1.0 cm/year east-west rate), slow-moving landslides and erosion landforms, and deformation at modern coastal protection infrastructure in the city of Crotone are used to: (i) showcase the type and precision of deformation products outputting from P-SBAS processing of big data, and the derivable key information to support value-adding and geological interpretation; and (ii) discuss potential and challenges of big data processing using cloud/grid infrastructure.

TI  - Satellite InSAR survey of structurally-controlled land subsidence due to groundwater exploitation in the Aguascalientes Valley, Mexico
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - To address increasing water demands in expanding cities, many aquifers in Mexico are overexploited and deplete. The resulting land subsidence often combines with ground faulting/fracturing and damage to infrastructure. This study provides the longest Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) survey ever undertaken for the Aguascalientes Valley, aimed to constrain its structurally-controlled subsidence process and the induced risk. 275 ERS-1/2 1996-2002, ENVISAT 2003-2010 and Sentinel-1 2014-2020 C-band SAR images are processed with change detection, differential Interferometric SAR (InSAR) and Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) methods. Aguascalientes notably expanded over the last four decades, as revealed by Seasat 1978 L-band SAR, Landsat 1985-2010 and Sentinel-2 2020 optical imagery. The observed subsidence pattern involves alluvial/fluvial deposits within the N-S trending graben. Maximum settlement rates are -14 cm/year in 1996, -10 cm/year in 2000-2010 and over -12 cm/year in 2015-2020. An acceleration (-0.70 cm/year(2)) is recorded in 2015-2020 close to recently developed industrial plants and housing districts. Satellite estimates agree with in-situ observations, static GPS surveying and continuous GPS monitoring data. Rough correlation is found with piezometric level drop rates, whereas aquifer thickness plays a stronger role in the subsidence process. While these outcomes align with the existing literature, this InSAR survey: (i) unveils previously unknown E-W deformation affecting two N-S oriented bands within the valley, with up to similar to +/- 3 cm/year in 2015-2020 towards its center; (ii) identifies zones of sagging and hogging with horizontal strain (epsilon) of up to 0.05-0.1%; (iii) retrieves differential rates reaching 6-8 cm/year and angular distortions (beta) of 1/500 along the Oriente fault; and (iv) investigates the statistical distribution of, beta across field surveyed faults and fissures, and marks areas with potentially yetunmapped ground discontinuities. A new surface faulting risk matrix embedding beta and epsilon is therefore proposed to estimate subsidence impact on properties and population. Given its scale-dependency, the risk assessment provides a lower bound to the percentage of urban areas at risk within the Aguascalientes state: at least 2% of the urban areas were at high and very high risk in 2003-2010 (involving similar to 12,000 properties and similar to 39,000 inhabitants), but this increased to 6% in 2015-2020 (similar to 25,600 properties, similar to 85,200 inhabitants). The evidence of a subsidence process evolving spatially and temporally highlights the need for continuous updating of hazard information.

TI  - The Role of Remote Sensing Data in Habitat Suitability and Connectivity Modeling: Insights from the Cantabrian Brown Bear
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological modeling requires sufficient spatial resolution and a careful selection of environmental variables to achieve good predictive performance. Although national and international administrations offer fine-scale environmental data, they usually have limited spatial coverage (country or continent). Alternatively, optical and radar satellite imagery is available with high resolutions, global coverage and frequent revisit intervals. Here, we compared the performance of ecological models trained with free satellite data with models fitted using regionally restricted spatial datasets. We developed brown bear habitat suitability and connectivity models from three datasets with different spatial coverage and accessibility. These datasets comprised (1) a Sentinel-1 and 2 land cover map (global coverage); (2) pan-European vegetation and land cover layers (continental coverage); and (3) LiDAR data and the Forest Map of Spain (national coverage). Results show that Sentinel imagery and pan-European datasets are powerful sources to estimate vegetation variables for habitat and connectivity modeling. However, Sentinel data could be limited for understanding precise habitat-species associations if the derived discrete variables do not distinguish a wide range of vegetation types. Therefore, more effort should be taken to improving the thematic resolution of satellite-derived vegetation variables. Our findings support the application of ecological modeling worldwide and can help select spatial datasets according to their coverage and resolution for habitat suitability and connectivity modeling.

TI  - Antibody Titers and Seroconversion Kinetics of Outbred Swiss and Heterozygous Nude Soiled-bedding Sentinels for Murine Norovirus and Mouse Hepatitis Virus
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR LABORATORY ANIMAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel animals remain a common means of evaluating rodent health in research colonies. An evaluation of our sentinel program revealed that using Crl:CD1(ICR)-Elite (CD1-E) mice was expensive, occasionally disrupted by limited supply, and minimally responsive to the 3Rs. This evaluation prompted us to explore the use of CRL:NU-Foxn1(nu/+) (Het-nude) mice as soiled-bedding sentinel (SBS) animals. Het-nude mice are a byproduct of breeding outbred athymic nude mice and are reared in isolators, with similar health status as CD1-E. Het-nude mice have a thymus, but may have smaller thymic size and fewer bone marrow stem cells than do wildtype controls, suggesting that Het-nude mice might not be immunologically normal. This study compared the antibody titer and seroconversion kinetics of Het-nude and CD1-E SBS to murine norovirus (MNV) and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). Het-nude and CD1-E female SBS (n = 22 mice of each stock) were housed continuously on soiled bedding collected from MNV-positive or MNV- and MHV-positive colonies at cage changes. Blood was collected for serology at 3, 9 and 12 to 19 wk after the start of soiled bedding exposure. Antibody titers to MNV or MHV did not differ significantly between Het-nude and CD1-E mice. A significant relationship was found between weeks of exposure and titer levels with an increase in titer over the testing period. This study supports the possible use of Het-nude mice as SBS, given that their antibody responses to MNV and MHV are equivalent to those of CD1-E mice.

TI  - Bright Singularities: Polarimetric Calibration of Spaceborne PolSAR Systems
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this letter, we present a new algorithm for the polarimetric calibration of spaceborne imaging radar systems. The technique combines two features: first, a new method for estimation of distortion matrices without the need for assumptions of small coupling or reciprocity; and second, it employs a factorized polar decomposition, which allows separate estimation of Faraday rotation from system distortion matrices in low-frequency spaceborne systems. We highlight a source of residual error in the procedure called hidden rotators, but show how to mitigate such errors to obtain fully calibrated data for arbitrary Faraday rotation. We illustrate using simulated data from the L-band ALOS-2 satellite.

TI  - Experimental Evaluation of Solar Radiation and Solar Efficacy Models and Performance of Data-Driven Models
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Weather data are major input for building energy usage predictions. However, solar-radiation-related historical and real-time weather data are unavailable or incomplete in many locations. Therefore, many models, which use more available weather parameters to predict solar radiation's components, were developed in the last 30 years. An experimental evaluation of these models is needed since measurement devices and satellite techniques are improved, and weather files are consequently updated. In this study, we review, calibrate, and validate the accuracy of global and diffuse irradiation prediction models and efficacy models using experimental data over an 18-month data collection period in Taipei, Taiwan, and Kingsville, Texas. The evaluation also covers data-driven models such as neural networks. The results show that the SUNY model provides good solar irradiance estimations; Perez and Muneer efficacy models provide good daylight illuminance estimations; and Erbs, Muneer, Reindl, and Perez models have similar accuracy but different error trends when separating direct and diffuse irradiance. The results can be used as a guideline when filling in solar-radiation-related fields. (C) 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

TI  - Optimizing Irrigation Water Use Efficiency for Tomato and Maize Fields across Italy Combining Remote Sensing Data and the AquaCrop Model
T2  - HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data of canopy cover and leaf area index are used together with the AquaCrop model to optimize irrigation water use efficiency for tomato and maize fields across Italy, which differ in climate, soil types and irrigation technique. An optimization irrigation strategy, "SIM strategy", is developed based on crop stress thresholds and then applied to all the analyzed fields in different crop seasons, evaluating the effect not only on irrigation volume and number of irrigations but also on crop yield and canopy cover, and on the drainage flux which represents the main water loss. Irrigation volume reduction is found to be between 200 and 1000 mm, mainly depending on the different soil types within the climate, irrigation technique and crop type. This is directly related to the drainage flux reduction which is of a similar entity. The SIM strategy efficiency has then been quantified by different indicators, such as the irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) which is higher than with the observed irrigations (around 35% for tomato fields in Southern Italy, between 30 and 80% for maize in Northern Italy), and the percolation deficit and irrigation efficiency. The AquaCrop model has been previously calibrated against canopy cover and leaf area index (LAI) data, producing errors between 0.7 and 5%, while absolute mean errors (MAE) between 0.015 and 0.04 are obtained for soil moisture (SM). The validation of the AquaCrop model has been performed against evapotranspiration (ET) ground-measured data and crop yields producing MAE values ranging from 0.3 to 0.9 mm/day, and 0.9 ton/ha for maize and 10 ton/ha for tomatoes, respectively.

TI  - A Sensitivity Analysis on the Spectral Signatures of Low-Backscattering Sea Areas in Sentinel-1 SAR Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a unique tool to collect measurements over sea surface but the physical interpretation of such data is not always straightforward. Among the different sea targets of interest, low-backscattering areas are often associated to marine oil pollution even if several physical phenomena may also result in low-backscattering patches at sea. In this study, the effects of low-backscattering areas of anthropogenic and natural origin on the azimuth autocorrelation function (AACF) are analyzed using VV-polarized SAR measurements. Two objective metrics are introduced to quantify the deviation of the AACF evaluated over low-backscattering areas with reference to slick-free sea surface. Experiments, undertaken on six Sentinel-1 SAR scenes, collected in Interferometric Wide Swath VV+VH imaging mode over large low-backscattering areas of different origin under low-to-moderate wind conditions (speed <= 7 m/s), spanning a wide range of incidence angles (from about 30 degrees up to 46 degrees), demonstrated that the AACF evaluated within low-backscattering sea areas remarkably deviates from the slick-free sea surface one and the largest deviation is observed over oil slicks.

TI  - Meteorological Drivers of Permian Basin Methane Anomalies Derived from TROPOMI
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The launch of the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on the Sentinel-5 Precursor (S-5P) satellite has revolutionized pollution observations from space. The purpose of this study was to link spatiotemporal variations in TROPOMI methane (CH4) columns to meteorological flow patterns over the Permian Basin, the largest oil and second-largest natural gas producing region in the United States. Over a two-year period (1 December 2018-1 December 2020), the largest average CH4 enhancements were observed near and to the north and west of the primary emission regions. Four case study periods-two with moderate westerly winds associated with passing weather disturbances (8-15 March 2019 and 1 April-10 May 2019) and two other periods dominated by high pressure and low wind speeds (16-23 March 2019 and 24 September-9 October 2020)-were analyzed to better understand meteorological drivers of the variability in CH4. Meteorological observations and analyses combined with TROPOMI observations suggest that weakened transport out of the Basin during low wind speed periods contributes to CH4 enhancements throughout the Basin, while valley and slope flows may explain the observed western expansion of the Permian Basin CH4 anomaly.

TI  - Land use and its effect on runoff modeled with SWAT
T2  - TECNOLOGIA Y CIENCIAS DEL AGUA
M3  - Article
AB  - The importance of simulation models for the monitoring of natural resources is increasing. The objective of this study was to apply the SWAT model (Soil Water Assessment Tool) to evaluate the impact of land use change on runoff and sediments in the Chapingo River basin from 1999 to 2015. Two land use maps were generated through the photointerpretation of Landsat and RapidEye images with resolutions of 15 and 5 m, respectively and field trips for verification. In the absence of reliable and recent runoff data, the monthly records for the periods 1964-1970 and 1971-1975 were used for the calibration and validation of the model. In this process the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients were 0.58 and 0.52, respectively. The land use of the basin in the study period changed: agriculture (-6.9 %); urban area (+ 2.89 %); mining area (+5.04 %), and pasture (+7.75 %). The application of SWAT calibrated and validated only for runoff for the period 1999-2015 did not detect changes in runoff (p = 0.2351) and sediments (p = 0.4430) depending on the change in land use determined. The correlation between runoff and annual sediments simulated with SWAT was significant (p = 0.0116) with a low R-2 (0.36), attributable to the lack of sediment field data to calibrate and validate the SWAT, in addition to the presence of soil and water conservation practices in the basin studied.

TI  - Retrieving Forest Canopy Elements Clumping Index Using ICESat GLAS Lidar Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Clumping index (CI) is a canopy structural variable important for modeling the terrestrial biosphere, but its retrieval from remote sensing data remains one of the least reliable. The majority of regional or global CI products available so far were generated from multiangle optical reflectance data. However, these reflectance-based estimates have well-known limitations, such as the mere use of a linear relationship between the normalized difference hotspot and darkspot (NDHD) and CI, uncertainties in bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) models used to calculate the NDHD, and coarse spatial resolutions (e.g., hundreds of meters to several kilometers). To remedy these limitations and develop alternative methods for large-scale CI mapping, here we explored the use of spaceborne lidar-the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS)-and proposed a semi-physical algorithm to estimate CI at the footprint level. Our algorithm was formulated to leverage the full vertical canopy profile information of the GLAS full-waveform data; it converted raw waveforms to forest canopy gap distributions and gap fractions of random canopies, which was used to estimate CI based on the radiative transfer theory and a revised Beer-Lambert model. We tested our algorithm over two areas in China-the Saihanba National Forest Park and Heilongjiang Province-and assessed its relative accuracies against field-measured CI and MODIS CI products. We found that reliable estimation of CI was possible only for GLAS waveforms with high signal-to-noise ratios (e.g., >65) and at gentle slopes (e.g., <12 degrees). Our GLAS-based CI estimates for high-quality waveforms compared well to field-based CI (i.e., R-2 = 0.72, RMSE = 0.07, and bias = 0.02), but they showed less correlation to MODIS CI (e.g., R-2 = 0.26, RMSE = 0.12, and bias = 0.04). The difference highlights the impact of the scale effect in conducting comparisons of products with huge differences resolution. Overall, our analyses represent the first attempt to use spaceborne lidar to retrieve high-resolution forest CI and our algorithm holds promise for mapping CI globally.

TI  - PolSAR Ship Detection Based on Polarimetric Correlation Pattern
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - For polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data, the correlation of two polarization channels is sensitive to the target orientation relative to the sensor's illumination direction. In this letter, the concept of polarimetric correlation pattern is proposed to explore this scattering diversity. The core idea is to extend the polarimetric correlation from a fixed angle to the rotation domain along the radar line of sight. A set of new polarimetric features are derived, and three features with high target-to-clutter ratio (TCR) are selected for PolSAR ship detection. The proposed ship detection method mainly contains three steps: the features selection, thresholding procedure, and morphological filtering. Experimental studies with Radarsat-2 and GaoFen-3 data validate the advantage of the proposed approach, especially for inshore dense ship discrimination.

TI  - GECORIS: An Open-Source Toolbox for Analyzing Time Series of Corner Reflectors in InSAR Geodesy
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Artificial radar reflectors, such as corner reflectors or transponders, are commonly used for radiometric and geometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensor calibration, SAR interferometry (InSAR) applications over areas with few natural coherent scatterers, and InSAR datum connection and geodetic integration. Despite the current abundance of regular SAR time series, no free and open-source software (FOSS) dedicated to analyzing SAR time series of artificial radar reflectors exists. In this paper, we present a FOSS Python toolbox for efficient and automatic estimation of: (i) the clutter level of a particular site before a corner reflector installation, (ii) the Radar Cross Section (RCS) to track a corner reflector's performance and detect outliers, for example, due to damage or debris accumulation, (iii) the Signal-to-Clutter Ratio (SCR) to predict the positioning precision and the InSAR phase variance, (iv) the InSAR displacement time series of a corner reflector network. We use the toolbox to analyze Sentinel-1 SAR time series of the network of 23 corner reflectors for InSAR monitoring of landslides in Slovakia.

TI  - An Application of Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) Technique for Infrastructure Monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the absence of systematic structural monitoring to support adequate maintenance standards, many existing infrastructures may reach unacceptable quality levels during their life cycle, resulting in significant damage and even potential failure. The metropolitan area of the Gulf of Salerno (Italy), served by a complex multimodal transport network connecting the port area to the roads and railways surrounding the urban area, represents an important industrial and commercial hub at the local and international scale. This particular scenario, developed in a complex morphological and geological context, has led to the interference and overlapping of the transport network (highway, railway, main and secondary roads) that run through the piedmont area north of the port. Given the relevance of the area, our research aims to highlight the capabilities of the persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) technique, belonging to the group of differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SAR), to extract space-temporal series of displacements on ground points or artifacts with millimeter accuracy useful to understand ongoing deformation processes. By using archived data from the European Space Agency missions, i.e., ERS1/2 (European remote-sensing satellite) and ENVISAT (environmental satellite), and the most recent data from COSMO-SkyMed constellations, it was possible to collect a 28-year dataset that was used to spatially analyze displacement patterns at a site-specific scale to check the stability of viaducts and embankments, and on a larger scale to understand the activity of the surrounding slopes. Despite the different resolution and subsequently the ground density, the analysis of the different datasets showed a spatiotemporal consistency in the displacement patterns that concerned two subareas showing significant annual velocity trends, one northeast of the city and the second in the port area. The analysis presented in this paper highlights how a complex geologic area, combining slope movements and various fault systems, could be a major concern for the stability of the overlying infrastructure and also the role that a PSI analysis can play in remotely monitoring their behavior over long periods of time.

TI  - Bipartite Network of Interest (BNOI): Extending Co-Word Network with Interest of Researchers Using Sensor Data and Corresponding Applications as an Example
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional co-word networks do not discriminate keywords of researcher interest from general keywords. Co-word networks are therefore often too general to provide knowledge if interest to domain experts. Inspired by the recent work that uses an automatic method to identify the questions of interest to researchers like "problems" and "solutions", we try to answer a similar question "what sensors can be used for what kind of applications", which is great interest in sensor- related fields. By generalizing the specific questions as "questions of interest", we built a knowledge network considering researcher interest, called bipartite network of interest (BNOI). Different from a co-word approaches using accurate keywords from a list, BNOI uses classification models to find possible entities of interest. A total of nine feature extraction methods including N-grams, Word2Vec, BERT, etc. were used to extract features to train the classification models, including naive Bayes (NB), support vector machines (SVM) and logistic regression (LR). In addition, a multi-feature fusion strategy and a voting principle (VP) method are applied to assemble the capability of the features and the classification models. Using the abstract text data of 350 remote sensing articles, features are extracted and the models trained. The experiment results show that after removing the biased words and using the ten-fold cross-validation method, the F-measure of "sensors" and "applications" are 93.2% and 85.5%, respectively. It is thus demonstrated that researcher questions of interest can be better answered by the constructed BNOI based on classification results, comparedwith the traditional co-word network approach.

TI  - Post-Earthquake Fold Growth Imaged in the Qaidam Basin, China, With Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Questions regarding the development of folds and their interactions with the seismic faults within thrust systems remain unanswered. However, estimating fault slip and earthquake hazards using surface observations and kinematic models of folding requires an understanding of how the shortening is accommodated during the different phases of the earthquake cycle. Here, we construct 16-years of interferometric synthetic aperture radar time series across the North Qaidam thrust system (NE Tibet), where three Mw 6.3 earthquakes occurred along basement faults underlying shortened folded sediments. The analysis reveals spatio-temporal changes of post-earthquake surface displacement rates and patterns, which continue more than 10 years after the seismic events. The decomposition of the Sentinel-1 ascending and descending line of sight velocities into vertical and shortening post-earthquake components indicates that long-term transient uplift and shortening is in agreement with the deformation that might be expected from kinematic models of folding. Long-term uplift coincides spatially with young anticlines observed in the geomorphology, with steep gradients in the forelimbs, gentle gradients in the back-limbs, an absence of subsidence in the footwalls, and higher gradients along interpreted bedding planes. Long-term shortening is also different from the surface displacements expected for typical time-varying creep on a narrow dislocation interface and shows rates higher than the average convergence across the whole region. These findings provide evidence for anelastic fold buckling during the post-earthquake phase and highlight the contribution of distributed aseismic deformation to the growth of topography.

TI  - Farming Resilience: From Maintaining States towards Shaping Transformative Change Processes
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Resilience is a concept that focuses on change: it includes the ability of a system to maintain its current state despite disturbances, its ability to adapt, and to transform. While resilience covers both stability and change, conceptual developments and empirical studies have put more emphasis on identifying what enables a farm to cope with the impact of a shock, such as a shift in markets or an extreme weather event, while remaining essentially unchanged. Much less emphasis has been put on what enables a farm to shape change, especially transformative change. I argue that this bias is partly due to the ecological roots of the concept, and partly to the use of conventional methods and their underlying substantialist worldview. A process-relational approach might be better suited to capture change. This approach shifts the conceptualization of a 'farm' as a stable material structure, to 'farming' as an open process of becoming, composed of heterogenous relations that are continuously made and remade. By exploring the differences between these two approaches to farm/farming resilience, I show how a process-relational approach displaces the presumption of structural determination and thus allows to highlight the ever-present openings for change.

TI  - Automated Mapping for Long-Term Analysis of Shifting Cultivation in Northeast India
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessment of the spatio-temporal dynamics of shifting cultivation is important to understand the opportunities for land restoration. The past studies on shifting cultivation mapping of North-East (NE) India lack systematic assessment techniques. We have developed a decision tree-based multi-step threshold (DTMT) method for consistent and long-term mapping of shifting cultivation using Landsat data from 1975 to 2018. Widely used vegetation indices such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) and its relative difference NBR (RdNBR) were integrated with the suitable thresholds in the classification, which yielded overall accuracy above 85%. A significant decrease in total shifting cultivation area was observed with an overall reduction of 75% from 1975-1976 to 2017-2018. The methodology presented in this study is reproducible with minimal inputs and can be useful to map similar changes by optimizing the index threshold values to accommodate relative differences for other landscapes. Furthermore, the crop-suitability maps generated by incorporating climate and soil factors prioritizes suitable land use of shifting cultivation plots. The Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform was employed for automatic mapping of the shifting cultivation areas at desired time intervals for facilitating seamless dissemination of the map products. Besides the novel DTMT method, the shifting cultivation and crop-suitability maps generated in this study, can aid in sustainable land management.

TI  - Radiation recall dermatitis with abemaciclib developing a year after radiotherapy
T2  - CURRENT PROBLEMS IN CANCER: CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Importance: Cyclin-dependent kinases 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors had been recently introduced in clinical practice approved for use in hormone receptor (HR) positive/ human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer. We report the first incidence of radiation recall reaction with the use of abemaciclib. Observations: A 46-year old woman was diagnosed with oligometastatic HR + /HER2-breast cancer (L1 vertebra and right 8th rib). Following mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy, she started letrozole with ovarian suppression. She received loco-regional radiotherapy (RT) to the chest wall and regional lymph nodes to a dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions using a four-field technique. She was treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) to L1 and rib lesion to a dose of 28 Gy and 24 Gy in 2 fractions, respectively. She had developed grade 2 radiation dermatitis during RT. Subsequently, she was started on palbociclib, which was later switched to abemaciclib 100 mg twice daily due to neutropenia. Three months after switching (14 months after RT), she developed erythema and hyperpigmentation over areas of prior radiation dermatitis. The reaction was grade 2 radiation recall dermatitis (RRD) over the upper back and grade 1 reaction involving axilla, chest wall, and other sites receiving SBRT. The reactions stabilized over the next 3 months with some improvement with the use of emollients and topical steroids. Conclusion and Relevance: This is the first incidence of RRD with the use of a CDK4/6 inhibitor upon switching to abemaciclib (receiving reduced dose) from palbociclib. The RRD possibly had a dose-dependent effect with grade 2 reactions developing over areas receiving higher skin dose.

TI  - Covariate Model of Pixel Vector Intensities of Invasive <i>H. sosnowskyi</i> Plants
T2  - JOURNAL OF IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article describes an agricultural application of remote sensing methods. The idea is to aid in eradicating an invasive plant called Sosnowskyi borscht (H. sosnowskyi). These plants contain strong allergens and can induce burning skin pain, and may displace native plant species by overshadowing them, meaning that even solitary individuals must be controlled or destroyed in order to prevent damage to unused rural land and other neighbouring land of various types (mostly violated forest or housing areas). We describe several methods for detecting H. sosnowskyi plants from Sentinel-2A images, and verify our results. The workflow is based on recently improved technologies, which are used to pinpoint exact locations (small areas) of plants, allowing them to be found more efficiently than by visual inspection on foot or by car. The results are in the form of images that can be classified by several methods, and estimates of the cross-covariance or single-vector auto-covariance functions of the contaminant parameters are calculated from random functions composed of plant pixel vector data arrays. The correlation of the pixel vectors for H. sosnowskyi images depends on the density of the chlorophyll content in the plants. Estimates of the covariance functions were computed by varying the quantisation interval on a certain time scale and using a computer programme based on MATLAB. The correlation between the pixels of the H. sosnowskyi plants and other plants was found, possibly because their structures have sufficiently unique spectral signatures (pixel values) in raster images. H. sosnowskyi can be identified and confirmed using a combination of two classification methods (using supervised and unsupervised approaches). The reliability of this combined method was verified by applying the theory of covariance function, and the results showed that H. sosnowskyi plants had a higher correlation coefficient. This can be used to improve the results in order to get rid of plants in particular areas. Further experiments will be carried out to confirm these results based on in situ fieldwork, and to calculate the efficiency of our method.

TI  - Residual lymph node tumour burden following removal of a single axillary sentinel lymph with macrometastatic disease in women with screen-detected invasive breast cancer
T2  - BJS OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Women with screen-detected invasive breast cancer who have macrometastatic disease on axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) are usually offered either surgical axillary node clearance (ANC) or axillary radiotherapy. These treatments can lead to significant complications for patients. The aim of this study was to identify a group of patients who may not require completion ANC.Methods: Data from the NHS Breast Screening Programme between 1 April 2012 and 31 March 2017 were interrogated to identify women with invasive breast carcinoma and a single sentinel lymph node (SLN) with macrometastatic disease who subsequently proceeded to completion ANC. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to identify patients with a single positive SLN who had no further lymph node metastasis on ANC.Results: Of the 2401 women included in the cohort, the presence of non-sentinel node disease was significantly affected by: the number of nodes obtained at SLNB (odds ratio (OR) 0.49 for retrieval of more than 1 node), invasive size of tumour (OR 1.63 for size greater than 20 mm), surgical treatment (OR 1.34 for mastectomy), human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) 2 status (OR 0.71 for HER2 positivity), and patient age (OR 1.10 for age less than 50 years; OR 1.46 for age greater than 70 years). Patients aged less than 70 years, with tumour size smaller than 2 cm, more than one node retrieved on SLNB, and who had breast-conserving surgery had a lower chance of positive non-sentinel nodes on completion ANC compared with other patients.Conclusion: This study, of a purely screen-detected breast cancer cohort, identified a subset of patients who may be spared completion ANC in the event of a single axillary SLN with macrometastasis.

M3  - Article
AB  - Teacher education research has incipiently contemplated the relationship between students and advisors, especially regarding advising didactic planning. Likewise, Brazilian law does not specify the advisor's role(s) in different levels of education. In this essay, we reflect on the advising process(es) through historical and hypothetical cases, inspired by real situations, to encourage discussions about this theme. Based on these cases, we highlight advising elements and attitudes, such as inheritance of intellectual capital, influence on the worldview, and ideological divergences. The mentors' experiences influence the advising process(es) more than the educational aspects.

TI  - Sentinel-1 Polarimetry to Map Apple Orchard Damage after a Storm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change increases extreme whether events such as floods, hailstorms, or storms, which can affect agriculture, causing damages and economic loss within the agro-food sector. Optical remote sensing data have been successfully used in damage detections. Cloud conditions limit their potential, especially while monitoring floods or storms that are usually related to cloudy situations. Conversely, data from the Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) are operational in all-weather conditions and are sensitive to the geometrical properties of crops. Apple orchards play a key role in the Italian agriculture sector, presenting a cultivation system that is very sensitive to high-wind events. In this work, the H-alpha-A polarimetric decomposition technique was adopted to map damaged apple orchards with reference to a stormy event that had occurred in the study area (NW Italy) on 12 August 2020. The results showed that damaged orchards have higher H (entropy) and alpha (alpha angle) values compared with undamaged ones taken as reference (Mann-Whitney one-tailed test U = 14,514, p < 0.001; U = 16604, p < 0.001 for H and alpha, respectively). By contrast, A (anisotropy) values were significantly lower for damaged orchards (Mann-Whitney one-tailed test U = 8616, p < 0.001). Based on this evidence, the authors generated a map of potentially storm-damaged orchards, assigning a probability value to each of them. This map is intended to support local funding restoration policies by insurance companies and local administrations.

TI  - Combining Remote Sensing and Crop Models to Assess the Sustainability of Stakeholder-Driven Groundwater Management in the US High Plains Aquifer
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Nonrenewable groundwater contributes similar to 20% of global irrigation water. As a result, key agricultural regions around the world are on unsustainable trajectories due to aquifer depletion, threatening food production and local economies. With increasing resource scarcity in the central High Plains Aquifer in the United States, an innovative stakeholder-driven groundwater management framework emerged in Kansas referred to as the Local Enhanced Management Area (LEMA) program. This framework enables groups of irrigators to join together to implement measures to conserve groundwater. Here, we assessed the efficacy of the first LEMA to move the region toward sustainability with a process-based crop model driven by well records and satellite-derived annual land use. We found increased irrigation efficiency under the LEMA program reduced groundwater extraction by 25% (40 million m(3)). However, only 22% of pumping reductions benefitted the net water balance (9 million m(3)) due to decreased irrigation return flow resulting from increased irrigation efficiency. We then estimated economic impacts using simulated crop yields, commodity prices, and estimated energy saved from reduced groundwater pumping. Cost savings from reduced pumping were about 4.5 times greater than the income lost from minor yield penalties. This suggests that the program promotes both economic and water sustainability, but water targets may need to be more strict to stabilize groundwater levels. As aquifer depletion threatens crop production in many parts of the world, approaches that integrate dynamic process-based models with in situ and satellite data can inform economically and hydrologically sustainable management strategies. Our work highlights the need to consider both economic factors and root zone processes when evaluating irrigation conservation programs.

TI  - A Technical Study on UAV Characteristics for Precision Agriculture Applications and Associated Practical Challenges
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - The incorporation of advanced technologies into Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) platforms have enabled many practical applications in Precision Agriculture (PA) over the past decade. These PA tools offer capabilities that increase agricultural productivity and inputs' efficiency and minimize operational costs simultaneously. However, these platforms also have some constraints that limit the application of UAVs in agricultural operations. The constraints include limitations in providing imagery of adequate spatial and temporal resolutions, dependency on weather conditions, and geometric and radiometric correction requirements. In this paper, a practical guide on technical characterizations of common types of UAVs used in PA is presented. This paper helps select the most suitable UAVs and on-board sensors for different agricultural operations by considering all the possible constraints. Over a hundred research studies were reviewed on UAVs applications in PA and practical challenges in monitoring and mapping field crops. We concluded by providing suggestions and future directions to overcome challenges in optimizing operational proficiency.

TI  - Why Are Rates of Reported Chlamydia Changing in the United States? Insights From the National Job Training Program
T2  - SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundIn 2010 to 2017, rates of reported chlamydia decreased among young Black women but increased for White women and all men. Because chlamydia case rates can be influenced by changes in prevalence, screening, and other factors, we compared chlamydia prevalence trends in a sentinel population with national case rate trends to understand potential drivers of case rate trends. MethodsChlamydia prevalence was calculated annually among 16- to 24-year-old entrants to the National Job Training Program (NJTP) in 2010 to 2017. An expectation-maximization-based maximum likelihood approach was used to adjust for misclassification due to imperfect test sensitivity and specificity. Models were stratified by sex, age, and race/ethnicity. A statistically significant trend in prevalence was defined as nonoverlapping 95% confidence intervals comparing 2010 and 2017. Trends in chlamydia prevalence were compared with trends in case rates using percentage change over time; relative changes >= 10% were considered meaningful. ResultsAmong NJTP entrants in 2010 to 2017, chlamydia prevalence was stable for all Black women, whereas case rates decreased for adolescents (-12%) and were stable for 20- to 24-year-olds (-4%). Among adolescent White women, prevalence was stable, whereas case rates increased (+30%). For White women aged 20 to 24 years, prevalence increased +62% and case rates increased +43%. Trends in prevalence differed from trends in case rates for all subgroups of men. ConclusionsPrevalence trends in this sentinel population differed from national case rate trends for Black women, White women, and men, suggesting potential decreased screening among Black women aged 16 to 19 years, increased prevalence among White women aged 20 to 24 years, and increased screening among men.

TI  - Evolution of the representation of global vegetation by vegetation continuous fields
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Two decades of global annual fractional vegetation cover products have been derived using daily surface reflectance and land surface temperature data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument aboard NASA's Terra satellite. These MODIS Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF) products are unique and a distinct advance over discrete (ordinal) land cover characterizations. VCF consists of three continuous fractional cover layers at 250 m resolution summing to 100%: tree cover, non-tree vegetation and non-vegetated surface plus surface water. This paper describes the fully-automated machine learning algorithm used to create MODIS VCF and details recent algorithm improvements. Comparisons of the latest VCF products in the MOD44B collection 6, with field-based fractional tree cover and other remote sensing fractional cover products demonstrate improved agreement: the mot mean square (RMS) deviations range from 9 to 23%. A comparison of MODIS canopy cover values with those from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) gives an R-2 value of 0.53. Automation of the algorithm provides flexibility for readily porting the method to derive fractional cover products from additional instruments with similar radiometric characteristics such as the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer (VIIRS) payload aboard Suomi NPP and JPSS platforms, and successors.

TI  - Displacement history and potential triggering factors of Baige landslides, China revealed by optical imagery time series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, on the basis of the image correlation technique and the time-series images of Landsat-8 (L8), Sentinel-2 (52), and GaoFen-2 (GF2), a systematic technical process is designed to investigate the precursory displacement evolution of two successive slope failures occurred in Baige Village, China on Oct. 11, 2018 and Nov. 3, 2018. An innovative fusion strategy is proposed to investigate the displacement history of the Oct. 11, 2018 Baige landslide, which has two steps: (1) selecting the optimal correlation window size and search step to eliminate the inconsistency of image correlation for different sensors, and (2) inverting the fused displacement time-series from correlation results to enhance the temporal sampling density. The normalized displacement velocity indicates that the Oct. 11, 2018 Baige landslide is characterized by high-speed sliding (28 m/yr) and high shear outlet with an average elevation difference of around 82 m. The fused displacement time series indicates that the whole phase transformation can be from the secondary stage to the tertiary stage on Mar. 26, 2017. Furthermore, the displacement velocity shows four quiescence phases in the secondary stage and two acceleration phases in the tertiary stage. The seasonal precipitation is assumed as the main external triggering factor, and it combined with the brittle geological material attributes to control the precursory landslide displacement evolution and caused the catastrophic slope failure on Oct. 11, 2018. The precursory displacement signals with a magnitude above 5 m/day of the second landslide (Nov. 3, 2018) is quantified by the 52 image correlation. This study highlights the prospects of optical observation time series with medium-/high-resolution in detecting and quantifying the spatio-temporal evolution characteristics of long-term creeping landslides which may play a significant role in the early warning of the catastrophic slope failure.

M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - One of the most important application of artificial intelligence (AI) in pathology is prediction, using morphological features, of patient prognosis and response to specific treatments. As one of the most common kinds of malignancies in the world and the crucial important cause of death due to malignant tumor among women, breast cancer has become the center of attention in clinical services. Axillary lymph node metastasis is an important prognostic factor in breast cancer. The accuracy of the assessment of axillary lymph node metastasis bears heavily on clinical diagnosis and treatment. At present, based on the principle of non-invasive procedures, many studies have been done to develop models that can be used to predict sentinel lymph node metastasis of breast cancer. However, different clinical and pathological parameters are used in these predictive models. How to analyze the clinical and pathological data of breast cancer patients in a more comprehensive way and how to establish a prediction model with better precision have become the future direction of development. In this paper, we describe the research progress of AI in pathology and the current status of its use in breast cancer research. We have conducted in-depth reflection and looked into the future of ways to predict effectively breast cancer lymph node metastasis and to establish more accurate and effective deep-learning algorithm based on AI assistance so as to continuously improve the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Patterns of Ecosystem Restoration Activities and Their Effects on Changes in Terrestrial Gross Primary Production in Southwest China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale ecosystem restoration projects (ERPs) have been implemented since the beginning of the new millennium to restore vegetation and improve the ecosystem in Southwest China. However, quantifying the effects of specific restoration activities, such as afforestation and grass planting, on vegetation recovery is difficult due to their incommensurable spatiotemporal distribution. Long-term and successive ERP-driven land use/cover changes (LUCCs) were used to recognise the spatiotemporal patterns of major restoration activities, and a contribution index was defined to assess the effects of these activities on gross primary production (GPP) dynamics in Southwest China during the period of 2001-2015. The results were as follows. (1) Afforestation and grass planting were major restoration activities that accounted for more than 54% of all LUCCs in Southwest China. Approximately 96% of restoration activities involved afforestation, and these activities were mostly distributed around Yunnan Province. (2) The Breathing Earth System Simulator (BESS) GPP performed better than the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) GPP validated by field observation data. Nevertheless, their annual GPP trends were similar and increased by 12,581 g C m(-2) d(-1) and 13,406 g C m(-2) d(-1) for MODIS and BESS GPPs, respectively. (3) Although the afforestation and grass planting areas accounted for less than 1% of the total area of Southwest China, they contributed to more than 1% of the annual GPP increase in the entire study area. Afforestation directly contributed 14.94% (BESS GPP) or 24.64% (MODIS GPP) to the annual GPP increase. Meanwhile, grass planting directly contributed only 0.41% (BESS GPP) or 0.03% (MODIS GPP) to the annual GPP increase.

TI  - Active learning regularization increases clear sky retrieval rates for vegetation biophysical variables using Sentinel-2 data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - For typical cloud conditions, a clear sky retrieval rate (CSRR) >67% is required to meet the Global Climate Observing System temporal interval requirement of 10 days when mapping canopy biophysical variables ('variables'). Physically based algorithms suitable for global mapping of variables using multispectral satellite imagery, e.g. the Simplified Level 2 Prototype Processor (SL2P), typically have a CSRR between 25% and 75%. An Active Learning Regularization (ALR) approach was developed to increase the CSRR rate while satisfying uncertainty requirements. A local calibration database for each variable was produced from representative valid SL2P estimates and associated Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument surface reflectance estimates. Predictors for each variable were developed by i) using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator regression to select a subset of spectral vegetation indices (VIs) from a provided library, ii) removing outliers from the calibration database by trimming the conditional distribution of each variable given a VI, and iii) calibrating a non-linear regression predictor of the variable given the selected VIs using the trimmed database. ALR was applied to MSI imagery acquired over the Canadian Prairies during the 2016 and 2018 growing seasons and validated with in-situ data collected over 50 fields by the SMAPVEX16-MB campaign. The mean CSRR during the 2018 growing season was similar to 98% (similar to 70%) for ALR (SL2P) for all canopy variables except FCOVER and similar to 98% for FCOVER using both ALR and SL2P. In comparison to SL2P, ALR had increased agreement rates with in-situ leaf area index (86% versus 79%) and fraction cover (96% versus 79%) but not canopy water content (35% versus 53%). Intercomparison with valid SL2P estimates from different MSI images acquired within +/- 2 days found that 90% [+/- 5%] of ALR estimates fell within the uncertainty of the valid estimates. These findings support the hypothesis that, over croplands, ALR significantly increases CSRR over SL2P without appreciably increasing uncertainty for variables retrieved by SL2P within thematic performance requirements.

TI  - Prospective assessment of urinary and bowel symptoms, and sexual function between laparoscopic assisted vaginal radical trachelectomy and radical hysterectomy
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveRadical trachelectomy is a valid alternative to radical hysterectomy in women with a desire to retain their fertility. Data regarding the oncological outcomes of radical trachelectomy are comparable with those of radical hysterectomy but information regarding urinary and sexual function is limited. The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate and compare quality of life, urinary and bowel symptoms, and sexual dysfunction between patients who underwent laparoscopic assisted vaginal radical trachelectomy versus radical hysterectomy for early-stage cervical cancer.MethodsPatients who underwent laparoscopic assisted vaginal radical trachelectomy or radical hysterectomy along with sentinel or systemic pelvic lymphadenectomy were included between May 2015 and January 2017. Patients were asked to complete a validated questionnaire (German pelvic symptom questionnaire) on bladder, bowel, prolapse, and sexual function, and total pelvic score, at least 48 hours before surgery and 6 months after surgery.ResultsA total of 51 patients were included. Of these, 26 patients (50.9%) underwent laparoscopic assisted vaginal radical trachelectomy and 25 (49.1%) underwent radical hysterectomy. No patient was converted to laparotomy. The majority of patients (76%) were diagnosed with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO 2018) stage 1B1 disease, with squamous cell carcinoma (54%) and grade II tumors (52%). Four patients (7.8 %) experienced perioperative complications (two grade II and two grade III complications according to the Clavien-Dindo classification). In the preoperative evaluation, the median scores for the four items of the questionnaire (bladder, bowel, prolapse, and sexual items) and total pelvic score were comparable between the two groups. The mean scores for radical hysterectomy and radical trachelectomy at the beginning of the study for bladder, bowel, prolapse, and sexual function were 0.93 versus 0.71, 0.71 versus 1.01, 0.12 versus 0.1, and 1.06 versus 1.0, respectively. On preoperative testing, the median scores for all four items of the questionnaire (p(bladder)=0.821, p(bowel)=0.126, p(prolapse)=0.449, p(sexual)=0.965) and the total pelvic score (p=0.756) were comparable between the two groups. The radical hysterectomy group had worse total pelvic scores at the 6 month postoperative survey compared with baseline (p=0.03). There was no difference in bladder (p=0.07) or bowel symptoms (p=0.07) in the radical hysterectomy group comparing baseline with the 6 month assessment. Women undergoing radical hysterectomy experienced more urinary morbidity than women undergoing vaginal trachelectomy at 6 weeks (p=0.025). However, the mean bladder and pelvic scores in the 6 month control were comparable between patients who had and those who had not experienced urinary morbidity (p(bladder)=0.127, p(total pelvic score)=0.480).ConclusionPatients undergoing laparoscopic assisted vaginal radical trachelectomy had similar pelvic scores in both the preoperative and postoperative periods. However, patients undergoing radical hysterectomy showed worse total pelvic scores on the postoperative assessment compared with the baseline evaluation. Urinary dysfunction in the early postoperative phase was more common in the radical hysterectomy group than in trachelectomy group.

TI  - Type I IFNs facilitate innate immune control of the opportunistic bacteria <i>Burkholderia cenocepacia</i> in the macrophage cytosol
T2  - PLOS PATHOGENS
M3  - Article
AB  - Author summaryOur immune system protects us from infections caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other organisms that we encounter regularly. The majority of these organisms have not evolved to cause us harm and are either tolerated within us or else are removed by the immune system. However, when the immune system is compromised, whether through illness, medication, or genetic abnormalities, some of these benign invaders become capable of causing significant, and even fatal, disease. These so-called 'opportunistic pathogens' are often difficult to treat due to antibiotic resistance and the fact that they infect people with compromised immune systems. In this study, we looked at how the sentinel cells of the immune system, called 'macrophages', can combat an opportunistic bacterial pathogen called Burkholderia cenocepacia, which infects patients with lung diseases like cystic fibrosis. We find that ancient immune proteins called interferons, which are often associated with battling viruses, are integral to macrophages' ability to kill these bacteria, limiting the chance of severe disease. Macrophages produce interferons during and after engulfment of these bacteria, boosting their anti-bacterial killing machinery and priming neighboring cells to do the same. The results of the work could help in directing anti-Burkholderia treatments in susceptible patients.The mammalian immune system is constantly challenged by signals from both pathogenic and non-pathogenic microbes. Many of these non-pathogenic microbes have pathogenic potential if the immune system is compromised. The importance of type I interferons (IFNs) in orchestrating innate immune responses to pathogenic microbes has become clear in recent years. However, the control of opportunistic pathogens-and especially intracellular bacteria-by type I IFNs remains less appreciated. In this study, we use the opportunistic, Gram-negative bacterial pathogen Burkholderia cenocepacia (Bc) to show that type I IFNs are capable of limiting bacterial replication in macrophages, preventing illness in immunocompetent mice. Sustained type I IFN signaling through cytosolic receptors allows for increased expression of autophagy and linear ubiquitination mediators, which slows bacterial replication. Transcriptomic analyses and in vivo studies also show that LPS stimulation does not replicate the conditions of intracellular Gram-negative bacterial infection as it pertains to type I IFN stimulation or signaling. This study highlights the importance of type I IFNs in protection against opportunistic pathogens through innate immunity, without the need for damaging inflammatory responses.

TI  - Tide-Induced Variability and Mechanisms of Surface Suspended Sediment in the Zhoushan Archipelago along the Southeastern Coast of China Based on GOCI Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The variations and dynamics of suspended sediment in the coastal waters around the Zhoushan Archipelago are complex due to strong tidal dynamics. This study aims to delineate the tide-induced variability of surface suspended sediment and reveal its mechanisms in the Zhoushan Archipelago based on Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) data. Suspended sediment concentration (SSC) estimations through the ultraviolet wavelength atmospheric correction (UV-AC) algorithm and a tuned empirical inversion algorithm using extensive in situ measurements are presented. GOCI-processed remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) is validated using field data and is cross-validated with Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (L8/OLI) measurements, respectively. The estimated SSC is validated with independent datasets. The validations reveal that GOCI-processed R-rs is reasonable and that the GOCI-retrieved SSC is accurate and can be used to quantify SSC distributions and variations in the Zhoushan Archipelago. The variations of the SSC in the study area are closely related to the temporal variations of the tidal level. High SSCs often occur in the middle of ebb or flood tides due to large tidal discharge and high tidal velocity. Significant hourly variations of the SSC are mainly controlled by tidal forces. Dynamic mechanism analysis indicates that during neap and middle tides, the local high SSC is mainly attributed to the sediment resuspension process driven by tidal currents; in addition, during the spring tide, the variations of the SSC are simultaneously modulated by sediment resuspension and horizontal advection processes.

TI  - Remote sensing of aboveground grass biomass between protected and non-protected areas in savannah rangelands
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate information on the amount of aboveground grass biomass (AGBg) stored in savannah rangelands remains unknown. Therefore, in this study we assessed the capability of a new multispectral sensor (Landsat-8 OLI) in estimating aboveground grass biomass stored within two different land use management units in savannah rangelands using the stepwise multiple linear regression methods. Specifically, we evaluated the performance of different Landsat-8 OLI derivatives (i.e. (a) spectral bands, (b) derived vegetation indices and (c) a combination of spectral bands and vegetation indices) to quantify aboveground grass biomass. The results highlighted that the use of spectral bands as stand-alone model variables yielded considerably high accuracies in terms of the coefficient of determination (r(2)) and the root mean square error (RMSE). An r(2) of 0.73 (72.81%) and RMSE of 37.88% for the protected area and an r(2) of 0.75 (75.18%) and with a RMSE of 33.16% for the nonprotected area were attained. The use of vegetation indices, however, demonstrated a very weak model performance yielding an r(2) of 0.31 (30.68%) and a RMSE of 51.51%, for the protected area and an r(2) of 0.50 (50.43%) and RMSE of 40% for the nonprotected areas. Comparatively, combining Landsat-8 OLI derived spectral bands and vegetation indices demonstrated improved model performance, yielding an r(2) of 0.92 (91.90%), and RMSE of 41.3% for the protected area and an r(2) of 0.94 (93.82%) with a RMSE of 33.14% for the nonprotected area. Therefore based on the observed results, AGBg in savannah rangelands can be satisfactorily estimated using broadband multispectral derivatives.

TI  - Spatio-temporal analysis of remotely sensed and hydrological model soil moisture in the small Jicinka River catchment in Czech Republic
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY AND HYDROMECHANICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The knowledge of spatio-temporal dynamics of soil moisture within the catchment is very important for rainfall-runoff modelling in flood forecasting In this study the comparison between remotely sensed soil moisture and soil moisture estimated from the SHETRAN hydrological model was performed for small and flashy Jieinka River catchment (75.9 km(2)) in the Czech Republic. Due to a relatively coarse spatial resolution of satellite data, the satellite soil moisture data were downscaled, by applying the method developed by Qu et al. (2015). The sub-grid variability of soil moisture was estimated on the basis of the mean soil moisture for the grid cell and the known hydraulic soil properties. The SHETRAN model was calibrated and verified to the observed streamflow hydrographs at the catchment outlet. The good correlation between the two different soil moisture information was obtained according to the majority of applied criteria. The results of the evaluation criteria indicate that the downscaled remotely sensed soil moisture data can be used as additional criteria for the calibration and validation of hydrological models for small catchments and can contribute to a better estimation of parameters, to reduce uncertainties of hydrological models and improve runoff simulations.

TI  - Dimensions of the Relationship between the Individual and Her Unique Worldview Construction
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Each individual constructs his own private worldview using elements from established worldview traditions. The biographical character of this formation makes this the individual's "Unique Worldview Construction" (UWC). The purpose of this theoretical study is to analyse the dynamic relationship between the individual and her own UWC. It describes more how than what he believes in or denies. The variation is exceedingly complex. To make it accessible, the complexity is crystallized into seven dimensions: (1) The authority structure deals with the individual's perception of herself as being superordinate/subordinate to her own UWC. (2) The importance dimension analyses the span from indifference to involvement among a variety of religious/nonreligious, age, and gender cohorts. (3) The certainty dimension explores doubt versus confidence, using theories like confirmation bias, naive realism, and cognitive dissonance. (4) The dimension of one's relationship to rejected beliefs describes different ways of being inclusive/exclusive. (5) The emotional dimension depicts the individual's weak/strong and negative/positive feelings towards different elements of her UWC. (6) The openness dimension sheds light on the respective traits of being introverted/extroverted regarding one's private worldview. (7) The continuity dimension explores different development patterns, along with complex pre/post-conversion and deconversion processes. The different dimensions partly correlate to each other.

TI  - Homogenized finite element models can accurately predict screw pull-out in continuum materials, but not in porous materials
T2  - COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objective: Bone screw fixation can be estimated with several test methods such as insertion torque, pull-out, push-in and bending tests. A basic understanding of the relationship between screw fixation and bone microstructure is still lacking. Computational models can help clarify this relationship. The objective of the paper is to evaluate homogenized finite element (hFE) models of bone screw pull-out.Methods: Experimental pull-out tests were performed on three materials: two polyurethane (PU) foams having a porous microstructure, and a high density polyethylene (HDPE) which is a continuum material. Forty-five titanium pedicle screws were inserted to 10, 20, and 30 mm in equally sized blocks of all three materials (N = 5/group). Pull-out characteristics i.e. stiffness (S), yield force (F-y), peak pull-out force (F-ult) and displacement at F-ult (d(ult)) were measured. hFE models were created replicating the experiments. The screw was modeled as a rigid body and 5 mm axial displacement was applied to the head of the screw. Simulations were performed evaluating two different conditions at the bone-screw interface; once in which the screw fitted the pilot hole exactly ("free-stressed") and once in which interface stresses resulting from the insertion process were taken into account ("pre-stressed").Results: The simulations representing the pre-stressed condition in HDPE matched the experimental data well; S, F-y, and F-ult differed less than 11%, 2% and 0.5% from the experimental data, respectively, whereas d(ult) differed less than 16%. The free-stressed simulations were less accurate, especially stiffness (158% higher than the pre-stressed condition) and d(ult) (30% lower than pre-stressed condition) were affected. The simulations representing PU did not match the experiments well. For the 20 mm insertion depth, S, F-y and F-ult differed by more than 104%, 89% and 66%, respectively from the experimental values. Agreement did not improve for 10 and 30 mm insertion depths.Conclusions: We found that hFE models can accurately quantify screw pull-out in continuum materials such as HDPE, but not in materials with a porous structure, such as PU. Pre-stresses in the bone induced by the insertion process cannot be neglected and need to be included in the hFE simulations. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - A data-driven approach to assessing the impact of water harvesting structures on regional water storage in East Africa
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - A small-scale water harvesting structure known as a sand dam has gained popularity across East Africa due to the efforts of non-governmental organizations. A sand dam is a subsurface water reservoir that stores water between sand grains. Stored thus, the water is filtered and protected from evaporation. This study uses remotely sensed data to investigate the impact of these structures on water storage and vegetative growth. The relationship between sand dams and water storage was modeled using a binary sand dam factor, climate data from the Famine Early Warning Systems Network Land Data Assimilation System (FLDAS), and water storage data measured by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) twin satellites. The analysis revealed that GRACE largely fails to detect a statistically significant impact of sand dams on regional water storage. However, analysis of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) indicated that sand dams have a significant impact on regional vegetation. Vegetative growth is correlated with groundwater levels, indicating that sand dams have a positive impact on water storage albeit on a smaller scale than GRACE can regularly detect. Significantly, this study shows that NDVI data can be used effectively to study small-scale, regional changes in vegetation and water storage.

TI  - How Accurate Is an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Data-Based Model Applied on Satellite Imagery for Chlorophyll-a Estimation in Freshwater Bodies?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical sensors are increasingly sought to estimate the amount of chlorophyll a (chl_a) in freshwater bodies. Most, whether empirical or semi-empirical, are data-oriented. Two main limitations are often encountered in the development of such models. The availability of data needed for model calibration, validation, and testing and the locality of the model developed-the majority need a re-parameterization from lake to lake. An Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) data-based model for chl_a estimation is developed in this work and tested on Sentinel-2 imagery without any re-parametrization. The Ensemble-based system (EBS) algorithm was used to train the model. The leave-one-out cross validation technique was applied to evaluate the EBS, at a local scale, where results were satisfactory (R-2 = Nash = 0.94 and RMSE = 5.6 mu g chl_a L-1). A blind database (collected over 89 lakes) was used to challenge the EBS' Sentine-2-derived chl_a estimates at a regional scale. Results were relatively less good, yet satisfactory (R-2 = 0.85, RMSE= 2.4 mu g chl_a L-1, and Nash = 0.79). However, the EBS has shown some failure to correctly retrieve chl_a concentration in highly turbid waterbodies. This particularity nonetheless does not affect EBS performance, since turbid waters can easily be pre-recognized and masked before the chl_a modeling.

TI  - Evaluation of Fast Molecular Detection of Lymph Node Metastases in Prostate Cancer Patients Using One-Step Nucleic Acid Amplification (OSNA)
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple SummaryProstate cancer (PCa) is the second most common cancer and one of the highestcauses of cancer deaths among men. The presence of lymph node metastases (LNM) is the strongest prognostic factor. Histological detection of LNM is the gold standard for LN staging. In clinical practice, only fractions of LNs are examined histopathologically, resulting in missed (micro-)metastases. Biomolecular techniques can enhance the identification of LNM but are not routinely used because of high cost. One-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) analyzes the entire LN by detecting cytokeratin 19 mRNA as a surrogate for LNM requiring less effort and allowing intraoperative application. To verify the reliability of OSNA for the first time in PCa, we examined LNs of patients undergoing prostatectomy and sentinel lymphadenectomy. Results were compared with histopathological and immunohistochemistry findings. OSNA identified LNM equivalent to, or in cases of micrometastases, even better than enhanced histopathology, and might be useful in intraoperative decision-making in personalized LN surgery.Background: In clinical routine, only fractions of lymph nodes (LNs) are examined histopathologically, often resulting in missed (micro-)metastases and incorrect staging of prostate cancer (PCa). One-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) analyzes the entire LN by detecting cytokeratin 19 (CK19) mRNA as a surrogate for LN metastases requiring less effort than conventional biomolecular techniques. We aimed to evaluate performance of OSNA in detecting sentinel LN (SLN) metastases in PCa. Methods: SLNs (n = 534) of 64 intermediate- or high-risk PCa patients undergoing radical prostatectomy with extended and sentinel-guided lymphadenectomy were cut into slices and alternatingly assigned to OSNA and histopathology (hematoxylin-eosin staining, CK19, and CK AE1/AE3 immunohistochemistry). Sensitivity and specificity of OSNA and concordance and measure of agreement (Cohen's kappa (kappa)) between OSNA and histopathology were assessed. Results: Histopathology revealed metastases in 76 SLNs. Sensitivity and specificity of OSNA were 84.2% and 96.1%, respectively. Discordant results were recorded for 30 of 534 SLNs, revealing high concordance (94.4%). Twenty-four discordant cases were classified as micrometastases, indicating a possible allocation bias. In 18 cases, positive results were conferred only by OSNA resulting in seven LN-positive patients who were missed by histopathology. Overall, the level of agreement was high (kappa = 0.78). Conclusions: OSNA provided a diagnosis that was as least as accurate as detailed histological examination and might improve LN staging in PCa.

TI  - Short-Term Response of Chlorophyll <i>a</i> Concentration Due to Intense Wind and Freshwater Peak Episodes in Estuaries: The Case of Fangar Bay (Ebro Delta)
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Estuaries and coastal bays are areas of large spatio-temporal variability in physical and biological variables due to environmental factors such as local wind, light availability, freshwater inputs or tides. This study focuses on the effect of strong wind events and freshwater peaks on short-term chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration distribution in the small-scale and microtidal, Fangar Bay (Ebro Delta, northwestern Mediterranean). The hydrodynamics of this bay are primarily driven by local wind episodes modulated by stratification in the water column. Results based on field-campaign observations and Sentinel-2 images revealed that intense wind episodes from both NW (offshore) and NE-E (onshore) caused an increase in the concentration of surface Chl a. The mechanisms responsible were horizontal mixing and the bottom resuspension (also linked to the breakage of the stratification) that presumably resuspended Chl a containing biomass (i.e., micropyhtobentos) and/or incorporated nutrients into the water column. On the other hand, sea-breeze was not capable of breaking up the stratification, so the chlorophyll a concentration did not change significantly during these episodes. It was concluded that the mixing produced by the strong winds favoured an accumulation of Chl a concentration, while the stratification that causes a positive estuarine circulation reduced this accumulation. However, the spatial-temporal variability of the Chl a concentration in small-scale estuaries and coastal bays is quite complex due to the many factors involved and deserve further intensive field campaigns and additional numerical modelling efforts.

TI  - Evaluation of Crop Type Classification with Different High Resolution Satellite Data Sources
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop type classification with satellite imageries is widely applied in support of crop production management and food security strategy. The abundant supply of these satellite data is accelerating and blooming the application of crop classification as satellite data at 10 m to 30 m spatial resolution have been made accessible easily, widely and free of charge, including optical sensors, the wide field of viewer (WFV) onboard the GaoFen (GF, high resolution in English) series from China, the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) onboard Sentinel 2 (S2) from Europe and the Operational Land Imager (OLI) onboard Landsat 8 (L8) from USA, thanks to the implementation of the open data policy. There are more options in using the satellite data as these three data sources are available. This paper explored the different capability of these three data sources for the crop type mapping in the same area and within the same growing season. The study was executed in a flat and irrigated area in Northwest China. Nine types of crop were classified using these three kinds of time series of data sources in 2017 and 2018, respectively. The same suites of the training samples and validation samples were applied for each of the data sources. Random Forest (RF) was used as the classifier for the crop type classification. The confusion error matrix with the OA, Kappa and F1-score was used to evaluate the accuracy of the classifications. The result shows that GF-1 relatively has the lowest accuracy as a consequence of the limited spectral bands, but the accuracy is at 93-94%, which is still excellent and acceptable for crop type classification. S2 achieved the highest accuracy of 96-98%, with 10 available bands for the crop type classification at either 10 m or 20 m. The accuracy of 97-98% for L8 is in the middle but the difference is small in comparison with S2. Any of these satellite data may be used for the crop type classification within the growing season, with a very good accuracy if the training datasets were well tuned.

TI  - Estimating Ecological Responses to Climatic Variability on Reclaimed and Unmined Lands Using Enhanced Vegetation Index
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climatic impact on re-established ecosystems at reclaimed mined lands may have changed. However, little knowledge is available about the difference in vegetation-climate relationships between reclaimed and unmined lands. In this study, ecological responses to climatic variability on reclaimed and neighbouring unmined lands were estimated using remote-sensing data at the Pingshuo Mega coal mine, one of the largest coal mines with long-term reclamation history in China. Time-series MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI) data and meteorological data from 1997 to 2017 were collected. Results show significantly different vegetation-climate relationships between reclaimed and unmined lands. First, the accumulation periods of all climatic variables were much longer on reclaimed mining lands. Second, vegetation on reclaimed lands responded to variabilities in temperature, rainfall, air humidity, and wind speed, while undisturbed vegetation only responded to variabilities of temperature and air humidity. Third, climatic variability made a much higher contribution to EVI variation on reclaimed land (20.0-46.5%) than on unmined land (0.7-1.7%). These differences were primarily caused by limited ecosystem resilience, and changed site hydrology and microclimate on reclaimed land. Thus, this study demonstrates that the legacy effects of surface mining can critically change on-site vegetation-climate relationships, which impacts the structure, functions, and stability of reclaimed ecosystems. Vegetation-climate relationships of reclaimed ecosystems deserve further research, and remote-sensing vegetation data are an effective source for relevant studies.

M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Influenza is one of the most important viral diseases with high mortality and morbidity that can have a great impact on public health and economy.Objective: To investigate the clinical and epidemiological features of influenza virus A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B infection in Fars province, southern Iran, in 2015-2019.Methods: In this retrospective cross-sectional study, we assessed the archived data of Syndromic Surveillance System of Iran's Health Ministry, allowed access by Communicable Diseases' Unit of Health chancellor of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, from December 22, 2015 to September 22, 2019. The participants included all patients whose data were recorded as influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infections/illness (SARI). Influenza viral infection was confirmed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).Results: Totally, 1269 patients suspected of influenza were sampled. The mean +/- SD of age was 29.40 +/- 26.91 years. Fever was the most common symptom (68.6%). The highest incidence was in winter (55.9%). Of 928/1269 laboratory's results which were recorded in the registry, 204 (16.08%) samples were positive and 724 (57.05%) were negative. Among 204 positive results, 191 (15.05%) were influenza type A, and 8 (0.63%) influenza type B. Among patients with definite influenza type A, 34 (2.68%) had H1N1/p subtype, 58 (4.57%) H3N2, and one (0.08%) had other subtypes; however, subtypes were not identified in 7.72% of patients. Six (3.0%) patients with confirmed influenza expired.Conclusion: The incidence of influenza, especially type A, in Fars province, southern Iran is considerable and requires more attention for prevention in health policy programs.

TI  - Gas Flaring: A Review Focused On Its Analysis From Space
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING MAGAZINE
M3  - Review
AB  - This article represents the current state of the art in analyzing gas flaring (GF) from space. GF is a prominent source of air pollution, with significant global and local impacts. Its emissions contribute to climate change and air pollution, and its practice is a waste of a valuable energy source. A key barrier in evaluating the status of this phenomenon is the incomplete and inconsistent availability (or lack) of public information. In the last few decades, satellite-based methodologies have shown considerable potential for bridging this gap. They have been employed for 1) detecting flaring sites, globally or regionally; 2) characterizing them; 3) computing the volumes of gas they flare; and 4) assessing air pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions. Long-term archives of multispectral satellite imagery, dating to the 1990s, also provide the ability to follow the spatiotemporal evolution of GF. This work, which collects literature papers through July 2019 starting with background information on satellites' capabilities to observe gas flares, describes satellite-based methododologies used to derive independent, reliable data on GF.

TI  - Explaining Sentinel 2-based dNBR and RdNBR variability with reference data from the bird's eye (UAS) perspective
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Characterizing the spatial variability of the severity of wildfires is important to assess ecological and economic consequences and to coordinate mitigation strategies. Vegetation indices such as the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) have become a standard tool to assess burn or fire severity across larger areas and are being used operationally. Despite the frequent application of dNBR-like vegetation indices, it is not yet fully understood which variables exactly drive the variability in dNBR observed by multispectral satellites. One reason for this is the lack of high quality prefire information about vegetation structure and composition. Consequently, the influence of prefire vegetation composition and other potentially influential variables such as cast shadows has hardly been examined. Here, we use very high resolution Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) orthoimages collected briefly before and after the large wildfires in Central Chile in the fire season 2016/2017 to derive variables related to the pre- and postfire landscape composition and structure. The variables are used as predictors in Generalized Additive Models (GAM) to explain the spatial variability in dNBR and RdNBR pixel values as observed by Sentinel-2. Our models explain more than 80% and 75% of the variability in dNBR and RdNBR values, respectively, using a sparse set of five predictors. The results suggest that in our study area the largest fraction of variability in Sentinel-2 based dNBR and RdNBR values can be explained by variables related to the fraction of consumed canopy cover while the vegetation composition before the fire does not have a large influence on dNBR and RdNBR.Our results further suggest that cast-shadows of snags and standing dead trees with remaining crown structure have a notable influence on the dNBR signal which may have been underestimated so far. We conclude that spatially continuous, very high spatial resolution data from UAS can be a valuable data source for an improved understanding of the exact meaning of common vegetation index products, operationally used for monitoring the environment.

TI  - Effect of multi-temporal satellite images on soil moisture prediction using a digital soil mapping approach
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM), a critical component of the global hydrological cycle, is affected by individual or combinations of multiple factors including soil properties, climate, and topography. Despite its importance to many disciplines, predicting SM continuously, accurately, and inexpensively over a large area is a great challenge due to its dynamic nature controlled mostly by the spatial and temporal variability of these factors. Static environmental covariates, such as those derived from a digital elevation model, are commonly used in digital soil mapping (DSM); these are typically less suitable for predicting dynamic properties. Easily available multitemporal satellite images show strong promise to capture this variability. The objective of this study was to predict SM from multi-temporal satellite images using a DSM approach. Specifically, we examined the feasibility of using dynamic, static, and combinations of environmental covariates (ECs) to predict SM in the Balikhli_Chay watershed in Iran on four separate dates in June, July, August, and September 2018 coincident with satellite overpass. Cubist and random forest (RF) machine learning algorithms (MLAs) were trained for making SM predictions for individual dates, and the data was then compiled without considering the date to create generalized models. The baseline for comparisons were the models developed using only static ECs. For June, July, August, and September, Cubist R-2 improvements were 96%, 78%, 185% and 120%, respectively. Using the generalized models, R-2 improved by as much as 223% and RMSE decreased by as much as 47% when comparing the best SM prediction model in each month to models developed using only static ECs for that same month using the Cubist model. Similar model improvements were seen for the RF model. The generalized Cubist and RF MLAs performed equally well with concordance of 0.91 and 0.90 for Cubist and RF respectively, and low RMSE of 3.04 and 2.98. The best Cubist and RF MLAs by month were always those developed with dynamic, or satellite-derived, ECs. Based on the variable importance statistics, land surface temperature (LST) was the most important EC. This study showed the strong predictions, and the practical feasibility of using multi-temporal satellite data as a dynamic EC that could help to capture the spatial and temporal variations of soil moisture. This approach could likely be extended to other dynamic soil property (e.g., soil temperature).

TI  - Google Earth Engine as Multi-Sensor Open-Source Tool for Supporting the Preservation of Archaeological Areas: The Case Study of Flood and Fire Mapping in Metaponto, Italy
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the impact of Climate change, anthropogenic and natural hazards (such as earthquakes, landslides, floods, tsunamis, fires) has dramatically increased and adversely affected modern and past human buildings including outstanding cultural properties and UNESCO heritage sites. Research about protection/monitoring of cultural heritage is crucial to preserve our cultural properties and (with them also) our history and identity. This paper is focused on the use of the open-source Google Earth Engine tool herein used to analyze flood and fire events which affected the area of Metaponto (southern Italy), near the homonymous Greek-Roman archaeological site. The use of the Google Earth Engine has allowed the supervised and unsupervised classification of areas affected by flooding (2013-2020) and fire (2017) in the past years, obtaining remarkable results and useful information for setting up strategies to mitigate damage and support the preservation of areas and landscape rich in cultural and natural heritage.

TI  - Environmental Effects on the Spatiotemporal Variability of Fish Larvae in the Western Guangdong Waters, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spawning grounds occupy an important position in the survival and reproduction of aquatic life, which plays an important role in the replenishment of fishery resources, especially in the China coasts where fishery resources are depleting. This study investigated environmental effects on the spatiotemporal variability of fish larvae in the western Guangdong waters (WGWs), on the basis of generalized additive models (GAMs) and center of gravity (CoG). Satellite data including sea surface salinity (SSS), sea surface temperature (SST), and in situ observations for fish larvae from April to June in 2014-2015 were used. Results showed that 40.3% of the total variation in fish larvae density was explained. SST, SSS, and depth showed positive effects in 23-24 degrees C and 27-30 degrees C, 24-32 PSU, and 0-60 m, and showed negative effects in 24-27 degrees C, 32-34.2 PSU, 60-80 m. Based on the stepwise GAMs, the most important factor was month, with a contribution of 10.6%, followed by longitude, offshore distance, depth, and latitude, with contributions of 7.0%, 7.0%, 6.3%, 4.2%, 3.9%, and 1.3%, respectively. Fish larvae CoG shifted northward by 0.6 degrees N and eastwards by 0.13 degrees E from April to June. The distribution of fish larvae in the WGWs was affected by complex submarine topography in the Qiongzhou Strait, coastal upwelling in the WGWs, and runoff from the Pearl River.

TI  - Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) Applied to the Study of Habitat Diversity in the Fine-Grained Landscapes of the Cantabrian Mountains
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Heterogeneous and patchy landscapes where vegetation and abiotic factors vary at small spatial scale (fine-grained landscapes) represent a challenge for habitat diversity mapping using remote sensing imagery. In this context, techniques of spectral mixture analysis may have an advantage over traditional methods of land cover classification because they allow to decompose the spectral signature of a mixed pixel into several endmembers and their respective abundances. In this work, we present the application of Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) to quantify habitat diversity and assess the compositional turnover at different spatial scales in the fine-grained landscapes of the Cantabrian Mountains (northwestern Iberian Peninsula). A Landsat-8 OLI scene and high-resolution orthophotographs (25 cm) were used to build a region-specific spectral library of the main types of habitats in this region (arboreal vegetation; shrubby vegetation; herbaceous vegetation; rocks-soil and water bodies). We optimized the spectral library with the Iterative Endmember Selection (IES) method and we applied MESMA to unmix the Landsat scene into five fraction images representing the five defined habitats (root mean square error, RMSE <= 0.025 in 99.45% of the pixels). The fraction images were validated by linear regressions using 250 reference plots from the orthophotographs and then used to calculate habitat diversity at the pixel (alpha-diversity: 30 x 30 m), landscape (gamma-diversity: 1 x 1 km) and regional (epsilon-diversity: 110 x 33 km) scales and the compositional turnover (beta- and delta-diversity) according to Simpson's diversity index. Richness and evenness were also computed. Results showed that fraction images were highly related to reference data (R-2 >= 0.73 and RMSE <= 0.18). In general, our findings indicated that habitat diversity was highly dependent on the spatial scale, with values for the Simpson index ranging from 0.20 +/- 0.22 for alpha-diversity to 0.60 +/- 0.09 for gamma-diversity and 0.72 +/- 0.11 for epsilon-diversity. Accordingly, we found beta-diversity to be higher than delta-diversity. This work contributes to advance in the estimation of ecological diversity in complex landscapes, showing the potential of MESMA to quantify habitat diversity in a comprehensive way using Landsat imagery.

TI  - Mapping Risk of Malaria as a Function of Anthropic and Environmental Conditions in Sussundenga Village, Mozambique
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Mozambique is a country in Southern Africa with around 30 million inhabitants. Malaria is the leading cause of mortality in the country. According to the WHO, Mozambique has the third highest number of malaria cases in the world, representing approximately 5% of the world total cases. Sussundenga District has the highest incidence in the Manica province and environmental conditions are the major contributor to malaria transmission. There is a lack of malaria risk maps to inform transmission dynamics in Sussundenga village. This study develops a malaria risk map for Sussundenga Village in Mozambique and identifies high risk areas to inform on appropriate malaria control and eradication efforts. One hundred houses were randomly sampled and tested for malaria in Sussundenga Rural Municipality. To construct the map, a spatial conceptual model was used to estimate risk areas using ten environmental and anthropic factors. Data from Worldclim, 30 x 30 Landsat images were used, and layers were produced in a raster data set. Layers between class values were compared by assigning numerical values to the classes within each layer of the map with equal rank. Data set input was classified, using diverse weights depending on their appropriateness. The reclassified data outputs were combined after reclassification. The map indicated a high risk for malaria in the northeast and southeast, that is, the neighborhoods of Nhamazara, Nhamarenza, and Unidade. The central eastern areas, that is, 25 de Junho, 1 and 2, 7 de Abril, and Chicueu presented a moderate risk. In Sussundenga village there was 92% moderate and 8% high risk. High malaria risk areas are most often located in densely populated areas and areas close to water bodies. The relevant findings of this study can inform on effective malaria interventions.

These models were estimated for mainland Spain from satellite data, using multilinear regressions and artificial neural networks. The variables utilized were combinations of global horizontal irradiance, clearness index, solar zenith angle cosine, relative humidity, and air temperature. The study territory was divided into regions with similar features regarding PAR through clustering of the PAR clearness index (k(P)(AR)). This methodology allowed PAR modeling for the two main climatic regions in mainland Spain (Oceanic and Mediterranean). MODIS 3 h data were employed to train the models, and PAR data registered in seven stations across Spain were used for validation. Usual validation indices assess the extent to which the models reproduce the observed data. However, none of those indices considers the exceedance probabilities, which allow the assessment of the viability of projects based on the data to be modeled. In this work, a new validation index based on these probabilities is presented. Hence, its use, along with the other indices, provides a double and thus more complete validation.

TI  - Mapping bull kelp canopy in northern California using Landsat to enable long-term monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Extending from central California to Alaska, bull kelp (Nereocystis luetkeana) forms seasonal kelp forests that are iconic coastal ecosystems in much of the eastern Pacific. Historical and ongoing field surveys and aerial imagery are used to provide biological data on kelp canopy cover and health, but satellite remote sensing provides the opportunity to generate consistent, long-term datasets over a large spatial scale. Robust satellite-based timeseries measurements of giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) are available for much of the California coastline (e.g., Santa Barbara to Santa Cruz), but there have been no equivalent publications for bull kelp. Recent loss of bull kelp in northern California emphasized the need for more expansive long-term monitoring of canopy trends. We tested various kelp classification approaches using Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) applied to Landsat imagery, which allowed sufficient temporal and spatial data collection during bull kelp's narrow seasonal maximum, and compare with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) aerial survey canopy area product. We addressed five main topics that have relevance to enabling Landsat in long-term monitoring of bull kelp canopy coverage in northern California: (1) the effect of MESMA configurations applied to Landsat imagery, including software dependencies and endmember configurations, (2) comparison of Landsat to traditional surveys, (3) differences across Landsat sensors, (4) tidal influence on canopy area, and (5) trends in the decadal timeseries. We found that there was no statistical difference (p = 0.53) between MESMA platforms (IDL-based and a Python-scripted method; RMSE 1.5 km(2) or 17.6% when normalized by the range in CDFW), and that a 7-endmember MESMA model provided the lowest RMSE (1.4 km(2) or 16.9%). Furthermore, while tidal phases can submerge or emerge kelp canopy and thus potentially affect kelp detection, we found a weak and statistically insignificant correlation between tides and performance of our remote estimate of kelp canopy area. Canopy estimations from Landsat-8 images yielded a higher NRMSE than Landsat-4 and -5 images, but the lack of matchup limits comparison. Imagery from early fall yielded the largest coverage estimates. Overall, our results show that Landsat enables broad remote measurement of bull kelp canopy coverage to supplement existing survey methods and increase continuity of timeseries for monitoring long-term trends.

TI  - A historical and future impact assessment of mining activities on surface biophysical characteristics change: A remote sensing-based approach
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mining activities and associated actions cause land-use/land-cover (LULC) changes across the world. The objective of this study were to evaluate the historical impacts of mining activities on surface biophysical characteristics, and for the first time, to predict the future changes in pattern of vegetation cover and land surface temperature (LST). In terms of the utilized data, satellite images of Landsat, and meteorological data of Sungun mine in Iran, Athabasca oil sands in Canada, Singrauli coalfield in India and Hambach mine in Germany, were used over the period of 1989-2019. In the first step, the spectral bands of Landsat images were employed to extract historical LULC changes in the study areas based on the homogeneity distance classification algorithm (HDCA). Thereafter, a CA-Markov model was used to predict the future of LULC changes based on the historical changes. In addition, LST and vegetation cover maps were calculated using the single channel algorithm, and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), respectively. In the second step, the trends of LST and NDVI variations in different LULC change types and over different time periods were investigated. Finally, a CA-Markov model was used to predict the LST and NDVI maps and the trend of their variations in future. The results indicated that the forest and green space cover was reduced from 9.95 in 1989 to 5.9 Km(2) in 2019 for Sungun mine, from 42.14 in 1999 to 33.09 Km(2) in 2019 for Athabasca oil sands, from 231.46 in 1996 to 263.95 Km(2) in 2016 for Singrauli coalfield, and from 180.38 in 1989 to 133.99 Km(2) in 2017 for Hambach mine, as a result of expansion and development of of mineral activities. Our findings about Sungun revealed that the areal coverage of forest and green space will decrease to 15% of the total study area by 2039, resulting in reduction of the mean NDVI by almost 0.06 and increase of mean standardized LST from 0.52 in 2019 to 0.61 in 2039. our results further indicate that for Athabasca oil sands (Singrauli coalfield, Hambach mine), the mean values of standardized LST and NDVI will change from 0.5 (0.44 and 0.4) and 0.38 (0.38, 0.35) in 2019 (2016, 2017) to 0.57 (0.5, 0.47) and 0.33 (0.32, 0.28), in 2039 (2036, 2035), respectively. This can be mainly attributed to the increasing mining activities in the past as well as future years. The discussion and conclusions presented in this study can be of interest to local planners, policy makers, and environmentalists in order to observe the damages brought to the environment and the society in a larger picture.

TI  - Simulated Atmospheric Response to Four Projected Land-Use Land-Cover Change Scenarios for 2050 in the North-Central United States
T2  - EARTH INTERACTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-use land-cover change (LULCC) has become an important topic of research for the central United States because of the extensive conversion of the natural prairie into agricultural land, especially in the northernGreat Plains. As a result, shifts in the natural climate (minimum/maximum temperature, precipitation, etc.) across the north-central United States have been observed, as noted within the Fourth National ClimateAssessment (NCA4) report. Thus, it is necessary to understand how further LULCC will affect the near-surface atmosphere, the lower troposphere, and the planetary boundary layer (PBL) atmosphere over this region. The goal of this work was to investigate the utility of a new future land-use land-cover (LULC) dataset within the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) modeling system. The present study utilizes a modeled future land-use dataset developed by the Forecasting Scenarios of Land-Use Change (FORE-SCE) model to investigate the influence of future (2050) land use on a simulated PBL development within theWRFModel. Three primary areas of LULCC were identified within the FORE-SCE future LULC dataset across Nebraska and South Dakota. Variations in LULC between the 2005 LULC control simulation and four FORE-SCE simulations affected near-surface temperature (0.5 degrees-1 degrees C) and specific humidity (0.3-0.5 g kg(-1)). The differences noted in the temperature andmoisture fields affected the development of the simulated PBL, leading to variations in PBL height and convective available potential energy. Overall, utilizing the FORE-SCEdatasetwithinWRF produced notable differences relative to the control simulation over areas of LULCC represented in the FORE-SCE dataset.

TI  - The Effect of Antecedence on Empirical Model Forecasts of Crop Yield from Observations of Canopy Properties
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Identification of yield deficits early in the growing season for cereal crops (e.g., Triticum aestivum) could help to identify more precise agronomic strategies for intervention to manage production. We investigated how effective crop canopy properties, including leaf area index (LAI), leaf chlorophyll content, and canopy height, are as predictors of winter wheat yield over various lead times. Models were calibrated and validated on fertiliser trials over two years in fields in the UK. Correlations of LAI and plant height with yield were stronger than for yield and chlorophyll content. Yield prediction models calibrated in one year and tested on another suggested that LAI and height provided the most robust outcomes. Linear models had equal or smaller validation errors than machine learning. The information content of data for yield prediction degraded strongly with time before harvest, and in application to years not included in the calibration. Thus, impact of soil and weather variation between years on crop phenotypes was critical in changing the interactions between crop variables and yield (i.e., slopes and intercepts of regression models) and was a key contributor to predictive error. These results show that canopy property data provide valuable information on crop status for yield assessment, but with important limitations.

TI  - Improved Mekong Basin Runoff Estimate and Its Error Characteristics Using Pure Remotely Sensed Data Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Basin runoff is a quantity of river discharge per unit basin area monitored close to an estuary mouth, essential for providing information on the flooding and drought conditions of an entire river basin. Owing to a decreasing number of in situ monitoring stations since the late 1970s, basin runoff estimates using remote sensing have been advocated. Previous runoff estimates of the entire Mekong Basin calculated from the water balance equation were achieved through the hybrid use of remotely sensed and model-predicted data products. Nonetheless, these basin runoff estimates revealed a weak consistency with the in situ ones. To address this issue, we provide a newly improved estimate of the monthly Mekong Basin runoff by using the terrestrial water balance equation, purely based on remotely sensed water balance component data products. The remotely sensed water balance component data products used in this study included the satellite precipitation from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), the satellite evapotranspiration from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and the inferred terrestrial water storage from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE). A comparison of our new estimate and previously published result against the in situ runoff indicated a marked improvement in terms of the Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC), reaching 0.836 (the new estimate) instead of 0.621 (the previously published result). When a three-month moving-average process was applied to each data product, our new estimate further reached a PCC of 0.932, along with the consistent improvement revealed from other evaluation metrics. Conducting an error analysis of the estimated mean monthly runoff for the entire data timespan, we found that the usage of different evapotranspiration data products had a substantial influence on the estimated runoff. This indicates that the choice of evapotranspiration data product is critical in the remotely sensed runoff estimation.

T2  - SPATIAL STATISTICS

AB  - Model-assisted estimation of forest wood volume is approached exploiting the wall-to-wall information available from satellite data and partial information achieved from airborne laser scanning (ALS) covering a portion of the survey area. If the portion covered by ALS is selected by a probabilistic sampling scheme, two-phase estimators are considered in which the two sources of information are exploited by means of linear and non-linear models. If the portion covered by ALS is fixed because purposively selected, the two sources of information are exploited by the double-calibration estimator. The performance of the proposed strategies is checked by a simulation study from two study areas in Southern and Northern Italy. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

T2  - ALTERNATIVE-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES
M3  - Article
AB  - Various means for levels of hinting at things or making allusions in the interaction between people are part of traditional Sami knowledge and communication, aesthetics and interpersonal communication. A reading of the novel trilogy Arbbolattat (The Heirs) (1997-2005), written by the Sami novelist Jovnna-Ande Vest, shows how the use of hinting and allusions is depicted as birgengoansto (coping skills), an essential art to master in the life of a small community, as a way to deliver a message in a softer tone rather than saying things directly and as a way to avoid conflicts. I especially emphasize the contextual part of the yoik tradition (the ancient Sami chanting tradition) and how it has functioned as a social device in the Sami community. It explains the individual's place within the community, and what people's worldview and life philosophy tell us about life in a small Sami village.

TI  - Detecting Climate Driven Changes in Chlorophyll-a in Deep Subalpine Lakes Using Long Term Satellite Data
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change has increased the temperature and altered the mixing regime of high-value lakes in the subalpine region of Northern Italy. Remote sensing of chlorophyll-a can help provide a time series to allow an assessment of the ecological implications of this. Non-parametric multiplicative regression (NPMR) was used to visualize and understand the changes that have occurred between 2003-2018 in Lakes Garda, Como, Iseo, and Maggiore. In all four deep subalpine lakes, there has been a disruption from a traditional pattern of a significant spring chlorophyll-a peak followed by a clear water phase and summer/autumn peaks. This was replaced after 2010-2012, with lower spring peaks and a tendency for annual maxima to occur in summer. There was a tendency for this switch to be interspersed by a two-year period of low chlorophyll-a. Variables that were significant in NPMR included time, air temperature, total phosphorus, winter temperature, and winter values for the North Atlantic Oscillation. The change from spring to summer chlorophyll-a maxima, relatively sudden in an ecological context, could be interpreted as a regime shift. The cause was probably cascading effects from increased winter temperatures, reduced winter mixing, and altered nutrient dynamics. Future trends will depend on climate change and inter-decadal climate drivers.

TI  - Is Alaska's Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta Greening or Browning? Resolving Mixed Signals of Tundra Vegetation Dynamics and Drivers in the Maritime Arctic
T2  - EARTH INTERACTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Alaska's Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta (YKD) is among the Arctic's warmest, most biologically productive regions, but regional decline of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) has been a striking feature of space-borne Advanced High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) observations since 1982. This contrast with "greening'' prevalent elsewhere in the low Arctic raises questions concerning climatic and biophysical drivers of tundra productivity along maritime-continental gradients. We compared NDVI time series from AVHRR, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Landsat for 2000-19 and identified trend drivers with reference to sea ice and climate datasets, ecosystem and disturbance mapping, field measurements of vegetation, and knowledge exchange with YKD elders. All time series showed increasing maximum NDVI; however, whereas MODIS and Landsat trends were very similar, AVHRR-observed trends were weaker and had dissimilar spatial patterns. The AVHRR and MODIS records for time-integrated NDVI were dramatically different; AVHRR indicated weak declines, whereas MODIS indicated strong increases throughout the YKD. Disagreement largely arose from observations during shoulder seasons, when there is partial snow cover and very high cloud frequency. Nonetheless, both records shared strong correlations with spring sea ice extent and summer warmth. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that, despite frequent disturbances and high interannual variability in spring sea ice and summer warmth, tundra productivity is increasing on the YKD. Although climatic drivers of tundra productivity were similar to more continental parts of the Arctic, our intercomparison highlights sources of uncertainty in maritime areas like the YKD that currently, or soon will, challenge historical concepts of "what is Arctic.''

TI  - An improved dark target method for aerosol optical depth retrieval over China from Himawari-8
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Himawari-8 (H8), the first of the new generation geostationary meteorological satellites, carries Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) sensor with 16 spectral bands from visible to infrared bands. As the spectral bands of AHI in reflectance bands are similar with MODIS, the Dark Target (DT) aerosol retrieval algorithm could be used for obtaining AOD over land with high temporal resolution from AHI measurements. However, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) which was used as a good indicator of surface spectral reflectance is obviously affected by the solar zenith angle and cannot be ignored for AOD retrieval with geostationary measurements. Collocated AHI Level 1b observations and AERONET AOD less than 0.2 have been input into Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum - Vector (6SV) to calculate the surface reflectance. It can be found that the regression relationships of surface reflectance between visible and shortwave infrared channel are obviously different over different observation sites, even the NDVI is the same. In this study, AHI/H8 AOD over land was retrieved through improving the estimation of surface reflectance relationship by taking into account the land cover, NDVI and scattering angle.This approach has been applied to the AHI/H8 observations in 2018; the global AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) and China Aerosol Research Network (CARSNET) ground-based AOD observations were used to evaluate the quality of AOD retrievals. The comparison results have shown that H8 AODs have good agreement with the ground-based measurements with R larger than 0.8 (N > 1500), and it is even up to 0.95 at Xianghe site. Validation with CARSNET has shown that the performance of H8 AOD is better in the morning than that in the afternoon. The AOD retrieval deviations have been found at those sites located at barren and mixed pixels. When compared with JAXA H8 AOD, it is found that the performance of AOD of this work is better than JAXA H8 AOD at most ground observation sites. More importantly, the AOD product of this work can better depicts the diurnal variation, a unique feature that the new generation geostationary satellite measurements can provide.

TI  - A Two-Step Integrated MLP-GTWR Method to Estimate 1 km Land Surface Temperature with Complete Spatial Coverage in Humid, Cloudy Regions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - There is an increasing demand for a land surface temperature (LST) dataset with both fine spatial and temporal resolutions due to the key role of LST in the Earth's land-atmosphere system. Currently, the technique most commonly used to meet the demand is thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing. However, cloud contamination interferes with TIR transmission through the atmosphere, limiting the potential of space-borne TIR sensors to provide the LST with complete spatio-temporal coverage. To solve this problem, we developed a two-step integrated method to: (i) estimate the 10-km LST with a high spatial coverage from passive microwave (PMW) data using the multilayer perceptron (MLP) model; and (ii) downscale the LST to 1 km and fill the gaps based on the geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) model. Finally, the 1-km all-weather LST for cloudy pixels was fused with Aqua MODIS clear-sky LST via bias correction. This method was applied to produce the all-weather LST products for both daytime and nighttime during the years 2013-2018 in South China. The evaluations showed that the accuracy of the reproduced LST on cloudy days was comparable to that of the MODIS LST in terms of mean absolute error (2.29-2.65 K), root mean square error (2.92-3.25 K), and coefficients of determination (0.82-0.92) against the in situ measurements at four flux stations and ten automatic meteorological stations with various land cover types. The spatial and temporal analysis showed that the MLP-GTWR LST were highly consistent with the MODIS, in situ, and ERA5-Land LST, with the satisfactory ability to present the LST pattern under cloudy conditions. In addition, the MLP-GTWR method outperformed a gap-filling method and another TIR-PMW integrated method due to the local strategy in MLP and the consideration of temporal non-stationarity relationship in GTWR. Therefore, the test of the developed method in the frequently cloudy South China indicates the efficient potential for further application to other humid regions to generate the LST under cloudy condition.

TI  - Analysis of Mediterranean Vegetation Fuel Type Changes Using Multitemporal LiDAR
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing fire size and severity over the last few decades requires new techniques to accurately assess canopy fuel conditions and change over larger areas. This article presents an analysis on vegetation changes by mapping fuel types (FT) based on conditional rules according to the Prometheus classification system, which typifies the vertical profile of vegetation cover for fuel management and ecological purposes. Using multi-temporal LiDAR from the open-access Spanish national surveying program, we selected a 400 ha area of interest, which was surveyed in 2010 and 2016 with scan densities of 0.5 and 2 pulses center dot m(-2), respectively. FTs were determined from the distribution of LiDAR heights over an area, using grids with a cell size of 20 x 20 m. To validate the classification method, we used a stratified random sampling without replacement of 15 cells per FT and made an independent visual assessment of FT. The overall accuracy obtained was 81.26% with a Kappa coefficient of 0.73. In addition, the relationships among different stand structures and ecological factors such as topographic aspect and forest vegetation cover types were analyzed. Our classification algorithm revealed that stands lacking understory vegetation usually appeared in shady slopes, which were mainly covered by beech stands, whereas sunny areas were preferentially covered by oak stands, where the understory reached greater height thanks to more light availability. Our analysis on FT changes during that 6 year time span revealed potentially hazardous transitions from cleared forests towards a vertical continuum of canopy fuels, where wildfire events would potentially reach tree crowns, especially in oak forests and southern slopes with higher sun exposure for lower fuel moistures and increased flammability. Accurate methods to characterize forest canopy fuels and change over time can help direct forest management activities to priority areas with greater fire hazard. Multi-date canopy fuel information indicated that while some forest types experienced a growth of the shrub layer, others presented an understory decrease. On the other hand, loss of understory was more frequently detected in beech stands; thus, those forests place lower risk of wildfire spread. Our approach was developed using low-density and publicly available datasets and was based on direct canopy fuel measurements from multi-return LiDAR data that can be accurately translated and mapped according to standard fuel type categories that are familiar to land managers.

TI  - Single-Look Multi-Master SAR Tomography: An Introduction
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article addresses the general problem of single-look multi-master SAR tomography. For this purpose, we establish the single-look multi-master data model, analyze its implications for the single and double scatterers, and propose a generic inversion framework. The core of this framework is the nonconvex sparse recovery, for which we develop two algorithms: one extends the conventional nonlinear least squares (NLS) to the single-look multi-master data model and the other is based on bi-convex relaxation and alternating minimization (BiCRAM). We provide two theorems for the objective function of the NLS subproblem, which lead to its analytic solution up to a constant phase angle in the 1-D case. We also report our findings from the experiments on different acceleration techniques for BiCRAM. The proposed algorithms are applied to a real TerraSAR-X data set and validated with the height ground truth made available by an SAR imaging geodesy and simulation framework. This shows empirically that the single-master approach, if applied to a single-look multi-master stack, can be insufficient for layover separation, and the multi-master approach can indeed perform slightly better (despite being computationally more expensive) even in the case of single scatterers. In addition, this article also sheds light on the special case of single-look bistatic SAR tomography, which is relevant for the current and future SAR missions such as TanDEM- X and Tandem-L.

TI  - Ship Detection and Feature Visualization Analysis Based on Lightweight CNN in VH and VV Polarization Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a significant application in maritime monitoring, which can provide SAR data throughout the day and in all weather conditions. With the development of artificial intelligence and big data technologies, the data-driven convolutional neural network (CNN) has become widely used in ship detection. However, the accuracy, feature visualization, and analysis of ship detection need to be improved further, when the CNN method is used. In this letter, we propose a two-stage ship detection for land-contained sea area without a traditional sea-land segmentation process. First, to decrease the possibly existing false alarms from the island, an island filter is used as the first step, and then threshold segmentation is used to quickly perform candidate detection. Second, a two-layer lightweight CNN model-based classifier is built to separate false alarms from the ship object. Finally, we discuss the CNN interpretation and visualize in detail when the ship is predicted in vertical-horizontal (VH) and vertical-vertical (VV) polarization. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can reach an accuracy of 99.4% and an F1 score of 0.99 based on the Sentinel-1 images for a ship with a size of less than 32 x 32.

TI  - Influence of Mediterranean Sea Temperature Increase on Gaeta Gulf (Tyrrhenian Sea) Biodiversity
T2  - Proceedings of the Zoological Society (Calcutta)
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, temperature variations and invasion on marine fauna are investigated to ascertain their relationship in the Mediterranean at the Gaeta Gulf (Tyrrhenian Sea). Sea temperatures were collected from 1986 to 2009, the only period in which the AVHRR sensor installed on NOAA satellite was available. Changes in the sea surface temperature from satellite using GIS software were estimated. Research on marine species was carried out using the barcoding technique. Nine organisms of which one Anthozoa and one Malacostraca and eight belonging to Actinopterygii Class were barcoded from 2005 to 2019 and four of these were detected as non-indigenous species. The first sightings are related toFistularia commersonii, andSphoeroides pachygasteridentified since 2009 and well reported in our previous publication. They have penetrated the Mediterranean from the Indian Ocean (through the Suez Canal) and from the Atlantic Ocean (Strait of Gibraltar) respectively and are still sporadic. These bioinvasions were linked for the first time to water heating, which increased by about 0.4 degrees C between 1989-1999 and 1999-2009. In addition, there are other identifications, such asArothron diadematusfrom the Suez Canal,Percnon gibbesifrom the Strait of Gibraltar; thermophilus indigenous species such asPomadasys incisusandAstroides calycularisand sporadic autochthonous species such asSudis hyalina,Tetragonurus cuvieri,Trachipterus trachipterus, andRemora osteochir. Non-native species and their invasions could lead to radical and sudden upheavals in the Mediterranean marine ecosystem and therefore require constant alert of sea surface temperature change.

TI  - Discrimination of Neoproterozoic granitic-phases in Southern-Sinai, Egypt. Remote sensing, petrography and geochemistry
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - At Sharm El-Sheikh area a unique association of Neoproterozoic Younger granitic phases is found. These granitic rocks are petrographically identified as monzogranite, syenogranite, alkali feldspar granite, and riebeckite granite. The magma sources of monzogranite and syenogranite are generally of magnesian affinity while those of Alkali-feldspar granite and riebeckite granite are ferroan affinity. Tectonically, the monzogranite and syenogranite were generated during syn-collision tectonic regime and those of Alkali-feldspar granite and riebeckite granite are (within-plate granite). Geochemically they are discriminated into fractionated A-type granites and I-type granite. Alkaline granite samples have the highest PREE upto 497.4 ppm while monzogranite samples have the lowest PREE reach 153.7. The most conspicuous negative Eu anomaly (Eu/Eu* = 0.1) is recorded in the in alkali feldspar and riebeckite granitoids while monzogranite and syenogranite samples display negligible negative to slight positive Eu anomalies (Eu/Eu* = 1.8). Landsat-8 bands (7, 4, 2) and (7, 3, 5) in RGB used in discrimination and lithologic mapping of the different granitoid rocks. Band rationing technique was successful in discrimination of the two main granitic phases of the study area. ? 2021 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

TI  - Opportunities for Gene and Environment Research in Cancer: An Updated Review of NCI's Extramural Grant Portfolio
T2  - CANCER EPIDEMIOLOGY BIOMARKERS & PREVENTION
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: The study of gene-environment (GxE) interactions is a research priority for the NCI. Previously, our group analyzed NCI's extramural grant portfolio from fiscal years (FY) 2007 to 2009 to determine the state of the science in GxE research. This study builds upon our previous effort and examines changes in the landscape of GxE cancer research funded by NCI.Methods: The NCI grant portfolio was examined from FY 2010 to 2018 using the iSearch application. A time-trend analysis was conducted to explore changes over the study interval.Results: A total of 107 grants met the search criteria and were abstracted. The most common cancer types studied were breast (19.6%) and colorectal (18.7%). Most grants focused on GxE using specific candidate genes (69.2%) compared with agnostic approaches using genome-wide (26.2%) or whole-exome/wholegenome next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches (19.6%); some grants used more than one approach to assess genetic variation. More funded grants incorporated NGS technologies in FY 2016-2018 compared with prior FYs. Environmental exposures most commonly examined were energy balance (46.7%) and drugs/treatment (40.2%). Over the time interval, we observed a decrease in energy balance applications with a concurrent increase in drug/treatment applications.Conclusions: Research in GxE interactions has continued to concentrate on common cancers, while there have been some shifts in focus of genetic and environmental exposures. Opportunities exist to study less common cancers, apply new technologies, and increase racial/ethnic diversity.Impact: This analysis of NCI's extramural grant portfolio updates previous efforts and provides a review of NCI grant support for GxE research.

TI  - Increase in Importance of <i>Aphelinus nigritus</i> (Howard) on Winter Crops in Oklahoma Coincides with Invasion of Sugarcane Aphid on Sorghum in Oklahoma
T2  - SOUTHWESTERN ENTOMOLOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - Aphid parasitoids on the Southern Great Plains provide important pest suppression services in summer and winter crops. The primary parasitoids Lysiphlebus testaceipes (Cresson), Aphelinus nigritus (Howard), and Diaretiella rapae (McIntosh) use multiple aphid host species on multiple crops in agricultural landscapes and historically, L. testaceipes has been the most abundant and arguably most important. However, after the sugarcane aphid, Melanaphis sacchari (Zehntner), infested sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) on the Southern Plains, A. nigritus increased in abundance and impact on this summer crop. We hypothesized that A. nigritus also would be more abundant in fields of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and winter canola (Brassica napus L.) in the region following the sugarcane aphid. From 2016-2019, we documented aphid parasitoid abundance and percentage of parasitism in Oklahoma winter crops during late fall and early spring using a standardized sentinel aphid deployment retrieval and rearing approach. Unexpectedly, A. nigritus was relatively abundant during Fall 2016, parasitizing as many as 5.4% of sentinel aphids in winter wheat fields which was more than the typically dominant parasitoid L. testaceipes. However, percentage of parasitism by A. nigritus decreased during the study. Our results suggested that abundance of A. nigritus mirrored those of sugarcane aphids in the region, and the temporary presence of the parasitoid in winter crops reflected dynamics at a landscape level.

TI  - Determining Long-Term Land Cover Dynamics in the South Baltic Coastal Zone from Historical Aerial Photographs
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal regions are dynamic environments that have been the main settlement destinations for human society development for centuries. Development by humans and environmental changes have resulted in intensive land cover transformation. However, detailed spatiotemporal analyses of such changes in the Polish Baltic coastal zone have not been given sufficient attention. The aim of the presented work is to fill this gap and, moreover, present a method for assessing indicators of changes in a coastal dune environment that could be an alternative for widely used morphological line indicators. To fulfill the main aim, spatial and temporal variations in the dune areas of the Pomeranian Bay coast (South Baltic Sea) were quantified using remote sensing data from the years 1938-2017, supervised classification, and a geographic information system post-classification change detection technique. Finally, a novel quantitative approach for coastal areas containing both sea and land surface sections was developed. The analysis revealed that for accumulative areas, a decrease in the land area occupied by water was typical, along with an increase in the surface area not covered by vegetation and a growth in the surface area occupied by vegetation. Furthermore, stabilized shores were subject to significant changes in tree cover area mainly at the expense of grass-covered terrains and simultaneous slight changes in the surface area occupied by water and the areas free of vegetation. The statistical analysis revealed six groups of characteristic shore evolutionary trends, of which three exhibited an erosive nature of changes. The methodology developed herein helps discover new possibilities for defining coastal zone dynamics and can be used as an alternative solution to methods only resorting to cross sections and line indicators. These results constitute an important step toward developing a predictive model of coastal land cover changes.

TI  - Coseismic Surface Displacement in the 2019 Ridgecrest Earthquakes: Comparison of Field Measurements and Optical Image Correlation Results
T2  - GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - A fundamental topic in earthquake studies is understanding the extent to which fault rupture at the surface is localized on primary fault strands as opposed to distributed tens to hundreds of meters away from primary ruptures through off-fault deformation (OFD) via a combination of discrete secondary faulting and bulk deformation. The 2019 Ridgecrest, CA M(w)6.4 and M(w)7.1 earthquakes provide an opportunity to explore this problem via comparison of published field-based and mostly on-fault offset measurements, with new lateral displacement measurements made over length scales of hundreds of meters across the primary rupture using WorldView satellite images collected before and after the earthquakes. A mean fit to the field observations underestimates net slip (pixel-correlation results) by an average of 0.4 m along the M(w)6.4 rupture (similar to 41% of net left-lateral displacement) and 0.7 m along the M(w)7.1 rupture (similar to 65% of net right-lateral displacement). We attribute these differences to substantial OFD along the lengths of the M(w)6.4 (similar to 59%) and M(w)7.1 (similar to 35%) ruptures. A maximum fit to the field observations provides an improved match to the pixel correlation results (difference of 0.1-0.2 m or similar to 76%-98% of net displacement). OFD may in part depend on displacement magnitude, where locations along the rupture with smaller displacements (<2 m) are characterized by a greater percentage of OFD. Furthermore, OFD increases with rupture zone width, especially at the scale of individual rupture strands (hundreds of meters). These findings contribute to a growing understanding of the important role of OFD in accommodating deformation near the surface.

TI  - The "Idea of Human" Literary Category: Epistemological Potential
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The "idea of human" ("type of attitude to the world") is considered as a relevant category of the conceptual apparatus of the modern science of literature. The aim of the work is to analyze the theoretical and methodological potential of this category on the basis of large typological units of the literary process, marked with the concepts of "historical and literary era", "artistic and cognitive cycle", "literary direction", "big style", "artistic method". The research used the methods of a typological and complex study of literary works, which in the synthesis of literary criticism and philosophy determine the strategy of searches in the field of theoretical and methodological content of the "idea of human" category as the foundation of the literary and philosophical anthropology of cultural and historical eras. The historical and genetic links between the worldview aesthetic principles and the artistic practice of literary trends are problematized. The logic of the research reveals the concept "object - knowledge", fundamental for epistemology, in the aspects of the structuring of the knowledge of the methodological semantics of the "idea of human" category and of the functioning of the definitions "generalized idea of human", "type of attitude to the world", "concept of human and reality", "whole of human", "human as a value". The article shows that the "idea of human" as a philosophical and aesthetic interpretation of the nature and essence of human at a certain stage in the development of artistic consciousness, worked out by the whole culture (R.R. Moskvina, G.V. Mokronosov) and defining integrity and logical consistency of the artistic system, is a synergistically functional semantic core of the historical and cultural era, and this core contains the dialectical potential of "negation of the negation". As a variable, the historical "idea of human", in the perspective of the stage development of artistic consciousness, undergoes dramatic changes and is realized in the logic of the successive change of historical and cultural epochs and their philosophical paradigms, in the constant alternation of "realistic" and "mystical", materialistic and idealistic methods of cognition and images of human and the world (D.I. Chizhevsky, A.M. Panchenko, and others). The conclusions are substantiated that the successive development of literary trends, creative methods and their axiological systems is conditioned by the dynamics of "types of attitude to the world"; that the functioning of the "idea of human" category in literary discourse is focused on argumentation of the ontological nature of fiction, on the identification of philosophical and aesthetic principles that determine the systematic nature and the successive change of artistic and cognitive cycles; that the evolution of the "idea of human" within the framework of one artistic and cognitive cycle is fixed by the dynamics of genre systems since, in the correlations of method, genre and style, "the idea of human" acts as a factor in genre formation.

T2  - VESTNIK SLAVIANSKIKH KULTUR-BULLETIN OF SLAVIC CULTURES-SCIENTIFIC AND INFORMATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper discusses the role of the ideologist of cultural movement in the reformist populism of the 1880s - 1890s, enlightener and writer Ya. V. Abramov in the context of creation of the book series "Life of remarkable people. Biographical library of F. Pavlenkov.. Its educational concept and democratic character are largely determined by Abramov's social and worldview intentions - ideological inspirer of so-called "going to the people", "going to great cultural work", who saw the goals of such work in releasing "constrained forces and abilities of the Russian folk spirit", supporting the "mental activity of the Russian people", in promoting its "generation of new forms of life". The author suggests a hypothesis, according to which the ideological genesis of the series is contained in Abramov's short story "The Philistine Thinker" (1881), where the idea on the educational significance of the biographies of prominent people, "benefactors of mankind" was first expressed. The paper traces affinity between updating the genre of popular scientific biographies of "great people" and the educational tasks of Abramov and Pavlenkov and highlights the role of "instructive biographies" of Abramov in creating the genre type of documentary and fiction books that synthesize the qualities of "contextual biography" and "biography of the hermeneutic model". The classic exemplarity of Abramov's books is determined by the genre-conditioning and structure-forming function of the concept of personality; a synthesis of artistry and journalism, documentary and imagery; principles of artistic typing when working with documentary material; actualization of genre dominants (biography-life description, biography-research, biography-portrait, etc.); the poetics of narrative, objectivizing the aesthetic nature of author's subjectivity.

TI  - Enlighten-GAN for Super Resolution Reconstruction in Mid-Resolution Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Previously, generative adversarial networks (GAN) have been widely applied on super resolution reconstruction (SRR) methods, which turn low-resolution (LR) images into high-resolution (HR) ones. However, as these methods recover high frequency information with what they observed from the other images, they tend to produce artifacts when processing unfamiliar images. Optical satellite remote sensing images are of a far more complicated scene than natural images. Therefore, applying the previous networks on remote sensing images, especially mid-resolution ones, leads to unstable convergence and thus unpleasing artifacts. In this paper, we propose Enlighten-GAN for SRR tasks on large-size optical mid-resolution remote sensing images. Specifically, we design the enlighten blocks to induce network converging to a reliable point, and bring the Self-Supervised Hierarchical Perceptual Loss to attain performance improvement overpassing the other loss functions. Furthermore, limited by memory, large-scale images need to be cropped into patches to get through the network separately. To merge the reconstructed patches into a whole, we employ the internal inconsistency loss and cropping-and-clipping strategy, to avoid the seam line. Experiment results certify that Enlighten-GAN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of gradient similarity metric (GSM) on mid-resolution Sentinel-2 remote sensing images.

TI  - Linking Long-Term Changes in Soil Salinity to Paddy Land Abandonment in Jaffna Peninsula, Sri Lanka
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinity is a serious threat to coastal agriculture and has resulted in a significant reduction in agricultural output in many regions. Jaffna Peninsula, a semi-arid region located in the northern-most part of Sri Lanka, is also a victim of the adverse effects of coastal salinity. This study investigated long-termsoil salinity changes and their link with agricultural land use changes, especially paddy land. Two Landsat images from 1988 and 2019 were used to map soil salinity distribution and changes. Another set of images was analyzed at four temporal periods to map abandoned paddy lands. A comparison of changes in soil salinity with abandoned paddy lands showed that abandoned paddy lands had significantly higher salinity than active paddy lands, confirming that increasing salts owing to the high levels of sea water intrusion in the soils, as well as higher water salinity in wells used for irrigation, could be the major drivers of degradation of paddy lands. The results also showed that there was a dramatic increase in soil salinity (1.4-fold) in the coastal lowlands of Jaffna Peninsula. 64.6% of the salinity-affected land was identified as being in the extreme saline category. In addition to reducing net arable lands, soil salinization has serious implications for food security and the livelihoods of farmers, potentially impacting the regional and national economy.

TI  - Atmospheric Correction of Satellite Optical Imagery over the Rio de la Plata Highly Turbid Waters Using a SWIR-Based Principal Component Decomposition Technique
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating water reflectance accurately from satellite optical data requires implementing an accurate atmospheric correction (AC) scheme, a particularly challenging task over optically complex water bodies, where the signal that comes from the water prevents using the near-infrared (NIR) bands to separate the perturbing atmospheric signal. In the present work, we propose a new AC scheme specially designed for the Rio de la Plata-a funnel-shaped estuary in the Argentine-Uruguayan border-highly scattering turbid waters. This new AC scheme uses far shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands but unlike previous algorithms relates the atmospheric signal in the SWIR to the signal in the near-infrared (NIR) and visible (VIS) bands based on the decomposition into principal components of the atmospheric signal. We describe the theoretical basis of the algorithm, analyze the spectral features of the simulated principal components, theoretically address the impact of noise on the results, and perform match-ups exercises using in situ measurements and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) imagery over the region. Plausible water reflectance retrievals were obtained in the NIR and VIS bands from both simulations and match-ups using field data-with better performance (i.e., lowest errors and offsets, and slopes closest to 1) compared to existing AC schemes implemented in the NASA Data Analysis Software (SeaDAS). Moreover, retrievals over images in the VIS and NIR bands showed low noise, and the correlation was low between aerosol and water reflectance spatial fields.

TI  - The cosmic roots of human nature and our culturally conditioned self-image
T2  - INTERNATIONAL COMMUNICATION OF CHINESE CULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Human nature is rooted in the fact that we are living beings and rational beings. According to the comprehensive science that is based on the independent principle of biology, human nature is rooted in the cosmic life principle and in the universal principle of reason. Human beings have a Nature-given, real self-identity that is rooted in the fundamental cosmic life principle, the principle of reason and biological autonomy. Our autonomy, which we identify as our Self, is in its very basis intimately related with the life of the Universe, because our vital instinct is identical to the life principle of the Universe. At the same time, our self-image is usually shaped on the basis of the dominant culture of our society. A culture identifying ourselves with an alienated self-image leads us to become alienated from our original and natural identity given by the cosmic roots of our Self. At present, a dualistic worldview is still dominant in Western civilisation. It is this worldview which is the root cause of alienation. Understanding that this worldview is incomplete at the ontological level can free our mindset from the alienating worldview. It is encouraging that comprehensive postmodern science has already proven on exact mathematical grounds that we are existing in a Living Universe that is governed by the same life-principle which is accessible within us in the form of our intrinsic vital instinct. The cosmic creativity and vitality of the life principle can be realized by us when we listen to it. Our genuine human abilities can develop within favourable family contexts and under conducive social conditions. We show that long-term sustainable development requires a culture in which our socially imprinted self-image is in harmony with our original, natural Self. Remarkably, the results presented in this article offer exact scientific foundations which can be connected with traditional Chinese ideas like tian ren he yi ("Heaven and people in harmony"), "Heaven, Earth and I were produced together, and all things and I are one", "The great virtue of Heaven and Earth is called 'life-giving'", "What Heaven imparts to man is called human nature", and "Human nature is composed of qizhi (vital energy and raw stuff)".

TI  - Impact of the number of dates and their sampling on a NDVI time series reconstruction methodology to monitor urban trees with Venμs satellite
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This article studies the influence of the number of satellite remote sensing acquisition dates and their sampling on the performance of a time series reconstruction method developed in Granero-Belinchon et al. 2020. This method initially aimed at monitoring urban London plane (Platanus x acerifolia) trees, and was tested with Sentinel-2 imagery at spatial resolutions of 10 and 20 m and a temporal revisit of 5 days. Due to its higher revisit frequency of 2 days while having a similar spatial resolution of 10 m, Ven mu s imagery was consequently used in the present article to fulfill with the purpose of this study. The strategy relies on the building of different acquisition date configurations based on the Ven mu s time series by considering uniform and non-uniform samplings and with a total number of acquisitions ranging from 45 to 14. Thus, the aim of the article is to examine the number of annual acquisitions needed to describe properly a vegetation phenological cycle and the impact of the annual sampling of these acquisitions on the final reconstructed time series. To this end, this study was carried out by using the widely used Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Results showed that on one hand, applied on an acquisition configuration composed of at least 18 uniformly sampled dates throughout the year, this reconstruction methodology is able to describe correctly the annual NDVI dynamics but leads to inaccuracies in the description of intra-annual ones. Nevertheless, these intra-annual descriptions are improved with the increase of the number of acquisitions. On the other hand, strongly non-uniform acquisition date samplings lead to inaccurate descriptions of the undersampled time periods but correct descriptions of the rest of the time series curve. The study case is London planes located in Toulouse (France) with 45 cloud-free Ven mu s images during the year 2019. Finally, this work emphasizes the main limitations of the studied reconstruction methodology when few acquisitions or very non-uniform acquisition date samplings are available and thus the identification of borderline cases in future applications and other study cases.

TI  - Satellite imagery and products of the 16-17 February 2020 Saharan Air Layer dust event over the eastern Atlantic: impacts of water vapor on dust detection and morphology
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - On 16-17 February 2020, dust within the Saharan Air Layer (SAL) from western Africa moved over the eastern Atlantic Ocean. Satellite imagery and products from the ABI on GOES-16, VIIRS on NOAA-20, and CALIOP on CALIPSO, along with retrieved values of layer and total precipitable water (TPW) from MIRS and NUCAPS, respectively, were used to identify dust within the SAL over the eastern Atlantic Ocean. Various satellite imagery and products were also used to characterize the distribution of water vapor within the SAL. There was a distinct pattern between dust detection and dust masking and values of precipitable water. Specifically, dust was detected when values of layer TPW were approximately 14 mm; in addition, dust was masked when values of layer TPW were approximately 28 mm In other words, water vapor masked infrared dust detection if sufficient amounts of water vapor existed in a column. Results herein provide observational support to two recent numerical studies that concluded water vapor can mask infrared detection of airborne dust.

TI  - Sea Ice Thickness Retrieval Based on GOCI Remote Sensing Data: A Case Study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate monitoring and measurement of sea ice thickness (SIT) is crucial for understanding climate change and preventing economic losses caused by sea ice disasters near coastal regions. In this study, a new method is developed to retrieve the SIT in Liaodong Bay (LDB) based on the Rayleigh-corrected reflectance from Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) images in the winters of 2012 and 2013. Compared with previously developed SIT retrieval methods (e.g., the method based on the thermodynamic principle of sea ice) using remote sensing data, our method has significant advantages with respect to the inversion accuracy (achieving retrieval skill scores as high as 0.86) and spatiotemporal resolution. Moreover, there is no significant increase in the computational cost with this method, which makes the method suitable for operational SIT retrieval in the global ocean.

TI  - An assessment of Arctic cloud water paths in atmospheric reanalyses
T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The role of Arctic clouds in the recent rapid Arctic warming has attracted much attention. However, Arctic cloud water paths (CWPs) from reanalysis datasets have not been well evaluated. This study evaluated the CWPs as well as LWPs (cloud liquid water paths) and IWPs (cloud ice water paths) from five reanalysis datasets (MERRA-2, MERRA, ERA-Interim, JRA-55, and ERA5) against the COSP (Cloud Feedback Model Intercomparison Project Observations Simulator Package) output for MODIS from the MERRA-2 CSP (COSP satellite simulator) collection (defined as M2Modis in short). Averaged over 1980-2015 and over the Arctic region (north of 60 degrees N), the mean CWPs of these five datasets range from 49.5 g/m(2) (MERRA) to 82.7 g/m(2) (ERA-Interim), much smaller than that from M2Modis (140.0 g/m(2)). However, the spatial distributions of CWPs, show similar patterns among these reanalyses, with relatively small values over Greenland and large values over the North Atlantic. Consistent with M2Modis, these reanalyses show larger LWPs than IWPs, except for ERA-Interim. However, MERRA-2 and MERRA underestimate the ratio of IWPs to CWPs over the entire Arctic, while ERA-Interim and JRA-55 overestimate this ratio. ERA5 shows the best performance in terms of the ratio of IWPs to CWPs. All datasets exhibit larger CWPs and LWPs in summer than in winter. For M2Modis, IWPs hold seasonal variation similar with LWPs over the land but opposite over the ocean. Following the Arctic warming, the trends in LWPs and IWPs during 1980-2015 show that LWPs increase and IWPs decrease across all datasets, although not statistically significant. Correlation analysis suggests that all datasets have similar interannual variability. The study further found that the inclusion of re-evaporation processes increases the humidity in the atmosphere over the land and that a more realistic liquid/ice phase can be obtained by independently treating the liquid and ice water contents.

TI  - Examining Relationships between Heat Requirement of Remotely Sensed Green-Up Date and Meteorological Indicators in the Hulun Buir Grassland
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accumulation of heat and moderate precipitation are the primary factors that are used by grasslands to trigger a green-up date. The accumulated growing degree-days (AGDD) requirement over the preseason is an important indicator of the response of grassland spring phenology to climate change. This study adopted the Normalized Difference Phenology Index (NDPI), which derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), to extract annual green-up dates in the Hulun Buir grassland in China between 2001-2015. Our analysis indicated that the range (standard deviation) and trend for the green-up date were DOY (day of year) 104 to DOY 144 (10.6 days) and -2.0 days per decade. Nine point two percent of the study area had significant (p < 0.05) changes in AGDD requirements. The partial correlations between the AGDD requirements and chilling days (67.04%, pixels proportion) were negative and significant (p < 0.05). The partial correlations between the AGDD requirement and precipitation (28.87%) were positive and significant (p < 0.05). Finally, the partial correlation between the AGDD requirement and insolation (97.65%) were positive and significant (p < 0.05). The results of this study could reveal the response of vegetation to climate warming and contribute to improving the phenological mechanism model of different grassland types in future research.

TI  - RSDehazeNet: Dehazing Network With Channel Refinement for Multispectral Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multispectral remote sensing (RS) images are often contaminated by the haze that degrades the quality of RS data and reduces the accuracy of interpretation and classification. Recently, the emerging deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) provide us new approaches for RS image dehazing. Unfortunately, the power of CNNs is limited by the lack of sufficient hazy-clean pairs of RS imagery, which makes supervised learning impractical. To meet the data hunger of supervised CNNs, we propose a novel haze synthesis method to generate realistic hazy multispectral images by modeling the wavelength-dependent and spatial-varying characteristics of haze in RS images. The proposed haze synthesis method not only alleviates the lack of realistic training pairs in multispectral RS image dehazing but also provides a benchmark data set for quantitative evaluation. Furthermore, we propose an end-to-end RSDehazeNet for haze removal. We utilize both local and global residual learning strategies in RSDehazeNet for fast convergence with superior performance. Channel attention modules are incorporated to exploit strong channel correlation in multispectral RS images. Experimental results show that the proposed network outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for synthetic data and real Landsat-8 OLI multispectral RS images.

TI  - Monitoring Land Use/Cover Change Using Remotely Sensed Data in Guangzhou of China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use/cover change (LUCC) has a crucial influence on ecosystem function, environmental change and decision support. Rapid and precise monitoring of land use/cover change information is essential for utilization and management of land resources. The objectives of this study were to monitor land use/cover change of Guangzhou of China from 1986 to 2018 using remotely sensed data, and analyze the correlation between artificial surface expansion and the gross domestic product (GDP) growth. Supervised classification was performed using Random Forest classifier, and the overall accuracy (OA) ranged from 86.42% to 96.58% and kappa coefficient (K) ranged from 0.8079 to 0.9499. The results show that the built-up area of Guangzhou of China from 1986 to 2018 continued to increase. However, the vegetation area continued to decrease during 32 years. The built-up area increased by 1315.56 km(2) (increased by 439.34%) with an average growth of 41.11 km(2)/year. The vegetation area reduced by 1290.78 km(2) (reduced by 19.99%) with an average reduction of 40.34 km(2)/year. Research has shown that the reduced vegetation area was mainly converted into built-up area. The area of water bodies and bare lands was relatively stable and had a little change. The results indicate that the GDP had a strong positive correlation with built-up area (R-2 = 0.98). However, there is a strong negative correlation between the GDP and vegetation area (R-2 = 0.97) in Guangzhou City, China. As a consequence, the increase of built-up area was at the cost of the reduction of vegetation area.

TI  - Evaluating Multi-Sensors Spectral and Spatial Resolutions for Tree Species Diversity Prediction
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests contribute significantly to terrestrial biodiversity conservation. Monitoring of tree species diversity is vital due to climate change factors. Remote sensing imagery is a means of data collection for predicting diversity of tree species. Since various sensors have different spectral and spatial resolutions, it is worth comparing them to ascertain which could influence the accuracy of prediction of tree species diversity. Hence, this study evaluated the influence of the spectral and spatial resolutions of PlanetScope, RapidEye, Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 images in diversity prediction based on the Shannon diversity index (H '), Simpson diversity Index (D-1) and Species richness (S). The Random Forest regression was applied for the prediction using the spectral bands of the sensors as variables. The Sentinel 2 was the best image, producing the highest coefficient of determination (R-2) under both the Shannon Index (R-2 = 0.926) and the Species richness (R-2 = 0.923). Both the Sentinel and RapidEye produced comparable higher accuracy for the Simpson Index (R-2 = 0.917 and R-2 = 0.915, respectively). The PlanetScope was the second-accurate for the Species richness (R-2 = 0.90), whiles the Landsat 8 was the least accurate for the three diversity indices. The outcomes of this study suggest that both the spectral and spatial resolutions influence prediction accuracies of satellite imagery.

TI  - Comment on "Comparison of Cloud Cover Detection Algorithms on Sentinel-2 Images of the Amazon Tropical Forest"
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - In their recent study, Sanchez et al. compared various cloud detection methods applied to Sentinel-2, specifically on images acquired over the Amazonian region, known for its frequent cloud cover. Comparison of cloud screening methods for optical satellite images is a complex task, which must take several parameters into account, such as the definition of a cloud, which can differ according to the methods, the different coding of the cloud and shadow masks, the possible dilation of masks, and also the way the method must be used to perform in nominal conditions. We found that the otherwise serious and useful comparison of cloud masks by Sanchez et al. is not fair to the real performances of MAJA cloud detection, for two reasons: (i) two thirds of the images used in the comparison were acquired before the launch of Sentinel-2B satellite, when the revisit of the Sentinel-2 mission was 20 days instead of five days for the nominal conditions of the mission, and (ii) there is an error in the understanding of how MAJA cloud masks are coded which also probably artificially degraded the results of MAJA as compared to the other methods.

TI  - Interference Geolocation in Satellite Communications Systems: An Overview
T2  - IEEE VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY MAGAZINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite interference geolocation plays a critical role in addressing radio interference problems related to satellite communications systems. Traditional interference geolocation approaches are mainly based on time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) and frequency-difference-of-arrival (FDOA) measurements. However, since new technologies have appeared, such as the widespread use of high-frequency bands, spot beams, emerging large-scale low- Earth orbit satellite constellations, and onboard processing, traditional methods may be unsuitable for modern satellite communications. Currently, to overcome these challenges, new approaches, such as single-satellite geolocation, geolocation onboard, and geolocation using carrier identification (CID), have been investigated in the literature. In this article, we provide an overview of the principles of, and innovations involving, interference geolocation techniques in satellite communications. In addition, we present the fundamental constraints, key challenges, and future directions for performing geolocation.

TI  - Sen2Grass: A Cloud-Based Solution to Generate Field-Specific Grassland Information Derived from Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - AGRIENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Grasslands are important for their ecological values and for agricultural activities such as livestock production worldwide. Efficient grassland management is vital to these values and activities, and remote sensing technologies are increasingly being used to characterize the spatiotemporal variation of grasslands to support those management practices. For this study, Sentinel-2 satellite imagery was used as an input to develop an open-source and automated monitoring system (Sen2Grass) to gain field-specific grassland information on the national and regional level for any given time range as of January 2016. This system was implemented in a cloud-computing platform (StellaSpark Nexus) designed to process large geospatial data streams from a variety of sources and was tested for a number of parcels from the Haus Riswick experimental farm in Germany. Despite outliers due to fluctuating weather conditions, vegetation index time series suggested four distinct growing cycles per growing season. Established relationships between vegetation indices and grassland yield showed poor to moderate positive trends, implying that vegetation indices could be a potential predictor for grassland biomass and chlorophyll content. However, the inclusion of larger and additional datasets such as Sentinel-1 imagery could be beneficial to developing more robust prediction models and for automatic detection of mowing events for grasslands.

TI  - IW Sentinel-1 satellite scenes for the investigation of mine slope stability: experiences from the Riacho dos Machados gold mine (Brazil)
T2  - EARTH SCIENCES RESEARCH JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last decade, the Persistent Scatterer Interferoinetry - PSI have been largely employed to predict instabilities and failure in open pit mines. The PSI is a powerlid technique, which combines radar satellite data in order to detect and monitor tiny surface displacements over vast areas. In the last years, the Sentinel-1 radar mission have produced images of the globe acquired with different spatial and temporal resolutions that are now freely available. In recent years. the footwall slopes of the Riacho dos Machados Gold Mine MRDM (Minas Gerais state, southeastern Brazil) have recorded large planar failures controlled by foliation planes. Therefore, the focus of this paper is to evaluate a stack of 39 Interferometric Wide Sentinel-1 scenes, spanning from January 2018 to April 2019, acquired in descending orbit geometry; for the detection and monitoring of surface displacements. The results have shown that descending INV Sentinel-1 scenes can be used to provide a broad picture of the Line-Of-Sight - LOS deformation phenomena. In order to monitor the evolution of the deformation phenomena induced by mining activities, LOS deformation maps with millimeter accuracy could be only delivered at least every 12 days.

TI  - Earthquake Damage Region Detection by Multitemporal Coherence Map Analysis of Radar and Multispectral Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth, as humans' habitat, is constantly affected by natural events, such as floods, earthquakes, thunder, and drought among which earthquakes are considered one of the deadliest and most catastrophic natural disasters. The Iran-Iraq earthquake occurred in Kermanshah Province, Iran in November 2017. It was a 7.4-magnitude seismic event that caused immense damages and loss of life. The rapid detection of damages caused by earthquakes is of great importance for disaster management. Thanks to their wide coverage, high resolution, and low cost, remote-sensing images play an important role in environmental monitoring. This study presents a new damage detection method at the unsupervised level, using multitemporal optical and radar images acquired through Sentinel imagery. The proposed method is applied in two main phases: (1) automatic built-up extraction using spectral indices and active learning framework on Sentinel-2 imagery; (2) damage detection based on the multitemporal coherence map clustering and similarity measure analysis using Sentinel-1 imagery. The main advantage of the proposed method is that it is an unsupervised method with simple usage, a low computing burden, and using medium spatial resolution imagery that has good temporal resolution and is operative at any time and in any atmospheric conditions, with high accuracy for detecting deformations in buildings. The accuracy analysis of the proposed method found it visually and numerically comparable to other state-of-the-art methods for built-up area detection. The proposed method is capable of detecting built-up areas with an accuracy of more than 96% and a kappa of about 0.89 in overall comparison to other methods. Furthermore, the proposed method is also able to detect damaged regions compared to other state-of-the-art damage detection methods with an accuracy of more than 70%.

TI  - Machine-Learning Approach Using SAR Data for the Classification of Oil Palm Trees That Are Non-Infected and Infected with the Basal Stem Rot Disease
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Basal stem rot disease (BSR) in oil palm plants is caused by the Ganoderma boninense (G. boninense) fungus. BSR is a major disease that affects oil palm plantations in Malaysia and Indonesia. As of now, the only available sustaining measure is to prolong the life of oil palm trees since there has been no effective treatment for the BSR disease. This project used an ALOS PALSAR-2 image with dual polarization, Horizontal transmit and Horizontal receive (HH) and Horizontal transmit and Vertical receive (HV). The aims of this study were to (1) identify the potential backscatter variables; and (2) examine the performance of machine learning (ML) classifiers (Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Random Forest (RF) to classify oil palm trees that are non-infected and infected by G. boninense. The sample size consisted of 55 uninfected trees and 37 infected trees. We used the imbalance data approach (Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE) in these classifications due to the differing sample sizes. The result showed backscatter variable HV had a higher correct classification for the G. boninense non-infected and infected oil palm trees for both classifiers; the MLP classifier model had a robust success rate, which correctly classified 100% for non-infected and 91.30% for infected G. boninense, and RF had a robust success rate, which correctly classified 94.11% for non-infected and 91.30% for infected G. boninense. In terms of model performance using the most significant variables, HV, the MLP model had a balanced accuracy (BCR) of 95.65% compared to 92.70% for the RF model. Comparison between the MLP model and RF model for the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve region, (AUC) gave a value of 0.92 and 0.95, respectively, for the MLP and RF models. Therefore, it can be concluded by using only the HV polarization, that both the MLP and RF can be used to predict BSR disease with a relatively high accuracy.

TI  - Improving the integrated hydrological simulation on a data-scarce catchment with multi-objective calibration
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The process-based hydrological model Soil and Water Assessment Tool ensures the simulation's reliability by calibration. Compared to the commonly applied single-objective calibration, multi-objective calibration benefits the spatial parameterization and the simulation of specific processes. However, the requirements of additional observations and the practical procedure are among the reasons to prevent the wider application of the multi-objective calibration. This study proposes to consider three groups of objectives for the calibration: multisite, multi-objective function, and multi-metric. For the study catchment with limited observations like the Yuan River Catchment (YRC) in China, the three groups corresponded to discharge from three hydrometric stations, both Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and inversed NSE for discharge evaluation, and MODIS global terrestrial evapotranspiration product and baseflow filtered from discharge as metrics, respectively. The applicability of two multi-objective calibration approaches, the Euclidean distance and nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II, was analyzed to calibrate the above-mentioned objectives for the YRC. Results show that multi-objective calibration has simultaneously ensured the model's better performance in terms of the spatial parameterization, the magnitude of the output time series, and the water balance components, and it also reduces the parameter and prediction uncertainty. The study thus leads to a generalized, recommended procedure for catchments with data scarcity to perform the multi-objective calibration.

TI  - Spatial Correlation between Ecosystem Services and Human Disturbances: A Case Study of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Exploring the spatial relationship between ecosystem services (ES) and human disturbance intensity (HDI) is vital for maintaining regional ecological security. This study aims to explore the spatial correlation between ES and HDI in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) and provide meaningful implications for coastal ecological planning. Multi-source remote sensing data, remote sensing software, and geographic information system provided initial data and technical support for this research. We integrated four human pressures (population, land-use, traffic, and energy) to map the HDI in the GBA for 2018. Coastal ES were comprehensively considered and spatially visualized by extracting the ES sources. The geographically weighted Pearson correlation coefficient and bivariate local Moran were used to quantitatively reflect and spatially visualize the detailed relationship between ES and HDI. Our study presents several key findings. First, the central and southern parts of the GBA are under strong HDI, dominated by a dense population and intense land utilization. Second, the kernel density of ES sources can better manifest the spatial distribution of ES objectively in comparison to the traditional model calculation. Provisioning services mainly originate from the periphery of the central cities; cultural services are highly concentrated in the heartland of the GBA; and regulating and maintenance services have high density in the outermost regions. Third, ES and HDI have a significant correlation, and the geographically weighted Pearson correlation coefficient and local indicator of spatial association cluster maps illustrate that unlike the global findings, the local correlation is spatially nonstationary as the local scale is affected by specific human activities, natural conditions, regional development, and other local factors. Four, high-capacity regions of ES provision are mainly under high HDI. Areas with high provisioning service values are mainly affected by population and traffic pressure, whereas regulating and maintenance services and cultural services are mainly dominated by high-density populations. Regulating and maintenance services are also affected by land-use pressure. We determine that human disturbance has negative spillover effects on ES, which should be the focus in regional ecological planning.

TI  - Adjunctive hyperbaric oxygen treatment for necrotising soft-tissue infections: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - DIVING AND HYPERBARIC MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction: Surgical intervention, broad-spectrum antibiotics and intensive care support are the standard of care in the treatment of necrotising soft-tissue infections (NSTI). Hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT) may be a useful adjunctive treatment and has been used for almost 60 years, but its efficacy remains unknown and has not been systematically appraised. The aim was to systematically review and synthesise the highest level of clinical evidence available to support or refute the use of HBOT in the treatment of NSTI.Methods: The review was prospectively registered (PROSPERO; CRD42020148706). MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and CINAHL were searched for eligible studies that reported outcomes in both HBOT treated and non-HBOT treated individuals with NSTI. In-hospital mortality was the primary outcome. Odds ratio (ORs) were pooled using random-effects models.Results: The search identified 486 papers of which 31 were included in the qualitative synthesis and 21 in the meta-analyses. Meta-analysis on 48,744 patients with NSTI (1,237 (2.5%) HBOT versus 47,507 (97.5%) non-HBOT) showed in-hospital mortality was 4,770 of 48,744 patients overall (9.8%) and the pooled OR was 0.44 (95% CI 0.33-0.58) in favour of HBOT. For major amputation the pooled OR was 0.60 (95% CI 0.28-1.28) in favour of HBOT. The dose of oxygen in these studies was incompletely reported.Conclusions: Meta-analysis of the non-random comparative data indicates patients with NSTI treated with HBOT have reduced odds of dying during the sentinel event and may be less likely to require a major amputation. The most effective dose of oxygen remains unclear.

TI  - Estimation of Surface Canopy Water in Pacific Northwest Forests by Fusing Radar, Lidar, and Meteorological Data
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface Canopy Water (SCW) is the intercepted rain water that resides within the tree canopy and plays a significant role in the hydrological cycle. Challenges arise in measuring SCW in remote areas using traditional ground-based techniques. Remote sensing in the radio spectrum has the potential to overcome the challenges where traditional modelling approaches face difficulties. In this study, we aim at estimating the SCW by fusing information extracted from the radar imagery acquired with the Sentinel-1 constellation, aerial laser scanning, and meteorological data. To describe the change of radar backscatter with moisture, we focused on six forest stands in the H.J. Andrews experimental forest in central Oregon, as well as four clear cut areas and one golf course, over the summers of 2015-2017. We found significant relationships when we executed the analysis on radar images in which individual tree crowns were delineated from lidar, as opposed to SCW estimated from individual pixel backscatter. Significant differences occur in the mean backscatter between radar images taken during rain vs. dry periods (no rain for >1 h), but these effects only last for roughly 30 min after the end of a rain event. We developed a predictive model for SCW using the radar images acquired at dawn, and proved the capability of space-based radar systems to provide information for estimation of the canopy moisture under conditions of fresh rainfall during the dry season.

TI  - The state of agricultural landscapes in the Mediterranean: smallholder agriculture and land abandonment in terraced landscapes of the Ricote Valley, southeast Spain
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The fast and broad adoption of mechanization and chemical inputs in Mediterranean terraced agriculture, combined with warming climate trends, has led to the progressive degradation of environmental and social conditions. These factors have concurred with the increasing abandonment of smallholder agriculture. We aimed to detect and quantify the progression of cultivated and abandoned terraced fields in the Ricote Valley between 2016 and 2019 while also exploring reasons for land abandonment over the past decades. To quantify cultivated and abandoned agricultural terraces, we conducted (1) a terrace detection based on Lidar and cadaster data, (2) a land use classification based on Sentinel imagery, and (3) an investigation of the reasons for land abandonment based on participant observation and an expert survey. Our results show high rates of abandonment compared to the total available agricultural terraced area in the Ricote Valley. In 2016, 56% of the detected terraced area was classified as not cultivated. In 2019, the percentage decreased to 40%. Small parcels are cultivated to a higher percentage than large or medium-sized parcels. We identified five main reasons underlying land abandonment: (1) low income of farmers; (2) land fragmentation resulting in higher transaction costs; (3) lack of interest in agricultural activities among young generations; (4) lack of modernization; and (5) emotional bonds preventing the sale of abandoned parcels. We stressed the importance of a place-based mixed method approach to gain a comprehensive understanding of the specificities of a given research area.

TI  - Hair Fescue and Sheep Sorrel Identification Using Deep Learning in Wild Blueberry Production
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are an emerging technology that provide an opportunity to increase agricultural efficiency through remote sensing and automatic inferencing of field conditions. This paper examined the novel use of CNNs to identify two weeds, hair fescue and sheep sorrel, in images of wild blueberry fields. Commercial herbicide sprayers provide a uniform application of agrochemicals to manage patches of these weeds. Three object-detection and three image-classification CNNs were trained to identify hair fescue and sheep sorrel using images from 58 wild blueberry fields. The CNNs were trained using 1280x720 images and were tested at four different internal resolutions. The CNNs were retrained with progressively smaller training datasets ranging from 3780 to 472 images to determine the effect of dataset size on accuracy. YOLOv3-Tiny was the best object-detection CNN, detecting at least one target weed per image with F-1-scores of 0.97 for hair fescue and 0.90 for sheep sorrel at 1280 x 736 resolution. Darknet Reference was the most accurate image-classification CNN, classifying images containing hair fescue and sheep sorrel with F-1-scores of 0.96 and 0.95, respectively at 1280 x 736. MobileNetV2 achieved comparable results at the lowest resolution, 864 x 480, with F-1-scores of 0.95 for both weeds. Training dataset size had minimal effect on accuracy for all CNNs except Darknet Reference. This technology can be used in a smart sprayer to control target specific spray applications, reducing herbicide use. Future work will involve testing the CNNs for use on a smart sprayer and the development of an application to provide growers with field-specific information. Using CNNs to improve agricultural efficiency will create major cost-savings for wild blueberry producers.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - PURPOSE: To describe the results of MRI (magnetic resonance image) guided ROLL (radioguided occult lesion localization) and SNOLL (sentinel node occult lesion localization) in the localization of residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer, as well as assessing the surgical results obtained and disease free survival.METHODS: Prospective observational analysis of 132 patients with 136 tumors, treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy at our hospital between 2011-2017. Residual disease was located presurgically with MRI guided ROLL/SNOLL technique. We analyzed technical aspects of localization, and variables corresponding to surgical procedures and events occurred during follow-up.RESULTS: The median tumor size was of 20.5mm (interquartilic range [IQR]: 14-28). The majority (96.3%) were invasive ductal carcinomas. Sentinel lymph node detection rate was 98.9%. Complete pathological response (CPR) in the breast was achieved in 58.1% of cases. The rate of affected margins in 89 cases operated by conservative surgery was 2.2%. With a median follow-up of 50 months (IQR: 37-61) we found a 7.4% rate of relapses. Of these, seven were loco-regional and three at distant sites. The estimated mean of disease-free survival time was 83.2 months (Confidence Interval [CI] 95%: 79.6-86.6).CONCLUSIONS: MRI guided ROLL/SNOLL is a great tool for breast cancer residual disease localization following neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In addition, this technique attains good loco-regional control of the diseases and has excellent surgical results.

TI  - Surgical Management of the Breast and Axilla after Neoadjuvant Therapy
T2  - CHIRURGIA
M3  - Review
AB  - The indications for the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for the management of breast cancer have broadened immensely in recent years. Initially intended mostly for inoperable breast cancers, this modality has then became the standard of care for locally advanced cancers. This treatment allowed safe surgical margin resection and in many patients with large tumors it allowed breast conserving surgery, avoiding the need for mastectomy. As clinical experience with NAC has increased along with the introduction of novel medications and better understanding of tumor biology, the indications for its use have become even more common for the treatment of some subtypes of early breast cancer. Furthermore, the use of NAC was found to have an impact on decreasing the need for axillary lymph node dissection in selected patients presenting initially with positive lymph nodes. This article will review the current practice and indications of NAC in breast cancer as well as some controversial issues regarding the surgical management of the breast and the axilla following neoadjuvant treatment.

TI  - Tantric Metaseity in the <i>Rig</i> <i>Veda</i>'s "Creation Hymn": A Sarkarian Reading and New Translation of X.129
T2  - CONCENTRIC-LITERARY AND CULTURAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Western surveys of idealism have historically overlooked Indian sources as scholars were unfamiliar with Indian metaphysics and lacked appropriate exegetical translations of India's ancient Sanskrit spiritual literature. But millennia before the (Neo)Platonists conceived their idealist arguments, Indian sages who meditated on causal consciousness produced esoteric teachings, metaphorical descriptions of abstract states, and influential philosophical ideas that shaped the ancient worldview of monistic idealism. Many Indologists argue that the Vedic religion introduced by the prehistorical or ancient Aryan migrants into northern India catalyzed the growth of later Hindu traditions that regard Brahman (Metaseity) as the supreme ontological entity. However, P. R. Sarkar tilts the origins of Indian idealism away from this monolithic Vedic source with his polemical claim that indigenous Siva Tantra initially existed independently from Aryan Vedic beliefs and propitiatory rites. This essay therefore interrogates the first ancient expression of metaphysics in India through a new translation and reinterpretation of the R.g Veda's canonical "Creation Hymn," mediated by Sarkar's Tantric historiography and spiritual metaphysics. By engaging with Sarkar's emic claim for Tantra's spiritual and epistemic influences on Vedic thought, I reconstruct the Creation Hymn's influential monistic ontology to explain its radical departure from the R.g Veda's traditional sacerdotalism. It is proposed that monistic idealism likely originated in India and that the Creation Hymn is the first textual evidence of this philosophy infused with proto-Tantra.

TI  - Spatial and Multi-Temporal Analysis of Land Surface Temperature through Landsat 8 Images: Comparison of Algorithms in a Highly Polluted City (Granada)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past decade, satellite imaging has become a habitual way to determine the land surface temperature (LST). One means entails the use of Landsat 8 images, for which mono window (MW), single channel (SC) and split window (SW) algorithms are needed. Knowing the precision and seasonal variability of the LST can improve urban climate alteration studies, which ultimately help make sustainable decisions in terms of the greater resilience of cities. In this study we determine the LST of a mid-sized city, Granada (Spain), applying six Landsat 8 algorithms that are validated using ambient temperatures. In addition to having a unique geographical location, this city has high pollution and high daily temperature variations, so that it is a very appropriate site for study. Altogether, 11 images with very low cloudiness were taken into account, distributed between November 2019 and October 2020. After data validation by means of R-2 statistical analysis, the root mean square error (RMSE), mean bias error (MBE) and standard deviation (SD) were determined to obtain the coefficients of correlation. Panel data analysis is presented as a novel element with respect to the methods usually used. Results reveal that the SC algorithms prove more effective and reliable in determining the LST of the city studied here.

TI  - Time-Series Prediction Approaches to Forecasting Deformation in Sentinel-1 InSAR Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Time series of displacement are now routinely available from satellite InSAR and are used for flagging anomalous ground motion, but not yet forecasting. We test conventional time series forecasting methods such as SARIMA and supervised machine learning approaches such as long short-term memory (LSTM) compared to simple function extrapolation. We focus initially on forecasting seasonal signals and begin by characterizing the time-series using sinusoid fitting, seasonal decomposition, and autocorrelation functions. We find that the three measures are broadly comparable but identify different types of seasonal characteristic. We use this to select a set of 310 points with highly seasonal characteristics and test the three chosen forecasting methods over prediction windows of 1-9 months. The lowest overall median RMSE values are obtained for SARIMA when considering short term predictions (<1 month), whereas sinusoid extrapolation produces the lowest median RMSE values for longer predictions (>6 months). Machine learning methods (LSTM) perform less well. We then test the prediction methods on 2,000 randomly selected points with a range of seasonalities and find that simple extrapolation of a constant function performed better overall than any of the more sophisticated time series prediction methods. Comparisons between seasonality and RMSE show a small improvement in performance with increasing seasonality. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the potential of time-series prediction for InSAR data but also highlights the limitations of applying these techniques to nonperiodic signals or individual measurement points. We anticipate future developments, especially to shorter timescales, will have a broad range of potential applications, from infrastructure stability to volcanic eruptions.

TI  - High-Resolution Estimates of Fire Severity-An Evaluation of UAS Image and LiDAR Mapping Approaches on a Sedgeland Forest Boundary in Tasmania, Australia
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - With an increase in the frequency and severity of wildfires across the globe and resultant changes to long-established fire regimes, the mapping of fire severity is a vital part of monitoring ecosystem resilience and recovery. The emergence of unoccupied aircraft systems (UAS) and compact sensors (RGB and LiDAR) provide new opportunities to map fire severity. This paper conducts a comparison of metrics derived from UAS Light Detecting and Ranging (LiDAR) point clouds and UAS image based products to classify fire severity. A workflow which derives novel metrics describing vegetation structure and fire severity from UAS remote sensing data is developed that fully utilises the vegetation information available in both data sources. UAS imagery and LiDAR data were captured pre- and post-fire over a 300 m by 300 m study area in Tasmania, Australia. The study area featured a vegetation gradient from sedgeland vegetation (e.g., button grass 0.2 m) to forest (e.g., Eucalyptus obliqua and Eucalyptus globulus 50m). To classify the vegetation and fire severity, a comprehensive set of variables describing structural, textural and spectral characteristics were gathered using UAS images and UAS LiDAR datasets. A recursive feature elimination process was used to highlight the subsets of variables to be included in random forest classifiers. The classifier was then used to map vegetation and severity across the study area. The results indicate that UAS LiDAR provided similar overall accuracy to UAS image and combined (UAS LiDAR and UAS image predictor values) data streams to classify vegetation (UAS image: 80.6%; UAS LiDAR: 78.9%; and Combined: 83.1%) and severity in areas of forest (UAS image: 76.6%, UAS LiDAR: 74.5%; and Combined: 78.5%) and areas of sedgeland (UAS image: 72.4%; UAS LiDAR: 75.2%; and Combined: 76.6%). These results indicate that UAS SfM and LiDAR point clouds can be used to assess fire severity at very high spatial resolution.

TI  - Green change in the core build-up areas of China: Information from MODIS data
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban built-up areas are the core area of global population agglomeration, where the interactions between human beings and the surrounding ecological environment supporting their survival are particularly intense. With the acceleration of urbanization since the 21st century, the level of green vegetation in the core built-up area (CBA) and its response to human activities are of great interest. In this study, an innovative green index (GI) was developed for evaluating green level in CBA from three aspects of "quantity-stability-balance". GI can be measured by integrating MODIS EVI data and metrics including green coverage index, nearest neighbor index, and coefficient of variance. Spatiotemporal pattern, regional differences and geographical variances of green level during 2001-2018 in China's CBAs were explored using geographic analysis methods (i.e. mutation test, trend analysis, spatial autocorrelation, Theil index, and scale variance). Results showed that during 2001-2018, GI and its different aspects of green coverage (GC), green stability (GS), and the balance of the greenness distribution (BGD) were generally high in South China and low in North China. Average green level in China's CBAs experienced a V-shaped change. Green level in 54.58% of CBAs indicated mutation phenomenon, and the green level in most of these CBAs improved after the turning point. Regional differences in green level were reduced, and gaps within group were far larger than gaps between groups. Scale variance in green level at the regional, provincial, and city levels fell by 96.91%, 53.27%, and 46%, respectively, and the contribution of the difference at the city level to total difference in China was far higher than that at the provincial and regional levels. More attention should be paid to green in CBA at the city level, and sustainable urban development and land management policies should be implemented in the future.

TI  - Predicting Skipjack Tuna Fishing Grounds in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean Based on High-Spatial-Temporal-Resolution Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Skipjack tuna are the most abundant commercial species in Taiwan's pelagic purse seine fisheries. However, the rapidly changing marine environment increases the challenge of locating target fish in the vast ocean. The aim of this study was to identify the potential fishing grounds of skipjack tuna in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO). The fishing grounds of skipjack tuna were simulated using the habitat suitability index (HSI) on the basis of global fishing activities and remote sensing data from 2012 to 2015. The selected environmental factors included sea surface temperature and front, sea surface height, sea surface salinity, mixed layer depth, chlorophyll a concentration, and finite-size Lyapunov exponents. The final input factors were selected according to their percentage contribution to the total efforts. Overall, 68.3% of global datasets and 35.7% of Taiwanese logbooks' fishing spots were recorded within 5 km of suitable habitat in the daily field. Moreover, 94.9% and 79.6% of global and Taiwan data, respectively, were identified within 50 km of suitable habitat. Our results showed that the model performed well in fitting daily forecast and actual fishing position data. Further, results from this study could benefit habitat monitoring and contribute to managing sustainable fisheries for skipjack tuna by providing wide spatial coverage information on habitat variation.

TI  - Pan-Sharpening via Multiscale Dynamic Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pan-sharpening is an effective method to obtain high-resolution multispectral images by fusing panchromatic (PAN) images with fine spatial structure and low-resolution multispectral images with rich spectral information. In this article, a multiscale pan-sharpening method based on dynamic convolutional neural network is proposed. The filters in dynamic convolution are generated dynamically and locally by the filter generation network which is different from the standard convolution and strengthens the adaptivity of the network. The dynamic filters are adaptively changed according to the input images. The proposed multiscale dynamic convolutions extract detail feature of PAN image at different scales. Multiscale network structure is beneficial to obtain effective detail features. The weights obtained by the weight generation network are used to adjust the relationship among the detail features in each scale. The GeoEye-1, QuickBird, and WorldView-3 data are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Compared with the widely used state-of-the-art pan-sharpening approaches, the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of both objective quality indexes and visual performance.

TI  - Influenza Surveillance Trends and Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Among Department of Defense Beneficiaries During the 2019-2020 Influenza Season.
T2  - MSMR
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Laboratory-based influenza surveillance was conducted in the 2019-2020 influenza season among Department of Defense (DoD) beneficiaries through the DoD Global Respiratory Pathogen Surveillance Program (DoDGRS). Sentinel and participating sites submitted 28,176 specimens for clinical diagnostic testing. A total of 5,529 influenza-positive cases were identified. Starting at surveillance week 45 (3-9 November 2019), influenza B was the predominant influenza type, followed by high activity of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 three weeks thereafter. Both influenza B and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 were then highly co-circulated through surveillance week 13 (22-28 March 2020). End-of-season influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) was estimated using a test-negative case-control study design. The adjusted end-of-season VE for all beneficiaries, regardless of influenza type or subtype, was 46% (95% confidence interval: 40%-52%). The influenza vaccine was moderately effective against influenza viruses during the 2019-2020 influenza season.

TI  - Improved estimation of gross primary production of paddy rice cropland with changing model parameters over phenological transitions
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - Paddy rice is one of the main grain crops in the world. Accurate estimations of the gross primary production (GPP) of paddy rice are essential for assessing rice grain production and monitoring the carbon cycle in paddy fields with the aim of providing ideal conditions for crops throughout the growing season. Several studies have demonstrated the advantages of combining the eddy covariance technique with remotely sensed data to model GPP at CO2 eddy flux tower sites. As paddy rice continuously changes during its growth and development, and important growth events frequently occur, it is critical to observe the growing conditions at various stages of the process. To better understand the variations in GPP at different growth stages, two key parameters that drive the vegetation photosynthesis model (VPM) are analyzed and estimated at various phenological phases. Specifically, general piecewise logistic functions are used to extract phenological transitions from data at four paddy rice flux tower sites. The maximum light-use efficiency (LUE) and optimum temperature are estimated from these phenological transitions, and these indicators are used to drive the VPM to simulate GPP over multiple years at the four sites. The simulation results show that GPP based on our phenological transition-based VPM (GPP(PVPM)) agrees reasonably well with the variations of GPP estimated from CO2 flux data (GPP(EC)) (R-2 > 0.9). In addition, a comparison indicates that GPP(PVPM) tracks the seasonal dynamics of GPP(EC) better than GPP estimated from the original VPM. Furthermore, GPP based on the improved maximum LUE is lower than GPP(EC) at most flux sites and GPP based on the improved optimum temperature is higher than GPP(EC). These comparisons imply that the maximum LUE and optimum temperature estimated in the phenological transitions of paddy rice are beneficial to enhance the accuracy of GPP estimation. The improved estimation of GPP provides phenological insights into the temporal dynamics of vegetation photosynthesis in paddy fields.

TI  - Transmission pattern of the parasitic dinoflagellate Hematodinium perezi in polyculture ponds of coastal China
T2  - AQUACULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Since 2012, Hematodinium perezi epizootics have occurred frequently in cultured swimming crabs Portunus trituberculatus in polyculture ponds along the coast of Shandong Province, China. These outbreaks have resulted in significant economic losses to local farmers. The cryptic transmission pattern of H. perezi has hampered the prevention and control of the pathogen in affected farms. The mudflat crab Helice tientsinensis is one of the dominant wild crabs in the region with considerable prevalence of the parasitic infection covering the full culture period of P. trituberculatus. Mudflat crabs can migrate in and out of polyculture ponds during water exchange and may act as an important reservoir host and source of H. perezi for newly seeded P. trituberculatus. During 2019, we carried out continuous field investigations and sentinel experiments in the polyculture pond system, as well as a series of laboratory infection trials, to study whether waterborne transmission of H. perezi can occur in polyculture ponds, and to determine whether H. perezi can be transmitted from H. tientsinensis to cultured P. trituberculatus. The sentinel experiment verified waterborne transmission of H. perezi to cultured P. trituberculatus in the polyculture pond. The cohabitation trial further indicated that H. perezi was transmittable from H. tientsinensis to P. trituberculatus through waterborne transmission, whereas P. trituberculatus was not able to acquire H. perezi infection by feeding on tissues of infected H. tientsinensis. The results highlighted the transmission pattern of the parasitic dinoflagellate H. perezi in the polyculture pond systems widely used along the coast line of China. In addition, the mudflat crab H. tientsinensis was confirmed as a reservoir host of H. perezi in the epidemic area, and confirmed as the likely source of the parasite during the intensive culture of P. trituberculatus.

TI  - Rice Inundation Assessment Using Polarimetric UAVSAR Data
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Irrigated rice requires intense water management under typical agronomic practices. Cost effective tools to improve the efficiency and assessment of water use is a key need for industry and resource managers to scale ecosystem services. In this research we advance model-based decomposition and machine learning to map inundated rice using time-series polarimetric, L-band Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) observations. Simultaneous ground truth observations recorded water depth inundation during the 2019 crop season using instrumented fields across the study site in Arkansas, USA. A three-component model-based decomposition generated metrics representing surface-, double bounce-, and volume-scattering along with a shape factor, randomness factor, and the Radar Vegetation Index (RVI). These physically meaningful metrics characterized crop inundation status independent of growth stage including under dense canopy cover. Machine learning (ML) comparisons employed Random Forest (RF) using the UAVSAR derived parameters to identify cropland inundation status across the region. Outcomes show that RVI, proportion of the double-bounce within total scattering, and the relative comparison between the double-bounce and the volume scattering have moderate to strong mechanistic ability to identify rice inundation status with Overall Accuracy (OA) achieving 75%. The use of relative ratios further helped mitigate the impacts of far range incidence angles. The RF approach, which requires training data, achieved a higher OA and Kappa of 88% and 71%, respectively, when leveraging multiple SAR parameters. Thus, the combination of physical characterization and ML provides a powerful approach to retrieving cropland inundation under the canopy. The growth of polarimetric L-band availability should enhance cropland inundation metrics beyond open water that are required for tracking water quantity at field scale over large areas.

TI  - An updated MODIS global urban extent product (MGUP) from 2001 to 2018 based on an automated mapping approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate global urban maps are fundamental in monitoring urbanization process and understanding environmental degradation. Therefore, this paper proposed a locally adaptive and fully automated global mapping method and produced an updated 250 m MODIS global urban area product (MGUP) from 2001 to 2018. The proposed approach mainly consists of 1) automated samples extraction from existing global products, 2) locally adaptive samples selection and trained classification in each 5 degrees x 5 degrees grid, and 3) post-processing in terms of the spatio-temporal context. To validate the product, 9 groups of samples for every two years from 2001 to 2018, amounting to over 150,000 sample points, were collected manually from Landsat imagery as global validation dataset. Accuracy assessment indicates that MGUP has a F-score of 0.88, achieving better results than the contemporary global products, i.e., MCD12Q1.v5 (0.82), MCD12Q1.v6 (0.86), and CCI-LC (0.86). Analysis of urban expansion based on MGUP shows that the world's urban area increased to 802233 km(2) and accounted for 0.54% of the Earth's land surface in 2018. The total global urban area expanded by 1.68 times from 2001 to 2018. At continent level, urban density varies considerably, and the highest and lowest one is in Europe (1.78%) and Oceania (0.15%), respectively. At national level, large increment of urban area mainly occurs in North America, Asia, and South America; and countries having high growth rates are mainly developing countries in Africa and Asia.

TI  - Reproductive Toxicity of 3,4-dichloroaniline (3,4-DCA) on Javanese Medaka (<i>Oryzias</i> <i>javanicus</i>, Bleeker 1854)
T2  - ANIMALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple SummaryCompound 3,4-dichloroaniline (3,4-DCA) is a degradation product of some herbicide and intermediate industrial chemicals of many products. Unregulated use of 3,4-DCA affects the reproduction of non-target organisms. In this study, the potential reproductive toxicity of 3,4-DCA on Javanese medaka, a native sentinel organism distributed around aquatic ecosystems of Southern Asia, was evaluated. Low fecundity was observed in female exposed fish to 250 mu g/L of 3,4-DCA. Gonad tissue alternation and interference of gametes development were observed both in male and female exposed fish. The response pattern indicated that a low concentration of 3,4-DCA exerted endocrine disruption in Javanese medaka. This finding would provide additional data on the toxicity effect of 3,4-DCA, and it will strengthen the potential of native species in monitoring local and regional aquatic environments.Compound 3,4-dichloroaniline (3,4-DCA) is a metabolite of several urea herbicides and intermediate chemical of several industrial products. Moreover, 3,4-DCA has been frequently detected in aquatic ecosystems around the world. This aniline is more toxic than the parent chemicals, and it affects non-target organisms. This study evaluated a 21-day reproductive response of an emerging aquatic vertebrate model, Javanese medaka (Oryzias javanicus), exposed to 3,4-DCA. Fecundity and gonads histopathology were observed. The spawning rate and fertilisation reduced significantly in the highest exposed-group (250 mu g/L). Gonadosomatic index (GSI) was significantly low in females exposed to 250 mu g/L. No substantial structural alteration of male gonads. However, oocyte development and ovarian cell structure were disrupted in 250 mu g/L exposed females. The gonadal developmental was not affected in the males; however, a significant reduction in the developmental of female gonads was observed at 250 mu g/L. These results show that 3,4-DCA interfere with the reproduction of Javanese medaka through fecundity and alteration of gonadal tissues.

TI  - Particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub>) generation map using MODIS Level-1 satellite images and deep neural network
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Most studies about particulate matter (PM) estimation have been done based on satellite-derived optical depth aerosol (AOD) products. But, the use of AOD products having coarse resolution is not possible for PM map generation in small spatial coverage such as local cities. To solve this issue, a PM estimation framework is proposed in this work which accepts the original calibrated radiance of MODIS-Level 1 images as input. There are no intermediate computations for atmospheric reflectance or aerosol thickness calculation. A deep neural network consisting of recurrent layers is proposed to extract the relationship between the grey level values of the satellite image bands and the PM measurements in different days and locations. Two individual networks are trained for PM2.5 and PM(10 )concentrations. The PM2.5 map and PM10 map of Tehran city are generated. The performance of the proposed method is compared with several recently published air pollution studies. The results show that the proposed method is a simple, low cost and efficient approach for PM generation of small-scaled coverage using free available Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images.

TI  - Application of Data Assimilation and the Relationship between ENSO and Precipitation
T2  - MATHEMATICAL AND COMPUTATIONAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change in Thailand is related to the El Nino and Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon, in particular drought and heavy precipitation. The data assimilation method is used to improve the accuracy of the Ensemble Intermediate Coupled Model (EICM) that simulates the sea surface temperature (SST). The four-dimensional variational (4D-Var) and three-dimensional variational (3D-Var) schemes have been used for data assimilation purposes. The simulation was performed by the model with and without data assimilation from satellite data in 2011. The result shows that the model with data assimilation is better than the model without data assimilation. The 4D-Var scheme is the best method, with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.492 and a Correlation Coefficient of 0.684. The relationship between precipitation in Thailand and the ENSO area in Nino 3.4 was consistent for seven months, with a correlation coefficient of -0.882.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy with one-step nucleic acid assay relegates the need for preoperative ultrasound-guided biopsy staging of the axilla in patients with early stage breast cancer
T2  - MOLECULAR AND CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Avoiding axillary node clearance in patients with early stage breast cancer and low-burden node-positive axillary disease is an emerging practice. Informing the decision to adopt axillary conservation is examined by comparing routine preoperative axillary staging using ultrasound (AUS) +/- AUS biopsy (AUSB) with intraoperative staging using sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and a one-step nucleic acid cytokeratin-19 amplification assay (OSNA). A single-centre, retrospective cohort study of 1,315 consecutive new diagnoses of breast cancer in 1,306 patients was undertaken in the present study. An AUS +/- AUSB was performed on all patients as part of their initial assessment. Patients who had a normal ultrasound (AUS-) or negative biopsy (AUSB-) followed by SLNB with OSNA +/- axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), and those with a positive AUSB (AUSB+), were assessed. Tests for association were determined using a chi(2) and Fisher's Exact test. A total of 266 (20.4%) patients with cT1-3 cN0 staging received 271 AUSBs. Of these, 205 biopsies were positive and 66 were negative. The 684 patients with an AUS-/AUSB-assessment proceeded to SLNB with OSNA. AUS sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) were 0.53 [0.44-0.62; 95% confidence interval (CI)] and 0.58 (0.53-0.64, 95% CI), respectively. Using a total tumour load cut-off of 15,000 copies/mu l to predict >= 2 macro-metastases, the sensitivity and NPV for OSNA were 0.82 (0.71-0.92, 95% CI) and 0.98 (0.97-0.99, 95% CI) (OSNA vs. AUS P<0.0001). Of the AUSB+ patients, 51% had <= 2 positive nodes following ALND and were potentially over-treated. Where available, SLNB with OSNA should replace AUSB for axillary assessment in cT1-2 cN0 patients with <= 2 indeterminate nodes seen on AUS.

TI  - Combining Optical Remote Sensing, McFLI Discharge Estimation, Global Hydrologic Modeling, and Data Assimilation to Improve Daily Discharge Estimates Across an Entire Large Watershed
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing has gained attention as a novel source of primary information for estimating river discharge, and the Mass-conserved Flow Law Inversion (McFLI) approach has successfully estimated river discharge in ungauged basins solely from optical satellite data. However, McFLI currently suffers from two major drawbacks: (1) existing optical satellites lead to temporally and spatially sparse discharge estimates and (2) because of the assumptions required, McFLI cannot guarantee downstream flow continuity. Hydrological modeling has neither drawback, yet model accuracy is frequently limited by a lack of discharge observations. We therefore combine McFLI and models in a data assimilation framework applicable globally. We establish a daily "ungauged" baseline model for 28,998 reaches of the Missouri river basin forced by recently published global runoff data, which we do not calibrate. We estimate discharge via McFLI using similar to 1 million width measurements made from 12,000 Landsat scenes and assimilate McFLI into the model before validating at 403 USGS gauges. Results show that assimilated discharges did not impair already accurate baseline flows and achieved median improvements of 28% normalized root mean square error, 0.50 Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and 0.23 Kling-Gupta efficiency where baseline performance was poor (defined as baseline negative NSE, 225/403 reaches). We ultimately improved flows at 92% of these originally poorly modeled gauges, even though Landsat images only provide McFLI discharges at 1.5% of reaches and 26% of simulated days. Our results suggest that the combination of McFLI and state-of-the-art hydrology models can improve flow estimations in ungauged basins globally.

TI  - Health monitoring of refugees in reception centres for asylum seekers: Decentralized surveillance network for the analysis of routine medical data.
T2  - Journal of health monitoring
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Refugees and asylum seekers living in reception centres tend to be not adequately included in population-based studies, routine medical data and official statistics. As part of the research project 'Health and primary-care sentinel surveillance in reception- and accommodation-centres for asylum-seekers in Germany' (PriCare), a health-monitoring approach was developed for the secondary use of routine medical data from on-site outpatient clinics in reception centres. To this end, a software application (Refugee Care Manager, RefCare©) for the digitisation and harmonisation of medical records was designed and implemented in reception centres in three German federal states. The approach of distributed computing in a surveillance network allows for the decentralised, harmonised analysis of the routine medical data stored in RefCare© in a manner that fully complies with data protection regulations and circumvents the need for centralised data storage. RefCare© provides an integrated surveillance feature that enables analyses of 64 indicators on population, morbidity, healthcare processes and quality of care to be undertaken across multiple facilities. This article describes the conceptual and practical approach and the technical procedures put in place to do so, and provides examples of the results that have been gained so far.

TI  - A Surging Glacier Recognized by Remote Sensing on the Zangser Kangri Ice Field, Central Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A glacier surge, which is quasi-periodic and involves rapid flow, is an abnormal glacier motion. Although some glaciers have been found to be surging, little is known about surging glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau (TP), especially the Central and Northern TP. Here, we found a surging glacier (GLIMS ID: G085885E34389N) on the Zangser Kangri ice field (ZK), Central TP, by means of the digital elevation models (DEMs) from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), TanDEM-X 90 m, Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) DEMs, and High Mountain Asia 8-m DEM (HMA), combined with Landsat images and the Global Land Ice Velocity Extraction from Landsat 8 (GoLIVE) dataset. This surge event was confirmed by the crevasses, shear margin, and visible advancing snout shown in the Landsat images produced since 2014 and the HMA. The inter-comparison of these DEMs and the surface velocity changes showed that the surge event started between October 2012 and January 2014. The glacier may have also surged in the 1970s, based on a comparison between the topographical map and Landsat images. The glacier mass balance here has been slightly positive from 1999 onward (+0.03 +/- 0.06 m w.e.a(-1) from 1999 to 2015, +0.02 +/- 0.07 m w.e.a(-1) from 1999 to December 2011), which may indicate that the ZK is located on the southern edge of the mass balance anomaly on the TP. Combining with other surging glaciers on the Central and Northern TP, the relatively balanced mass condition, large size, and shallow slope can be associated with glacier surges on the Central and Northern TP.

TI  - Modeled Response of South American Climate to Three Decades of Deforestation
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the potential effects of historical deforestation in South America using a regional climate model driven with reanalysis data. Two different sources of data were used to quantify deforestation during the 1980s to 2010s, leading to two scenarios of forest loss: smaller but spatially continuous in scenario 1 and larger but spatially scattered in scenario 2. The model simulates a generally warmer and drier local climate following deforestation. Vegetation canopy becomes warmer due to reduced canopy evapotranspiration, and ground becomes warmer due to more radiation reaching the ground. The warming signal for surface air is weaker than for ground and vegetation, likely due to reduced surface roughness suppressing the sensible heat flux. For surface air over deforested areas, the warming signal is stronger for the nighttime minimum temperature and weaker or even becomes a cooling signal for the daytime maximum temperature, due to the strong radiative effects of albedo at midday, which reduces the diurnal amplitude of temperature. The drying signals over deforested areas include lower atmospheric humidity, less precipitation, and drier soil. The model identifies the La Plata basin as a region remotely influenced by deforestation, where a simulated increase of precipitation leads to wetter soil, higher ET, and a strong surface cooling. Over both deforested and remote areas, the deforestation-induced surface climate changes are much stronger in scenario 2 than scenario 1; coarse-resolution data and models (such as in scenario 1) cannot represent the detailed spatial structure of deforestation and underestimate its impact on local and regional climates.

TI  - Long-wavelength lithospheric magnetic field of China
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - We present new regional models, denoted CLAS, of the Chinese lithospheric field, combining the long-wavelength information provided by satellite-derived models: CHAOS-6, MF7, LCS-1 and NGDC720, and an extremely high-quality compilation of 97 994 aeromagnetic survey data with 10 km x 10 km resolution for shorter wavelength. The models are estimated using a depleted basis of global spherical harmonic functions centred on China. CLAS models are determined include harmonic degrees up to 400. Although some accuracy of aeromagnetic data is lost in order to balance the consistent of two data sets, the results show that CLAS models have a high correlation with the satellite models at low-degree terms (degree correlation > 0.9) but with more power at high-degree terms, reflecting more features of the lithospheric field in continental China. Examples of improvement include Changbai mountains, Sichuan Basin and Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. CLAS models have good agreement (coherence > 0.9) with Chinese aeromagnetic data at wavelength down to about 100 km (corresponding to spherical harmonic degree n = 400), filling the usual gap between satellite models and aeromagnetic data. Comparison with aeromagnetic data filtered at 100 km gives good agreement (correlation > 0.95). The residuals between CLAS models and aeromagnetic data are still large (rms > 70 nT), but with most of misfits arising from shorter wavelength fields that the model cannot fit at degree up to 400; such misfit could be reduced by increasing the model degree. We provide a geological example of how the inclusion of satellite data can change the geological conclusions that can be drawn from the magnetic information. However, the two data sets are not completely consistent, future models should start from a reanalysis of the aeromagnetic data and its line levelling to ensure consistency with the satellite model.

TI  - Mapping China's Electronic Power Consumption Using Points of Interest and Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Producing gridded electric power consumption (EPC) maps at a fine geographic scale is critical for rational deployment and effective utilization of electric power resources. Brightness of nighttime light (NTL) has been extensively adopted to evaluate the spatial patterns of EPC at multiple geographical scales. However, the blooming effect and saturation issue of NTL imagery limit its ability to accurately map EPC. Moreover, limited sectoral separation in applying NTL leads to the inaccurate spatial distribution of EPC, particularly in the case of industrial EPC, which is often a dominant portion of the total EPC in China. This study pioneers the separate estimation of spatial patterns of industrial and nonindustrial EPC over mainland China by jointly using points of interest (POIs) and multiple remotely sensed data in a random forests (RF) model. The POIs provided fine and detailed information about the different socioeconomic activities and played a significant role in determining industrial and nonindustrial EPC distribution. Based on the RF model, we produced industrial, non-industrial, and overall EPC maps at a 1 km resolution in mainland China for 2011. Compared against statistical data at the county level, our results showed a high accuracy (R-2 = 0.958 for nonindustrial EPC estimation, 0.848 for industrial EPC estimation, and 0.913 for total EPC). This study indicated that the proposed RF-based method, integrating POIs and multiple remote sensing data, can markedly improve the accuracy for estimating EPC. This study also revealed the great potential of POIs in mapping the distribution of socioeconomic parameters.

AB  - Crop yields need to be improved in a sustainable manner to meet the expected worldwide increase in population over the coming decades as well as the effects of anticipated climate change. Recently, genomics-assisted breeding has become a popular approach to food security; in this regard, the crop breeding community must better link the relationships between the phenotype and the genotype. While high-throughput genotyping is feasible at a low cost, high-throughput crop phenotyping methods and data analytical capacities need to be improved.

TI  - Enhancing Indigenous impact assessment: Lessons from Indigenous planning theory
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Impact assessment faces a number of key challenges. One area singled out as needing attention is community based impact assessment. Impact assessment related to Indigenous communities is a particular case in point. We lend an Indigenous voice to this conversation. The emerging field of Indigenous impact assessment is underdeveloped compared to other forms of IA, particularly in terms of its theoretical foundation. In the article we address that gap by highlighting the current conundrum in Indigenous practice, exemplified in the context of Aotearoa New Zealand. Then we base our deliberation in an Indigenous worldview, applying Indigenous planning theory to impact assessment. Indigenous planning theory has an explicit decolonising agenda that supports communities to reclaim traditional planning approaches. We provide key parameters for establishing a theoretical and practical space for Indigenous IA, and for conceptualising the relationship between Indigenous IA other forms of IA. We argue for a 'third space' that facilitates co-existence of different forms of IA activity rather than integration of Indigenous endeavours into broader IA types. In doing so, we demonstrate the potential of Indigenous planning theory to connect international dialogue and case studies on Indigenous impact assessment, and to broaden and deepen IA theory and practice.

TI  - Synergies Among Environmental Science Research and Monitoring Networks: A Research Agenda
T2  - EARTHS FUTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Many research and monitoring networks in recent decades have provided publicly available data documenting environmental and ecological change, but little is known about the status of efforts to synthesize this information across networks. We convened a working group to assess ongoing and potential cross-network synthesis research and outline opportunities and challenges for the future, focusing on the US-based research network (the US Long-Term Ecological Research network, LTER) and monitoring network (the National Ecological Observatory Network, NEON). LTER-NEON cross-network research synergies arise from the potentials for LTER measurements, experiments, models, and observational studies to provide context and mechanisms for interpreting NEON data, and for NEON measurements to provide standardization and broad scale coverage that complement LTER studies. Initial cross-network syntheses at co-located sites in the LTER and NEON networks are addressing six broad topics: how long-term vegetation change influences C fluxes; how detailed remotely sensed data reveal vegetation structure and function; aquatic-terrestrial connections of nutrient cycling; ecosystem response to soil biogeochemistry and microbial processes; population and species responses to environmental change; and disturbance, stability and resilience. This initial study offers exciting potentials for expanded cross-network syntheses involving multiple long-term ecosystem processes at regional or continental scales. These potential syntheses could provide a pathway for the broader scientific community, beyond LTER and NEON, to engage in cross-network science. These examples also apply to many other research and monitoring networks in the US and globally, and can guide scientists and research administrators in promoting broad-scale research that supports resource management and environmental policy.

TI  - Velamentous cord insertion, ischemic-hypoxic encephalopathy and neurological rehabilitation: A case report
T2  - BIOMEDICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy is a frequent and important cause of neurological problems in the term and preterm newborn. A sentinel event of this entity is the vasa previa, specifically when there is an abnormality of the placenta, type velum insertion of the umbilical cord. There are reports that show the association between these two entities, but the recovery process and neurological prognosis of children with both conditions are scarce in the literature. We present the case of a patient with a history of velum insertion of the umbilical cord and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, who received therapeutic hypothermia (Cool Cap), where his neurological rehabilitation process is described and the percentage of probability of presenting this condition against to the population without these factors. A five-year-old boy with an Apgar index at birth equal to zero at one minute and two at fifteen minutes, who developed severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy secondary to a velum insertion of the umbilical cord without prenatal diagnosis, with great initial neurological and multisystemic compromise. The recovery process included initial multidisciplinary management from neonatal intensive care and a focus on early neurological habilitation. Currently in school, in comprehensive therapies and with physical examination without motor/sensory deficiencies, neuropsychological test suggests risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Children with severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy usually have disabilities due to motor, cognitive and/or behavioral deficiencies. Having received Cool Cap plus a structured rehabilitation process greatly reduced the expected deficiencies according to prognosis and has promoted satisfactory physical and neurological development.

TI  - NOAA-AVHRR Orbital Drift Correction: Validating Methods Using MSG-SEVIRI Data as a Benchmark Dataset
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (NOAA-AVHRR) data provides the possibility to build the longest Land Surface Temperature (LST) dataset to date, starting in 1981 up to the present. However, due to the orbital drift of the NOAA platforms, no LST dataset is available before 2000 and the arrival of newer platforms. Although numerous methods have been developed to correct this orbital drift effect on the LST, a lack of validation has prevented their application. This is the gap we bridge here by using the 15 min temporal resolution of Meteosat Second Generation-Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infra-Red Imager (MSG-SEVIRI) data to simulate drifted and reference LST time series. We then use these time series to validate an orbital drift correction method based on solar zenith angle (SZA) anomalies that we presented in a previous work (C1), as well as two variations of this approach (C0 and C2). Our results show that the C0 method performs better than the two others, although its overall bias absolute value ranges up to 1 K, while standard deviation values remain around 3 K. This is verified for most land covers, for all NOAA platforms, and these statistics remain mostly stable with noise on SZA time series (from 0 degrees to +/- 10 degrees). With this study, we show that orbital drift correction methods can be thoroughly validated and that such validation should aim toward bias absolute values below 0.1 K and standard deviation values around 1.4 K at coarse spatial resolution. To validate other orbital drift correction approaches, the drifted and reference time series used in this work are freely available for download from the first author's webpage. This will be the first step toward the building of an orbital-drift-corrected long-term LST dataset.

TI  - Vertical Accuracy Evaluation of Digital Terrain Model (DTM) ALOS PALSAR-2 in Rote Dead Sea Area - Indonesia
T2  - GEODETSKI LIST
M3  - Review
AB  - Vertical accuracy evaluation is essential to determine in order to know the quality of a DTM. This quality will affect the scale type and utilization of the DTM. The study data use DTM ALOS PALSAR-2. This study evaluates the vertical accuracy of the DTM ALOS PALSAR-2 with different height reference fields in the Rote Dead Sea Area, Indonesia. Each DTM is made with the EGM 1996, EGM 2008, and WGM 2012. The three DTMs extracted based on the height reference field will have different orthometric heights; therefore, an evaluation of the vertical accuracy is needed to determine the quality of the three DTMs. They compare with field measurements from GNSS-levelling. This test is carried out at lowland and highland, using 10 test points. For the lowland area, the RMSE (z) in height at DTM is 1.363 m for WGM 2012, 2.017 m for EGM 2008, and 1.934 m for EGM 1996. For the highlands area, the RMSE (z) in height at DTM is 1.185 m for WGM 2012, 1.201 m for EGM 2008, and 1.432 m for EGM 1996. The DTM-WCM 2012 and DTM-EGM 1996 are recommended to use in this area because they have higher vertical accuracy. The vertical accuracy test in the Rote lowland corresponds to class 2 and class 3 on a scale of 1:10,000. The vertical accuracy test results in the Rote highland correspond to class 1 and class 2 on a scale of 1:10,000. The ALOS PALSAR-2 DTM vertical accuracy test results can he used for mapping scales of 1:10,000 - 1:25,000 in Rote.

TI  - Landslide hazard assessment of the Neom promising city, northwestern Saudi Arabia: An integrated approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides hazard as one of the major environmental threats of the Neom promising city in northwestern Saudi Arabia has been assessed through data integration of several sources including topographic, geologic, and seismologic data sets. Moreover, Landsat imagery and historical landslide data are introduced in assessing landslide susceptibility of the study area. All these data oriented to generate eight thematic layers representing eight landslide conditioning factors. These factors arranged according to their relative importance for landslide susceptibility mapping as follows: slope angle, elevation, curvature, aspect, earthquake density, fault density, drainage density, and lineaments density. These factors were assessed using GIS through a numerical rating scheme for thematic layers. The ranks and weights were given in association with intensive field studies and authors' experiences. The estimated values of Landslide Potential Index (LPI) varies from 32 up to 107. Then, the resultant landslide susceptibility map classifies the landslide hazards into three relative classes of susceptibility: high, moderate, and low. Furthermore, this map was tested through several field checks and the extracted historical landslides within Neom area as well. This landslide susceptibility map will boost decision-making authority while executing the developing projects throughout the Neom promising area either avoiding strategic facilities or applying corrective geotechnical procedures to minimize the landslide hazardous impact for Neom city.

TI  - Using thermal remote sensing in the classification of mountain permafrost landscapes
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermal infrared satellite imagery is increasingly utilized in permafrost studies. One useful application of the land surface temperature (LST) products is classification and mapping of landscapes in permafrost regions, as LST values can help differentiate between frozen and unfrozen ground. This article describes a new approach to the use of LST. The essence of the new approach lies in the fact that in the territory where it is impossible to determine (indicate) the state of the underlying ground according to the same morphological characteristics (relief, vegetation, soil composition, etc.), the LST parameter, which reflects the thermal state of the landscape, allows as an additional criterion (indicator) identify frozen/un-frozen landscapes. In this work, using the above approach, a map has been compiled, which shows the permafrost natural-territorial complexes of the Elkon Massif, Eastern Siberia, including topography, slope aspect, slope angle, vegetation, snow cover and LST. The map provides a more detailed and updated description of permafrost distribution in the study area.

TI  - Evaluation of MODIS and Himawari-8 Low Clouds Retrievals Over the Southern Ocean With In Situ Measurements From the SOCRATES Campaign
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aircraft observations collected during the Southern Ocean Cloud Radiation Aerosol Transport Experimental Study in January-February of 2018 are used to evaluate cloud properties from three satellite-imager datasets: (1) the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer level 2 (collection 6.1) cloud product, (2) the CERES-MODIS Edition 4 cloud product, and (3) the NASA SatCORPS Himawari-8 cloud product. Overall the satellite retrievals compare well with the in situ observations, with little bias and modest to good correlation coefficients when considering all aircraft profiles for which there are coincident MODIS observations. The Himawari-8 product does, however, show a statistically significant mean bias of about 1.2 mu m for effective radius (r(e)) and 2.6 for optical depth (tau) when applied to a larger set of profiles with coincident Himawari-8 observations. The low overall mean-bias in the r(e) retrievals is due in part to compensating errors between cases that are non- or lightly precipitating, with cases that have heavier precipitation. r(e) is slightly biased high (by about 0.5-1.0 mu m) for non- and lightly precipitating cases and biased low by about 3-4 mu m for heavily precipitating cases when precipitation exits near cloud top. The bias in non- and lightly precipitating conditions is due to (at least in part) having assumed a drop size distribution in the retrieval that is too broad. These biases in the r(e) ultimately propagate into the retrieved liquid water path and number concentration.Plain Language Summary Clouds play a crucial role in the weather and climate system. Satellite data can provide useful information on cloud properties (such as the size of the cloud droplets, the amount of the liquid water, and the number of droplets in a given volume of the clouds) over large areas and at high spatial and temporal resolutions. However, satellite cloud properties are determined or retrieved from satellite measurements by employing a variety of simplifying assumptions that can lead to large uncertainties in some conditions. In situ measurements of clouds from aircraft provide more direct observations and can be used as ground truth to evaluate and improve the performance of the satellite retrievals. This study focuses on clouds over the Southern Ocean (SO) and uses aircraft measurements from Southern Ocean Cloud Radiation Aerosol Transport Experimental Study (SOCRATES) in January-February of 2018 to evaluate cloud properties from three satellite observations. It is found that the satellite observations generally compare well with aircraft measurements with little bias. However, satellite observations tend to overestimate the size of the cloud droplets, when clouds are not precipitating or are lightly precipitating, while for clouds with heavier precipitation, the satellite observations tend to underestimate the size of the cloud droplets.

CL  - Chicago, IL
AB  - Marjolin's ulcer (MU) is a rare, aggressive entity with frequent delay in diagnosis for a variety of regions. Although well described and classically taught in medical school, aspects of its treatment remain ill-defined and controversial. A systematic review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines to identify studies discussing patients who underwent surgical treatment of MU. A total of 31 papers, reporting on 1016 patients, were included. Burns were the most common etiology of malignant degeneration (68%), followed by trauma. The lower extremity was most affected (51%) and Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) was found in 94% of cases, with the majority being well differentiated. Basal cell carcinoma and melenoma composed a minority of cases. Melanoma occurred more frequently in previously skin grafted wounds and had a higher rate of metastases than SCC. Most patients did not have associated regional or distant metastases present at diagnosis. Wide local excision (71%) was performed in most cases, unless amputation was indicated for severe disease or bone involvement. Lymphadenectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy were variably reported, with conflicting evidence on the efficacy. Lymphadenectomy was most commonly indicated for known lymph node involvement. In cases of metastatic disease chemotherapy and radiation were used in conjunction with surgical treatment. Despite numerous articles on this topic, controversy remains in the management of MU. Early diagnosis of suspicious chronic wounds and prompt surgical intervention remains imperative to its treatment.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Narrowing Barrier Islands along the Coast of Pakistan over Past 30 Years
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Barrier islands (BIs) are the first line of defense against the sea/wave actions in coastal areas, and assessing their stability is crucial in the context of effective coastal planning. Therefore, this study evaluates the spatial-temporal shoreline changes of the BIs in Pakistan over the past three decades (1989-2018). Satellite data from Landsat missions are used to delineate the shorelines of 19 BIs in Pakistan. After delineating the shorelines from satellite observations, two well-known statistical methods (i.e., end point rate (EPR) and linear regression rate (LRR)) are used to capture the localized changes in the BIs. The results ascertain that nearly all of the BIs have experienced noteworthy erosion during the past three decades. While the mean erosion over all the BIs during the study period is estimated to be >6 m/y, significant spatial heterogeneities among the individual BIs exist. The interdecadal comparison indicates that the highest mean erosion of the BIs occurred during the period 1989-1999 (13.03 +/- 0.62 m/y), which gradually reduced over the preceding decades (i.e., 7.76 +/- 0.62 m/y during the period 1999-2009 and 3.8 +/- 0.7 m/y during the period 2009-2018). Nevertheless, similar to 65% of the total BIs experienced high erosion (>2 m/y), similar to 15% experienced moderate (<2 m/y), and similar to 20% experienced low erosion (<1 m/y) during the period 1989-2018. This situation implies that while similar to 65% of these BIs need immediate interventions from the concerned authorities, the 15% BIs with moderate erosion might experience high erosion in the wake of rising sea levels and decreasing sediment influx in the near future without proper measures. This depletion of the BIs might not only affect Pakistan but also have regional consequences due to their various services.

TI  - Estimating Processing Tomato Water Consumption, Leaf Area Index, and Height Using Sentinel-2 and VENμS Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop monitoring throughout the growing season is key for optimized agricultural production. Satellite remote sensing is a useful tool for estimating crop variables, yet continuous high spatial resolution earth observations are often interrupted by clouds. This paper demonstrates overcoming this limitation by combining observations from two public-domain spaceborne optical sensors. Ground measurements were conducted in the Hula Valley, Israel, over four growing seasons to monitor the development of processing tomato. These measurements included continuous water consumption measurements using an eddy-covariance tower from which the crop coefficient (K-c) was calculated and measurements of Leaf Area Index (LAI) and crop height. Satellite imagery acquired by Sentinel-2 and VEN mu S was used to derive vegetation indices and model K-c, LAI, and crop height. The conjoint use of Sentinel-2 and VEN mu S imagery facilitated accurate estimation of K-c (R-2 = 0.82, RMSE = 0.09), LAI (R-2 = 0.79, RMSE = 1.2), and crop height (R-2 = 0.81, RMSE = 7 cm). Additionally, our empirical models for LAI estimation were found to perform better than the SNAP biophysical processor (R-2 = 0.53, RMSE = 2.3). Accordingly, Sentinel-2 and VEN mu S imagery was demonstrated to be a viable tool for agricultural monitoring.

TI  - ECtHR DECISIONS THAT INFLUENCED THE CRIMINAL PROCEDURE OF UKRAINE
T2  - ACCESS TO JUSTICE IN EASTERN EUROPE
M3  - Article
AB  - As of 2020, 70 years have passed since the day of the adoption of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR), which Ukraine ratified in September 1997. It was from this date that the countdown to significant democratic transformations in Ukraine and the establishment of human and civil rights and freedoms began. In this article, the authors raise relevant issues of reforming the criminal process of Ukraine in the context of European standards. The old Code of Criminal Procedure of Ukraine was adopted in 1960 and was in force for almost half a century. During this time, it became obsolete and bore a significant imprint of the Soviet past, which was manifest in both the bodies that conducted the trial and had primarily repressive powers and the public interests that dominated the rights and legitimate interests of those involved in criminal justice.The conditions under which the first steps aimed at realising the importance of the Convention and the value of human rights enshrined in it took place were not easy. The path of reform processes in criminal proceedings was associated with the confrontation of the Soviet past with modern transformation. It was difficult to realise the need to harmonise national legislation with European standards of human rights and freedoms and consolidate their perception as one of the necessary conditions for Ukraine's integration into the European legal space, as well as the need for a conceptually new worldview for both the people of Ukraine and law enforcement bodies - officers, judges, and prosecutors.The authors summarise the most important decisions of the ECtHR made on complaints against Ukraine during the period of the reform of criminal procedure legislation, analyse the problems identified by the ECtHR, and illustrate how the legislator implemented the ECtHR standards in national criminal procedure legislation. They note that on the basis of the Convention and the case-law of the ECtHR in criminal procedure legislation, important principles of criminal proceedings, such as adversarial proceedings, direct examination of evidence, the right to defence, the right not to testify against oneself and close relatives, and reasonable time are legitimised. For the first time, the legislation of Ukraine has enshrined a rule on the inadmissibility of evidence obtained as a result of a significant violation of human rights and freedoms. A separate segment of the article is devoted to the consideration of amendments to the criminal procedure legislation regarding the protection of the rights and legitimate interests of a person in respect of whom a measure of restraint in the form of custody is chosen. In order to ensure the right of a person to liberty and security, the position of an investigating judge and the institute of free legal aid have been introduced. In addition, the authors focus on the aspects of direct application of the Convention and ECtHR decisions in law enforcement practice without amending the legislation, as well as analyse the legislative perspectives arising from non-implemented ECtHR decisions

T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we measured the in situ international roughness index (IRI) for first-degree roads spanning more than 1300 km in East Azerbaijan Province, Iran, using a quarter car (QC). Since road quality mapping with in situ measurements is a costly and time-consuming task, we also developed new equations for constructing a road quality proxy map (RQPM) using discriminant analysis and multispectral information from high-resolution Sentinel-2 images, which we calibrated using the in situ data on the basis of geographic information system (GIS) data. The developed equations using optimum index factor (OIF) and norm R provide a valuable tool for creating proxy maps and mitigating hazards at the network scale, not only for primary roads but also for secondary roads, and for reducing the costs of road quality monitoring. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of the norm R equation for road classification in East Azerbaijan province are 65.0% and 0.59, respectively.

TI  - An Integrated Spectral-Structural Workflow for Invasive Vegetation Mapping in an Arid Region Using Drones
T2  - DRONES
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping invasive vegetation species in arid regions is a critical task for managing water resources and understanding threats to ecosystem services. Traditional remote sensing platforms, such as Landsat and MODIS, are ill-suited for distinguishing native and non-native vegetation species in arid regions due to their large pixels compared to plant sizes. Unmanned aircraft systems, or UAS, offer the potential to capture the high spatial resolution imagery needed to differentiate species. However, in order to extract the most benefits from these platforms, there is a need to develop more efficient and effective workflows. This paper presents an integrated spectral-structural workflow for classifying invasive vegetation species in the Lower Salt River region of Arizona, which has been the site of fires and flooding, leading to a proliferation of invasive vegetation species. Visible (RGB) and multispectral images were captured and processed following a typical structure from motion workflow, and the derived datasets were used as inputs in two machine learning classifications-one incorporating only spectral information and one utilizing both spectral data and structural layers (e.g., digital terrain model (DTM) and canopy height model (CHM)). Results show that including structural layers in the classification improved overall accuracy from 80% to 93% compared to the spectral-only model. The most important features for classification were the CHM and DTM, with the blue band and two spectral indices (normalized difference water index (NDWI) and normalized difference salinity index (NDSI)) contributing important spectral information to both models.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Change of Urban Sprawl Patterns in Bamako District in Mali Based on Time Series Analysis
T2  - URBAN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - For decades, urban sprawl has remained a major challenge for big cities in developing countries, such as Bamako. The aim of this study is to analyze urban sprawl pattern changes over time in the Bamako district using landscape index analyses. Four thematic maps of land cover (LC) were produced by applying the maximum likelihood supervised classification method on Landsat images for 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2018. Five landscape indexes were selected and calculated at class level and landscape level using FRAGSTATS software. The results showed that the dominant class for all the years within the landscape was a built-up class. Forest class covered the smallest area in terms of the percentage of land (%PLAND), and was the weakest class in terms of number of patches (NP) and largest patch index (LPI). Grassland is defined as the class with the highest fragmentation, farmland with the highest shape irregularity and more heterogeneity, and built-up with the highest patches. Class area (CA) of built-up showed the importance of sprawl in Communes 6, 5, and 4, respectively. Indices trends and land use/cover showed infill, scattered, and ribbon developments of sprawl. This study contributes toward monitoring long-term urban sprawl patterns using index analyses.

TI  - Assessing Vegetation Response to Multi-Scalar Drought across the Mojave, Sonoran, Chihuahuan Deserts and Apache Highlands in the Southwest United States
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the patterns and relationships between vegetation productivity and climatic conditions is essential for predicting the future impacts of climate change. Climate change is altering precipitation patterns and increasing temperatures in the Southwest United States. The large-scale and long-term effects of these changes on vegetation productivity are not well understood. This study investigates the patterns and relationships between seasonal vegetation productivity, represented by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) across the Mojave, Sonoran, and Chihuahuan Deserts and the Apache Highlands of the Southwest United States over 16 years from 2000 to 2015. To examine the spatiotemporal gradient and response of vegetation productivity to dry and wet conditions, we evaluated the linear trend of different SPEI timescales and correlations between NDVI and SPEI. We found that all four ecoregions are experiencing more frequent and severe drought conditions in recent years as measured by negative SPEI trends and severe negative SPEI values. We found that changes in NDVI were more strongly correlated with winter rather than summer water availability. Investigating correlations by vegetation type across all four ecoregions, we found that grassland and shrubland productivity were more dependent on summer water availability whereas sparse vegetation and forest productivity were more dependent on winter water availability. Our results can inform resource management and enhance our understanding of vegetation vulnerability to climate change.

TI  - Evaluation of the temporal variations of groundwater storage and its interactions with climatic variables using GRACE data and hydrological models: A study from Turkey
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring of the fluctuations of groundwater storage is particularly important in arid and semi-arid regions where water scarcity brings about various challenges. Remote sensing data and techniques play a preponderant role in developing solutions to environmental problems. The launch of Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites has eased the remote monitoring and evaluation of groundwater resources with an unprecedented precision over large scales. Within the scope of the current study, the latest release (RL06) of GRACE mass concentrations (Mascons) from Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) dataset as well as Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) models of Noah and Catchment Land Surface Model (CLSM) were used to provide Groundwater Storage Anomalies (GWSA) over Turkey. The temporal interactions of the estimated GWSA with the climatic variables of precipitation and temperature (derived from the reanalysis datasets of CHELSA [Climatologies at High resolution for the Earth's Land Surface Areas] and FLDAS [the Famine Early Warning Systems Network Land Data Assimilation System], respectively) were investigated statistically. The results suggest that there is a descending trend (from 2003 to 2016) for Terrestrial Water Storage Anomalies (TWSA) and GWSA over Turkey with a total loss of 11 and 6 cm of water, respectively. The statistical analysis results also indicate that the monthly variations of GWSA over Turkey are highly correlated with precipitation and temperature at 2-month lag. The analysis of the climatology (long-term) values of monthly GWSA, precipitation and temperature also revealed high agreement between the variables.

TI  - Recovery of Forest Vegetation in a Burnt Area in the Republic of Korea: A Perspective Based on Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires are severe disasters that cause significant damage in the Republic of Korea and the entire world, and an effort is being made to prevent forest fires internationally. The Republic of Korea budgets 3.38 million USD every year to prevent forest fires. However, an average of 430 wildfires occur nationwide annually. Thirty-eight percent of the forest fire budget is used for forest restoration. Restoring afforestation in the affected areas is a top priority. This study aimed to estimate the degree of vegetative regeneration using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Soil-Adjustment Vegetation Index (SAVI), and Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR). Although many studies have used NBR with NDVI to extract plant regeneration regions, they suffer from atmospheric effects and soil brightness. Thus, this study utilizes NBR with NDVI, EVI, and SAVI to accurately select areas for targeted forest restoration. Furthermore, this study applies clustering analysis to extract the spatial boundary of vegetative regenerative regions. The proposed method suggests a pixel range of vegetation indices. These ranges can be used as an indicator, such as the NBR's Fire Severity Level, which reflects the mountain's local characteristics, meaning that it can be useful after forest fires. Using the three vegetation indices can extract more accurate vegetation areas than using NBR with NDVI and can help determine a forest restoration target area.

TI  - A Model to Estimate Leaf Area Index in Loblolly Pine Plantations Using Landsat 5 and 7 Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation indices calculated from remotely sensed satellite imagery are commonly used within empirically derived models to estimate leaf area index in loblolly pine plantations in the southeastern United States. The data used to parameterize the models typically come with observation errors, resulting in biased parameters. The objective of this study was to quantify and reduce the effects of observation errors on a leaf area index (LAI) estimation model using imagery from Landsat 5 TM and 7 ETM+ and over 1500 multitemporal measurements from a Li-Cor 2000 Plant Canopy Analyzer. Study data comes from a 16 quarter 1 ha plot with 1667 trees per hectare (2 m x 3 m spacing) fertilization and irrigation research site with re-measurements taken between 1992 and 2004. Using error-in-variable methods, we evaluated multiple vegetation indices, calculated errors associated with their observations, and corrected for them in the modeling process. We found that the normalized difference moisture index provided the best correlation with below canopy LAI measurements (76.4%). A nonlinear model that accounts for the nutritional status of the stand was found to provide the best estimates of LAI, with a root mean square error of 0.418. The analysis in this research provides a more extensive evaluation of common vegetation indices used to estimate LAI in loblolly pine plantations and a modeling framework that extends beyond the typical linear model. The proposed model provides a simple to use form allowing forest practitioners to evaluate LAI development and its uncertainty in historic pine plantations in a spatial and temporal context.

TI  - Towards a Topographically-Accurate Reflection Point Prediction Algorithm for Operational Spaceborne GNSS Reflectometry-Development and Verification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - GNSS Reflectometry (GNSS-R), a method of remote sensing using the reflections from satellite navigation systems, was initially envisaged for ocean wind speed sensing. In recent times there has been significant interest in the use of GNSS-R for sensing land parameters such as soil moisture, which has been identified as an Essential Climate Variable (ECV). Monitoring objectives for ECVs set by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) organisation include a reduction in data gaps from spaceborne sources. GNSS-R can be implemented on small, relatively cheap platforms and can enable the launch of constellations, thus reducing such data gaps in these important datasets. However in order to realise operational land sensing with GNSS-R, adaptations are required to existing instrumentation. Spaceborne GNSS-R requires the reflection points to be predicted in advance, and for land sensing this means the effect of topography must be considered. This paper presents an algorithm for on-board prediction of reflection points over the land, allowing generation of DDMs on-board as well as compression and calibration. The algorithm is tested using real satellite data from TechDemoSat-1 in a software receiver with on-board constraints being considered. Three different resolutions of Digital Elevation Model are compared. The algorithm is shown to perform better against the operational requirements of sensing land parameters than existing methods and is ready to proceed to flight testing.

TI  - Application of Remote Sensing Data for Locust Research and Management-A Review
T2  - INSECTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple SummaryLocust outbreaks around the world regularly affect vast areas and millions of people. Mapping and monitoring locust habitats, as well as prediction of locust outbreaks is essential to minimize the damage on crops and pasture. In this context, remote sensing has become one of the most important data sources for effective locust management. This review paper summarizes remote sensing-based studies for locust management and research over the past four decades and reveals progress made and gaps for further research. We quantify which locust species, regions of interest, sensor data and variables were mainly used and which thematic foci were of interest. Our review shows that most studies were conducted for the desert locust, the migratory locust and Australian plague locust and corresponding areas of interest. Remote sensing studies for other destructive locust species are rather rare. Most studies utilized data from optical sensors to derive NDVI and land cover for mapping and monitoring the locust habitats. Furthermore, temperature, precipitation and soil moisture are derived from thermal infrared, passive and active radar sensors. Applications of the European Sentinel fleet, entire Landsat archive or very-high-spatial-resolution data are rare. Implementing new methods (e.g., data fusion) and additional data sources could provide new insights for locust research and management.Recently, locust outbreaks around the world have destroyed agricultural and natural vegetation and caused massive damage endangering food security. Unusual heavy rainfalls in habitats of the desert locust (Schistocerca gregaria) and lack of monitoring due to political conflicts or inaccessibility of those habitats lead to massive desert locust outbreaks and swarms migrating over the Arabian Peninsula, East Africa, India and Pakistan. At the same time, swarms of the Moroccan locust (Dociostaurus maroccanus) in some Central Asian countries and swarms of the Italian locust (Calliptamus italicus) in Russia and China destroyed crops despite developed and ongoing monitoring and control measurements. These recent events underline that the risk and damage caused by locust pests is as present as ever and affects 100 million of human lives despite technical progress in locust monitoring, prediction and control approaches. Remote sensing has become one of the most important data sources in locust management. Since the 1980s, remote sensing data and applications have accompanied many locust management activities and contributed to an improved and more effective control of locust outbreaks and plagues. Recently, open-access remote sensing data archives as well as progress in cloud computing provide unprecedented opportunity for remote sensing-based locust management and research. Additionally, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems bring up new prospects for a more effective and faster locust control. Nevertheless, the full capacity of available remote sensing applications and possibilities have not been exploited yet. This review paper provides a comprehensive and quantitative overview of international research articles focusing on remote sensing application for locust management and research. We reviewed 110 articles published over the last four decades, and categorized them into different aspects and main research topics to summarize achievements and gaps for further research and application development.The results reveal a strong focus on three species-the desert locust, the migratory locust (Locusta migratoria), and the Australian plague locust (Chortoicetes terminifera)-and corresponding regions of interest. There is still a lack of international studies for other pest species such as the Italian locust, the Moroccan locust, the Central American locust (Schistocerca piceifrons), the South American locust (Schistocerca cancellata), the brown locust (Locustana pardalina) and the red locust (Nomadacris septemfasciata). In terms of applied sensors, most studies utilized Advanced Very-High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre VEGETATION (SPOT-VGT), Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) as well as Landsat data focusing mainly on vegetation monitoring or land cover mapping. Application of geomorphological metrics as well as radar-based soil moisture data is comparably rare despite previous acknowledgement of their importance for locust outbreaks. Despite great advance and usage of available remote sensing resources, we identify several gaps and potential for future research to further improve the understanding and capacities of the use of remote sensing in supporting locust outbreak- research and management.

TI  - Analysis of the Cosmic Ray Effects on Sentinel-1 SAR Satellite Data
T2  - AEROSPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ionizing radiation sources such as Solar Energetic Particles and Galactic Cosmic Radiation may cause unexpected errors in imaging and communication systems of satellites in the Space environment, as reported in the previous literature. In this study, the temporal variation of the speckle values on Sentinel 1 satellite images were compared with the cosmic ray intensity/count data, to analyze the effects which may occur in the electromagnetic wave signals or electronic system. Sentinel 1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images nearby to the cosmic ray stations and acquired between January 2015 and December 2019 were processed. The median values of the differences between speckle filtered and original image were calculated on Google Earth Engine Platform per month. The monthly median "noise" values were compared with the cosmic ray intensity/count data acquired from the stations. Eight selected stations' data show that there are significant correlations between cosmic ray intensities and the speckle amounts. The Pearson correlation values vary between 0.62 and 0.78 for the relevant stations.

TI  - Validation and Trend Analysis of Satellite-Based AOD Data over Southern India
T2  - AEROSOL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosols are finely suspended solid or liquid particles in the atmosphere. Anthropogenic aerosols from industrialization and urbanization are among the prominent factors instrumental in climate change process. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) is a quantitative estimate of the amount of aerosol present in the atmosphere. The rise in concentration of aerosols in the atmosphere has affected the clear sky visibility in most of the metropolitan cities. AOD data from satellite and ground observations are the main sources in studying the effect of aerosol on spatial patterns of precipitation and temperature. The continuous AOD data are validated against ground observations. It is observed that Moderate Resolution Spectrometer is closely correlated with ground observations. The coefficient of determination is 0.58 for Pune station and 0.7 for Kanpur station. Trends in AOD have been assessed for 2 decades over Southern India using Mann-Kendall test and Innovative Trend Analysis (ITA) method. Both the tests showed a decrease in area of significant trend for the second decade when compared to the first decade. This might be because of change in mitigation policies adopted in India. It is observed that 67% and 40% of the area showed a significant positive trend in the first and second decades using Mann-Kendall test, respectively. However, 42% and 30% of the area showed a significant positive trend in the first and second decades using the ITA method. The variation in percentage of area in both the tests is attributed to the manner in which data are given as input and also on the mode of application. Hence, both the tests are useful to assess the trend in AOD data.

TI  - Sentinel-1 A-DInSAR Approaches to Map and Monitor Ground Displacements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) is a group of advanced interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) techniques used to measure and monitor terrain deformation. Sentinel-1 has improved the data acquisition throughout and, compared to previous sensors, increased considerably the differential interferometric SAR (DInSAR) and PSI deformation monitoring potential. The low density of persistent scatterer (PS) in non-urban areas is a critical issue in DInSAR and has inspired the development of alternative approaches and refinement of the PS chains. This paper proposes two different and complementary data-driven procedures to obtain terrain deformation maps. These approaches aim to exploit Sentinel-1 highly coherent interferograms and their short revisit time. The first approach, called direct integration (DI), aims at providing a very fast and straightforward approach to screen-wide areas and easily detects active areas. This approach fully exploits the coherent interferograms from consecutive images provided by Sentinel-1, resulting in a very high sampling density. However, it lacks robustness and its usability lays on the operator experience. The second method, called persistent scatterer interferometry geomatics (PSIG) short temporal baseline, provides a constrained application of the PSIG chain, the CTTC approach to the PSI. It uses short temporal baseline interferograms and does not assume any deformation model for point selection. It is also quite a straightforward approach, which improves the performances of the standard PSIG approach, increasing the PS density and providing robust measurements. The effectiveness of the approaches is illustrated through analyses performed on different test sites.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variability of Suspended Particulate Matter in the Surface Layer of the Open Part of the Black Sea
T2  - OCEANOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on long-term measurements of the concentration of total suspended particulate matter (TSM), particulate organic carbon, chlorophyll a, and the water transparency index for 1978-1998, as well as satellite measurements of the light scattering coefficient for 1998-201, seasonal linear regression equations for the surface layer of the open part of the Black Sea have been obtained. These equations and available ship and satellite data were used to calculate the seasonal concentrations of TSM that differed from its measured concentrations by 5-22%. Satisfactory agreement was obtained between seasonal spatial distributions and intra-annual variations in the TSM concentrations determined from measured and calculated concentrations based on ship data. Several time periods of interannual variability with characteristic changes in the TSM concentration, phytoplankton biomass, water transparency, and climate conditions were identified. Anomalous changes in the structure of the plankton community in the late 1980s and early 1990s, which coincided with climatic cycles, contributed to the high phytoplankton biomass and, as a consequence, the TSM concentration. The revealed consistency of temporal changes in the TSM concentration and phytoplankton biomass indicates its important role in forming the TSM field in the surface layer in the open part of the Black Sea.

T2  - PERICHORESIS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper I examine one of the effects of Laszlo Ravasz's (1882-1975) theological thinking, former professor of Practical Theology at Protestant Theological Institute, Kolzosvar-Cluj-Napoca, namely the development of his spiritual life and its impact on his theological scientific position. Due to the limitations of the scope of this paper, I could present the less wellknown views of Ravasz's work on the mission. John R. Mott's lecture in Kolozsvar-Cluj-Napoca provides, among others, the certainty that in the modern theoretical approach of the young Ravasz he approached the tasks of pastoral ministry, preaching, dissemination of the gospel, theological education in a modern and actual way. This notion was not perfect, but it helped to bring about a new impetus for the Hungarian Protestant worldview that was stuck in rationalism and liberalism, and for the value theology to constitute a positive transition to the dialectical theology. Ravasz was an authentic representative of this transition.

AB  - The main aim of the present study is to investigatethegeochemical characteristics of dolomites and dolomite enriched mineralised zones andtheir source identification by understanding lithological and geomorphological units. The geological and geomorphological maps were prepared with help of Landsat 8 OLI satellite data. Thematic maps were created for three revenuemandalsnamely Lingala, Pulivendla and Pendlimarri of YSR Kadapa District, A.P, India. Subsequently, geochemical analys wasperformed on the mineralised zones to know the type and grade of the dolomite. Based on the geochemical investigation, the overall grade of dolomite with respect to MgO % in the study area is 20 to 29%, which is commercially considered as high grade and is useful for glass industry, except for some occurrences in villages like K.Velavavaripalle (20.64% MgO), Chinnakudala (20.60% MgO), Velidandla (19% MgO), Nandimandalam (18.80% MgO), which may be useful for steel industry.

TI  - Parameter Uncertainty of a Hydrologic Model Calibrated with Remotely Sensed Evapotranspiration and Soil Moisture
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed (RS) observations are becoming prevalent for hydrological model calibration in sparsely monitored regions. In this study, the parameter uncertainty associated with a hydrological model calibrated with RS evapotranspiration (ET) and soil moisture (SM) is investigated in detail using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. The daily Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) ReScaled potential ET (CMRSET) and SM retrievals from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) are used to calibrate a simplified Australian Water Resource Assessment Landscape (AWRA-L) model at 10 small catchments in Eastern Australia. The study inspects the changes in parameter uncertainty with respect to different RS observations and catchment rainfall conditions and the impact of parameter uncertainty on model predictions. Results suggest that uncertainty in posterior parameter distributions increases from high- to low-rainfall catchments due to the intricate nonlinear relationship between rainfall and runoff in low-yielding catchments. Uncertainty is narrower for ET calibrations than SM calibrations, representing higher uncertainty associated with SM data processing. The study concluded that quantification of parameter uncertainty alone is not enough to provide satisfactory prediction uncertainty.

AB  - Landslides are posing a significant global hazard as they occur instantaneously with devastating consequences. The development of new remote sensing technologies and innovative processing techniques over the past few years opened up new horizons and perspectives in landslide monitoring research. The purpose of the current research is the integrated monitoring of an active landslide, located in Western Greece, using low-cost and high-repeatability remote sensing data like those obtained by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Repeated UAV campaigns and global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) surveys were performed to assess the activity of the landslide and determine its kinematic behavior. UAV data were processed using structure from motion (SfM) photogrammetry and the generated high-detailed orthophotos and digital surface models (DSMs) were submitted in further processing procedure in an ArcGIS environment. Regarding the GNSS data, a new low-cost technique for the estimation of the direction and the rate of movement of the displaced material was developed. The repeated measurements were displayed in a vector format in a three-axis diagram. In addition, GNSS measurements were used to verify the results of the photogrammetric processing. The final assessment was carried out taking into account geological data such as petrographic and crystallographic features of the material of the landslide. It was observed that the lithology and consequently the petrographic properties of the material plays a key role regarding the activity of the landslide.

TI  - Field Scale Assessment of the TsHARP Technique for Thermal Sharpening of MODIS Satellite Images Using VENμS and Sentinel-2-Derived NDVI
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed-based surface temperature is an important tool for crop monitoring and has great potential for improving irrigation management. However, current thermal satellite platforms do not display the fine spatial resolution required for identifying crop water status patterns at the field scale. The thermal sharpening (TsHARP) utility provides a technique for downscaling coarse thermal images to match the finer resolution of images acquired in the visible and near infrared bandwidths. This sharpening method is based on the inverse linear relationship between vegetation fraction calculated from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST). The current study used the TsHARP method to sharpen low-resolution thermal data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer MODIS (1 km) to the finer resolution of Sentinel-2 (10 m) and Vegetation and Environment New micro-Spacecraft (VEN mu S) (5 m) visible-near infrared images. The sharpening methodology was evaluated at scene and field scales in southern Georgia and northern Mississippi, USA. A comparison of sharpened temperature was made with reference temperatures from Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) in four different spatial resolutions (30, 60, 120, and 240 m) for method validation. Coarse resolution comparison on the dates in which imagery from both sensors were acquired on the same day resulted in average observed mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.63 degrees C, and R-2 variation from 0.34 to 0.74. Temperature errors at the field scale ranged from 0.25 to 3.11 degrees C using both Sentinel-2 and VEN mu S. Sharpened maps at 120 and 60 m resolution showed the highest consistency for all fields and dates. Maps sharpened using VEN mu S images showed comparable or higher accuracy than maps sharpened using Sentinel-2. The superior performance coupled with the better revisit time indicates that the VEN mu S platform has high potential for frequent in-season crop monitoring. Further research with ground data collection is needed to explore field use limitations of this methodology, but these results give useful insights of potential benefits of implementing the TsHARP technique as a tool for crop stress monitoring.

TI  - A Study of the Processes of Desertification at the Modern Delta of the Ili River with the Application of Remote Sensing Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The water regime is the main factor contributing to the formation of landscapes in the river deltas of arid zones, any fluctuations in which lead to a change in the integral hydromorphic landscape. After the construction of the Kapshagai reservoir, the anthropogenic load on the ecosystem of the Ili River delta increased, as a result of which degradation processes, such as drying out and salinization, intensified. In the short term, this phenomenon may lead to the desertification of about 1 million ha of land in the modern river delta. In this regard, the main goal of this study is to look at the processes of desertification in the modern delta of the Ili River, using remote sensing data, which allows for quick identification of the long-term dynamics of degradation processes. For this, the authors used satellite data from Landsat 1-5 MSSS and Landsat 8OLI satellites for 1979 and 2019 and soil analysis data obtained through the ground (field) surveys. Using regression analysis of space and soil data, predictors for interpreting space images were identified and maps of landscape drying and soil salinization were compiled, reflecting the changes that have occurred over the past 40 years. As a result, it was found that in 2019, compared to 1979, the area of landscapes covered with vegetation had decreased by 12% and there was a transformation of hydromorphic landscapes into salt marshes and solonetzes. Over the past 40 years, the volume of non-saline soils has decreased by 41.3% and the volume of saline soils has increased to varying degrees. That is, at present, on the territory of the modern delta, a difficult land improvement situation has developed associated with the cessation of spring and summer floods due to the intensive water use at the Chinese and Kazakh sides.

TI  - The Impact of Climate Warming on Lake Surface Heat Exchange and Ice Phenology of Different Types of Lakes on the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing air temperature is a significant feature of climate warming, and is cause for some concern, particularly on the Tibetan Plateau (TP). A lack of observations means that the impact of rising air temperatures on TP lakes has received little attention. Lake surfaces play a unique role in determining local and regional climate. This study analyzed the effect of increasing air temperature on lake surface temperature (LST), latent heat flux (LE), sensible heat flux (H), and ice phenology at Lake Nam Co and Lake Ngoring, which have mean depths of approximately 40 m and 25 m, respectively, and are in the central and eastern TP, respectively. The variables were simulated using an adjusted Fresh-water Lake (FLake) model (FLake_alpha_ice = 0.15). The simulated results were evaluated against in situ observations of LST, LE and H, and against LST data derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for 2015 to 2016. The simulations show that when the air temperature increases, LST increases, and the rate of increase is greater in winter than in summer; annual LE increases; H and ice thickness decrease; ice freeze-up date is delayed; and the break-up date advances. The changes in the variables in response to the temperature increases are similar at the two lakes from August to December, but are significantly different from December to July.

TI  - The 2017 Mega-Fires in Central Chile: Impacts on Regional Atmospheric Composition and Meteorology Assessed from Satellite Data and Chemistry-Transport Modeling
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - In January 2017, historic forest fires occurred in south-central Chile. Although their causes and consequences on health and ecosystems were studied, little is known about their atmospheric effects. Based on chemistry-transport modeling with WRF-CHIMERE, the impact of the 2017 Chilean mega-fires on regional atmospheric composition, and the associated meteorological feedback, are investigated. Fire emissions are found to increase pollutants surface concentration in the capital city, Santiago, by +150% (+30 mu g/m(3)) for PM2.5 and +50% (+200 ppb) for CO on average during the event. Satellite observations show an intense plume extending over 2000 km, well reproduced by the simulations, with Aerosol Optical Depth at 550 nm as high as 4 on average during the days of fire activity, as well as dense columns of CO and O-3. In addition to affecting atmospheric composition, meteorology is also modified through aerosol direct and indirect effects, with a decrease in surface radiation by up to 100 W/m(2) on average, leading to reductions in surface temperatures by 1 K and mixing layer heights over land by 100 m, and a significant increase in cloud optical depth along the plume. Large deposition fluxes of pollutants over land, the Pacific ocean and the Andes cordillera are found, signaling potential damages to remote ecosystems.

TI  - Periglacial Lake Origin Influences the Likelihood of Lake Drainage in Northern Alaska
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Nearly 25% of all lakes on earth are located at high latitudes. These lakes are formed by a combination of thermokarst, glacial, and geological processes. Evidence suggests that the origin of periglacial lake formation may be an important factor controlling the likelihood of lakes to drain. However, geospatial data regarding the spatial distribution of these dominant Arctic and subarctic lakes are limited or do not exist. Here, we use lake-specific morphological properties using the Arctic Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and Landsat imagery to develop a Thermokarst lake Settlement Index (TSI), which was used in combination with available geospatial datasets of glacier history and yedoma permafrost extent to classify Arctic and subarctic lakes into Thermokarst (non-yedoma), Yedoma, Glacial, and Maar lakes, respectively. This lake origin dataset was used to evaluate the influence of lake origin on drainage between 1985 and 2019 in northern Alaska. The lake origin map and lake drainage datasets were synthesized using five-year seamless Landsat ETM+ and OLI image composites. Nearly 35,000 lakes and their properties were characterized from Landsat mosaics using an object-based image analysis. Results indicate that the pattern of lake drainage varied by lake origin, and the proportion of lakes that completely drained (i.e., >60% area loss) between 1985 and 2019 in Thermokarst (non-yedoma), Yedoma, Glacial, and Maar lakes were 12.1, 9.5, 8.7, and 0.0%, respectively. The lakes most vulnerable to draining were small thermokarst (non-yedoma) lakes (12.7%) and large yedoma lakes (12.5%), while the most resilient were large and medium-sized glacial lakes (4.9 and 4.1%) and Maar lakes (0.0%). This analysis provides a simple remote sensing approach to estimate the spatial distribution of dominant lake origins across variable physiography and surficial geology, useful for discriminating between vulnerable versus resilient Arctic and subarctic lakes that are likely to change in warmer and wetter climates.

TI  - Controversies in the Management of Early-stage Serous Endometrial Cancer
T2  - IN VIVO
M3  - Review
AB  - Background/Aim: Early-stage uterine serous carcinoma (USC) has one of the highest recurrence rates and mortality among early-stage uterine epithelial cancers. Research into the clinical management of USC has begun to progress, guided by surgical and pathological advances. This article summarizes the available literature regarding diagnosis, management, and possible future uses of molecular analysis of women with early-stage USC. Materials and Methods: PubMed was searched for all pertinent English language research articles published from January 1, 2006 through March 1, 2020 which included a study population of women diagnosed with stage 1 USC. Due to the scarcity of prospective or large-scale data, studies were not limited by design or numbers of patients. Studies performed at earlier dates were incorporated to provide context. Results: A total of 86 studies were included in the review. Multiple well designed studies have confirmed the safety of a minimally invasive surgical approach for surgical management of USC. The role of sentinel node biopsy has been validated with both prospective and retrospective multi-center data. Stage I USC is associated with a highly variable risk of recurrence, even following completion of adjuvant chemoradiation. This aggressive phenotype has been linked to high numbers of somatic copy number alterations, tumor protein 53, and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase mutations, which have been shown to be predictive of prognosis. Conclusion: Early-stage USC demonstrates a lack of predictable recurrence patterns, with reports noting distant recurrence in patients with disease confined to polyps. Unless no residual tumor is found on hysterectomy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy should be discussed and individualized by stage and treatment goals.

M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes and demonstrates an autonomous robotic team that can rapidly learn the characteristics of environments that it has never seen before. The flexible paradigm is easily scalable to multi-robot, multi-sensor autonomous teams, and it is relevant to satellite calibration/validation and the creation of new remote sensing data products. A case study is described for the rapid characterisation of the aquatic environment, over a period of just a few minutes we acquired thousands of training data points. This training data allowed for our machine learning algorithms to rapidly learn by example and provide wide area maps of the composition of the environment. Along side these larger autonomous robots two smaller robots that can be deployed by a single individual were also deployed (a walking robot and a robotic hover-board), observing significant small scale spatial variability.

AB  - Background/Aim: This report outlines our experience in the management of 10 cases of low-risk endometrial cancer with Indocyanine Green for sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping using the Pinpoint 30-degree 4K S1 SPY real-time camera system (Stryker). This system offers simultaneous, real-time, high-definition white light and fluorescence imaging through a single laparoscope, without the need to change camera filters. Patients and Methods: In our retrospective case series we included all endometrioid endometrial cancers of grade G1 and pre-operative radiological staging FIGO 1A reported on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that were treated laparoscopically from October 2019 to April 2020. Results: Bilateral sentinel lymph node excision was achieved in 9 out of 10 cases. In one patient, one sentinel lymph node featuring a micrometastasis of <2 mm was identified. Conclusion: A specialist minimal access team can safely and reliably reproduce this technique for sentinel lymph node excision.

TI  - Incidence of Uterine Bleeding Following Oral Anticoagulant Use in FDA's Sentinel System
T2  - OBSTETRICAL & GYNECOLOGICAL SURVEY
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - The aim of this study was to improve the understanding among clinicians of uterine bleeding (UB) events requiring intervention among women treated with an oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy. The authors examined the incidence of UB events in the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) Sentinel System, a database that comprised medical encounter and outpatient pharmacy claims data contributed by 17 public and commercial health insurers and integrated delivery networks. This allowed drug safety surveillance using real-world postmarketing data. The study was conducted from October 2010 through September 2015. Participants were women diagnosed with venous thromboembolism (VTE) and atrial fibrillation in the 183 days prior to (baseline) and on the day of receiving warfarin or non-vitamin K oral OACs. Women with hysterectomy, joint replacement, or outcome during the baseline were excluded. Patients were followed from their OAC dispensing date until the earliest of one of the following: end of treatment exposure, disenrollment from medical or prescription drug coverage, death, end of the study period, or study outcome. The focus of the study was UB events resulting in medical, transfusion, or surgical interventions reflecting clinically relevant morbidity.Medical management was same-day insertion of an intrauterine system or vaginal packing or use of oral contraceptive or antifibrinolytics. Transfusion management involved red blood cell transfusion. Surgical management was surgical intervention (hysterectomy, polypectomy, myomectomy, dilatation and curettage, endometrial ablation, uterine artery embolization) occurring within 30 days of UB diagnosis. Overall incidence rates of these outcomes were estimated, stratified by age group.Of 1,050,192 OAC new users, the overall incidence rates of UB for outcomes with medical, transfusion, and surgical management were 0.6, 1.7, and 5.0 per 1000 person-years, respectively. In comparison, after stratification by age group, incidence rates of UB among those younger than 50 years were 11.8, 13.7, and 33.0 per 1000 person-years; these estimates were consistently higher in those 50 years or older than in women younger than 50 years. At all ages, UB with surgical management was more common than with medical or transfusion management. Prior to treatment, 2.8% of women reported a gynecological disorder (adenomyosis, endometrial hyperplasia, endometriosis, gynecological cancers, ovarian cyst, uterine fibroids, or uterine or cervical polyp).These findings indicate that detailed guidance on management of reproductive-aged women receiving an OAC can help health care providers to be aware of the risk of severe UB, thus allowing earlier interventions that mitigate morbidity from severe UB. Because clinical trials typically enroll only a small proportion of reproductive-aged women, trials may not reflect the extent of medical or surgical intervention from severe UB.

T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - For detection of a road network, high-resolution satellite data have been used following the object-oriented classification approach. We used object-based feature extraction algorithms for detection of road networks from a high resolution Cartosat-2F multispectral data in an Indian city with varying terrain conditions ranging from a compact built-up area to a predominantly vegetated area. The approach involves multi-resolution segmentation (MRS) and spectral difference segmentation (SDS) followed by road extraction using fuzzy rule-based algorithm based on various object features, viz. gray-level co-occurrence matrix homogeneity, density, rectangular fit, etc. With overall accuracies ranging from 77.46% to 92% SDS approach performed better than MRS which could afford 60.46% to 75.0% only. However, both of these approaches score over the classical Gaussian maximum likelihood classifier which could register only 50.0% to 68.0% overall accuracy. Furthermore, the maximum overall accuracy was obtained in compact built-up site (85% to 92%) followed by sparsely built-up site (75.0% to 88%) and predominantly vegetated site (60.46% to 77.14%).

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Distribution of Deep Convection Observed along the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Complex terrain features-in particular, environmental conditions, high population density and potential socio-economic damage-make the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt (TMVB) of particular interest regarding the study of deep convection and related severe weather. In this research, 10 years of Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) cloud observations are combined with Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS) rainfall data to characterize the spatio-temporal distribution of deep convective clouds (DCCs) and their relationship to extreme precipitation. From monthly distributions, wet and dry phases are identified for cloud fraction, deep convective cloud frequency and convective precipitation. For both DCC and extreme precipitation events, the highest frequencies align just over the higher elevations of the TMVB. A clear relationship between DCCs and terrain features, indicating the important role of orography in the development of convective systems, is noticed. For three sub-regions, the observed distributions of deep convective cloud and extreme precipitation events are assessed in more detail. Each sub-region exhibits different local conditions, including terrain features, and are known to be influenced differently by emerging moisture fluxes from the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean. The observed distinct spatio-temporal variabilities provide the first insights into the physical processes that control the convective development in the study area. A signal of the midsummer drought in Mexico (i.e., "canicula") is recognized using MODIS monthly mean cloud observations.

TI  - Correction of Directional Effects in VEGETATION NDVI Time-Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface reflectance measurements from the VEGETATION program (SPOT-4, SPOT-5 and PROBA-V satellites) have led to the acquisition of consistent time-series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) at a global scale. The wide imaging swath (>2000 km) of the family of VEGETATION space-borne sensors ensures a daily coverage of the Earth at the expense of a varying observation and illumination geometries between successive orbit overpasses for a given target located on the ground. Such angular variations infer saw-like patterns on time-series of reflectance and NDVI. The presence of directional effects is not a real issue provided that they can be properly removed, which supposes an appropriate BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function) sampling as offered by the VEGETATION program. An anisotropy correction supports a better analysis of the temporal shapes and spatial patterns of land surface reflectance values and vegetation indices such as NDVI. Herein we describe a BRDF correction methodology, for the purpose of the Copernicus Global Land Service framework, which includes notably an adaptive data accumulation window and provides uncertainties associated with the NDVI computed with normalized reflectance. Assessing the general performance of the methodology in comparing time-series between normalized and directional NDVI reveals a significant removal of the high-frequency noise due to directional effects. The proposed methodology is computationally efficient to operate at a global scale to deliver a BRDF-corrected NDVI product based on long-term Time-Series of VEGETATION sensor and its follow-on with the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellite constellation.

TI  - Remote Soil Moisture Measurement from Drone-Borne Reflectance Spectroscopy: Applications to Hydroperiod Measurement in Desert Playas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The extent, timing, and magnitude of soil moisture in wetlands (the hydropattern) is a primary physical control on biogeochemical processes in desert environments. However, determining playa hydropatterns is challenged by the remoteness of desert basin sites and by the difficulty in determining soil moisture from remotely sensed data at fine spatial and temporal scales (hundreds of meters to kilometers, and hours to days). Therefore, we developed a new, reflectance-based soil moisture index (continuum-removed water index, or CRWI) that can be determined via hyperspectral imaging from drone-borne platforms. We compared its efficacy at remotely determining soil moisture content to existing hyperspectral and multispectral soil moisture indices. CRWI varies linearly with in situ soil moisture content (R-2 = 0.89, p < 0.001) and is comparatively insensitive to soil clay content (R-2 = 0.4, p = 0.01), soil salinity (R-2 = 0.82, p < 0.001), and soil grain size distribution (R-2 = 0.67, p < 0.001). CRWI is negatively correlated with clay content, indicating it is not sensitive to hydrated mineral absorption features. CRWI has stronger correlation with surface soil moisture than other hyperspectral and multispectral indices (R-2 = 0.69, p < 0.001 for WISOIL at this site). Drone-borne reflectance measurements allow monitoring of soil moisture conditions at the Alvord Desert playa test site over hectare-scale soil plots at measurement cadences of minutes to hours. CRWI measurements can be used to determine surface soil moisture at a range of desert sites to inform management decisions and to better reveal ecosystem processes in water-limited environments.

TI  - A New Cycle-Slip Repair Method for Dual-Frequency BDS Against the Disturbances of Severe Ionospheric Variations and Pseudoranges with Large Errors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Many Beidou navigation satellite system (BDS) receivers or boards provide dual-frequency measurements to conduct precise positioning and navigation for low-power consumption. Cycle-slip processing is a primary work to guarantee consistent, precise positioning with the phase data. However, the cycle-slip processing of BDS dual-frequency phases still follows with those of existing GPS methods. For single-satellite data, cycle-slip detection (CSD) with the geometry-free phase (GF) is disturbed by severe ionospheric delay variations, while CSD or cycle-slip repair (CSR) with the Melbourne-Wubbena combination (MW) must face the risk of the tremendous disturbance from large pseudorange errors. To overcome the above limitations, a new cycle-slip repair method for BDS dual-frequency phases (BDCSR) is proposed: (1) An optimal model to minimize the variance of the cycle-slip calculation was established to the dual-frequency BDS, after correcting the ionospheric variation with a reasonable and feasible way. (2) Under the BDS dual-frequency condition, a discrimination function was built to exclude the adverse disturbance from the pseudorange errors on the CSR, according to the rankings of the absolute epoch-difference GFs calculated by the searched cycle-slip candidates after correcting the ionospheric variation. Subsequently, many compared CSR tests were implemented in conditions of low and medium elevations during strong geomagnetic storms. Comparisons from the results of different methods show that: (1) The variations of ionospheric delays are intolerable in the cycle-slip calculation during the geomagnetic storm, and the tremendous influence from the ionospheric variation should be corrected before calculating the cycle-slip combination with the BDS dual-frequency data. (2) Under the condition of real dual-frequency BDS data during the geomagnetic storm, the actual success rate of the conventional dual-frequency CSR (CDCSR) by employing the optimized combinations, but absenting from the discrimination function, is lower than that of BDCSR by about 2%; The actual success rate of the CSD with MW (MWCSD), is lower than that of BDCSR by about 2%. (3) After adding gross errors of 0.7 m to all real epoch-difference pseudoranges epoch-by-epoch, results of CDCSR and MWCSD showed many errors. However, BDCSR achieved a higher actual success rate than those of CDCSR and MWCSD, about 43% and 16%, respectively, and better performance of refraining the disturbance of large pseudorange error on the cycle-slip determination was achieved in the BDCSR methodology.

TI  - Comparison of Regional Winter Wheat Mapping Results from Different Similarity Measurement Indicators of NDVI Time Series and Their Optimized Thresholds
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Generally, there is an inconsistency between the total regional crop area that was obtained from remote sensing technology and the official statistical data on crop areas. When performing scale conversion and data aggregation of remote sensing-based crop mapping results from different administrative scales, it is difficult to obtain accurate crop planting area that match crop area statistics well at the corresponding administrative level. This problem affects the application of remote sensing-based crop mapping results. In order to solve the above problem, taking Fucheng County of Hebei Province in the Huanghuaihai Plain of China as the study area, based on the Sentinel-2 normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series data covering the whole winter wheat growth period, the statistical data of the regional winter wheat planting area were regarded as reference for the winter wheat planting area extracted by remote sensing, and a new method for winter wheat mapping that is based on similarity measurement indicators and their threshold optimizations (WWM-SMITO) was proposed with the support of the shuffled complex evolution-University of Arizona (SCE-UA) global optimization algorithm. The accuracy of the regional winter wheat mapping results was verified, and accuracy comparisons with different similarity indicators were carried out. The results showed that the total area accuracy of the winter wheat area extraction by the proposed method reached over 99.99%, which achieved a consistency that was between the regional remote sensing-based winter wheat planting area and the statistical data on the winter wheat planting area. The crop recognition accuracy also reached a high level, which showed that the proposed method was effective and feasible. Moreover, in the accuracy comparison of crop mapping results based on six different similarity indicators, the winter wheat distribution that was extracted by root mean square error (RMSE) had the best recognition accuracy, and the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient were 94.5% and 0.8894, respectively. The overall accuracies of winter wheat that were extracted by similarity indicators, such as Euclidean distance (ED), Manhattan distance (MD), spectral angle mapping (SAM), and spectral correlation coefficient (SCC) were 94.1%, 93.9%, 93.3%, and 92.8%, respectively, and the kappa coefficients were 0.8815, 0.8776, 0.8657, and 0.8558, respectively. The accuracy of the winter wheat results extracted by the similarity indicator of dynamic time warping (DTW) was relatively low. The results of this paper could provide guidance and serve as a reference for the selection of similarity indicators in crop distribution extraction and for obtaining large-scale, long-term, and high-precision remote sensing-based information on a regional crop spatial distribution that is highly consistent with statistical crop area data.

TI  - Barotropic and Baroclinic Inverse Kinetic Energy Cascade in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Stratified geostrophic turbulence theory predicts an inverse energy cascade for the barotropic (BT) mode. Satellite altimetry has revealed a net inverse cascade in the baroclinic (BC) mode. Here the spatial variabilities of BT and BC kinetic energy fluxes in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) were investigated using ECCO2 data, which synthesize satellite data and in situ measurements with an eddy-permitting general circulation model containing realistic bathymetry and wind forcing. The BT and BC inverse kinetic energy cascades both reveal complex spatial variations that could not be explained fully by classical arguments. For example, the BC injection scales match better with most unstable scales than with the first-mode deformation scales, but the opposite is true for the BT mode. In addition, the BT and BC arrest scales do not follow the Rhines scale well in terms of spatial variation, but show better consistency with their own energy-containing scales. The reverse cascade of the BT and BC modes was found related to their EKE, and better correlation was found between the BT inverse cascade and barotropization. Speculations of the findings were proposed; however, further observations and modeling experiments are needed to test these interpretations. Spectral flux anisotropy exhibits a feature associated with oceanic jets that is consistent with classical expectations. Specifically, the spectral flux along the along-stream direction remains negative at scales up to that of the studied domain (similar to 2000 km), while that in the perpendicular direction becomes positive close to the scale of the width of a typical jet.

TI  - Development and validation of a nomogram for prediction of lymph node metastasis in early-stage breast cancer
T2  - GLAND SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Lymph node status is an important factor in determining the prognosis of early-stage breast cancer. We endeavored to build and validate a simple nomogram to predict lymph node metastasis (LNM) in patients with early-stage breast cancer.Methods: Patients with T1-2 and non-metastasis (M0) breast cancer registered in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database were enrolled. All patients were divided into primary cohort and validation cohort in a 2:1 ratio. In order to assess risk factors for LNM, we performed univariate and multivariate binary logistic regression, and based on results of multivariable analysis, we built the predictive nomogram model. The C-index, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and calibration plots were applied to assess LNM model performance. Moreover, the nomogram efficiency was further validated through the validation cohort, part of which was from the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University database.Results: Totally, 184,531 female breast cancer with T1-2 tumor size from SEER database and 1,222 patients from the Chinese institutional data were included. There were 123,019 patients in the primary cohort and 62,734 patients in validation cohort. The LNM nomogram was composed of seven features including age at diagnosis, race, primary site, histologic type, grade, tumor size and subtype. The model showed good discrimination, with a C-index of 0.720 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.717-0.723] and good calibration. Similar C-index was 0.718 (95% CI: 0.713-0.723) in validation cohort. Consistently, ROC curves presented good discrimination in the primary cohort [area under the curve (AUC) =0.720] and the validation set (AUC = 0.718) for the LNM nomogram. Calibration curve of the nomogram demonstrated good agreement.Conclusions: With the prediction of novel validated nomogram for women with early-stage breast cancer, doctors may distinguish patients with high possibility of LNM and devise individualize treatments.

TI  - Review of dust storm detection algorithms for multispectral satellite sensors
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Satellite remote sensing has been extensively utilized for monitoring dust storms in space and time. Dust storm detection using satellite observations is important to analyze the dust storm trajectories and sources. This paper reviews the algorithms for dust storm detection used in multispectral satellite sensors, spanning visible to thermal wavelengths. Four categories of dust detection algorithms are summarized, namely, dust spectral index algorithms, temporal anomalous detection algorithms, spatial coherence tested algorithms (physical-based algorithms) and machine learning-based algorithms. Following discussions of dust storm detection algorithms, the dust presence validation methods are also reviewed. Future developments for dust storm detection are focused upon three aspects: detection of dust storms at nighttime; development of more efficient machine learning methods for retrieval; and integrating physical and machine learning methods for satellite images.

TI  - Multitemporal Water Extraction of Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake Based on an Automatic Water Extraction and Dynamic Monitoring Framework
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate large-scale water body mapping and dynamic monitoring are of great significance for water resource planning, flood control, and disaster reduction applications. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems have the characteristics of strong operability, wide coverage, and all-weather data availability, and play a key role in large-scale water monitoring applications. However, there are still some challenges in the application of highly efficient, high-precision water extraction and dynamic monitoring methods. In this paper, a framework for the automatic extraction and long-term change monitoring of water bodies is proposed. First, a multitemporal water sample dataset is produced based on the bimodal threshold segmentation method. Second, attention block and pyramid module are introduced into the UNet (encoder-decoder) model to construct a robust water extraction network (PA-UNet). Then, GIS modeling is used for the automatic postprocessing of the water extraction results. Finally, the results are mapped and statistically analyzed. The whole process realizes end-to-end input and output. Sentinel-1 data covering Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake are selected for water extraction and dynamic monitoring analysis from 2017 to 2020, and Sentinel-2 images from a similar time frame are selected for verification. The results show that the proposed framework can realize high-precision (the extraction accuracy is higher than 95%), highly efficient automatic water extraction. Multitemporal monitoring results show that Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake fluctuate most in April, July, and November in 2017, 2019, and 2020, and the change trends of the two lakes are the same.

TI  - Spatiotemporal estimation of satellite-borne and ground-level NO<sub>2</sub> using full residual deep networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Compared with the limited capability of ground-level monitoring, remote sensing provides useful image data at a moderate or high spatial or temporal resolution with global coverage for monitoring of air pollutants, e.g., aerosol optical depth (AOD) observations from the MODIS for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) nitrogen dioxide (NO2) vertical columns for ground-level NO2 concentration. However, the extensive nonrandom missingness of OMI-NO2 data (e.g., an approximate per-pixel missing proportion of 59% for mainland China in 2015) due to cloud contamination or high reflectance limits applicability of these data in estimation of ground-level NO2. This paper proposes the use of a full residual deep learning method to impute missing satellite-borne NO2 data (OMI-NO2) and to estimate (map) ground-level NO2 with uncertainty (coefficient of variation) at a high spatial (1 x 1 km(2)) and temporal (daily) resolution. For the large study region (mainland China except Hainan Province), the presented method achieved robust performance with a stable learning efficiency (mean test R-2: 0.98 with a small standard deviation of 0.01; mean test RMSE: 0.42 x 10(15) molecules/cm(2)) for imputation of OMI-NO2. In the model, the coordinates and elevation were used to capture the spatial variability of the OMI-NO2 columns, and fused meteorological grid data and planetary boundary layer height and ozone data from GEOS-FP were used to capture spatiotemporal variability of OMI-NO2. The evaluation with ground in situ NO2 measurements showed considerable contribution of the complete (raw observed and imputed) OMI-NO2 columns, meteorology and traffic variables to inference of ground-level NO2 (test R-2: 0.82; test RMSE: 8.80 mu g/m(3)). The complete grids of OMI-NO2 columns showed natural and smooth spatial transitions between the raw observed and imputed values. The surfaces of predicted NO2 concentration not only showed consistent distributions with OMI-NO2 at a regional and temporal scale, but also presented local spatial gradients of ground-level NO2. OMI-NO2 can be downscaled and imputed to be used as an important predictor to improve the estimation of high-resolution ground-level NO2. The reliable estimates of ground-level NO2 concentration with uncertainty can reduce the bias in estimates of NO2 exposure and subsequently evaluations of its health effects.

TI  - Dynamic monitoring algorithm of natural resources in scenic spots based on MODIS Remote Sensing technology
T2  - EARTH SCIENCES RESEARCH JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - A dynamic monitoring algorithm of natural resources in scenic spots based on MODIS remote sensing technology is proposed to improve natural resources monitoring accuracy in scenic spots. The remote sensing images of scenic spots obtained by MODIS were preprocessed by TM image processing, atmospheric correction, and other technologies to get high-precision remote sensing images. The remote sensing images of scenic spots were segmented by the multiscale segmentation method, and then the hierarchical supervision classification method was used. The change points of natural resources were extracted. The resource changes and independent variables of scenic spots were analyzed based on the least square method to realize the dynamic monitoring of natural resources in scenic locations. The experimental results show that the technique can accurately monitor the dynamic changes of forest resources and water resources in scenic spots, and the monitoring results have high accuracy.

TI  - A Multi-Level Output-Based DBN Model for Fine Classification of Complex Geo-Environments Area Using Ziyuan-3 TMS Imagery
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fine-scale land use and land cover (LULC) data in a mining area are helpful for the smart supervision of mining activities. However, the complex landscape of open-pit mining areas severely restricts the classification accuracy. Although deep learning (DL) algorithms have the ability to extract informative features, they require large amounts of sample data. As a result, the design of more interpretable DL models with lower sample demand is highly important. In this study, a novel multi-level output-based deep belief network (DBN-ML) model was developed based on Ziyuan-3 imagery, which was applied for fine classification in an open-pit mine area of Wuhan City. First, the last DBN layer was used to output fine-scale land cover types. Then, one of the front DBN layers outputted the first-level land cover types. The coarse classification was easier and fewer DBN layers were sufficient. Finally, these two losses were weighted to optimize the DBN-ML model. As the first-level class provided a larger amount of additional sample data with no extra cost, the multi-level output strategy enhanced the robustness of the DBN-ML model. The proposed model produces an overall accuracy of 95.10% and an F1-score of 95.07%, outperforming some other models.

TI  - Is the efficacy of satellite-based inversion of SO<sub>2</sub> emission model dependent?
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based inverse modeling has the potential to drive aerosol precursor emissions, but its efficacy for improving chemistry transport models (CTMs) remains elusive because of its likely inherent dependence on the error characteristics of a specific CTM used for the inversion. This issue is quantitively assessed here by using three CTMs. We show that SO2 emissions from global GEOS-Chem adjoint model and OMI SO2 data, when combined with spatial variation of bottom-up emissions, can largely improve WRF-Chem and WRF-CMAQ forecast of SO2 and aerosol optical depth (in reference to moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer data) in China. This suggests that the efficacy of satellite-based inversion of SO2 emission appears to be high for CTMs that use similar or identical emission inventories. With the advent of geostationary air quality monitoring satellites in next 3 years, this study argues that an era of using top-down approach to rapidly update emission is emerging for regional air quality forecast, especially over Asia having highly varying emissions.

TI  - Ground Deformation After a Caldera Collapse: Contributions of Magma Inflow and Viscoelastic Response to the 2015-2018 Deformation Field Around Baroarbunga, Iceland
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Improvement of our understanding of the role of ground deformation due to viscoelastic relaxation following eruptions is important, as the generated signals can resemble renewed magma inflow. We study post-eruptive unrest at the subglacial Baroarbunga volcano, Iceland, after a caldera collapse and major magma drainage in 2014-2015. Elevated seismicity began about 6 months after the eruption ended, including nine M-lw > 4.5 earthquakes. Global Navigation Satellite System and Sentinel-1 Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar geodesy are applied to evaluate post-eruptive ground deformation from 2015 to 2018. Horizontal velocities locally exceed 10 cm/year and rapidly decay with distance away from the caldera. We explore two end-member models and their combination to explain the post-eruptive deformation field: 1) viscoelastic relaxation caused by the co-eruptive caldera collapse and magma withdrawal, and 2) renewed magma inflow. We find parameter combinations for each model that explain the observed ground deformation. The purely viscoelastic relaxation model, consisting of a half-space composed of a 7-km thick elastic layer on top of a viscoelastic layer with a viscosity of 3.0 x 10(18) Pa s reproduces broadly the observations. A simple magma inflow model consisting of a single point source with an inflow rate of 1 x 10(7) m(3)/year at 0.7 km depth broadly fits the observations, but may be unrealistic. A more elaborate model of magma inflow into a 10-km deep sill combined with slip on the caldera ring fault explains the observations well. Our results suggest that the co-eruptive deformation field is likely influenced by viscoelastic relaxation, renewed magma inflow, or a combination of both processes.

TI  - Application of a Multi-Layer Artificial Neural Network in a 3-D Global Electron Density Model Using the Long-Term Observations of COSMIC, Fengyun-3C, and Digisonde
T2  - SPACE WEATHER-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The ionosphere plays an important role in satellite navigation, radio communication, and space weather prediction. However, it is still a challenging mission to develop a model with high predictability that captures the horizontal-vertical features of ionospheric electrodynamics. In this study, multiple observations during 2005-2019 from space-borne global navigation satellite system (GNSS) radio occultation (RO) systems (COSMIC and FY-3C) and the Digisonde Global Ionosphere Radio Observatory are utilized to develop a completely global ionospheric three-dimensional electron density model based on an artificial neural network, namely ANN-TDD. The correlation coefficients of the predicted profiles all exceed 0.96 for the training, validation and test datasets, and the minimum root-mean-square error of the predicted residuals is 7.8 x 10(4) el/cm(3). Under quiet space weather, the predicted accuracy of the ANN-TDD is 30%-60% higher than the IRI-2016 at the Millstone Hill and Jicamarca incoherent scatter radars. However, the ANN-TDD is less capable of predicting ionospheric dynamic evolution under severe geomagnetic storms compared to the IRI-2016 with the STORM option activated. Additionally, the ANN-TDD successfully reproduces the large-scale horizontal-vertical ionospheric electrodynamic features, including seasonal variation and hemispheric asymmetries. These features agree well with the structure revealed by the RO profiles derived from the FORMOSAT/COSMIC-2 mission. Furthermore, the ANN-TDD successfully captures the prominent regional ionospheric patterns, including the equatorial ionization anomaly, Weddell Sea anomaly and mid-latitude summer nighttime anomaly. The new model is expected to play an important role in the application of GNSS navigation and in the explanation of the physical mechanisms involved.

TI  - Evaluation and comparison of light use efficiency models for their sensitivity to the diffuse PAR fraction and aerosol loading in China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The diffuse photosynthetically active radiation (PAR(dif)) is highly related to the gross primary productivity (GPP) of vegetation and can enhance the photosynthetic rate of shaded leaves. The PAR(dif) is mainly influenced by aerosols on clear sky days. To explore the impacts of the PAR(dif) fraction and aerosol loading on the accuracy of GPP estimations, we evaluated and compared the sensitivity of one-leaf and two-leaf light use efficiency (LUE) models (MOD17 and TL-LUE models) to the PAR(dif) fraction and aerosol optical depth (AOD) using satellite data and measurements at ChinaFLUX sites in China from 2003 to 2010. The estimated GPP from two models (GPP_MOD and GPP_TL) showed systematic underestimations when compared with the measured GPP at ChinaFLUX sites (GPP_FLUX). In addition, the underestimation of the GPP estimated by the two models was larger in months with high PAR(dif) fractions than in months with low PAR(dif) fractions at most sites. The TL-LUE model exhibited better performance than the MOD17 model with reduced underestimation and root-mean-square error (RMSE) values when the PAR(dif) fraction was greater than 0.7 or 0.8. When the PAR(dif) fraction was low, the TL-LUE model reduced the overestimation or increased the underestimations of GPP compared with the MOD17 model depending on the site. Both MOD17 and TL-LUE exhibited higher underestimations of GPP at high AOD values than at low AOD values at most sites. The TL-LUE model exhibited an overall better performance than MOD17 under high AOD. The overestimation also occurred for low AOD, which was consistent with that for low PARdif fractions. Therefore, the two LUE models showed dynamic performance with variations in the PAR(dif) fraction and AOD, which should be considered in the application and further improvement of GPP models.

TI  - Forest Fuel Loads Estimation from Landsat ETM plus and ALOS PALSAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fuel load is the key factor driving fire ignition, spread and intensity. The current literature reports the light detection and ranging (LiDAR), optical and airborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data for fuel load estimation, but the optical and SAR data are generally individually explored. Optical and SAR data are expected to be sensitive to different types of fuel loads because of their different imaging mechanisms. Optical data mainly captures the characteristics of leaf and forest canopy, while the latter is more sensitive to forest vertical structures due to its strong penetrability. This study aims to explore the performance of Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Arrayed L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) data as well as their combination on estimating three different types of fuel load-stem fuel load (SFL), branch fuel load (BFL) and foliage fuel load (FFL). We first analyzed the correlation between the three types of fuel load and optical and SAR data. Then, the partial least squares regression (PLSR) was used to build the fuel load estimation models based on the fuel load measurements from Vindeln, Sweden, and variables derived from optical and SAR data. Based on the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) method, results show that L-band SAR data performed well on all three types of fuel load (R-2 = 0.72, 0.70, 0.72). The optical data performed best for FFL estimation (R-2 = 0.66), followed by BFL (R-2 = 0.56) and SFL (R-2 = 0.37). Further improvements were found for the SFL, BFL and FFL estimation when integrating optical and SAR data (R-2 = 0.76, 0.81, 0.82), highlighting the importance of data selection and combination for fuel load estimation.

TI  - Characterising three decades of evolution of forest spatial pattern in a major coal-energy province in northern China using annual Landsat time series
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The analysis of change processes in relation to spatial patterns is gaining increasing attention in landscape ecology. Forest spatial pattern change is a critical process in landscape dynamics, and has a significant impact on the biodiversity, habitat quality, and ultimately, variation in the overall function of a forest ecosystem. The purpose of this study is to characterise the forest spatial pattern evolution over a 1 x 1 km(2) landscape units covering Shanxi, which is a major coal-energy province in northern China. Four landscape metrics, i.e., aggregation index (AI), largest patch index (LPI), patch density (PD), and shape index (SI), were derived based upon annual forest distribution maps (1987-2018). These metrics were used to identify three spatially heterogeneous pattern types: severely fragmentised pattern (SFP), incompletely fragmentised pattern (IFP), and relatively intact pattern (RIP), based on the integration of the self-organising map (SOM) with k-means algorithms. Post-classification change detection was conducted to analyse the change process of the forest spatial patterns. Results indicate that:(i) the average proportion of forest area with the RIP was approximately 50%, making it the dominant spatial pattern type; whereas forest areas with the SFP and IFP gradually approached each other in value; (ii) 80.7% landscape units experienced a pattern change, wherein the area with the SFP was always more likely to disappear during transition; (iii) Therein, the change times primarily concentrated between 2 and 4 for 66% of these units and the change duration was primarily in the range of 7-17 years. A relatively high proportion of pattern change occurred for sequential periods (2002-2005), and that the IFP interacts with the other pattern types most frequently. We concluded that the evaluation of multiple landscape metrics is effective in identifying spatial patterns through the combined use of the SOM with the k-means cluster. The spatial pattern and land-scape change processes are mutually restricted, and the forest spatial pattern has its own internal dynamics that has a different effect on the change processes.

TI  - Subpixel Change Detection Based on Radial Basis Function with Abundance Image Difference Measure for Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, land cover change detection has become a research focus of remote sensing. To obtain the change information from remote sensing images at fine spatial and temporal resolutions, subpixel change detection is widely studied and applied. In this paper, a new subpixel change detection method based on radial basis function (RBF) for remote sensing images is proposed, in which the abundance image difference measure (AIDM) is designed and utilized to enhance the subpixel mapping (SPM) by borrowing the fine spatial distribution of the fine spatial resolution image to decrease the influence of the spectral unmixing error. First, the fine and coarse spatial resolution images are used to develop subpixel change detection. Second, linear spectral mixing modeling and the degradation procedure are conducted on the coarse and fine spatial resolution image to produce two temporal abundance images, respectively. Then, the designed AIDM is utilized to enhance the RBF-based SPM by comparing the two temporal abundance images. At last, the proposed RBF-AIDM method is applied for SPM and subpixel change detection. The synthetic images based on Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and real case images based on two temporal Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images and one Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) image are undertaken to validate the proposed method. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can sufficiently decrease the influence of the spectral unmixing error and improve the subpixel change detection results.

TI  - Interannual and Seasonal Variations of Hydrological Connectivity in a Large Shallow Wetland of North China Estimated from Landsat 8 Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrological connectivity is an important characteristic of wetlands that maintains the stability and functions of an ecosystem. This study investigates the temporal variations of hydrological connectivity and their driving mechanism in Baiyangdian Lake, a large shallow wetland in North China, using a time series of open water surface area data derived from 36 Landsat 8 multispectral images from 2013-2019 and in situ measured water level data. Water area classification was implemented using the Google Earth Engine. Six commonly used indexes for extracting water surface data from satellite images were compared and the best performing index was selected for the water classification. A composite hydrological connectivity index computed from open water area data derived from Landsat 8 images was developed based on several landscape pattern indices and applied to Baiyangdian Lake. The results show that, reflectance in the near-infrared band is the most accurate index for water classification with >98% overall accuracy because of its sensitivity to different land cover types. The slopes of the best-fit linear relationships between the computed hydrological connectivity and observed water level show high variability between years. In most years, hydrological connectivity generally increases when water levels increase, with an average R-2 of 0.88. The spatial distribution of emergent plants also varies year to year owing to interannual variations of the climate and hydrological regime. This presents a possible explanation for the variations in the annual relationship between hydrological connectivity and water level. For a given water level, the hydrological connectivity is generally higher in spring than summer and autumn. This can be explained by the fact that the drag force exerted by emergent plants, which reduces water flow, is smaller than that for summer and autumn owing to seasonal variations in the phenological characteristics of emergent plants. Our study reveals that both interannual and seasonal variations in the hydrological connectivity of Baiyangdian Lake are related to the growth of emergent plants, which occupy a large portion of the lake area. Proper vegetation management may therefore improve hydrological connectivity in this wetland.

TI  - Semi-/Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation Method and Its Application for Coastal Aquaculture Areas Based on Multi-Source Remote Sensing Images-Taking the Fujian Coastal Area (Mainly Sanduo) as an Example
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal aquaculture areas are some of the main areas to obtain marine fishery resources and are vulnerable to storm-tide disasters. Obtaining the information of coastal aquaculture areas quickly and accurately is important for the scientific management and planning of aquaculture resources. Recently, deep neural networks have been widely used in remote sensing to deal with many problems, such as scene classification and object detection, and there are many data sources with different spatial resolutions and different uses with the development of remote sensing technology. Thus, using deep learning networks to extract coastal aquaculture areas often encounters the following problems: (1) the difficulty in labeling; (2) the poor robustness of the model; (3) the spatial resolution of the image to be processed is inconsistent with that of the existing samples. In order to fix these problems, this paper proposes a novel semi-/weakly-supervised method, the semi-/weakly-supervised semantic segmentation network (Semi-SSN), and adopts 3 data sources: GaoFen-2 image, GaoFen-1(PMS)image, and GanFen-1(WFV)image with a 0.8 m, 2 m, and 16 m spatial resolution, respectively, and through experiments, we analyze the extraction effect of the model comprehensively. After comparing with other the-state-of-art methods and verifying on an open remote sensing dataset, we take the Fujian coastal area (mainly Sanduo) as the experimental area and employ our method to detect the effect of storm-tide disasters on coastal aquaculture areas, monitor the production, and make the distribution map of coastal aquaculture areas.

TI  - Comparative analysis of dry intrusion in the different position of pre-TC squall line on typhoon Lekima (1909) and Matsa (0509)
T2  - TROPICAL CYCLONE RESEARCH AND REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Using conventional observation data, FY2 satellite data, typhoon data and NCEP reanalysis data, the different position of Pre-TC squall line accompanying the similar tracks with "Lekima" (No. 1909) and "Matsa" (No. 0509) is studied. The article analyzes the circulation background and trigger mechanism generated by the two pre-TC squall lines, and uses various physical quantities such as low-level vertical wind shear, humidity, wind field, wet potential vorticity, and vertical vorticity. Also, try to study the dynamic mechanism of dry intrusion during the process using the Slantwise Vorticity Development (SVD) theory. The results show that: the high-altitude system and the ground trigger mechanism produced are significantly different. On the high-altitude system, the "Lekima" squall line is generated between the continental high pressure and the typhoon with the northeast jet. The "Matsa" squall line occurred between the typhoon and the subtropical high, and near the typhoon inverted trough, which was generated with the strong easterlies. On the ground trigger mechanism, the "Lekima" squall line is generated at the convergence line under the intersection of northeast and northwest air currents. The "Matsa" squall line is generated in the ground inverted trough moves westward and meridional degree increases. During the two pre-TC squall lines, low-level vertical wind shear values are above 16 m.s(-1).The dry air intrusion in the lower layer came from the upper and middle troposphere in the vertical direction, and in the east from the west along the latitude in the horizontal direction. Theoretical analysis base on the development of wet potential vorticity, vertical vorticity, and inclined vorticity indicate that the downward transmission of the high potential vorticity band on the upper troposphere, the level of dry invasion, and the air mixing of equivalent potential temperature at high and low levels play an important role in the generation and development of the preTC squall line. The slantwise vorticity has a good corresponding relationship with the vertical vorticity over the pre-TC squall line. The two development processes of the pre-TC squall line can be better explained by using the SVD theory. (C) 2021 The Shanghai Typhoon Institute of China Meteorological Administration.

TI  - Exploring the utility of social-ecological and entomological risk factors for dengue infection as surveillance indicators in the dengue hyper-endemic city of Machala, Ecuador
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - The management of mosquito-borne diseases is a challenge in southern coastal Ecuador, where dengue is hyper-endemic and co-circulates with other arboviral diseases. Prior work in the region has explored social-ecological factors, dengue case data, and entomological indices. In this study, we bring together entomological and epidemiological data to describe links between social-ecological factors associated with risk of dengue transmission at the household level in Machala, Ecuador. Households surveys were conducted from 2014-2017 to assess the presence of adult Aedes aegypti (collected via aspiration) and to enumerate housing conditions, demographics, and mosquito prevention behaviors. Household-level dengue infection status was determined by laboratory diagnostics in 2014-2015. Bivariate analyses and multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify social-ecological variables associated with household presence of female Ae. aegypti and household dengue infection status, respectively. Aedes aegypti presence was associated with interruptions in water service and weekly trash collection, and household air conditioning was protective against mosquito presence. Presence of female Ae. aegypti was not associated with household dengue infections. We identified shaded patios and head of household employment status as risk factors for household-level dengue infection, while window screening in good condition was identified as protective against dengue infection. These findings add to our understanding of the systems of mosquito-borne disease transmission in Machala, and in the larger region of southern Ecuador, aiding in the development of improved vector surveillance efforts, and targeted interventions.Author summaryThe management of dengue fever, spread by the mosquito Aedes aegypti, is a major challenge to public health in southern coastal Ecuador. This is particularly true in the city of Machala, Ecuador, where the annual number of dengue fever cases is historically high. In this study, we bring together mosquito survey data and data on human dengue infections to describe household characteristics that are associated with dengue risk in Machala. Household surveys were conducted to determine the presence of adult Ae. aegypti mosquitoes, household-level dengue infection status, and to collect information housing conditions, members of the household, and mosquito prevention behaviors. Statistical analyses were performed to determine which household characteristics were linked to presence of female Ae. aegypti mosquitoes and dengue infection status. We identified several factors that were associated with increased risk of household mosquito presence, or dengue infections, in addition to protective characteristics associated with lower risk. Interestingly, presence of female Ae. aegypti did not predict which households would have dengue infections. These findings add to our understanding of mosquito-borne disease risk in Machala, and in the larger region of southern Ecuador, aiding in the development of improved mosquito control and surveillance efforts.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Evolution of Fractional Vegetation Cover and Its Response to Climate Change Based on MODIS Data in the Subtropical Region of China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The subtropical vegetation plays an important role in maintaining the structure and function of global ecosystems, and its contribution to the global carbon balance are receiving increasing attention. The fractional vegetation cover (FVC) as an important indicator for monitoring environment change, is widely used to analyze the spatiotemporal pattern of regional and even global vegetation. China is an important distribution area of subtropical vegetation. Therefore, we first used the dimidiate pixel model to extract the subtropical FVC of China during 2001-2018 based on MODIS land surface reflectance data, and then used the linear regression analysis and the variation coefficient to explore its spatiotemporal variations characteristics. Finally, the partial correlation analysis and the partial derivative model were used to analyze the influences and contributions of climate factors on FVC, respectively. The results showed that (1) the subtropical FVC had obvious spatiotemporal heterogeneity; the FVC high-coverage and medium-coverage zones were concentratedly and their combined area accounted for more than 70% of the total study area. (2) The interannual variation in the average subtropical FVC from 2001 to 2018 showed a significant growth trend. (3) In 76.28% of the study area, the regional FVC showed an increasing trend, and the remaining regional FVC showed a decreasing trend. However, the overall fluctuations in the FVC (increasing or decreasing) in the region were relatively stable. (4) The influences of climate factors to the FVC exhibited obvious spatial differences. More than half of all pixels exhibited the influence of the average annual minimum temperature and the annual precipitation had positive on FVC, while the average annual maximum temperature had negative on FVC. (5) The contributions of climate changes to FVC had obvious heterogeneity, and the average annual minimum temperature was the main contribution factor affecting the dynamic variations of FVC.

TI  - New indices to capture the evolution characteristics of urban expansion structure and form
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - A quantitative description is the basis for correctly understanding the urban expansion process. Previous approaches were dedicated to identifying expansion types based on the boundary sharing rate, thereby depicting the evolution of urban expansion. These methods, however, focused on describing neighborhood relations and ignored urban global expansion structure and form information. In this study, we first propose a new index, the location centrality index (LCI), to capture the expansion structure characteristics by incorporating an "area-inverse distance" weighting algorithm and geometric features. Then, we propose another index, the location centrality aggregation index (LCAI), to depict the heterogeneous evolution of urban form by considering the attribute of the new patch. The location centrality and location aggregation types are identified to reflect the effect of new patches on the urban expansion structure and form based on LCI and LCAI, respectively. Two variants of LCI and LCAI are also proposed to reflect the global bottom-up characteristics of urban expansion. The LCI and LCAI were verified using four periods of Landsat images (1995, 2000, 2005, and 2010) of the Wuhan metropolitan area, China. The results show that the overall development trend of the expansion structure in the Wuhan metropolitan area was toward decentralization. The urban form had become generally separated, but tended toward aggregation from 2005 to 2010. Our findings also reveal that the LCI fills the gap in the dynamic assessment of urban expansion with previous indices by explicitly uncovering global structure characteristics. The LCAI achieves better performance than previous indices in identifying heterogeneous aggregation.

TI  - Underground Coal Fire Detection and Monitoring Based on Landsat-8 and Sentinel-1 Data Sets in Miquan Fire Area, XinJiang
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Underground coal fires have become a worldwide disaster, which brings serious environmental pollution and massive energy waste. Xinjiang is one of the regions that is seriously affected by the underground coal fires. After years of extinguishing, the underground coal fire areas in Xinjiang have not been significantly reduced yet. To extinguish underground coal fires, it is critical to identify and monitor them. Recently, remote sensing technologies have been showing great potential in coal fires' identification and monitoring. The thermal infrared technology is usually used to detect thermal anomalies in coal fire areas, and the Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (DInSAR) technology for the detection of coal fires related to ground subsidence. However, non-coal fire thermal anomalies caused by ground objects with low specific heat capacity, and surface subsidence caused by mining and crustal activities have seriously affected the detection accuracy of coal fire areas. To improve coal fires' detection accuracy by using remote sensing technologies, this study firstly obtains temperature, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and subsidence information based on Landsat8 and Sentinel-1 data, respectively. Then, a multi-source information strength and weakness constraint method (SWCM) is proposed for coal fire identification and analysis. The results show that the proposed SWCM has the highest coal fire identification accuracy among the employed methods. Moreover, it can significantly reduce the commission and omission error caused by non-coal fire-related thermal anomalies and subsidence. Specifically, the commission error is reduced by 70.4% on average, and the omission error is reduced by 30.6%. Based on the results, the spatio-temporal change characteristics of the coal fire areas have been obtained. In addition, it is found that there is a significant negative correlation between the time-series temperature and the subsidence rate of the coal fire areas (R-2 reaches 0.82), which indicates the feasibility of using both temperature and subsidence to identify and monitor underground coal fires.

The literature review showed that the current landslides extraction methods mostly depend on expert interpretation which was low automation and thus was unable to provide sufficient information for earthquake rescue in time. To solve the above problem, an end-to-end improved Mask R-CNN model was proposed. The main innovations of this paper were (1) replacing the feature extraction layer with an effective ResNeXt module to extract the landslides. (2) Increasing the bottom-up channel in the feature pyramid network to make full use of low-level positioning and high-level semantic information. (3) Adding edge losses to the loss function to improve the accuracy of the landslide boundary detection accuracy. At the end of this paper, Jiuzhaigou County, Sichuan Province, was used as the study area to evaluate the new model. Results showed that the new method had a precision of 95.8%, a recall of 93.1%, and an overall accuracy (OA) of 94.7%. Compared with the traditional Mask R-CNN model, they have been significantly improved by 13.9%, 13.4%, and 9.9%, respectively. It was proved that the new method was effective in the landslides automatic extraction.

TI  - A Spatial Improved-kNN-Based Flood Inundation Risk Framework for Urban Tourism under Two Rainfall Scenarios
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban tourism has been suffering socio-economic challenges from flood inundation risk (FIR) triggered by extraordinary rainfall under climate extremes. The evaluation of FIR is essential for mitigating economic losses, and even casualties. This study proposes an innovative spatial framework integrating improved k-nearest neighbor (kNN), remote sensing (RS), and geographic information system (GIS) to analyze FIR for tourism sites. Shanghai, China, was selected as a case study. Tempo-spatial factors, including climate, topography, drainage, vegetation, and soil, were selected to generate several flood-related gridded indicators as inputs into the evaluation framework. A likelihood of FIR was mapped to represent possible inundation for tourist sites under a moderate-heavy rainfall scenario and extreme rainfall scenario. The resultant map was verified by the maximum inundation extent merged by RS images and water bodies. The evaluation outcomes deliver the baseline and scientific information for urban planners and policymakers to take cost-effective measures for decreasing and evading the pressure of FIR on the sustainable development of urban tourism. The spatial improved-kNN-based framework provides an innovative, effective, and easy-to-use approach to evaluate the risk for the tourism industry under climate change.

TI  - Evaluating the Vertical Accuracy of DEM Generated from ZiYuan-3 Stereo Images in Understanding the Tectonic Morphology of the Qianhe Basin, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently available high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) is not particularly useful to geologists for understanding the long-term changes in fluvial landforms induced by tectonic uplift, although DEMs that are generated from satellite stereo images such as the ZiYuan-3 (ZY3) satellite include characteristics with significant coverage and rapid acquisition. Since an ongoing analysis of fluvial systems is lacking, the ZY3 DEM was generated from block adjustment to describe the mountainous area of the Qianhe Basin that have been induced by tectonic uplift. Moreover, we evaluated the overall elevation difference in ZY3 DEM, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (1 '' x 1 '') (SRTM1), and Reflection Radiometer Global Digital Elevation Model (ASTER GDEM) by using the Ice Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite/Geoscience Laser Altimeter (ICESat/GLAH14) point cloud and a DEM of 1:50,000 scale. The values of the root mean square error (RMSE) of the elevation difference for ZY3 DEM were 9.31 and 9.71 m, respectively, and are in good agreement with SRTM1. The river long profiles and terrace heights were also extracted to compare the differences in channel steepness and the incision rates with SRTM1 and ASTER GDEM. Our results prove that ZY3 DEM would be a good alternative to SRTM1 in achieving the 1:50,000 scale for DEM products in China, while ASTER GDEM is unsuitable for extracting river longitudinal profiles. In addition, the northern and southern river incision rates were estimated using the ages and heights of river terraces, demonstrating a range from 0.12-0.45 to 0.10-0.33 m/kyr, respectively. Collectively, these findings suggest that ZY3 DEM is capable of estimating tectonic geomorphological features and has the potential for analyzing the continuous evolutionary response of a landscape to changes in climate and tectonics.

TI  - A methodology to estimate forest fires burned areas and burn severity degrees using Sentinel-2 data. Application to the October 2017 fires in the Iberian Peninsula
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - A methodology to estimate the extent of areas affected by forest fires, as well as the burn severity levels using Sentinel 2 images (10 and 20 m) is proposed and applied to the fires occurred in October 2017 in Spain and Portugal. An extension larger than 250,000 ha and 4 burn severity levels (low, moderate, high and very high) have been obtained. The comparison with the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS), which uses MODIS images (250 m), shows that the methodology improves the area estimate by 10 % in commission area. In terms of burn severity levels, the Separability index (SI) and the Kappa statistic (k) show a high correlation between Sentinel-2 and EFFIS (SI values higher than one in all cases and k higher than 0.69, respectively).

TI  - Cetacean Strandings and Museum Collections: A Focus on Sicily Island Crossroads for Mediterranean Species
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
M3  - Review
AB  - The study examined the extent of the cetacean strandings in Italy, with a particular focus on Sicily Island. The paper aimed to contribute to the description of a pattern that contemplates the "regular and rare" cetacean species passage along the Sicilian coast. The estimate of marine cetacean strandings was extrapolated from the National Strandings Data Bank (BDS-Banca Dati Spiaggiamenti) and evaluated according to a subdivision in three coastal subregions: the Tyrrhenian sub-basin (northern Sicilian coast), the Ionian sub-basin (eastern Sicilian coast), and the Channel of Sicily (southern Sicilian coast). Along the Italian coast, more than 4880 stranding events have been counted in the period 1990-2019. Most of these were recorded in five Italian regions: Apulia, Sicily, Sardinia, Tuscany, and Calabria. Approximately 15% of the recorded strandings in Italy occurred on the Sicilian coast. In Sicily Island, 725 stranded cetaceans were recorded in 709 stranding events, resulting in approximately 20 carcasses every year; the total number of specimens identified to species level was 539. The distribution along the Sicilian coast was the following: 312 recorded in the Tyrrhenian sub-basin, 193 in the Ionian sub-basin, and 220 in the Channel of Sicily. Stenella coeruleoalba was the species that can be considered as the stable record along the time-lapse investigated, and some rare species have been recorded as well. The role of Sicily Island as a sentinel territory of the cetacean distribution for the central Mediterranean Sea and as a region receiving a marine resource suitable for the scientific research and cetological museum collections is discussed herein.

TI  - Possibilities and Challenges in Providing Psychotherapeutic Interventions to Meet the Needs of the Latinx Population in the United States
T2  - GENEALOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The mental health system in the United States faces challenges in adequately engaging the Latinx population with modalities that conform to the Latinx worldview, which demands incorporating holistic, family-centric, and trauma-informed models of treatment. Service provision and innovation is hampered by lack of research focusing on this population, the low numbers of Latinx clinicians available, and the lack of treatment adaptations to meet their needs. Psychotherapeutic interventions employed in the Latin American context are potentially useful when working with acculturating Latinx. In this article attention is given to barriers and facilitators for incorporating Family constellation therapy-a holistic trauma-informed treatment modality that offers conflict resolution through connection with ancestry.

TI  - Benchmarking Deep Learning Models for Cloud Detection in Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The systematic monitoring of the Earth using optical satellites is limited by the presence of clouds. Accurately detecting these clouds is necessary to exploit satellite image archives in remote sensing applications. Despite many developments, cloud detection remains an unsolved problem with room for improvement, especially over bright surfaces and thin clouds. Recently, advances in cloud masking using deep learning have shown significant boosts in cloud detection accuracy. However, these works are validated in heterogeneous manners, and the comparison with operational threshold-based schemes is not consistent among many of them. In this work, we systematically compare deep learning models trained on Landsat-8 images on different Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 publicly available datasets. Overall, we show that deep learning models exhibit a high detection accuracy when trained and tested on independent images from the same Landsat-8 dataset (intra-dataset validation), outperforming operational algorithms. However, the performance of deep learning models is similar to operational threshold-based ones when they are tested on different datasets of Landsat-8 images (inter-dataset validation) or datasets from a different sensor with similar radiometric characteristics such as Sentinel-2 (cross-sensor validation). The results suggest that (i) the development of cloud detection methods for new satellites can be based on deep learning models trained on data from similar sensors and (ii) there is a strong dependence of deep learning models on the dataset used for training and testing, which highlights the necessity of standardized datasets and procedures for benchmarking cloud detection models in the future.

TI  - Assessing the performance of different OBIA software approaches for mapping invasive alien plants along roads with remote sensing data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Roads and roadsides provide dispersal channels for non-native invasive alien plants (IAP), many of which hold devastating impacts in the economy, human health, biodiversity and ecosystem functionality. Remote sensing is an essential tool for efficiently assessing and monitoring the dynamics of IAP along roads. In this study, we explore the potentialities of object based image analysis (OBIA) approach to map several invasive plant species along roads using very high spatial resolution imagery. We compared the performance of OBIA approaches implemented in one open source software (OTB/Monteverdi) against those available in two proprietary pro-grams (eCognition and ArcGIS). We analysed the images by two sequential processes. First, we obtained a land-cover map for 15 study sites by segmenting the images with the algorithms Mean Shift Segmentation (MSS) and Multiresolution Segmentation (MRS), and by classifying the segmented images with the algorithms Support Vector Machine (SVM), Nearest Neighbour Classifier (NNC) and Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC). We created a mask using the polygons classified as non-vegetation to crop the images of the 15 study sites. Second, we repeated the previous segmentation and classification steps over the 15 masked images of vegetated areas using the same algorithms. OTB/Monteverdi, with MSS and SVM algorithms, showed to be a good software for land-cover mapping (OA = 87.0%), as well as ArcGIS, with MSS and MLC algorithms (OA = 84.3%). However, these two programs, using the same segmentation algorithms, did not achieve good accuracy results when mapping IAP species (OA(OTB/Monteverdi) = 63.3%; OAA(cos = 45.7%). eCognition, with MRS and NNC algorithms, reached better classification results in both land-cover and IAP maps (OA(Land-cover )= 95.7%; OA(Invasive-plant )= 92.8%). 'Bare soil' and 'Road', and 'A. donax' were the classes with best and worst overall accuracy, respectively, when mapping land-cover classes in the three programs. 'Other trees' was the class with the most accurate and significant differences in the three programs when mapping IAP species. The separation of each invasive species should be improved with a phenology-based design of field surveys. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of sequential segmentation and classification of RS data for mapping and monitoring plant invasions along linear infrastructures, which allows to reduce the time, cost and hazard of extensive field campaigns along roadsides.

TI  - Seamless maps of major elements of the Moon: Results from high-resolution geostationary satellite
T2  - RESEARCH IN ASTRONOMY AND ASTROPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Major elements such as Fe, Ti, Mg, Al, Ca and Si play very important roles in understanding the origin and evolution of the Moon. Previous maps of these major elements derived from orbital data are based on mosaic images or low-resolution gamma-ray data. The hue variations and gaps among orbital boundaries in the mosaic images are not conducive to geological studies. This paper aims to produce seamless and homogenous distribution maps of major elements using the single-exposure image of the whole lunar disk obtained by China's high-resolution geostationary satellite, Gaofen-4, with a spatial resolution of similar to 500 m. The elemental contents of soil samples returned by Apollo and Luna missions are regarded as ground truth, and are correlated with the reflectance of the sampling sites extracted from Gaofen-4 data. The final distribution maps of these major oxides are generated with the statistical regression model. With these products, the average contents and proportions of the major elements for maria and highlands were estimated and compared. The results showed that SiO2 and TiO2 have the highest and lowest fractions in mare and highland areas, respectively. Moreover, the relative concentrations of these elements could serve as indicators of geologic processes, e.g., the obviously asymmetric distributions of Al2O3, CaO and SiO2 around Tycho crater may suggest that Tycho crater was formed by an oblique impact from the southwest direction.

TI  - Testing the indirect effects of somatic and parental effort on stress: the roles of worldviews and coping strategies
T2  - CURRENT PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Life history theory (LHT) is a mid-level theory from evolutionary biology. LHT, adapted to humans, assumes that individuals can be placed along a single continuum of LH strategies referred to as the slow-to-fast LH continuum: faster life history strategists score higher on mating effort and lower on somatic and parental effort. In the present study we examine the hypothesis that worldview and coping strategies are mediators between somatic and parental effort (SPE) and current perceived stress. 226 participants completed a set of instruments: Mini-K, the World Assumptions Scale, Brief COPE, and the Perceived Stress Scale. In order to test the hypotheses about mediators, Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used. The results from the current study showed that individuals allocating their own resources to SPE experienced lower current stress, and felt positive about the benevolence and meaningfulness of the world as well as the worthiness of the self. A more complex linkage was also revealed: individuals displaying SPE endorsed stronger beliefs about self-worth, which in turn was associated with a lower tendency to use disengagement coping and which again translated into a lower level of perceived stress. Furthermore, females investing in SPE maintained a higher level of belief in the meaningfulness of the world, which translated into a higher tendency to use external support for coping.

TI  - Effects of urbanization on groundwater level in aquifers of Binh Duong Province, Vietnam
T2  - JOURNAL OF GROUNDWATER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this paper was to assess the impact of urbanization on the groundwater level (GWL) in aquifers of Binh Duong (BD) Province. The research method is to analyze the trend of GWL, the recharge capacity of surface over time and the relationship between them. The data of the GWL used in the study are the average values in the dry and rainy seasons of 35 observation wells from 2011 to 2018, which are in Pleistocene and Pliocene aquifers. The ability to recharge groundwater from the surface in this study was represented by the curve number (CN), a parameter used in hydrology for calculating direct runoff or infiltration from rainfall. The land use data to identify the CN was analyzed from the Landsat images. The results show that besides over-exploitation, the change of surface characteristic due to the urbanization development process is also the cause of the GWL decline. The analysis of seasonal GWL data shows that the increase in impervious surface area is the cause of GWL decline in the Pleistocene aquifer, which is more evident in the rainy season than in the dry season. The statistical results also show that in the rainy season and in shallow aquifers, a higher CN change can be found with the wells that had a remarkable GWL decline compared to the remaining wells.

TI  - A Low-Cost Active Reflector for Interferometric Monitoring Based on Sentinel-1 SAR Images
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The effectiveness of radar interferometric techniques in non-urban areas can often be compromised due to the lack of stable natural targets. This drawback can be partially compensated through the installation of reference targets, characterized by a bright and stable radar response. The installation of passive corner reflectors (PCR) often represents a valid aid, but these objects are usually cumbersome, and suffer from severe weather conditions; furthermore, the installation of a PCR can be difficult and costly, especially in places with hard accessibility. Active reflectors (AR) represent a less cumbersome alternative to PCRs, while still providing a stable phase response. This paper describes the design, implementation, and test of an AR prototype, designed to operate with the Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR), aimed at providing a fair performance/cost benefit. These characteristics, obtained through a tradeoff between the use of off-the-shelf components and a simple architecture, can make the setup of a dense network (i.e., tens of devices) in the monitored areas feasible. The paper reports the design, implementation, and the analysis of different tests carried out in a laboratory, and in a real condition in the field, to illustrate AR reliability and estimate its phase stability.

TI  - Forecasting Oil Crops Yields on the Regional Scale Using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Early prediction of crop yields on large cropland areas is of a great importance for operational planning in the agrarian sector of economy and ensuring food security. Large-scale forecasts became possible owing to the introduction of remote sensing technologies in the systems of precision agriculture, providing the information on crops conditions both on a certain field and large croplands. The study on the forecasting of major oil crop yields, namely, sunflower (Helianthus annuus L), winter rape (Brassica napus) and soybean (Glycine max), on the regional level in Kherson oblast of Ukraine was conducted using historical yielding data and monthly MODIS Terrain NDVI smoothed time series imagery with 250 m resolution of the period from 2012 to 2019. The statistical data on the crop yields were linked to the corresponding values of monthly NDVI to determine the type of inter-relationship and work out the regression models for the oil crops yield prediction based on the remotely sensed vegetation index. The highest correlation between the yields of the oil crops and NDVI with the best prediction accuracy were obtained by using the index values at the period of April for winter rape, July for sunflower, and August for soybean. The developed regression models have reasonable accuracy with the mean absolute percentage errors of predictions reaching 25.23 percent for sunflower, 18.28 percent for winter rape, and 13.24 percent for soybean. The models are easy in use and might be recommended for introduction in theory and practice of precision agriculture.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Lightning Activity Detected by WWLLN over the Tibetan Plateau and Its Comparison with LIS Lightning
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Herein, we compared data on the spatiotemporal distribution of lightning activity obtained from the World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) with that from the Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS). The WWLLN and LIS both suggest intense lightning activity over the central and southeastern Tibetan Plateau (TP) during May-September. Meanwhile, the WWLLN indicates relatively weak lightning activity over the northeastern TP, where the LIS suggests very intense lightning activity, and it also indicates a high-density lightning center over the southwestern TP that is not suggested by the LIS. Furthermore, the WWLLN lightning peaks in August in terms of monthly variation and in late August in terms of 10-day variation, unlike the corresponding LIS lightning peaks of July and late June, respectively. Other observation data were also introduced into the comparison. The blackbody temperature (TBB) data from the Fengyun-2E geostationary satellite (as a proxy of deep convection) and thunderstorm-day data support the spatial distribution of the WWLLN lightning more. Meanwhile, for seasonal variation, the TBB data are more analogous to the LIS data, whereas the cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning data from a local CG lightning location system are closer to the WWLLN data. It is speculated that the different WWLLN and LIS observation modes may cause their data to represent different dominant types of lightning, thereby leading to differences in the spatiotemporal distributions of their data. The results may further imply that there exist regional differences and seasonal variations in the electrical properties of thunderstorms over the TP.

TI  - A Precision Evaluation Index System for Remote Sensing Data Sampling Based on Hexagonal Discrete Grids
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of earth observation, satellite navigation, mobile communication, and other technologies, the order of magnitude of the spatial data we acquire and accumulate is increasing, and higher requirements are put forward for the application and storage of spatial data. As a new form of data management, the global discrete grid can be used for the efficient storage and application of large-scale global spatial data, which is a digital multiresolution georeference model that helps to establish a new model of data association and fusion. It is expected to make up for the shortcomings in the organization, processing, and application of current spatial data. There are different types of grid systems according to the grid division form, including global discrete grids with equal latitude and longitude, global discrete grids with variable latitude and longitude, and global discrete grids based on regular polyhedrons. However, there is no accuracy evaluation index system for remote sensing images expressed on the global discrete grid to solve this problem. This paper is dedicated to finding a suitable way to express remote sensing data on discrete grids, as well as establishing a suitable accuracy evaluation system for modeling remote sensing data based on hexagonal grids to evaluate modeling accuracy. The results show that this accuracy evaluation method can evaluate and analyze remote sensing data based on hexagonal grids from multiple levels, and the comprehensive similarity coefficient of the images before and after conversion is greater than 98%, which further proves the availability of the hexagonal-grid-based remote sensing data of remote sensing images. This evaluation method is generally applicable to all raster remote sensing images based on hexagonal grids, and it can be used to evaluate the availability of hexagonal grid images.

TI  - An Exponential Algorithm for Bottom Reflectance Retrieval in Clear Optically Shallow Waters from Multispectral Imagery without Ground Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Bottom reflectance is a significant parameter characterizing the bottom types for clear optically shallow waters, typically in oceanic islands and reefs. However, there is not an effective physics-based method for inverting the bottom reflectance using multispectral images. In this study, we propose a novel approach for quantitatively inverting the bottom reflectance at 550 nm without the dependence of in situ bottom reflectance data or any other priori knowledge. By linking different pixels in the same image and utilizing the strong linear relationship between their water depths and the spectral related parameters, the global situation of the radiative transfer model was constrained, and an exponential relationship between the log-transformed ratio of the blue-green band reflectance and the bottom reflectance was established. The proposed model was checked by comparing the Hydrolight input bottom reflectance with that inverted from Hydrolight simulated spectrum, resulting in correlating well. Our method has successfully performed using WorldView-2 and Landsat-8 in Midway Island in the North Pacific Ocean, with the cross- and indirectly checking and obtained reliable and robust results. In addition, we assessed the potential of the quantitative bottom reflectance in benthic classification and inversion ranges under different bottom reflectance. These results indicated that compared with those methods relying on in situ data or hyperspectral imagery, our algorithm is more likely to efficiently improve the parameterization of bottom reflectance, which can be very useful for benthic habitat mapping and transferred to large-scale regions in clean reef waters, as well as monitor time-series dynamics of oceanic bottom types to forecast coral reef bleaching.

TI  - Where to Go or Where Not to Go-A Method for Advising Communities during Extreme Temperatures
T2  - CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is producing more extremes and increasing the number and magnitude of risks that impact people's lives, so identifying and understanding local climate risks is a long but essential process for defining adaptation strategies. The availability of technologies to sensitize and educate people about risks, and to assist people with becoming active observers and monitors of climatic elements has helped to promote permanent surveillance and proactive attitudes towards climatic phenomena that lead to undesirable risks. This paper proposes a methodological approach to guide citizens moving around the city when extreme temperatures occur, minimizing climatic risks and negative health comes, using a very simple method based on Landsat 8 temperature data images at a subsection spatial scale level. The results obtained indicate the places of higher extreme temperatures risks, as well as some of the potential places that people can use to protect themselves. This work demonstrates the value of mapping climatic factors at a local scale and deliver tailored and accurate maps with the places suitable for alleviating bioclimatic stresses and the places that should be avoided.

TI  - Application of the Random Forest Classifier to Map Irrigated Areas Using Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Improvements in irrigated areas' classification accuracy are critical to enhance agricultural water management and inform policy and decision-making on irrigation expansion and land use planning. This is particularly relevant in water-scarce regions where there are plans to increase the land under irrigation to enhance food security, yet the actual spatial extent of current irrigation areas is unknown. This study applied a non-parametric machine learning algorithm, the random forest, to process and classify irrigated areas using images acquired by the Landsat and Sentinel satellites, for Mpumalanga Province in Africa. The classification process was automated on a big-data management platform, the Google Earth Engine (GEE), and the R-programming was used for post-processing. The normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) was subsequently used to distinguish between irrigated and rainfed areas during 2018/19 and 2019/20 winter growing seasons. High NDVI values on cultivated land during the dry season are an indication of irrigation. The classification of cultivated areas was for 2020, but 2019 irrigated areas were also classified to assess the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on agriculture. The comparison in irrigated areas between 2019 and 2020 facilitated an assessment of changes in irrigated areas in smallholder farming areas. The approach enhanced the classification accuracy of irrigated areas using ground-based training samples and very high-resolution images (VHRI) and fusion with existing datasets and the use of expert and local knowledge of the study area. The overall classification accuracy was 88%.

TI  - Representation of tree cover in global land cover products: Finland as a case study area
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest extent mapping is required for climate modeling and monitoring changes in ecosystem state. Different global land cover (LC) products employ simple tree cover (referred also as "forest cover" or even "vegetation cover") definitions to differentiate forests from non-forests. Since 1990, a large number of forest extent maps have become available. Although many studies have compared forest extent data, they often use old data (i.e., around the year 2000). In this study, we assessed tree cover representations of three different annual, global LC products (MODIS VCF (MOD44B, Collection 6 (C6)), MCD12Q1 (C6), and CCI LC (v.2.1.1)) using the Finnish Multi-Source National Forest Inventory (MS-NFI) data for the year 2017. In addition, we present an intercomparison approach for analyzing spatial representations of coniferous and deciduous species. Intercomparison of different LC products is often overlooked due to challenges involved in non-standard and overlapping LC class definitions. Global LC products are used for monitoring changes in land use and land cover and modeling of surface fluxes. Given that LC is a major driver of global change through modifiers such as land surface albedo, more attention should be paid to spatial mapping of coniferous and deciduous species. Our results show that tree cover was either overestimated or underestimated depending on the LC product, and classification accuracy varied between 42 and 75%. Intercomparison of the LC products showed large differences in conifer and deciduous species spatial distributions. Spatial mapping of coniferous and deciduous tree covers was the best represented by the CCI LC product as compared with the reference MS-NFI data.

TI  - Uncertainty and Sensitivity Analysis of a Remote-Sensing-Based Penman-Monteith Model to Meteorological and Land Surface Input Variables
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analysed the uncertainty and sensitivity of core and intermediate input variables of a remote-sensing-data-based Penman-Monteith (PM-Mu) evapotranspiration (ET) model. We derived absolute and relative uncertainties of core measured meteorological and remote-sensing-based atmospheric and land surface input variables and parameters of the PM-Mu model. Uncertainties of important intermediate data components (i.e., net radiation and aerodynamic and surface resistances) were also assessed. To estimate the instrument measurement uncertainties of the in situ meteorological input variables, we used the reported accuracies of the manufacturers. Observational accuracies of the remote sensing input variables (land surface temperature (LST), land surface emissivity (epsilon(s)), leaf area index (LAI), land surface albedo (alpha)) were derived from peer-reviewed satellite sensor validation reports to compute their uncertainties. The input uncertainties were propagated to the final model's evapotranspiration estimation uncertainty. Our analysis indicated relatively high uncertainties associated with relative humidity (RH), and hence all the intermediate variables associated with RH, like vapour pressure deficit (VPD) and the surface and aerodynamic resistances. This is in contrast to other studies, which reported LAI uncertainty as the most influential. The semi-arid conditions and seasonality of the regional South African climate and high temporal frequency of the variations in VPD, air and land surface temperatures could explain the uncertainties observed in this study. The results also showed the ET algorithm to be most sensitive to the air-land surface temperature difference. An accurate assessment of those in situ and remotely sensed variables is required to achieve reliable evapotranspiration model estimates in these generally dry regions and climates. A significant advantage of the remote-sensing-based ET method remains its full area coverage in contrast to classic-point (station)-based ET estimates.

TI  - Detection of Oil Palm Disease in Plantations in Krabi Province, Thailand with High Spatial Resolution Satellite Imagery
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) trees are an important contributor of recent economic development in Southeast Asia. The high product yield, and the consequent high profitability, has led to a widespread expansion of plantations in the greater region. However, oil palms are susceptible to diseases that can have a detrimental effect. In this study we use hyper- and multi-spectral remote sensing to detect diseased oil palm trees in Krabi province, Thailand. Proximate spectroscopic measurements were used to identify and discern differences in leaf spectral radiance; the results indicate a relatively higher radiance in visible and near-infrared for the healthy leaves in comparison to the diseased. From a total of 113 samples for which the geolocation and the hyperspectral radiance were recorded, 59 and 54 samples were healthy and diseased oil palm trees, respectively. Moreover, a WorldView-2 satellite image was used to investigate the usability of traditional vegetation indices and subsequently detecting diseased oil palm trees. The results show that the overall maximum likelihood classification accuracy is 85.98%, the Kappa coefficient 0.71 and the producer's accuracy for healthy and diseased oil palm trees 83.33 and 78.95, respectively. We conclude that high spatial and spectral resolutions can play a vital role in monitoring diseases in oil palm plantations.

TI  - A Convolutional Neural Network Architecture for Sentinel-1 and AMSR2 Data Fusion
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With a growing number of different satellite sensors, data fusion offers great potential in many applications. In this work, a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is presented for fusing Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) data. The CNN is applied to the prediction of Arctic sea ice for marine navigation and as input to sea ice forecast models. This generic model is specifically well suited for fusing data sources where the ground resolutions of the sensors differ with orders of magnitude, here 35 km x 62 km (for AMSR2, 6.9 GHz) compared with the 93 m x 87 m (for sentinel-1 IW mode). In this work, two optimization approaches are compared using the categorical cross-entropy error function in the specific application of CNN training on sea ice charts. In the first approach, concentrations are thresholded to be encoded in a standard binary fashion, and in the second approach, concentrations are used as the target probability directly. The second method leads to a significant improvement in R2 measured on the prediction of ice concentrations evaluated over the test set. The performance improves both in terms of robustness to noise and alignment with mean concentrations from ice analysts in the validation data, and an R-2 value of 0.89 is achieved over the independent test set. It can be concluded that CNNs are suitable for multisensor fusion even with sensors that differ in resolutions by large factors, such as in the case of Sentinel-1 SAR and AMSR2.

TI  - THE ROLE OF TRADITION AND INNOVATIONS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PRIMARY EDUCATION THEORY IN AZERBAIJAN (1920-1931)
T2  - REVISTA ON LINE DE POLITICA E GESTAO EDUCACIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The study of the history of primary education in Azerbaijan expands the boundaries of pedagogical thinking. The re-introduction of the progressive aspects of the historical and pedagogical heritage of the 20th century into scientific circles plays an important role in the formation of modern educational culture. Historical and pedagogical heritage is a source of renewal of pedagogical knowledge, acquisition of qualitatively new content, as well as its sustainability. It is important to study the history of primary education, as it helps to solve two problems that are closely related to each other. Firstly, what happened when one first examined the historical pedagogical heritage? How did it happen? Why did it happen and what was the result? What was the significance of what happened during that period and any further development? Secondly, by referring to the historical pedagogical heritage, it is possible to understand the theory and practice of today's education, the problems of modern pedagogical thinking and worldview. The article examines and compares the role of tradition and innovation in the development of the theory of primary education in Azerbaijan in the 1920s. For this purpose, the article analyzes the educational technologies used in that period, general scientific approaches, curricula and content of textbooks prepared for primary schools, and quality criteria in teacher formation. It is argued that this period was politically complex, economically difficult, characterized by a general decline in the common cultural and educational level of the population, but was interesting in terms of the building of a new society and a new state. Reforms in the field of education in Russia were repeated in Azerbaijan. Although experiments in the field of education were aimed at raising the cultural level of society, eliminating illiteracy, establishing new approaches to education, innovations (application of "complex" approach, use of active learning methods, application of project method etc.), they did not improve the quality of education. The introduction of innovations sometimes led to the denial and oblivion of traditions. The new teaching methods applied in Azerbaijani schools without any expertise, as they were brought from European and American schools, created serious problems in the formation of education because the new technology denied the tradition. With the class-lesson system with strict regulations, exhaustive structure and function, rich traditions were replaced by the laboratory-brigade method. The results of incorrect experiments became a serious obstacle to the development of education. For this reason, in the early 1930s, official government decisions banned experiments that hindered the development of education.

TI  - Tracking Marine Alien Macroalgae in the Mediterranean Sea: The Contribution of Citizen Science and Remote Sensing
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Review
AB  - The accelerating rate of the introduction of non-indigenous species (NIS) and the magnitude of shipping traffic make the Mediterranean Sea a hotspot of biological invasions. For the effective management of NIS, early detection and intensive monitoring over time and space are essential. Here, we present an overview of possible applications of citizen science and remote sensing in monitoring alien seaweeds in the Mediterranean Sea. Citizen science activities, involving the public (e.g., tourists, fishermen, divers) in the collection of data, have great potential for monitoring NIS. The innovative methodologies, based on remote sensing techniques coupled with in situ/laboratory advanced sampling/analysis methods for tracking such species, may be useful and effective tools for easily assessing NIS distribution patterns and monitoring the space/time changes in habitats in order to support the sustainable management of the ecosystems. The reported case studies highlight how these cost-effective systems can be useful complementary tools for monitoring NIS, especially in marine protected areas, which, despite their fundamental role in the conservation of marine biodiversity, are not immune to the introduction of NIS. To ensure effective and long-lasting management strategies, collaborations between researchers, policy makers and citizens are essential.

TI  - Advantages of preoperative localization and surgical resection of metastatic axillary lymph nodes using magnetic seeds after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer
T2  - SURGICAL ONCOLOGY-OXFORD
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: To assess the safety and effectiveness of magnetic seeds in preoperative localization and surgical dissection of metastatic axillary lymph nodes (LN+) in breast cancer patients with axillary involvement, after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). In addition, to assess the impact of targeted axillary dissection (TAD) in reducing the rate of false negatives (FN) in sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB).Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional prospective cohort study was conducted from April 2017 to September 2019, including breast cancer patients with axillary lymph node involvement treated with NAC. Prior to NAC, the LN+ were marked by ultrasound-guided clip insertion. After NAC, a magnetic seed (Magseed (R)) was inserted in the clip-marked lymph node (MLN). During surgery, the MLN was located and removed with the aid of a magnetic detection probe (Sentimag (R)) and the sentinel lymph node was removed. Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) was used to determine the rate of FN for SLNB alone and the combination of SLNB and MLN dissection, called TAD.Results: The study included 29 patients (mean age, 55; range, 30-78 years). Selective preoperative localization and surgical dissection were successful for all 30 MLNs (100%). The MLN corresponded to the SLN in 50% of cases. After ALND, there were 21.4% (3/14) FN with SLNB alone and 5.9% (1/17) with TAD.Conclusions: Following NAC, selective surgical removal of MLN by preoperative localization using magnetic seeds is a safe and effective procedure with a success rate of 100%. Adding TAD reduces the rate of FN associated with SLNB alone.

AB  - IntroductionTo evaluate oncological and obstetrical outcomes of early stage cervical cancer patients who underwent conservative management to retain childbearing potential.MethodsData of women (aged <40 years) who underwent fertility sparing treatment for International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IA1 with lymphovascular invasion (LVSI) and IB1 cervical cancer were prospectively collected. All patients underwent cervical conization/s and laparoscopic nodal evaluation (pelvic lymphadenectomy/sentinel node mapping). Oncological and obstetrical outcomes were assessed.ResultsOverall, 39 patients met inclusion criteria; 36 (92.3%) women were nulliparous. There were: 3 (7.7%) IA1-LVSI+; 11 (28.2%) IA2; and 25 (64.1%) IB1 cervical cancers, according to 2018 FIGO stage classification. Histological types were 22 (56.4%) squamous carcinoma and 17 (43.6%) adenocarcinoma. Pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed in 29 (74.4%) patients, while 10 (25.6%) patients had only sentinel node mapping. In 4 (10.3%) patients conservative treatment was discontinued due to nodal involvement and 2 (5.1%) patients requested definitive treatment (hysterectomy) after a negative lymph node evaluation. Among 33 (84.6%) patients who retained their childbearing potential, 17 (51.5%) had a second conization. 2 (6.1%) patients relapsed and underwent definitive treatment. After a median follow-up of 51 months (range 1-184) no deaths were reported. 22 (70.9%) patients attempted to conceive. There were 13 natural pregnancies among 12 (54.5%) women who got pregnant. Live birth rate was 76.9%: 9 (69.2%) term and 1 (7.7%) preterm (at 32 weeks) deliveries. 2 (15.4%) miscarriages (first and second trimester) and 1 (7.7%) termination of pregnancy for medical reasons were recorded.ConclusionConization plus laparoscopic nodal evaluation may be a safe and feasible conservative option in the setting of fertility-sparing treatment for early-stage cervical cancer patients.

TI  - Groundwater Depletion Signals in the Beqaa Plain, Lebanon: Evidence from GRACE and Sentinel-1 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Regions with high productivity of agriculture, such as the Beqaa Plain, Lebanon, often rely on groundwater supplies for irrigation demand. Recent reports have indicated that groundwater consumption in this region has been unsustainable, and quantifying rates of groundwater depletion has remained a challenge. Here, we utilize 15 years of data (June 2002-April 2017) from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission to show Total Water Storage (TWS) changes in Lebanon's Beqaa Plain. We then obtain complimentary information on various hydrologic cycle variables, such as soil moisture storage, snow water equivalent, and canopy water storage from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) model, and surface water data from the largest body of water in this region, the Qaraaoun Reservoir, to disentangle the TWS signal and calculate groundwater storage changes. After combining the information from the remaining hydrologic cycle variables, we determine that the majority of the losses in TWS are due to groundwater depletion in the Beqaa Plain. Results show that the rate of groundwater storage change in the West Beqaa is nearly +0.08 cm/year, in the Rashaya District is -0.01 cm/year, and in the Zahle District the level of depletion is roughly -1.10 cm/year. Results are confirmed using Sentinel-1 interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data, which provide high-precision measurements of land subsidence changes caused by intense groundwater usage. Furthermore, data from local monitoring wells are utilized to further showcase the significant drop in groundwater level that is occurring through much of the region. For monitoring groundwater storage changes, our recommendation is to combine various data sources, and in areas where groundwater measurements are lacking, we especially recommend the use of data from remote sensing.

TI  - Analysis of the Spatio-Temporal Evolution of Dredging from Satellite Images: A Case Study in the Principality of Asturias (Spain)
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the fundamental tasks in the maintenance of port operations is periodic dredging. These dredging operations facilitate the elimination of sediments that the coastal dynamics introduce. Dredging operations are increasingly restrictive and costly due to environmental requirements. Understanding the condition of the seabed before and after dredging is essential. In addition, determining how the seabed has behaved in recent years is important to consider when planning future dredging operations. In order to analyze the behavior of sediment transport and the changes to the seabed due to sedimentation, studies of littoral dynamics are conducted to model the deposition of sediments. Another methodology that could be used to analyze the real behavior of sediments would be to study and compare port bathymetries collected periodically. The problem with this methodology is that it requires numerous bathymetric surveys to produce a sufficiently significant analysis. This study provides an effective solution for obtaining a dense time series of bathymetry mapping using satellite data, and enables the past behavior of the seabed to be examined. The methodology proposed in this work uses Sentinel-2A (10 m resolution) satellite images to obtain historical bathymetric series by the development of a random forest algorithm. From these historical bathymetric series, it is possible to determine how the seabed has behaved and how the entry of sediments into the study area occurs. This methodology is applied in the Port of Luarca (Principality of Asturias), obtaining satellite images and extracting successive bathymetry mapping utilizing the random forest algorithm. This work reveals how once the dock was dredged, the sediments were redeposited and the seabed recovered its level prior to dredging in less than 2 months.

TI  - Evaluation of diagnostic accuracy of developed rapid SARS-COV-2 IgG antibody test kit using novel diluent system
T2  - VirusDisease
M3  - Article
AB  - Immunochromatographic assay kits are used in primary diagnostics which is based on the principle of antigen and antibody interaction. These kits play pivotal role in rapid surveillance of infectious diseases at early stages as well as for the surveillance of the contagious diseases. The immunochromatographic test kits lacks sensitivity and specificity with certain diseases. In this study, our intention was to develop a rapid test kit for SARS-COV-2 with a novel diluent system to enhance the efficacy of antigen-antibody binding and thereby the improvement in the sensitivity outlined. Finally, IgG antibodies against SARS-COV-2 virus peptides were analyzed using 25 positive and 25 negative confirmed clinical samples. The sensitivity of the clinical studies showed 91% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Therefore, the authors propose that this assay will be a potential tool for efficient community or sentinel surveillance of SARS-COV-2 infection and additionally, for effective monitoring of convalescent sera therapy.

TI  - Being Interconnected at the Time of COVID-19 Pandemic: A Call to Regain the Sense of Community
T2  - JOURNAL OF FUTURES STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article focuses on the relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and world's interconnectedness, in the belief that the present situation, although temporary, could shed light on some key structural issues of our contemporary societies. Here the network image is used, metaphorically, for both describing the dynamics of the contagion and highlighting the risks and opportunities of being highly interconnected. It is then discussed how the magnitude of the crisis requires to understand its deeper reasons, as what is really at stake is the type of world we want to live in. In this respect, the Causal Layered Analysis (CLA) is used for showing how the analysis and representation of the pandemic vary according to different schemes and worldviews. It is suggested that living more safely in a highly interconnected context requires a heightened sense of belonging, i.e. regaining the sense of community, as encapsulated for example in the African proverb "I am because we are". Getting this sense of community would provide an alternative way forward with multiple cascading effects, and yet it is not something that can be easily achieved, unless a turn in worldview is involved.

TI  - On optimizing a MODIS-based framework for in-season corn yield forecast
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate forecast of corn yields is important for decision making regarding food and energy management strategies. In this work, we developed an unprecedented optimized framework for the MODIS-based mid-season corn yield forecasting over five producing states of the United States: Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska, and Ohio. We evaluated Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI)-based forecasts under different schemes accounting for: different machine learning techniques with a mid-season composite or multi-temporal composites as inputs, four (county-, district-, state-, and global-based) training domains, and 16-day composites versus daily interpolated composites involving the day of pixels as predictors. Under the best identified scheme, we compared the EVI-based forecasts with those based on Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Leaf area Index (LAI) and Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetic Active Radiation (FPAR). EVI and NDVI were transformed to LAI (named as LAIEVI and LAINDVI) as predictors for producing EVI- and NDVI-based forecasts. We evaluated both county- and state-level forecasts using the percent error (PE), mean absolute PE (MAPE) and determination coefficient (R-2). The linear regression models driven by the single latest composite in mid-season often outperformed elastic net and random forest models driven by multi-temporal composites. The forecast performance decreased with longer subsets of EVI composites being used. The performance under the different training domains varied by states and forecast level (county or state), although the changes within states were mostly non-significant except in Nebraska. The forecasts based on 16-day and daily composites performed similarly, indicating that the use of information about the day of pixel composite provides no additional benefit to the yield forecast. For the best EVI-based schemes, the medium annual MAPE (PE) at the county (state) level varied between 6.1% (2.4%) and 7.7% (5.3%) across states while the medium annual R-2 (interannual R-2) varied between 0.54 (0.59) and 0.82 (0.86). Results suggested that, while EVI was, in general, the best predictor for the Corn Belt as a whole, the adequacy of the EVI- and NDVI-based forecasts varied by states and largely exceeded that of the LAI- and FPAR-based forecasts. Compared with the EVI-based forecasts, the NDVI-based forecasts performed better in Iowa (MAPE's 0.9% and 1.43% lower at the county and state level), similar in Nebraska and worse in the other states. Overall, the best state-level forecasts consistently outperformed concurrent National Agricultural Statistical Service (NASS) forecasts.

TI  - Responses of plant phenology to urban heat island effects in Beijing
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid development of cities increases urban heat island (UHI) effect. Urban greening can alleviate the heat island effect, but plant phenology could be affected by the heat island effect. Using remote sensing images, we compared the plant phenology between UHI areas and non-UHI areas as well as the different levels of UHI intensity in Beijing. Landsat-8 images 14 Beijing were used to invert the land surface temperature (LST). Spatial analysis methods were used to identify UHI zones and the UHI intensity classification. With data of normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) of MOD13A1 , three phenological parameters (start of growth season (SOG) , end of growth season (EOG), and length of growth season (LOG)) were extracted by the Dallimer mean value method and dynamic threshold method. The three parameters were used to examine the differences in plant phenology between the UHI areas and the non-UHI areas and between different UHI intensity levels. The UHI effect of Beijing in summer was more obvious than that in winter. The SOG in the UHI areas extracted by Dallimer mean value method was four days earlier, the EOG was nine days later, and the LOG was 13 days longer than that in non-UHI areas. The SOG in UHI areas extracted by dynamic threshold method was 10 days earlier, the EOG was four days later, and the LOG was 14 days longer than that in non-UHI areas. Compared with the Dallimer mean value method, the phenology calculated by the dynamic threshold method was closer to the observation data. Under higher UHI intensity, the SOG would be earlier, the EOG would be later, and the LOG would be longer. This study enriches the response mechanism of plant phenology to the UHI effect in North China, which helps us to understand the effects of global warming on ecosystems.

TI  - A Large-Scale Benchmark Data Set for Evaluating Pansharpening Performance: Overview and Implementation
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING MAGAZINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Pansharpening aims to sharpen a lowspatial-resolution (LR) multispectral (MS) image using a high-spatial-resolution (HR) panchromatic (Pan) image to obtain the HR MS image. It has been a fundamental and active research topic in remote sensing, and pansharpening methods have been developed for nearly 40 years. While the performance evaluation of pansharpening methods is still based on a small number of individual images, datadriven pansharpening approaches are attracting increasing attention. However, few publicly available benchmark data sets for pansharpening are available, especially large-scale ones. This has been a serious limitation for the future development of pansharpening methods.

TI  - Quantitative assessment of the importance of bio-physical drivers of land cover change based on a random forest method
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial distribution patterns of land cover greatly influence the ecological balance of the Loess Plateau. Understanding the bio-physical drivers of land cover change is important for ecological restoration in the context of climate change. However, in the analysis of the drivers of land cover change in the Loess Plateau, the role of bio-physical drivers has not been quantitatively evaluated. Using remote sensing data, machine learning, and statistical methods, this study analyzed the spatial and temporal patterns of land cover from 2001 to 2018 in the Loess Plateau of China. We used a random forest (RF) model to quantify the importance of bio-physical drivers of land cover. Our results demonstrated that the RF model has good performance and high reliability (model ac-curacy score 0.8). Our simulation experiment revealed that evapotranspiration was the most important driver (importance score, IS >0.2), temperature and precipitation had regional heterogeneity, and slope was the least important (IS <0.05). We suggest that evapotranspiration can be regulated by properly allocating the type of land cover, so as to rationally allocate water resources on the Loess Plateau. This study provides a new foun-dation for quantitatively evaluating the drivers of land cover change and regulating the distribution of water resources on the Loess Plateau, China.

TI  - AN AUTOMATED SEGMENTATION OF NATURA 2000 HABITATS FROM SENTINEL-2 OPTICAL DATA
T2  - DISCRETE AND CONTINUOUS DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS-SERIES S
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we present a mathematical model and numerical method designed for the segmentation of satellite images, namely to obtain in an automated way borders of Natura 2000 habitats from Sentinel-2 optical data. The segmentation model is based on the evolving closed plane curve approach in the Lagrangian formulation including the efficient treatment of topological changes. The model contains the term expanding the curve in its outer normal direction up to the region of habitat boundary edges, the term attracting the curve accurately to the edges and the smoothing term given by the influence of local curvature. For the numerical solution, we use the flowing finite volume method discretizing the arising advection-diffusion intrinsic partial differential equation including the asymptotically uniform tangential redistribution of curve grid points. We present segmentation results for satellite data from a selected area of Western Slovakia (Zahorie) where the so-called riparian forests represent the important European Natura 2000 habitat. The automatic segmentation results are compared with the semi-automatic segmentation performed by the botany expert and with the GPS tracks obtained in the field. The comparisons show the ability of our numerical model to segment the habitat areas with the accuracy comparable to the pixel resolution of the Sentinel-2 optical data.

TI  - SEMI-AUTOMATIC SEGMENTATION OF NATURA 2000 HABITATS IN SENTINEL-2 SATELLITE IMAGES BY EVOLVING OPEN CURVES
T2  - DISCRETE AND CONTINUOUS DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS-SERIES S
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper we introduce mathematical model and real-time numerical method for segmentation of Natura 2000 habitats in satellite images by evolving open planar curves. These curves in the Lagrangian formulation are driven by a suitable velocity vector field, projected to the curve normal. Besides the vector field, the evolving curve is influenced also by the local curvature representing a smoothing term. The model is numerically solved using the flowing finite volume method discretizing the arising intrinsic partial differential equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The time discretization is chosen as an explicit due to the ability of real-time edge tracking. We present the results of semi-automatic segmentation of various areas across Slovakia, from the riparian forests to mountainous areas with scrub pine. The numerical results were compared to habitat boundaries tracked by GPS device in the field by using the mean and maximal Hausdorff distances as criterion.

TI  - A coupled impact of different management and soil moisture on yield of winter wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i> L.) in dry conditions at locality Mezofold, Hungary
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY AND HYDROMECHANICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Variable rate technology (VRT) in nutrient management has been developed in order to apply crop inputs according to the required amount of fertilizers. Meteorological conditions rarely differ within one field; however, differences in soil conditions responding to precipitation or evaporation results within field variations. These variations in soil properties such as moisture content, evapotranspiration ability, etc. requires site-specific treatments for the produced crops. There is an ongoing debate among experts on how to define management zones as well as how to define the required amount of fertilizers for phosphorus and nitrogen replenishment for winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production. For management zone delineation, vegetation based or soil based data collection is applied, where various sensor technology or remote sensing is in help for the farmers. The objective of the study reported in this paper was to investigate the effect of soil moisture data derived from Sentinel-2 satellite images moisture index and variable rate phosphorus and nitrogen fertilizer by means of variable rate application (VRA) in winter wheat in Mezofold, Hungary. Satellite based moisture index variance at the time of sowing has been derived, calculated and later used for data comparison. Data for selected points showed strong correlation (R-2 = 0.8056; n = 6) between moisture index and yield, however generally for the whole field correlation does not appear. Vegetation monitoring has been carried out by means of NDVI data calculation. On the field level, as indicated earlier neither moisture index values at sowing nor vegetation index data was sufficient to determine yield. Winter wheat production based on VRA treatment resulted significant increase in harvested crop: 5.07 t/h in 2013 compared to 8.9 t/ha in 2018. Uniformly managed (control) areas provided similar yield as VRA treated areas (8.82 and 8.9 t/ha, respectively); however, the input fertilizer was reduced by 108 kg/ha N and increased by 37 kg/ha P.

TI  - The Dual Role of High Endothelial Venules in Cancer Progression versus Immunity
T2  - TRENDS IN CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs) are important initiators and regulators of immunity. To carry out this function, the blood vasculature must deliver oxygen and nutrients and recruit circulating lymphocytes into the SLO parenchyma, where they encounter cognate antigen. High endothelial venules (HEVs) are specialised postcapillary venules that specifically serve this function and are found in all SLOs except spleen. It is becoming clear that alterations to HEV network density and/or morphology can result in immune activation or, as recently implicated, in providing an exit route for tumour cell dissemination and metastases. In this review, the structural plasticity of HEVs, the regulatory pathways underpinning this plasticity, and the relevance of these pathways to cancer progression will be discussed.

TI  - Moving Borders: Mapping and Monitoring Amu Darya River Dynamics Using Remote Sensing Data and Techniques
T2  - GEODETSKI LIST
M3  - Review
AB  - Assessment of water-related disaster risk is essential for risk mitigation and management for sustainable development. This problem arises with transboundary waters, adding geopolitical problems to the existing ones. For moving borders, such as the border between Afghanistan and Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, mapping and monitoring of the river dynamics is essential for resolving potential problems that may occur due to shifts in the river bank. In order to achieve the objectives of this study, mapping and analyzing land conversion, river channel dynamics, quantify lateral erosion and accretion in the period between 1990 - 2020, four Landsat images were used. The results of the investigation showed significant shift of the river bank, especially from north to south, causing damages over agricultural areas of the local people in Afghanistan. Also the results showed the total area of the river shift on both sides of the border. The most critical parts of the river were also detected, and it was concluded that some parts of the border moved up to 3 km inside Afghanistan. Such information can help both local and international administration in resolving problems due to unresolved water sharing policies, and can help in making geopolitical decisions beneficial for both parties.

A novel image-fusion strategy based on the fast local Laplacian filter is employed to generate a difference index using the complementary information extracted from the change vector analysis and absolute gradient difference of the bitemporal satellite images. The difference index is then segmented into changed and unchanged pixels using a fast level-set method. A novel local outlier method is then applied to the unchanged pixels of the bitemporal images to identify the initial RCSS, which are then scored by a novel unchanged purity index, and the histogram of the scores is used to produce the final RCSS. The RRN between the bitemporal images is achieved by adjusting the subject image to the reference image using orthogonal linear regression on the final RCSS. The proposed method is applied to seven different data sets comprised of bitemporal images acquired by various satellites, including Landsat TM/ETM+, Sentinel 2B, Worldview 2/3, and Aster. The experimental results show that the method outperforms the stateof-the-art RRN methods. It reduces the average root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the best baseline method (IR-MAD) by up to 32% considering all data sets.

TI  - Locating and Dating Land Cover Change Events in the Renosterveld, a Critically Endangered Shrubland Ecosystem
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover change is the leading cause of global biodiversity decline. New satellite platforms allow for monitoring of habitats in increasingly fine detail, but most applications have been limited to forested ecosystems. I demonstrate the potential for detailed mapping and accurate dating of land cover change events in a highly biodiverse, Critically Endangered, shrubland ecosystem-the Renosterveld of South Africa. Using supervised classification of Sentinel 2 data, and subsequent manual verification with very high resolution imagery, I locate all conversion of Renosterveld to non-natural land cover between 2016 and 2020. Land cover change events are further assigned dates using high temporal frequency data from Planet labs. A total area of 478.6 hectares of Renosterveld loss was observed over this period, accounting for 0.72% of the remaining natural vegetation in the region. In total, 50% of change events were dated to within two weeks of their actual occurrence, and 87% to within two months. The Renosterveld loss identified here is almost entirely attributable to conversion of natural vegetation to cropland through ploughing. Change often preceded the planting and harvesting seasons of rainfed annual grains. These results show the potential for new satellite platforms to accurately map land cover change in non-forest ecosystems, and detect change within days of its occurrence. There is potential to use this and similar datasets to automate the process of change detection and monitor change continuously.

TI  - Spatio-temporal Assessment of Landscape Ecological Risk and Associated Drivers: A Case Study of Delhi
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND URBANIZATION ASIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization is considered as the key driver for land use and land cover (LULC) changes across the globe and Delhi is no exception to this phenomenon. The population of Delhi has almost doubled from 8.4 million in 1991 to 16.3 million in 2011. Correspondingly, the built-up area has also increased from 336.82 to 598.22 km(2) during 1999-2018. This urban expansion has led to emergence of serious ecological risk and fragmentation of the landscape. In this context, it is imperative to analyse the level of risks induced by such urban expansion and its underlying associations with other factors. This article quantifies the LULC changes in Delhi during 1999-2018 using Landsat 5 (TM) and Landsat 8 (OLI) data. A spatio-temporal sprawl induced risk assessment index has been developed by combining landscape fragmentation score and land use land cover vulnerability score. The landscape fragmentation score was based on four landscape metrics, whereas the vulnerability score was computed from LULC data. The article also assesses the association between risk areas and economic activities, environmental and infrastructural amenities that are considered key drivers of urban expansion in Delhi. To estimate spatio-temporal variability between risk areas and key drivers, ordinary least square regression and geographical weighted regression (GWR) were used. The GWR results reveal that sprawl-induced ecological risk in Delhi is strongly associated with economic activity, infrastructural accessibility and environmental amenities. This spatial empirical assessment also shows that urban growth incentives or services such as roads, metro rail, schools and hospitals can also create pressure on the landscape if local authorities arbitrarily provide these services across space without considering the associated risks.

TI  - The use of biomimetic tools for water quality monitoring: passive samplers versus sentinel organisms
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - To evaluate the performance of artificial and biological integrative sampling strategies, dissolved concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs) and metals (Cu and Mn) were measured with passive sampler devices (PSD) enclosing hydrophobic and chelating phases, and Asiatic clams were transplanted to a polluted area in the Rio de la Plata. Water concentrations based on PSD were compared with spot water samples collected at 0, 15, 32, and 63 days of exposition. PCBs and metals displayed linear accumulation kinetics both in PSDs and bivalves, but with different slopes. PCBs slopes were 2-27 times higher in bivalves (0.3-7.9 vs. 0.1-2.6 ng g(-1) d(-1) in PSDs) reflecting active filtration and uptake from particles, colloids, and dissolved phase, whereas metal slopes were 2.5-11 times lower in bivalves (0.04-0.18 vs. 0.10-2.00 mu g g(-1) d(-1) in PSDs) suggesting metal bioregulation. Truly dissolved PCB concentrations from PSD (4.0-6.9 ng.l(-1)) represented average 13 +/- 4 % of PCB concentrations from filtered spot water samples reflecting the operational discrimination of the PSD diffusion membrane on competing dissolved and colloidal organic phases. In contrast, PSD dissolved Cu concentrations (2.3-8.2 mu g l(-1)) were equivalent to the spot water values (3.2-3.8 mu g l(-1)) suggesting that Cu speciation was adequately integrated by passive sampling. On the other hand, PSD-dissolved Mn concentrations (49 +/- 38 mu g l(-1)) were higher (p<0.05) than those from spot water samples (7 +/- 11 mu g l(-1)) possibly due to phase changes of Mn distribution related to variable redox conditions in the water. Results evidenced that the PSDs are efficient accumulators of metals and organic compounds from the truly dissolved fraction.

TI  - Tolerance in the Field of Education: Modern Challenges and New Paradigms
T2  - BEYTULHIKME-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the study of the problems of tolerance in modern education, analyzes the tolerant behavior of man in the context of understanding his worldview on the empirical, rational and philosophical levels. The main focus of the study is on the problems of coexistence of freedom of will and tolerance and philosophical and ethical principles of tolerance in modern education. The modern globalized world poses new challenges to humanity, caused by the latest technologies that have not only united people but also made the world more complex and unstable. Such a union has sometimes caused individuality to erode, we communicate only with people who have similar views to ours and we distance ourselves from those who have a different opinion. In this aspect, modern education faces one of the main tasks - to teach the younger generation to build a safe society without barriers, to be able to protect people from harmful information and learn to work with it, the ability to adapt to harsh living conditions, changes and professional structure. The novelty of this study is that the implementation of tolerance in the educational process will help to reveal the inner world of man, will change his thinking, turning into a rational and morally responsible person who not only does not lose his identity but also builds relationships with people "I-Other", which helps her to better understand the difference of each person.

TI  - Actual Evapotranspiration Estimates in Arid Cold Regions Using Machine Learning Algorithms with In Situ and Remote Sensing Data
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Actual evapotranspiration (ETa) estimations in arid regions are challenging because this process is highly dynamic over time and space. Nevertheless, several studies have shown good results when implementing empirical regression formulae that, despite their simplicity, are comparable in accuracy to more complex models. Although many types of regression formulae to estimate ETa exist, there is no consensus on what variables must be included in the analysis. In this research, we used machine learning algorithms-through implementation of empirical linear regression formulae-to find the main variables that control daily and monthly ETa in arid cold regions, where there is a lack of available ETa data. Meteorological data alone and then combined with remote sensing vegetation indices (VIs) were used as input in ETa estimations. In situ ETa and meteorological data were obtained from ten sites in Chile, Australia, and the United States. Our results indicate that the available energy is the main meteorological variable that controls ETa in the assessed sites, despite the fact that these regions are typically described as water-limited environments. The VI that better represents the in situ ETa is the Normalized Difference Water Index, which represents water availability in plants and soils. The best performance of the regression equations in the validation sites was obtained for monthly estimates with the incorporation of VIs (R-2 = 0.82), whereas the worst performance of these equations was obtained for monthly ETa estimates when only meteorological data were considered. Incorporation of remote-sensing information results in better ETa estimates compared to when only meteorological data are considered.

TI  - Present and Future High-Resolution Climate Forcings over Semiarid Catchments: Case of the Tensift (Morocco)
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - In semiarid areas, the climate is characterized by strong spatiotemporal variability while the meteorological ground network is often very sparse. In this context, the spatial distribution of meteorological variables is thus a real issue for watershed hydrology, agronomy and the study of surface-atmosphere retroaction in these regions. The aim of this study is twofold: (1) to evaluate and to adapt a reanalysis system "Systeme d'Analyse Fournissant des Renseignements Adaptes a la Nivologie" (SAFRAN) to map the meteorological variables on the Tensift catchment (Morocco) between 2004 and 2014; (2) to project temperature and precipitation for the 2041-2060 horizon at high-resolution based on the Euro-CORDEX database at 12 km resolution (using two Representative Concentration Pathway -RCPs- scenarios and four Regional Climate Models), on the SAFRAN reanalysis and on a network of meteorological stations. SAFRAN was assessed: (1) based on leave-one-out for a station located in the plain and another in the mountains; (2) by comparison to another re-analysis system named the Meteorological Distribution System for High-Resolution Terrestrial Modeling (MicroMet); (3) by comparison to in situ measurements of snowfall at one station and to the daily Snow Cover Area derived from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) product at the catchment scale. The evaluation of the SAFRAN reanalysis showed that an irregular grid up to 1 km resolution is better for reproducing meteorological variables than the regular version of SAFRAN at 8 km, especially in mountains. The projection of the SAFRAN forcing is conducted in three steps corresponding to the three subsections below: (1) disaggregation of the Euro-CORDEX climate scenarios using the Q-Q approach based on stations data; (2) computation of the spatialized delta-change between historical and future Euro-CORDEX runs after Q-Q correction; (3) futurization of SAFRAN using the spatialized delta change values. The mountainous area is expected to face a higher increase in air temperature than the plains, reaching +2.5 degrees C for RCP8.5 and +1.71 degrees C for RCP4.5 over 2041-2060. This warming will be accompanied by a marked decrease in precipitation (-16% for RCP8.5). These present and future spatialized data sets should be useful for impact studies, in particular those focusing on water resources.

TI  - Outlier Detection at the Parcel-Level in Wheat and Rapeseed Crops Using Multispectral and SAR Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper studies the detection of anomalous crop development at the parcel-level based on an unsupervised outlier detection technique. The experimental validation is conducted on rapeseed and wheat parcels located in Beauce (France). The proposed methodology consists of four sequential steps: (1) preprocessing of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and multispectral images acquired using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites, (2) extraction of SAR and multispectral pixel-level features, (3) computation of parcel-level features using zonal statistics and (4) outlier detection. The different types of anomalies that can affect the studied crops are analyzed and described. The different factors that can influence the outlier detection results are investigated with a particular attention devoted to the synergy between Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. Overall, the best performance is obtained when using jointly a selection of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 features with the isolation forest algorithm. The selected features are co-polarized (VV) and cross-polarized (VH) backscattering coefficients for Sentinel-1 and five Vegetation Indexes for Sentinel-2 (among us, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and two variants of the Normalized Difference Water). When using these features with an outlier ratio of 10%, the percentage of detected true positives (i.e., crop anomalies) is equal to 94.1% for rapeseed parcels and 95.5% for wheat parcels.

TI  - Improved Algorithms for Remote Sensing-Based Aerosol Retrieval during Extreme Biomass Burning Events
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposed an aerosol characterization process using satellites for severe biomass burning events. In general, these severely hazy cases are labeled as "undecided" or "hazy." Because atmospheric aerosols are significantly affected by factors such as air quality, global climate change, local environmental risk, and human and biological health, efficient and accurate algorithms for aerosol retrieval are required for global satellite data processing. Our previous classification of aerosol types was based primarily on near-ultraviolet (UV) data, which facilitated subsequent aerosol retrieval. In this study, algorithms for aerosol classification were expanded to events with serious biomass burning aerosols (SBBAs). Once a biomass burning event is identified, the appropriate radiation simulation method can be applied to characterize the SBBAs. The second-generation global imager (SGLI) on board the Japanese mission JAXA/Global Change Observation Mission-Climate contains 19 channels, including red (674 nm) and near-infrared (869 nm) polarization channels with a high resolution of 1 km. Using the large-scale wildfires in Kalimantan, Indonesia in 2019 as an example, the complementarity between the polarization information and the nonpolarized radiance measurements from the SGLI was demonstrated to be effective in radiation simulations for biomass burning aerosol retrieval. The retrieved results were verified using NASA/AERONET ground-based measurements, and then compared against JAXA/SGLI/L2-version-1 products, and JMA/Himawari-8/AHI observations.

TI  - Soil Moisture Estimation Synergy Using GNSS-R and L-Band Microwave Radiometry Data from FSSCat/FMPL-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Federated Satellite System mission (FSSCat) was the winner of the 2017 Copernicus Masters Competition and the first Copernicus third-party mission based on CubeSats. One of FSSCat's objectives is to provide coarse Soil Moisture (SM) estimations by means of passive microwave measurements collected by Flexible Microwave Payload-2 (FMPL-2). This payload is a novel CubeSat based instrument combining an L1/E1 Global Navigation Satellite Systems-Reflectometer (GNSS-R) and an L-band Microwave Radiometer (MWR) using software-defined radio. This work presents the first results over land of the first two months of operations after the commissioning phase, from 1 October to 4 December 2020. Four neural network algorithms are implemented and analyzed in terms of different sets of input features to yield maps of SM content over the Northern Hemisphere (latitudes above 45 degrees N). The first algorithm uses the surface skin temperature from the European Centre of Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) in conjunction with the 16 day averaged Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to estimate SM and to use it as a comparison dataset for evaluating the additional models. A second approach is implemented to retrieve SM, which complements the first model using FMPL-2 L-band MWR antenna temperature measurements, showing a better performance than in the first case. The error standard deviation of this model referred to the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) SM product gridded at 36 km is 0.074 m3/m3. The third algorithm proposes a new approach to retrieve SM using FMPL-2 GNSS-R data. The mean and standard deviation of the GNSS-R reflectivity are obtained by averaging consecutive observations based on a sliding window and are further included as additional input features to the network. The model output shows an accurate SM estimation compared to a 9 km SMOS SM product, with an error of 0.087 m3/m3. Finally, a fourth model combines MWR and GNSS-R data and outperforms the previous approaches, with an error of just 0.063 m3/m3. These results demonstrate the capabilities of FMPL-2 to provide SM estimates over land with a good agreement with respect to SMOS SM.

TI  - Cluster-Based Empirical Tropospheric Corrections Applied to InSAR Time Series Analysis
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) allows for mapping of crustal deformation on land with high spatial resolution and precision in areas with high signal-tonoise ratios. Efforts to obtain precise displacement time series globally, however, are severely limited by radar path delays within the troposphere. The tropospheric delay is integrated along the full path length between the ground and the satellite, resulting in correlations between the interferometric phase and elevation that can vary dramatically in both space and time. We evaluate the performance of spatially variable, empirical removal of phase-elevation dependence within SAR interferograms through the use of the K-means clustering algorithm. We apply this method to both synthetic test data, as well as to C-band Sentinel-1a/b time series acquired over a large area in south-central Mexico along the Pacific coast and inlandan area with a large elevation gradient that is of particular interest to researchers studying tectonic- and anthropogenicrelated deformation. We show that the clustering algorithm is able to identify cases where tropospheric properties vary across topographic divides, reducing total root mean square (rms) by an average of 50%, as opposed to a spatially constant phase-elevation correction, which has insignificant error reduction. Our approach also reduces tropospheric noise while preserving test signals in synthetic examples. Finally, we show the average standard deviation of the residuals from the best-fit linear rate decreases from approximately 3 to 1.5 cm, which corresponds to a change in the error on the best-fit linear rate from 0.94 to 0.63 cm/yr.

TI  - Land Use and Soil Organic Carbon Stocks-Change Detection over Time Using Digital Soil Assessment: A Case Study from Kamyaran Region, Iran (1988-2018)
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use change and soil organic carbon stock (SOCS) depletion over time is one of the predominant worldwide environmental problems related to global warming and the need to secure food production for an increasing world population. In our research, satellite images from 1988 and 2018 were analyzed for a 177.48 km(2) region in Kurdistan Province, Iran. Across the study area. 186 disturbed and undisturbed soil samples were collected at two depths (0-20 cm and 20-50 cm). Bulk density (BD), soil organic carbon (SOC), rock fragments (RockF) and SOCS were measured. Random forest was used to model the spatial variability of SOCS. Land use was mapped with supervised classification and maximum likelihood approaches. The Kappa index and overall accuracy of the supervised classification and maximum likelihood land use maps varied between 83% and 88% and 78% and 85%, respectively. The area of forest and high-quality rangeland covered 5286 ha in 1988 and decreased by almost 30% by 2018. Most of the decrease was due to the establishment of cropland and orchards, and due to overgrazing of high-quality rangeland. As expected, the results of the analysis of variance showed that mean values of SOCS for the high-quality rangeland and forest were significantly higher compared to other land use classes. Thus, transformation of land with natural vegetation like forest and high-quality rangeland led to a loss of 15,494 Mg C in the topsoil, 15,475 Mg C in the subsoil and 15,489 Mg C-1 in total. We concluded that the predominant causes of natural vegetation degradation in the study area were mostly due to the increasing need for food, anthropogenic activities such as cultivation and over grazing, lack of government landuse legislation and the results of this study are useful for land use monitoring, decision making, natural vegetation planning and other areas of research and development in Kurdistan province.

TI  - Assessing agricultural salt-affected land using digital soil mapping and hybridized random forests
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Salinization and alkalization are predominant environmental problem world-wide which their accurate assessment is essential for determining appropriate ways to deal with land degradation, for better soil and crop management. In the current research, a combination of random forests and covariate data were used to assess spatial variability of soil salinity and sodicity in 436 km(2) agricultural salt-affected land in Kurdistan Province, Iran. Using the conditioned Latin hypercube sampling method, 295 soil samples were sampled across the study area, and then soil reaction (pH), electrical conductivity (EC), and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) were measured. Covariate data including terrain attributes, remotely-sensed data, groundwater table, and categorical maps were acquired. Random forest (RF) models were used to predict the spatial distribution of pH, EC, and SAR by making a relationship between soil data and covariates. Furthermore, three optimization algorithms (particle swarm optimization-PSO, genetic algorithm-GA, and bat algorithm-BAT) were used to explore if the hybridized RF works better than the standard RF. Results of 10-fold cross-validation with 100 replications indicated that the accuracy of RF PSO was higher for predicting pH (RMSE = 0.52 and R-2 = 0.67), EC (RMSE = 2.32 dSm(-1) and R-2 = 0.57), and SAR (RMSE = 8.98 and R-2 = 0.54, respectively) in comparison to the other implemented models. Furthermore, the results disclosed that the most important covariates to predict pH, EC, and SAR were groundwater table, categorical maps, salinity index, and multi-resolution ridge top flatness. Besides, the results indicated that the mean values for pH, EC, and SAR in lowland and bare land were significantly different from the other physiographic units and land uses, respectively. Importantly, the classified map of salt-affected soils highlighted areas with a high risk of exceeding critical threshold values of pH, EC, and SAR, which is located in the center of the study area, and showed that 6.30%, 3.1%, and 4.6% of the study area are saline-sodic soil, saline soil, and sodic soil, respectively. These up to date spatial soil information on severity of soil salinity and sodicity is crucial for agricultural management of affected areas and the proposed method can be used to the other similar regions.

TI  - Traditional Knowledge and Uses of Wild Vertebrates in the Maya Community of Zavala, Municipality of Sotuta, Yucatan, Mexico
T2  - ESTUDIOS DE CULTURA MAYA
M3  - Article
AB  - The relationship between Mexican ethnic groups and wildlife is known by its use for nutritional and medicinal purposes. Particularly, in the Maya culture ornamental and ceremonial uses have been attributed to the fauna. Similarly, different beliefs, stories and legends have been developed around it. The studies conducted to document these relationships in the state of Yucatan are scarce; therefore this work was raised to determine the uses and beliefs of the wildlife in the Maya town of Zavala. 174 semi-structured interviews were conducted among men and women of different ages. The significant species were then divided into seven categories of use: food, medicine, pets, ornamental, ceremonial, mythical, and ominous. 54 species related with the worldview of the residents were identified, and divided into three classes, 20 orders, 38 families, and 54 genera. The birds were the most represented with 30 species, followed by Mammalia class with 19, and Reptilia with 5. Mammals were the group with the highest general use index. With this work, it was concluded that the inhabitants of Zavala preserve in their daily activities the ancestral uses and knowledge of the wildlife. Likewise, the information collected contributes to the knowledge of ethnozoology in Yucatan.

TI  - A Comparative Approach of Fuzzy Object Based Image Analysis and Machine Learning Techniques Which Are Applied to Crop Residue Cover Mapping by Using Sentinel-2 Satellite and UAV Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Conservation tillage methods through leaving the crop residue cover (CRC) on the soil surface protect it from water and wind erosions. Hence, the percentage of the CRC on the soil surface is very critical for the evaluation of tillage intensity. The objective of this study was to develop a new methodology based on the semiautomated fuzzy object based image analysis (fuzzy OBIA) and compare its efficiency with two machine learning algorithms which include: support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) for the evaluation of the previous CRC and tillage intensity. We also considered the spectral images from two remotely sensed platforms of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and Sentinel-2 satellite, respectively. The results indicated that fuzzy OBIA for multispectral Sentinel-2 image based on Gaussian membership function with overall accuracy and Cohen's kappa of 0.920 and 0.874, respectively, surpassed machine learning algorithms and represented the useful results for the classification of tillage intensity. The results also indicated that overall accuracy and Cohen's kappa for the classification of RGB images from the UAV using fuzzy OBIA method were 0.860 and 0.779, respectively. The semiautomated fuzzy OBIA clearly outperformed machine learning approaches in estimating the CRC and the classification of the tillage methods and also it has the potential to substitute or complement field techniques.

TI  - Semantics of the Traditions in the Kazakh Folk Culture Associated with a Baby Under the Age of One
T2  - MILLI FOLKLOR
M3  - Article
AB  - Each person, from the moment of birth to the end of his life, performs a number of customs and rituals that carry invaluable meaning. Tradition is the generally accepted rules of behavior that accumulate over the centuries in accordance with the religion and beliefs, lifestyle and national identity of each nation, created by living conditions, patterns of behavior that form in society, separating one cultural group from another in everyday life and regulating social actions. Every society has its own form of life, traditions, customs and believes. Traditions, customs, prohibitions, taboos and rituals occupy a special place in the Kazakhs' process of educating the younger generation. If we look at the traditions and customs of the Kazakh people, we will see that there are many traditions, customs, prohibitions and rituals associated with the birth of a child. Some rituals begin even before the birth of a baby. This article discusses in detail the traditions performed from the birth of a child to the turn of the age one, and also emphasizes the features and importance of these traditions. In the heritage of Kazakhs connected with raising children, there are many traditions about the family. The traditions of raising a child include educational traditions that have existed since the birth of the child. These are the rules for preparing girls and boys for family formation, survival and work in the future. Traditions shape a person's behavior from birth to death, his worldview and relationships with others. From folk wisdom, "Alti zhil ash bolsan da atannin saltin umitpa" (even if you are hungry for 6 years, still do not forget the tradition), we see that tradition is a social phenomenon based on beliefs and everyday life of people and handed down from generation to generation. It is formed with upbringing given by parents. In this article, the basics of the Kazakh traditions connected with the newborn child are discussed such as kursak shashu, jeriktik oris, kindik sheshe, jariskazan, shildehana, itkoylek, kalja, besik toi, kyrkynan shigaru, bauirinan tabak alu and tusaukeser. Kursak shashu or kursak toy is the ancient ritual dedicated to pregnant woman. The purpose of the kursak shashu ritual, performed by a mother-in-law, who found out that her bride was pregnant, is to share her joy with others and draw attention to the fact that after this day, the expectant mother needs special care. The ritual performed at the time when it started the pain of childbirth, called jariskazan. This ritual is performed with the intention that the bride will give birth unharmed for a short period of time until the cauldron boils and the food is ready. The rituals such as the lifting newborn baby off the ground and asking for good news takes places after the birth of a child. The child's umbilical cord is cut off by a large and respected woman called kindik sheshe. After this she cuts baby's hair while people say wishes like bawi berik bolsin. After a certain time following birth, there is a celebration called shildehana. In order to regain former strength the mother of a child has to eat kalja. In 40 days after the rituals such as balani avizdandiruv, giving name to a child, besik toy there is a ritual called kirk cikarma. After six or seven months, the bawirinan tabak aluw ritual is performed when the baby is eager to crawl, and the tusawkeser ritual is performed when he learns to stand and starts to step.The entire article covers all these rituals in detail, as well as explains the semantic meaning of rituals performed in Kazakh folk culture associated with a baby under the age of one.

TI  - Integration of an InSAR and ANN for Sinkhole Susceptibility Mapping: A Case Study from Kirikkale-Delice (Turkey)
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Suitable route determination for linear engineering structures is a fundamental problem in engineering geology. Rapid evaluation of alternative routes is essential, and novel approaches are indispensable. This study aims to integrate various InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) techniques for sinkhole susceptibility mapping in the Kirikkale-Delice Region of Turkey, in which sinkhole formations have been observed in evaporitic units and a high-speed train railway route has been planned. Nine months (2019-2020) of ground deformations were determined using data from the European Space Agency's (ESA) Sentinel-1A/1B satellites. A sinkhole inventory was prepared manually using satellite optical imagery and employed in an ANN (Artificial Neural Network) model with topographic conditioning factors derived from InSAR digital elevation models (DEMs) and morphological lineaments. The results indicate that high deformation areas on the vertical displacement map and sinkhole-prone areas on the sinkhole susceptibility map (SSM) almost coincide. InSAR techniques are useful for long-term deformation monitoring and can be successfully associated in sinkhole susceptibility mapping using an ANN. Continuous monitoring is recommended for existing sinkholes and highly susceptible areas, and SSMs should be updated with new results. Up-to-date SSMs are crucial for the route selection, planning, and construction of important transportation elements, as well as settlement site selection, in such regions.

TI  - Christ as Yogi: The Jesus of Vivekananda and Modern Hinduism
T2  - CHURCH HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - Swami Vivekananda was the most influential pioneer of a Yogi Christ, illustrating well over a century ago how the life and teachings of Jesus might be incorporated within a larger Hindu worldview-and then presented back to Western audiences. Appropriation of Jesus, one of the central symbols of the West, might be viewed as the ultimate act of counter-Orientalism. This article begins by providing a brief biography of Vivekananda and the modern Hinduism that nurtured him and that he propagated. He articulated an inclusivist vision of Advaita Vedanta as the most compelling vision of universal religion. Next, the article turns to Vivekananda's views of Christianity, for which he had little affection, and the Bible, which he knew extraordinarily well. The article then systematically explores Vivekananda's engagement with the New Testament, revealing a clear hermeneutical preference for the Gospels, particularly John. Following the lead of biblical scholars, Vivekananda made a distinction between the Christ of the Gospels and the Jesus of history, offering sometimes contradictory conclusions about the historicity of elements associated with Jesus's life. Finally, the article provides a detailed articulation of Vivekananda's Jesus-a figure at once familiar to Christians but, in significant ways, uniquely accommodated to Hindu metaphysics. Vivekananda demonstrated a robust understanding and discriminating use of the Christian Bible that has not been properly recognized. He deployed this knowledge to launch an important and long-lived pattern: an attractive, fleshed out depiction of Jesus of Nazareth, transformed from the Christian savior into a Yogi model of self-realization. Through his efforts, Jesus became an indisputably Indian religious figure, no longer just a Christian one. The Yogi Christ remains a prominent global religious figure familiar to Hindus, Christians, and those of other faiths alike.

TI  - A conjugate application of MODIS/Terra data and empirical method to assess reference evapotranspiration for the southwest region of Bangladesh
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Availability of water resources, especially irrigation water in the Southwest (SW) region of Bangladesh, is in threat due to climate change impacts, reduction of upstream flow, and excessive groundwater consumption. It is essential to assess the evapotranspiration (ET), especially reference evapotranspiration (ET0) to ensure efficient irrigation demand for this region. However, direct measurement of ET0 is a difficult task as empirical equation-based assessment requires a complex set of input data. As remote sensing (RS) technology has evolved as a viable alternative to the ground-based estimation of ET0, this study investigated whether it is possible to attain a reliable assessment of ET0 for the SW region of Bangladesh using satellite data. Land surface temperature (LST) data retrieved from the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite have been evaluated as an alternative of air temperature in three empirical ET0 assessment methods, namely the Hargreaves-Samani (HS), Thornthwaite (TH), and Blaney-Criddle (BC) methods. ET0 assessed from these methods have been calibrated and validated against the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith (PM) method. Several statistical indices, viz. root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean relative error (MRE), and coefficient of determination (R2) have been used to evaluate the performance of ET0 assessment from the above-mentioned methods. MODIS-LST data have been found strongly correlated with air temperature (R2 = 0.95). A good correlation in ET0 assessment has been found between the PM method and HS (R2 = 0.85), TH (R2 = 0.81), and BC (R2 = 0.79) methods. With the calibrated result, the calibrated HS method provides the most accurate results compared to the other methods, with an average RMSE of 0.44 mm/day, MAE of 0.39 mm/day, and MRE of 12.34%. Considering the consistency of the findings with the previous studies, this method has been recommended for assessing ET0 under conditions of limited data availability.

TI  - Trends in use of remotely sensed data in wetlands assessment and monitoring in Zimbabwe
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The paper assesses trends in use of earth observation data in wetland conditions monitoring and assessment in Zimbabwe from 1980 to 2019. Reviewed literature shows academia and research institutions (69.8%), government agencies (14%) and international development partners (16.3%) as the main users of remotely sensed data in wetland ecological assessments and monitoring. There is more reliance by the abovementioned stakeholders on freely available low-cost resolution imagery from Landsat (62.9%) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (14.3%). Other stakeholders, however, are reliant on high-resolution imagery like Rapid Eye (5.7%) and aerial photography (11.4%). Satellite images in wetland management in Zimbabwe are used for land use land cover change detection (42.1%), vegetation health monitoring (21.1%), water quantity monitoring (5.3%), water quality monitoring (13.2%) and wetland mapping (18.4%). The identified challenges faced by different stakeholders to effectively utilise EO data include high cost of high-resolution imageries, limited expertise, inadequate equipment and software. Since the cost of high-resolution satellite imagery mainly constraints the acquisition of suitable satellite data to assess the small wetlands that dominate Zimbabwe's landscape, there is need to promote use of recently launched freely available high-resolution Sentinel data to improve the ecological assessment of wetland conditions.

TI  - Cervical conization and lymph node assessment for early stage low-risk cervical cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveThere has been a contemporary shift in clinical practice towards tailoring treatment in patients with early cervical cancer and low-risk features to non-radical surgery. The objective of this study was to evaluate the oncologic, fertility, and obstetric outcomes after cervical conization and sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in patients with early stage low-risk cervical cancer.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective review in patients with early cervical cancer treated with cervical conization and lymph node assessment between November 2008 and February 2020. Eligibility criteria included patients with a histologic diagnosis of invasive squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma or adenosquamous carcinoma, International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics 2009 stage IA1 with positive lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI), stage IA2, or stage IB1 (<= 2 cm) with less than two-thirds (<10 mm) cervical stromal invasion.ResultsA total of 44 patients were included in the analysis. The median age was 31 years (range 19-61) and 20 patients (45%) were nulliparous. One patient had a 25 mm tumor while the remaining patients had tumors smaller than 20 mm. Eighteen (41%) patients had LVSI. Median follow-up was 44 months (range 6-137). A total of 17 (39%) patients had negative margins on the diagnostic excisional procedure, and none had residual disease on the repeat cone biopsy. Three (6.8%) patients had micrometastases detected in the SLNs and underwent ipsilateral lymphadenectomy; all remaining non-SLN lymph nodes were negative. Six (13.6%) patients required more definitive surgical or adjuvant treatment due to high-risk pathologic features. There were no recurrences documented. Three patients developed cervical stenosis. The live birth rate was 85% and 16 (94%) of 17 patients had live births at term.ConclusionCervical conization with SLN biopsy appears to be a safe treatment option in selected patients with early cervical cancer. Future results of prospective trials may shed definitive light on fertility-sparing options in this group of patients.

TI  - Building Damage Detection Based on OPCE Matching Algorithm Using a Single Post-Event PolSAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an effective tool in detecting building damage. At present, more and more studies detect building damage using a single post-event fully polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) image, because it permits faster and more convenient damage detection work. However, the existence of non-buildings and obliquely-oriented buildings in disaster areas presents a challenge for obtaining accurate detection results using only post-event PolSAR data. To solve these problems, a new method is proposed in this work to detect completely collapsed buildings using a single post-event full polarization SAR image. The proposed method makes two improvements to building damage detection. First, it provides a more effective solution for non-building area removal in post-event PolSAR images. By selecting and combining three competitive polarization features, the proposed solution can remove most non-building areas effectively, including mountain vegetation and farmland areas, which are easily confused with collapsed buildings. Second, it significantly improves the classification performance of collapsed and standing buildings. A new polarization feature was created specifically for the classification of obliquely-oriented and collapsed buildings via development of the optimization of polarimetric contrast enhancement (OPCE) matching algorithm. Using this developed feature combined with texture features, the proposed method effectively distinguished collapsed and obliquely-oriented buildings, while simultaneously also identifying the affected collapsed buildings in error-prone areas. Experiments were implemented on three PolSAR datasets obtained in fully polarimetric mode: Radarsat-2 PolSAR data from the 2010 Yushu earthquake in China (resolution: 12 m, scale of the study area: 50 km2); ALOS PALSAR PolSAR data from the 2011 Tohoku tsunami in Japan (resolution: 23.14 m, scale of the study area: 113 km2); and ALOS-2 PolSAR data from the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake in Japan (resolution: 5.1 m, scale of the study area: 5 km2). Through the experiments, the proposed method was proven to obtain more than 90% accuracy for built-up area extraction in post-event PolSAR data. The achieved detection accuracies of building damage were 82.3%, 97.4%, and 78.5% in Yushu, Ishinomaki, and Mashiki town study sites, respectively.

TI  - Carboxylesterase activities as potential biomarkers of pollution in marine pelagic predators
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessment of chemical exposures in the marine environment is frequently undertaken in sedentary organisms inhabiting coastal environments. However, predatory pelagic fish should be considered sentinel species, as they play an important role in the sustainability of the ecosystems due to their high position in trophic webs. In this study, carboxylesterase (CE) activities were analysed in four predatory tuna species of commercial interest along the western Mediterranean Sea: little tunny (Euthynnus alletteratus), Atlantic bonito (Sarda sarda), bullet tuna (Auxis rochei) and albacore tuna (Thunnus alalunga). CEs are potential biomarkers of chemical exposure, as they are an important family of enzymes involved in the metabolism of xenobiotic and endogenous compounds. CE measures were taken from the liver of these tuna species using five commercial substrates: 4-nitrophenyl acetate (4NPA), 4-nitrophenyl butyrate (4NPB), 1-naphthyl acetate (1NA), 1-naphthyl butyrate (1NB), and 2-naphthyl acetate (2NA). Butyrate substrates (1NB and 4NPB) yielded the highest hydrolysis rates, and were thus the best substrates for these measures. CE activities differed between species. The larger differences were attained with 1NB-CE, with higher activities seen in bullet tuna, followed by little tunny, Atlantic bonito and albacore tuna. Individual size was identified as one of the main factors modulating CE activities, while there was no evidence for a role for trophic level (measured as delta 15N). Using little tunny as sentinel, no geographical differences but inter-annual variation in CE activity was observed. The kinetic parameters and in vitro exposure to the pesticide dichlorvos provided complementary information on the sensitivity of tuna CEs to this model pesticide. Our results propose that the little tunny could be considered a potential bioindicator species in the pelagic realm.

TI  - Digital Soil Mapping Using Multispectral Modeling with Landsat Time Series Cloud Computing Based
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Geotechnologies allow natural resources to be surveyed more quickly and cheaply than traditional methods. This paper aimed to produce a digital soil map (DSM) based on Landsat time series data. The study area, located in the eastern part of the Brazilian Federal District (Rio Preto hydrographic basin), comprises a representative basin of the Central Brazil plateau in terms of pedodiversity. A spectral library was produced based on the soil spectroscopy (from the visible to shortwave infrared spectral range) of 42 soil samples from 0-15 cm depth using the Fieldspec Pro equipment in a laboratory. Pearson's correlation and principal component analysis of the soil attributes revealed that the dataset could be grouped based on the texture content. Hierarchical clustering analysis allowed for the extraction of 13 reference spectra. We interpreted the spectra morphologically and resampled them to the Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper satellite bands. Afterward, we elaborated a synthetic soil/rock image (SySI) and a soil frequency image (number of times the bare soil was captured) from the Landsat time series (1984-2020) in the Google Earth Engine platform. Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) was used to model the SySI, using the endmembers as the input and generating a DSM, which was validated by the Kappa index and the confusion matrix. MESMA successfully modeled 9 of the 13 endmembers: Dystric Rhodic Ferralsol (clayic); Dystric Rhodic Ferralsol (very clayic); Dystric Haplic Ferralsol (loam-clayic); Dystric Haplic Ferralsol (clayic); Dystric Petric Plinthosol (clayic); Dystric Petric Plinthosol (very clayic); Dystric Regosol (clayic); Dystric Regosol (very clayic); and Dystric, Haplic Cambisol (clayic). The root mean squared error (RMSE) varied from 0 to 1.3%. The accuracy of DSM achieved a Kappa index of 0.74, describing the methodology's effectiveness to differentiate the studied soils.

TI  - Atlas of sentinel lymph nodes in early breast cancer using single-photon emission computed tomography: implication for lymphatic contouring
T2  - RADIATION ONCOLOGY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: To determine the localization of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in a large cohort of patients with breast cancer and validate the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (ES-TRO), Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG), and Radiotherapy Comparative Effectiveness (RAD-COMP) guidelines on regional lymph node clinical target volume (CTV-LN) delineation.Materials and Methods: A total of 254 women with cT1-3N0-1M0 breast cancer underwent single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT-CT) visualization of SLNs after intra- and peritumoral injection of 99mTc-radiocolloids. All SPECT-CT images were fused with reference simulation computed tomography. A 3D atlas of SLNs was created and used for evaluation of CTV-LN defined by contouring guidelines.Results: SPECT-CT visualized 532 SLNs that were localized in axillary level I in 67.5%, level II in 15.4%, level III in 7.3%, internal mammary in 8.5%, and supraclavicular in 1.3% cases. The majority of level II-IV and internal mammary SLNs were inside the recommended CTV-LN. Axillary level I SLNs were covered by ESTRO and RTOG contours in 85% and 85% cases, respectively. "Out of contours" SLNs were mostly detected in lateral subgroup of level I LN (18.5%), while 98%-99% of anterior pectoral and central axillary SLNs were covered by CTV-LN. Internal mammary SLNs were visualized in 33 cases and were outside ESTRO and RTOG contours in 3 and 6 observations, respectively.Conclusion: SPECT-CT atlas of SLNs demonstrated that in most cases ESTRO and RTOG guidelines correctly represented CTV-LNs with the exception of lateral subgroup of SLNs.

TI  - A Spatial and Temporal Assessment of Vegetation Greening and Precipitation Changes for Monitoring Vegetation Dynamics in Climate Zones over Africa
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation is vital, and its greening depends on access to water. Thus, precipitation has a considerable influence on the health and condition of vegetation and its amount and timing depend on the climatic zone. Therefore, it is extremely important to monitor the state of vegetation according to the movements of precipitation in climatic zones. Although a lot of research has been conducted, most of it has not paid much attention to climatic zones in the study of plant health and precipitation. Thus, this paper aims to study the plant health in five African climatic zones. The linear regression model, the persistence index (PI), and the Pearson correlation coefficients were applied for the third generation Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI3g), with Climate Hazard Group infrared precipitation and Climate Change Initiative Land Cover for 34 years (1982 to 2015). This involves identifying plants in danger of extinction or in dramatic decline and the relationship between vegetation and rainfall by climate zone. The forest type classified as tree cover, broadleaved, deciduous, closed to open (>15%) has been degraded to 74% of its initial total area. The results also revealed that, during the study period, the vegetation of the tropical, polar, and warm temperate zones showed a higher rate of strong improvement. Although arid and boreal zones show a low rate of strong improvement, they are those that experience a low percentage of strong degradation. The continental vegetation is drastically decreasing, especially forests, and in areas with low vegetation, compared to more vegetated areas, there is more emphasis on the conservation of existing plants. The variability in precipitation is excessively hard to tolerate for more types of vegetation.

TI  - Evaluation of In-cage Filter Paper as a Replacement for Sentinel Mice in the Detection of Murine Pathogens
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR LABORATORY ANIMAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent studies have evaluated alternatives to the use of live animals in colony health monitoring. Currently, an alternative method that is suitable for all rack types and that has been verified to detect the infectious agents most commonly excluded from mouse colonies is unavailable. We compared the use of filter paper placed on the inside floor of mouse cages to the traditional use of sentinel mice in the detection of several prevalent murine pathogens including mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), murine norovirus (MNV), minute virus of mice (MVM), mouse parvovirus (MPV), Theiler murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), Helicobacter spp., Syphacia obvelata, and Aspiculuris tetraptera. Experimental groups comprised 7 cages containing either 2 pieces of filter paper on the cage floor or 2 ICR sentinel mice. Soiled bedding from pet-store mice was transferred to the experimental cages weekly for 8 wk. At 1 and 2 mo after bedding transfer, the filter papers were evaluated by PCR and sentinel mice were tested by serology and fecal PCR. Filter papers detected all pathogens as effectively (MHV, MNV, MPV, MVM, TMEV S. obvelata, and A. tetraptera) or more effectively (Helicobacter spp.) than sentinel mice at both time points. Filter papers more readily detected pathogens with a high copy number per RT-PCR analysis than a low copy number. Helicobacter spp. were not detected by sentinel mice at either time point. These results indicate that the use of filter paper placed on the interior floor of empty mouse cages and exposed to soiled bedding is efficient in detecting bacteria, endoparasites, and most of the common mouse viruses included in an animal health monitoring program.

TI  - POTENTIAL INFLUENCE OF URBAN SPRAWL AND CHANGING LAND SURFACE TEMPERATURE ON OUTDOOR THERMAL COMFORT IN LAGOS STATE, NIGERIA
T2  - QUAESTIONES GEOGRAPHICAE
M3  - Article
AB  - The continuous monitoring of the relationship between land surface temperature (LST) and land cover change is imperative for an inquiry into the potential impact of LST on human well-being, including urban outdoor thermal comfort in Lagos State, Nigeria. Using Landsat imagery, this study assessed land cover and LST changes from 1984 to 2019. Land cover was extracted, LST was determined from Landsat imageries and the land cover changes were linked to LST using the contribution index (CI). Afterwards, the universal thermal climate index (UTCI) was calculated to determine the heat stress levels. Findings confirm the presence of urban sprawl and new growth areas in previously rural Local Government Areas (LGAs) eastward, northward and westward of Lagos metropolis and in regions which lie on the fringe of the state's border with Ogun State. Also, a very strong link between high LST intensities and increasing concentration of urban areas in rapidly growing LGAs has been observed. This link further confirms the increased warming of the state, with an increase in mean LST of 2.16 degrees C during 1984-2019. The UTCI which was used to gauge the influence of LST on outdoor thermal comfort ranged from moderate to strong heat stress levels. This study helps to strengthen the case for definite policies and actions which should be aimed at achieving moderate urban development through increased urban tree canopy/green infrastructure provision and carbon sequestration activities in urban design/landscape design, in Lagos State.

TI  - Satellite evidence for pervasive water eutrophication in the Doce River reservoirs following the collapse of the Fundao dam in Brazil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the worst socio-environmental disasters to mark the history of Brazil and the world occurred in November 2015 and involved the mining sector. The collapse of the Fundao dam released approximately 43 million m(3) of iron ore tailings, which moved downstream to reach the Doce River. This resulted in the contamination of water, soil, and sediments along the entire course of the river, which also affected its mouth in the Atlantic Ocean. Four years after the disaster, several socio-environmental problems continue to persist in the affected areas. In this context, the reservoirs built along the Doce River deserve special attention as they are artificial environments that are highly vulnerable to changes in water parameters. This study aims to determine water quality indicators of these reservoirs using remote sensing data and image processing methods, including semi-analytical algorithms, to comprehend the progress of eutrophication processes. Operational land imager/Landsat-8 data (from 2013 to 2019) were used to map the suspended particulate matter (SPM), euphotic zone (Z(eu)) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) before and after the collapse. The results showed significant changes in SPM and Z(eu) in the reservoirs after the collapse. Non-conformity of these parameters is observed even now, and they tend to intensify during rainy periods when resuspension processes of sediments occur. Moreover, there has been an increase in the eutrophication of reservoirs as noticed by the significant increase in Chl-a after the disaster, especially in January, July, and August.

T2  - Ilmu Kelautan
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorpyrifos is a xenobiotics contaminants that threats the marine environment and the living organism within the habitat. Although several marine bivalve species have been used as the indicator of marine pollution, the used of Saccostrea mordax is remaining unknown. This study aimed at investigating the suitability of lysosome membrane integrity, carboxylesterase activity, 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine and condition index as biomarkers in adult S. mordax following their exposure to 0.0, 5.0 and 500 [mu]g.L-1 of Chlorpyrifos for 21 days under laboratory conditions. Results indicated that the lysosome membrane integrity showed a dose-dependent response with a significant statistical number of destabilized cells between all the treatment groups. Carboxylesterase activity was significantly inhibited in 500 [mu]g.L-1 chlorpyrifos treated group, while the environmentally relevant concentration (5 [mu]g.L-1) did not induce a significant inhibition with reference to the control. Similarly, the condition index showed a dose-dependent response with the oysters exposed to 500 [mu]g.L-1 chlorpyrifos exhibiting a significantly reduced growth rate. There was no statistical significance in the means of both 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine in all treatment groups. The reaction of S. mordax to chlorpyrifos contamination demonstrates that the species can potentially be used as sentinel organisms in environmental monitoring programs. Lysosome membrane integrity was a single out as a sensitive biomarker for exposure to chlorpyrifos and is therefore suitable for environmental monitoring for sublethal concentrations of chlorpyrifos contaminations. Additionally, the use of multiple biomarkers was found to be robust in this study and can be extrapolated to other ecotoxicological studies

TI  - Exploring Short-Term Climate Change Effects on Rangelands and Broad-Leaved Forests by Free Satellite Data in Aosta Valley (Northwest Italy)
T2  - CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing is a power tool for the long-term monitoring of vegetation. This work, with reference to a regional case study, investigates remote sensing potentialities for describing the annual phenology of rangelands and broad-leaved forests at the landscape level with the aim of detecting eventual effects of climate change in the Alpine region of the Aosta Valley (Northwest (NW) Italy). A first analysis was aimed at estimating phenological metrics (PMs) from satellite images time series and testing the presence of trends along time. A further investigation concerned evapotranspiration from vegetation (ET) and its variation along the years. Additionally, in both the cases the following meteorological patterns were considered: air temperature anomalies, precipitation trends and the timing of yearly seasonal snow melt. The analysis was based on the time series (TS) of different MODIS collections datasets together with Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) collection obtained through Google Earth Engine. Ground weather stations data from the Centro Funzionale VdA ranging from 2000 to 2019 were used. In particular, the MOD13Q1 v.6, MOD16A2 and MOD10A1 v.6 collections were used to derive PMs, ET and snow cover maps. The SRTM (shuttle radar topography mission) DTM (digital terrain model) was also used to describe local topography while the Coordination of Information on the Environment (CORINE) land cover map was adopted to investigate land use classes. Averagely in the area, rangelands and broad-leaved forests showed that the length of season is getting longer, with a general advance of the SOS (start of the season) and a delay in the EOS (end of the season). With reference to ET, significant increasing trends were generally observed. The water requirement from vegetation appeared to have averagely risen about 0.05 Kg.m(-2) (about 0.5%) per year in the period 2000-2019, for a total increase of about 1 Kg.m(-2) in 20 years (corresponding to a percentage difference in water requirement from vegetation of about 8%). This aspect can be particularly relevant in the bottom of the central valley, where the precipitations have shown a statistically significant decreasing trend in the period 2000-2019 (conversely, no significant variation was found in the whole territory). Additionally, the snowpack timing persistence showed a general reduction trend. PMs and ET and air temperature anomalies, as well as snow cover melting, proved to have significantly changed their values in the last 20 years, with a continuous progressive trend. The results encourage the adoption of remote sensing to monitor climate change effects on alpine vegetation, with particular focus on the relationship between phenology and other abiotic factors permitting an effective technological transfer.

TI  - Analysis of heat sources in different areas of influence of the BR-242 highway in the Nova Ubirata-MT, Brazil
T2  - NATIVA
M3  - Article
AB  - The concentration of heat sources in different boundary bands of influence of the BR-242 highway was analyzed in the municipality of Nova Ubirata-MT. The heat sources obtained by the database of burnings from Brazilian National Institute for Space Research (INPE), detected by the MODIS sensor of the AQUA satellite were identified and quantified. The Kernel density estimator and the Buffer analysis (distance in two classes of 0 - 5 km and 0 - 20 km along the BR-242 corridor) were used to estimate the distribution of heat sources in the municipality. The results indicated an increase in the heat sources from the area of influence of 20 km, noting that 10% of the heat sources occurred in the range of 0 - 5 km and 29% in the range of 0 - 20 km, totaling 5,568 detected heat sources in the years from 2008 to 2017. This new information promises to promote public policies on the procedures applied by IBAMA in the environmental regularization of federal highways, especially to diagnose environmental road liabilities.

T2  - RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF MARINE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A method for estimating the integral microalgae biomass beneath a unit surface was designed based on a mathematical model for phytoplankton vital function in the water column and subsequently tested. The model was verified based on data collected during field studies. The results of remote sensing allow extending this method to cover large territories (areas of water). The phytoplankton abundance in the waters of the western Kamchatka shelf in a cold year was compared to that in a warm year using satellite-derived data. It has been found that in the northern part of the shelf the total phytoplankton biomass in the cold year of 2016 was generally higher than that in the warm year of 2015. According to the assessments, as confirmed by data from the literature, this may be caused by the dynamics in the phytoplankton species structure.

AB  - Taking into account both the argument that body and movement are cultural and social constructions and the notion of (social) dances as structured movement systems, this work deals with the dancing of sones huastecos, which are performed mostly in social occasions, and sones de Xantolo, which are performed during All Saints' Day celebrations. Improvised or choreographed, zapateado, the particular footwork used in the dance, is central to both types of sones. Zapateado builds community and embodies aesthetic values shared by the members of the community. A worldview rich in symbolism is particularly embedded in sones de Xantolo and reflected in the dance.

TI  - An assessment of emission characteristics of Northern Hemisphere cities using spaceborne observations of CO<sub>2</sub>, CO, and NO<sub>2</sub>
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Intensified anthropogenic activities and high levels of energy consumption in cities have led to an increase in emissions of CO2 and air pollutants, impacting air quality and calling for better measures to monitor and reduce emissions. This study assesses the emission characteristics of cities in the Northern Hemisphere during two winter seasons from December 2018 to March 2020 using a combination of CO2 observations from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (000-2) along with CO and NO2 observations from the Sentinel-5 Precursor TROPO-spheric Monitoring Instrument (S-5P TROPOMI). We calculate the estimates of urban enhancement concentrations of CO2, CO, and NO2 from anthropogenic emissions in cities. Moreover, using ratios of CO/CO2 and NO2/CO2 according to each city, we analyze the relationship between CO2 and air pollutants and find that cities show distinct emission patterns according to where they are located in different regions of the world. Our analysis shows that a positive relationship exists in the comparisons of CO/CO2 and NO2/CO2 ratios to city population and GDP. However, when cities in the Northern Hemisphere are divided into "developed" and "developing" regions, a difference in pattern is found where most developed cities show a smaller increase of both CO/CO2 and NO2/CO2 ratios with the increase of GDP, while developing cities show a larger increase of ratios per increase of GDP. Especially, developing cities facing rapid economic development like Mumbai and Tianjin show high emission ratios that almost match that of developed cities. The higher incline of increase in emission ratios in developing cities can be attributed to the low combustion efficiency of fossil fuels along with less stringent pollution control measures. This implies that pollution control measures are crucial for effective management of air quality degradation with economic advancement within these developing cities. The analysis also highlights the importance of urban geological features in cities such as that of Tehran and Milan which can trap air pollution under appropriate meteorological conditions. Despite the short period of analysis, our study demonstrates that satellite observations of CO2 and air pollutants together can provide clues about factors controlling the co-emission of air pollutants and carbon in cities and suggests that the application of the proposed methods with longer periods of observation will support coupled air quality and climate mitigation strategies.

TI  - Tumor Staging of Endocervical Adenocarcinoma: Recommendations From the International Society of Gynecological Pathologists
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) updated its staging system for cervical cancer in 2018 with changes that affect size criteria for early stage disease, as well as including pathology and radiology in addition to clinical assessment to be used in staging. Lymph node involvement was also included in the staging system. In early stage disease, pathologic findings are crucial in determining stage, which in turn determine treatment and prognosis for the patient. Therefore, it is imperative that there are unified and consistent methods and recommendations for assessing and reporting pathologic parameters for accurate staging. We describe the changes in the revised FIGO staging scheme and discuss controversial issues in cervical cancer staging from a pathologic perspective. We also provide practical recommendations regarding these parameters based on literature review and/or expert opinion/consensus.

TI  - Phenological Analysis of Sub-Alpine Forest on Jeju Island, South Korea, Using Data Fusion of Landsat and MODIS Products
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change poses a disproportionate risk to alpine ecosystems. Effective monitoring of forest phenological responses to climate change is critical for predicting and managing threats to alpine populations. Remote sensing can be used to monitor forest communities in dynamic landscapes for responses to climate change at the species level. Spatiotemporal fusion technology using remote sensing images is an effective way of detecting gradual phenological changes over time and seasonal responses to climate change. The spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM) is a widely used data fusion algorithm for Landsat and MODIS imagery. This study aims to identify forest phenological characteristics and changes at the species-community level by fusing spatiotemporal data from Landsat and MODIS imagery. We fused 18 images from March to November for 2000, 2010, and 2019. (The resulting STARFM-fused images exhibited accuracies of RMSE = 0.0402 and R-2 = 0.795. We found that the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) value increased with time, which suggests that increasing temperature due to climate change has affected the start of the growth season in the study region. From this study, we found that increasing temperature affects the phenology of these regions, and forest management strategies like monitoring phenology using remote sensing technique should evaluate the effects of climate change.

TI  - Endocervical Adenocarcinoma, Gross Examination, and Processing, Including Intraoperative Evaluation: Recommendations From the International Society of Gynecological Pathologists
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The International Society of Gynecological Pathologists (ISGyP) Endocervical Adenocarcinoma Project aims to provide evidence-based guidance for the pathologic evaluation, classification, and reporting of endocervical adenocarcinoma. This review presents the recommendations pertaining to gross evaluation and intraoperative consultation of specimens obtained from patients in the setting of cervical cancer. The recommendations are the product of review of published peer-reviewed evidence, international guidelines and institutional grossing manuals, as well as deliberation within this working group. The discussion presented herein details the approach to the different specimen types encountered in practice: loop electrosurgical excision procedure, cone, trachelectomy, radical hysterectomy, pelvic exenteration, and lymphadenectomy specimens. Guidelines for intraoperative evaluation of trachelectomy and sentinel lymph node specimens are also addressed. Correlation with ISGyP recommendations on cancer staging, which appear as a separate review in this issue, is also included when appropriate. While conceived in the framework of endocervical adenocarcinoma, most of the discussion and recommendations can also be applied to other cervical malignancies.

TI  - NUMERICAL SIMULATION OF SHIP NAVIGATION IN ROUGH SEAS BASED ON ECMWF DATA
T2  - BRODOGRADNJA
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, several changes have been observed in the Earth's environment. This is also applicable to the ocean environment. The concept of weather routing has been applied for ship navigation for a long time. Many service providers offer weather routing service with the availability of high-quality satellite data. Unfortunately, not much information is available in the public domain as to how much the recent change in the weather pattern has affected ship navigation. The purpose of this paper is to fill this information gap. We investigate the influence of recent changes in the ocean environment on ship navigation. Weather data from ECMWF, namely ERA-Interim, is used for this purpose. The ECMWF data for the last 27 years is analysed. We compute the statistical characteristics of this data for the first 10 years, last 10 years, and 27 years. The statistical characteristics of the data are determined based on "summer" and "winter" zones as defined by international maritime regulations. Six different worldwide commercial ship routes are selected covering all the ocean regions. Navigation on great ellipse with waypoint is considered. MMG type ship manoeuvring model for 3 different ship types (DTMB 5415, PCC, VLCC) is used. The added resistance due to wave, wind and the effort of keeping the ship on the desired course using autopilot in the rough ocean environment is included in the MMG model. The fuel consumption and the duration of each one of the voyage are computed. Based on the analysis and simulation results it is shown that:(i) The mean wave height, wave period, and wind speed has increased in some ocean zones and decreased in other ocean zones. If any change has occurred, it is uniform for both seasons (summer and winter).(ii) In which ocean regions there is a perceptible change in fuel consumption, average ship speed and voyage time due to the changes in the weather pattern.(iii) The changing weather pattern in different ocean zones affects each ship type differently.

TI  - Monitoring temporal variations in the geothermal activity of Miocene Lesvos volcanic field using remote sensing techniques and MODIS - LST imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Many islands of the Aegean Sea show strong geothermal activity due to volcanism in the area. In this paper, Robust Satellite Techniques (RST) are used to isolate, from other known possible sources, those thermal anomalies possibly related to geothermal activity in the Miocene volcanic field of Lesvos Island (Northern Aegean). For this purpose, 12 years (2003-2014) of daily Night-time Land Surface Temperature (LST) products, from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) acquisitions were analyzed. The final dataset contained 770 thermal anomalies whose spatial correlation with geological and structural data of Lesvos - such as caldera rims, ring faults, major tectonic lineaments and hydrothermal alterations mapped by processing SENTINEL-2 MSI satellite images - has been particularly investigated. In the approximately 20 ma geothermal field of Lesvos, geothermal activity seems to be also associated with the extensional regime of the broader area that leads to lithosphere thinning and consequent heat transfer in the multi-fractured terrain of Lesvos through volcanic and tectonic faults. Achieved results seem to confirm the possibility to use RST-based thermal anomalies to identify temporal variations in the geothermal activity probably due to the uplifting and circulation of the hydrothermal waters.

TI  - Temporal and Spatial Variation of Anthropogenic Heat in the Central Urban Area: A Case Study of Guangzhou, China
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban heat island effect caused by the rapid increase in urban anthropogenic heat has gradually become an important factor affecting the living environment of urban residents. Studying the temporal and spatial variation characteristics of urban anthropogenic heat is of great significance for urban planning and urban ecological service systems. In this study, the urban anthropogenic heat flux (AHF) in 2004, 2009, 2014, and 2020 in the central urban area of Guangzhou was retrieved based on Landsat data and the surface energy balance equation, and the temporal and spatial characteristics of different types of anthropogenic heat were explored by combining the transfer matrix and the migration of the gravity center. The results showed that: (1) The overall change trend of anthropogenic heat in the central urban area of Guangzhou was enhanced, and the degree of enhancement was related to the type of urban functional land. (2) Different types of anthropogenic heat had different characteristics in terms of area expansion and spatial changes. Low-value anthropogenic heat (zero-AHF zone, low-AHF zone, medium-AHF zone) changed drastically in terms of area expansion. High-value anthropogenic heat (medium-AHF zone, high-AHF zone) changed more drastically in space. The increase in urban population, rapid economic development, and increased industrial production activities have stimulated the emission of anthropogenic heat, which has a positive impact on the intensity of anthropogenic heat.

TI  - Assimilation of LAI Derived from UAV Multispectral Data into the SAFY Model to Estimate Maize Yield
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we develop a method to estimate corn yield based on remote sensing data and ground monitoring data under different water treatments. Spatially explicit information on crop yields is essential for farmers and agricultural agencies to make well-informed decisions. One approach to estimate crop yield with remote sensing is data assimilation, which integrates sequential observations of canopy development from remote sensing into model simulations of crop growth processes. We found that leaf area index (LAI) inversion based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) vegetation index has a high accuracy, with R-2 and root mean square error (RMSE) values of 0.877 and 0.609, respectively. Maize yield estimation based on UAV remote sensing data and simple algorithm for yield (SAFY) crop model data assimilation has different yield estimation accuracy under different water treatments. This method can be used to estimate corn yield, where R-2 is 0.855 and RMSE is 692.8kg/ha. Generally, the higher the water stress, the lower the estimation accuracy. Furthermore, we perform the yield estimate mapping at 2 m spatial resolution, which has a higher spatial resolution and accuracy than satellite remote sensing. The great potential of incorporating UAV observations with crop data to monitor crop yield, and improve agricultural management is therefore indicated.

TI  - Completely resected stage III melanoma controversy-15 years of national tertiary centre experience
T2  - RADIOLOGY AND ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Two prospective randomized studies analysing cutaneous melanoma (CM) patients with sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases and rapid development of systemic adjuvant therapy have changed our approach to stage III CM treatment. The aim of this study was to compare results of retrospective survival analysis of stage III CM patients' treatment from Slovenian national CM register to leading international clinical guidelines.Patients and methods. Since 2000, all Slovenian CM patients with primary tumour >= Tlb are treated at the Institute of Oncology Ljubljana and data are prospectively collected into a national CM registry. A retrospective analysis of 2426 sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsies and 789 lymphadenectomies performed until 2015 was conducted using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log-rank tests.Results. Positive SLN was found in 519/2426 (21.4%) of patients and completion dissection (CLND) was performed in 455 patients. The 5-year overall survival (OS) of CLND group was 58% vs. 47% of metachronous metastases group (MLNM) (p = 0.003). The 5-year OS of patients with lymph node (LN) metastases and unknown primary site (UPM) was 45% vs. 21% of patients with synchronous LN metastasis. Patients with SLN tumour burden < 0.3 mm had 5-year OS similar to SLN negative patients (86% vs. 85%; p = 0.926). The 5-year OS of patients with burden > 1.0 mm was similar to the MLNM group (49% vs. 47%; p = 0.280).Conclusions. Stage III melanoma patients is a heterogeneous group with significant OS differences. CLND after positive SLNB might still remain a method of treatment for selected patients with stage III.

TI  - THE VERY IDEA OF AN ECOLOGICAL WORLDVIEW
T2  - ETHICS AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In environmental philosophy, it has often been argued that adopting a new ecological worldview is necessary in order to generate environmentalist social change in response to ecological crisis. I introduce the analytical category of metascientific stance (tacit assumptions about the nature, practices, goals, and place of the sciences in society) in order to discuss the popular model of worldview clash in this article and contrast it with other models of science-environmentalism relation. I argue that its frequent combination with an epistemological holism, often implying antirealism, is entirely at odds with an environmental philosophy that recognizes the real asymmetrical dependence of humankind on the nonhuman. Moreover, it assumes a questionable metaethical relation between worldview and action. I examine three essential tensions in the worldview clash model for environmentalism and argue that because the very idea of a worldview has deep roots in Modernist dualism and anthropocentrism, it is a fundamentally flawed way of framing environmentalist action.

TI  - The Hazards Posed by Mesoscale Lightning Megaflashes
T2  - EARTH INTERACTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Lightning megaflashes extending over >100-km distances have been observed by the Geostationary Lightning Mappers (GLMs) on NOAA's R-series Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES). The hazards posed by megaflashes are unclear, however, because of limitations in the GLM data. We address these by reprocessing GOES-16 GLM measurements from 1 January 2018 to 15 January 2020 and integrating them with Earth Networks Global Lightning Network (ENGLN) observations. ENGLN verified 194 880 GLM megaflashes as natural lightning. Of these, 127 479 flashes occurred following the October 2018 GLM software update that standardized GLM timing. Reprocessed GLM/ENGLN lightning maps from these postupdate cases provide a comprehensive view of how individual megaflashes evolve. This megaflash dataset is used to generate statistics that describe their hazards. The average megaflash produces 5-7 cloud-to-ground (CG) strokes that are spread across 40%-50% of the flash extent. As flash extent increases beyond 100 km, megaflashes become concentrated in key hot-spot regions in North and South America while the number of CG and intracloud events per flash and the overall peak current increase. CGs in the larger megaflashes occur over 80% of the flash extent measured by GLM, and the majority contain regions where the megaflash is the only lightning activity in the preceding hour. These statistics demonstrate that there is no safe location below an electrified cloud that is producing megaflashes, and current lightning safety guidance is not always sufficient to mitigate megaflash hazards.

TI  - Assessment of ICESat-2 Sea Ice Surface Classification with Sentinel-2 Imagery: Implications for Freeboard and New Estimates of Lead and Floe Geometry
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - NASA's Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) mission launched in September 2018 and is now providing high-resolution surface elevation profiling across the entire globe, including the sea ice cover of the Arctic and Southern Oceans. For sea ice applications, successfully discriminating returns between sea ice and open water is key for accurately determining freeboard (the extension of sea ice above local sea level) and new information regarding the geometry of sea ice floes and leads. We take advantage of near-coincident optical imagery obtained from the European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel-2 (S-2) satellite over the Western Weddell Sea of the Southern Ocean in March 2019 and the Lincoln Sea of the Arctic Ocean in May 2019 to evaluate the surface classification scheme in the ICESat-2 ATL07 and ATLIO sea ice products. We find a high level of agreement between the ATL07 (specular) lead classification and visible leads in the S-2 imagery in these two coincident images across all six ICESat-2 beams, increasing our confidence in the freeboard products and deriving new estimates of the sea ice state. The S-2 overlays provide additional, albeit limited, evidence of the misclassification of dark leads due to clouds. Dark leads are no longer used to derive sea surface and thus freeboard as of the third release (r003) of the ICESat-2 sea ice products. We show estimates of lead fraction and more preliminary estimates of chord length (a proxy for floe size) using two metrics for classifying sea surface (lead) segments across both the Arctic and Southern Ocean for the first winter season of data collection.

TI  - Dogs as Sentinels for Flavivirus Exposure in Urban, Peri-Urban and Rural Hanoi, Vietnam
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Diseases caused by flaviviruses, including dengue fever and Japanese encephalitis, are major health problems in Vietnam. This cross-sectional study explored the feasibility of domestic dogs as sentinels to better understand risks of mosquito-borne diseases in Hanoi city. A total of 475 dogs serum samples from 221 households in six districts of Hanoi were analyzed by a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA) for antibodies to the pr-E protein of West Nile virus and other flaviviruses due to cross-reactivity. The overall flavivirus seroprevalence in the dog population was 70.7% (95% CI = 66.4-74.8%). At the animal level, significant associations between seropositive dogs and district location, age, breed and keeping practice were determined. At the household level, the major risk factors were rural and peri-urban locations, presence of pigs, coil burning and households without mosquito-borne disease experience (p < 0.05). Mosquito control by using larvicides or electric traps could lower seropositivity, but other measures did not contribute to significant risk mitigation of flavivirus exposure in dogs. These results will support better control of mosquito-borne diseases in Hanoi, and they indicate that dogs can be used as sentinels for flavivirus exposure.

TI  - Understanding Dense Time Series of Sentinel-1 Backscatter from Rice Fields: Case Study in a Province of the Mekong Delta, Vietnam
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice is the primary staple food of more than half of the world's population and plays an especially important role in global economy, food security, water use, and climate change. The usefulness of Synthetic Aperture Radars (SAR) for rice mapping and monitoring has been demonstrated locally in many studies, in particular in the last five years with the availability of an unprecedented amount of free Sentinel-1 data within the Copernicus program. However, although earlier studies from the 1990s have laid the foundations of the physical understanding of the SAR response of rice fields, the more recent studies tend to overlook this aspect and to favor instead approaches driven by supervised learning which provide accurate results locally but cannot necessarily be extended to wide areas. The objective of this study is to analyze in detail the backscatter temporal variation of rice fields, using Sentinel-1 from 2015 to 2020 and in-situ data for the 5 rice seasons over 2 years 2017-2018, in order to derive robust SAR-based indicators useful for rice monitoring applications, which are essential for planning, monitoring and food security applications. The test region is the An Giang province, in the Mekong River Delta, Vietnam, one of the world's major rice regions which presents a diversity in rice cultivation practices, in cropping density, and in crop calendar. The SAR data have been analyzed as a function of rice parameters, and the temporal and polarization behaviors of the radar backscatter of different rice varieties have been interpreted physically. New backscatter indicators for the detection of rice paddy area, the estimation of the sowing date, phenological stage and the mapping of the short cycle and long cycle rice varieties have been developed and discussed regarding the generality of the methods with respect to the rice cultural practices and the SAR data characteristics.

TI  - Trends in Satellite Earth Observation for Permafrost Related Analyses-A Review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Climate change and associated Arctic amplification cause a degradation of permafrost which in turn has major implications for the environment. The potential turnover of frozen ground from a carbon sink to a carbon source, eroding coastlines, landslides, amplified surface deformation and endangerment of human infrastructure are some of the consequences connected with thawing permafrost. Satellite remote sensing is hereby a powerful tool to identify and monitor these features and processes on a spatially explicit, cheap, operational, long-term basis and up to circum-Arctic scale. By filtering after a selection of relevant keywords, a total of 325 articles from 30 international journals published during the last two decades were analyzed based on study location, spatio-temporal resolution of applied remote sensing data, platform, sensor combination and studied environmental focus for a comprehensive overview of past achievements, current efforts, together with future challenges and opportunities. The temporal development of publication frequency, utilized platforms/sensors and the addressed environmental topic is thereby highlighted. The total number of publications more than doubled since 2015. Distinct geographical study hot spots were revealed, while at the same time large portions of the continuous permafrost zone are still only sparsely covered by satellite remote sensing investigations. Moreover, studies related to Arctic greenhouse gas emissions in the context of permafrost degradation appear heavily underrepresented. New tools (e.g., Google Earth Engine (GEE)), methodologies (e.g., deep learning or data fusion etc.) and satellite data (e.g., the Methane Remote Sensing LiDAR Mission (Merlin) and the Sentinel-fleet) will thereby enable future studies to further investigate the distribution of permafrost, its thermal state and its implications on the environment such as thermokarst features and greenhouse gas emission rates on increasingly larger spatial and temporal scales.

TI  - Historical Changes in Land Use and Suitability for Future Agriculture Expansion in Western Bahia, Brazil
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Western Bahia is a critical region in Brazil's recent expansion of agricultural output. Its outstanding increase in production is associated with strong growth in cropland area and irrigation. Here we present analyses of Western Bahian historical changes in land use, including irrigated area, and suitability for future agricultural expansion that respects permanent protection areas and the limits established by the Brazilian Forest Code in the Cerrado biome. For this purpose, we developed a land use and land cover classification database using a random forest classifier and Landsat images. A spatial multicriteria decision analysis to evaluate land suitability was performed by combining this database with precipitation and slope data. We demonstrate that between 1990 and 2020, the region's total agricultural area increased by 3.17 Mha and the irrigated area increased by 193,480 ha. Throughout the region, the transition between the different classes of land use and land cover followed different pathways and was strongly influenced by land suitability and also appears to be influenced by Brazil's new Forest Code of 2012. We conclude that even if conservation restrictions are considered, agricultural area could nearly double in the region, with expansion possible mostly in areas we classify as moderately suitable for agriculture, which are subject to climate hazards when used for rainfed crops but are otherwise fine for pastures and irrigated croplands.

TI  - Potentialities and Limitations of Research on VHRS Data: Alexander the Great's Military Camp at Gaugamela on the Navkur Plain in Kurdish Iraq as a Test Case
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a selected aspect of research conducted within the Gaugamela Project, which seeks to finally identify the location of one of the most important ancient battles: the Battle of Gaugamela (331 BCE). The aim of this study was to discover material remains of the Macedonian military camp on the Navkur Plain in Kurdish Iraq. For this purpose, three very high resolution satellite (VHRS) datasets from Pleiades and WorldView-2 were acquired and subjected to multi-variant image processing (development of different color composites, integration of multispectral and panchromatic images, use of principle component analysis transformation, use of vegetation indices). Documentation of photointerpretation was carried out through the vectorization of features/areas. Due to the character of the sought-after artifacts (remnants of a large enclosure), features were categorized into two types: linear features and areal features. As a result, 19 linear features and 2 areal features were found in the study area of the Mahad hills. However, only a few features fulfilled the expected geometric criteria (layout and size) and were subjected to field groundtruthing, which ended in negative results. It is concluded that no traces have been found that could be interpreted as remnants of an earthen enclosure capable of accommodating around 47,000 soldiers. Further research perspectives are also suggested.

TI  - National Crop Mapping Using Sentinel-1 Time Series: A Knowledge-Based Descriptive Algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - National-level mapping of crop types is important to monitor food security, understand environmental conditions, inform optimal use of the landscape, and contribute to agricultural policy. Countries or economic regions currently and increasingly use satellite sensor data for classifying crops over large areas. However, most methods have been based on machine learning algorithms, with these often requiring large training datasets that are not always available and may be costly to produce or collect. Focusing on Wales (United Kingdom), the research demonstrates how the knowledge that the agricultural community has gathered together over past decades can be used to develop algorithms for mapping different crop types. Specifically, we aimed to develop an alternative method for consistent and accurate crop type mapping where cloud cover is quite persistent and without the need for extensive in situ/ground datasets. The classification approach is parcel-based and informed by concomitant analysis of knowledge-based crop growth stages and Sentinel-1 C-band SAR time series. For 2018, crop type classifications were generated nationally for Wales, with regional overall accuracies ranging between 85.8% and 90.6%. The method was particularly successful in distinguishing barley from wheat, which is a major source of error in other crop products available for Wales. This study demonstrates that crops can be accurately identified and mapped across a large area (i.e., Wales) using Sentinel-1 C-band data and by capitalizing on knowledge of crop growth stages. The developed algorithm is flexible and, compared to the other methods that allow crop mapping in Wales, the approach provided more consistent discrimination and lower variability in accuracies between classes and regions.

TI  - Evaluation of Antibiotic Dissemination into the Environment and Untreated Animals, by Analysis of Oxytetracycline in Poultry Droppings and Litter
T2  - ANIMALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple SummaryOxytetracycline (OTC) is an antibiotic used mainly in feed and drinking water. OTC is poorly absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract of poultry; making droppings a potential route of dissemination of this antibiotic. The aim of this study was to evaluate the dissemination of oxytetracycline excreted from treated birds to the environment and other untreated animals (sentinels), through the analysis of their droppings and litter by HPLC-MS/MS following the end of treatment. In treated bird droppings, the average concentration of OTC+4-epi-OTC ranged from 347.63 to 2244.66 mu g kg(-1). OTC+4-epi-OTC in litter reached concentrations of 22,741.68 mu g kg(-1). Traces of OTC+4-epi-OTC were detected in the droppings and litter from sentinels. Therefore, OTC+4-epi-OTC can persist in the litter of treated animals at high concentrations and can be transferred to untreated birds that share the same environment. This exposure has the potential to increase the likelihood of selection of resistant bacteria in the environment.Oxytetracycline (OTC) is widely used in broiler chickens. During and after treatment a fraction of OTC is excreted in its original form and as its epimer, 4-epi-OTC in droppings. To address the transfer of OTC into the environment, we evaluated the dissemination of OTC and 4-epi-OTC from treated birds to the environment and sentinels, through the simultaneous analysis of broiler droppings and litter. Male broiler chickens were bred in controlled conditions. One group was treated by orogastric tube with 80 mg kg(-1) of OTC and two groups received no treatment (sentinels). OTC+4-epi-OTC were analyzed and detected by a HPLC-MS/MS post the end of treatment. The highest concentrations of OTC+4-epi-OTC were detected in the droppings of treated birds 14-days following the end of treatment (2244.66 mu g kg(-1)), and one day following the end of treatment in the litter (22,741.68 mu g kg(-1)). Traces of OTC+4-epi-OTC were detected in the sentinels' droppings and litter (<12.2 mu g kg(-1)). OTC+4-epi-OTC can be transferred from treated birds to the environment and to other untreated birds. The presence and persistence of OTC+4-epi-OTC in litter could contribute to the selection of resistant bacteria in the environment, increasing the potential hazard to public and animal health.

TI  - High resolution middle eastern soil attributes mapping via open data and cloud computing
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil presents a high vulnerability to the environmental degradation processes especially in arid and semiarid regions, requiring research that leads to its understanding. To date, there are no detailed soil maps covering a large extension of the Middle East region, especially for calcium carbonate content. Thus, we used topsoil data (0-20 cm) from more than 5000 sites for mapping near 3,338,000 square km of the Middle East. To do this, we used covariates obtained from remote sensing data and random forest (RF) algorithm. Around 65% of the soil information was acquired from Iranian datasets and the remaining from the World Soil Information Service dataset. By using 30 covariates layers-soil, climate, relief, parent material and age features- we then trained and tuned RF regression models-in R software- and used the optimal ones (according to the minimum root mean square error) for making spatial predictions-within Google Earth Engine- of topsoil attributes and associated uncertainties at 30 m resolution. All covariates were relatively important for mapping topsoil attributes, ranging from 4% to 98%. Annual precipitation, temperature annual range and elevation were the most important ones (>31%). Overall, the prediction models trained by RF explained around 40-66% of the variation present in topsoil attributes. The ratio of the performance to interquartile distance (RPIQ) ranged between 1.59 and 2.83, suggesting accurate models. Our predicted maps indicated that sandy and loamy soils with poor organic carbon levels, alkaline reaction and high calcium carbonate content were widespread in middle eastern topsoils. Our framework overcomes some limitations related to high computational requirements and enables accurate predictions of topsoil attributes. Our maps presented correct pedological correspondences and had realistic spatial representations and interesting levels of uncertainties.

TI  - CURRENT INVASION STATUS AND POTENTIAL FOR UK ESTABLISHMENT OF THE BROWN MARMORATED STINK BUG, HALYOMORPHA HALYS (HEMIPTERA: PENTATOMIDAE).
T2  - British Journal of Entomology and Natural History
M3  - Article
AB  - We describe reports of adult brown marmorated stink bugs Halyomorpha halys (Stal) in the UK and discuss the implications for possible establishment of this global invasive species. Reports of interceptions at ports date back to 2010, but more recently (since 2018) adults have been observed free in the environment within England. Sentinel pheromone traps deployed in England and Wales caught no H. halys during 2018 and 2019, but two adult males (in Essex and London) were caught during August 2020. Although no other life stages (indicating reproduction within the UK) have been detected, CLIMEX modelling based on UK climate parameters (using both historical data and projected future climate) predicts that H. halys already has the potential to establish in localised areas (particularly Greater London) with a much larger area of suitability for establishment across South East and Eastern England predicted by 2050. However, recent (2018-2020) temperatures in several areas of the South East already provide sufficient thermal requirements for potential completion of at least one generation per year.

TI  - Retrieval of Daytime Total Column Water Vapour from OLCI Measurements over Land Surfaces
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A new retrieval of total column water vapour (TCWV) from daytime measurements over land of the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) on-board the Copernicus Sentinel-3 missions is presented. The Copernicus Sentinel-3 OLCI Water Vapour product (COWa) retrieval algorithm is based on the differential absorption technique, relating TCWV to the radiance ratio of non-absorbing band and nearby water vapour absorbing band and was previously also successfully applied to other passive imagers Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). One of the main advantages of the OLCI instrument regarding improved TCWV retrievals lies in the use of more than one absorbing band. Furthermore, the COWa retrieval algorithm is based on the full Optimal Estimation (OE) method, providing pixel-based uncertainty estimates, and transferable to other Near-Infrared (NIR) based TCWV observations. Three independent global TCWV data sets, i.e., Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET), Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) and U.S. SuomiNet, and a German Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) TCWV data set, all obtained from ground-based observations, serve as reference data sets for the validation. Comparisons show an overall good agreement, with absolute biases between 0.07 and 1.31 kg/m(2) and root mean square errors (RMSE) between 1.35 and 3.26 kg/m(2). This is a clear improvement in comparison to the operational OLCI TCWV Level 2 product, for which the bias and RMSEs range between 1.10 and 2.55 kg/m(2) and 2.08 and 3.70 kg/m(2), respectively. A first evaluation of pixel-based uncertainties indicates good estimated uncertainties for lower retrieval errors, while the uncertainties seem to be overestimated for higher retrieval errors.

TI  - Google Earth Engine Sentinel-3 OLCI Level-1 Dataset Deviates from the Original Data: Causes and Consequences
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we demonstrate that the Google Earth Engine (GEE) dataset of Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) level-1 deviates from the original Copernicus Open Access Data Hub Service (DHUS) data by 10-20 W m(-2) sr(-1) mu m(-1) per pixel per band. We compared GEE and DHUS single pixel time series for the period from April 2016 to September 2020 and identified two sources of this discrepancy: the ground pixel position and reprojection. The ground pixel position of OLCI product can be determined in two ways: from geo-coordinates (DHUS) or from tie-point coordinates (GEE). We recommend using geo-coordinates for pixel extraction from the original data. When the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) Pixel Extraction Tool is used, an additional distance check has to be conducted to exclude pixels that lay further than 212 m from the point of interest. Even geo-coordinates-based pixel extraction requires the homogeneity of the target area at a 700 m diameter (49 ha) footprint (double of the pixel resolution). The GEE OLCI dataset can be safely used if the homogeneity assumption holds at 2700 m diameter (9-by-9 OLCI pixels) or if the uncertainty in the radiance of 10% is not critical for the application. Further analysis showed that the scaling factors reported in the GEE dataset description must not be used. Finally, observation geometry and meteorological data are not present in the GEE OLCI dataset, but they are crucial for most applications. Therefore, we propose to calculate angles and extraterrestrial solar fluxes and to use an alternative data source-the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) dataset-for meteodata.

TI  - Landslide Risk Analysis on Agriculture Area in Pacitan Regency in East Java Indonesia Using Geospatial Techniques
T2  - Environment and Natural Resources Journal
M3  - Article
AB  - Pacitan is one of the regencies in East Java Province, dominated by hills and mountain landforms covering 85% of its area. Since 2011, more than 16 landslides have occurred significantly in this area. These disasters have engulfed more than 350 ha of agricultural land in Pacitan. This study analyzed the risk of future landslides due to land use change. The parameters used were rainfall, slope, topography, geology, soil, and land use which were assessed and weighed by the Paimin method. Land-use classification from Landsat 8 OLI in 1998, 2008, and 2018 were analyzed using regression formula to calculate the trend of change in 2030. Land use was also classified from the land capability classification (LCC) and regional spatial planning (RSP) as land use options in 2030. The results showed that land use changed over time due to the changes in landslide hazards, which increased three-foldfrom 1998 to 2018 and will peak tremendously in 2030. There are 29.47 ha of agricultural land in 2018 that have a high potential landslide hazard if no intervention is made. The accuracy for prediction of the 2018 data mapping was 82%. The LCC strategy suggests land use planning to reduce a high level of the landslides.

TI  - Discriminating Possible Causes of Microwave Brightness Temperature Positive Anomalies Related With May 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake Sequence
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the spatiotemporally weighted two-step method (STW-TSM), the spatiotemporal characteristics of the residual microwave brightness temperature (MBT) with the Mw7.9 Wenchuan earthquake on May 12, 2008 are revealed by satellite data from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) sensor. Two significant MBT positive anomalies are found to be exactly in spatial accordance with two geological Quaternary zones, and the detailed geometric information of the MBT positive anomaly is found to be correlated with the microwave frequencies. After eliminating other possible influential factors, including surface temperature, vegetation index, land-surface roughness, and surface soil moisture under the conditions of space, time, and magnitude, and according to the microwave radiative transfer model, the dielectric variation in the ground surface is suggested to be the primary contributor of the MBT positive anomaly. The positive-hole (P-hole) theory is applied to interpret the geological preference of the MBT positive anomalies through a chain process: crustal stress enhancing-P-hole producing and flowing down stress gradients-surface P-hole accumulating-dielectric constant decreasing-and microwave radiation increasing. The stress-resulting effect of the dielectric decrease on MBT the increase provides a novel mechanism for microwave remotesensing monitoring of crustal stress field alteration, earthquake preparation, and upcoming shocks. This research has a particular significance for searching potential georelations between the tectonic earthquake preparation and the abnormal satellite MBT.
